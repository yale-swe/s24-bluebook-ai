                "Great format with online and in person lectures. Online lectures covered most of the material (very engagingly) and in person lectures went into greater detail or offered context.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team is great! Prof. Jung was a pretty engaging lecturer and a really understanding prof. The material is very intro-level which is good if you don't have an art history background. We only did lecture on Wednesdays, so that was awesome\r\nWeaknesses: the pre-class lectures were pretty long each week (2 hours); I wish that there was more content on art/architecture from African countries. It was by far the shortest unit. I appreciate that Prof. Jung understood that this was a problem, but she spent the whole time explaining the problem and then offered little solution.",
                "Strengths: everything! Dr. Jung is an amazing lecturer and I loved all of our class meetings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been nice if we could have in person classes twice a week, but it was also nice to have that break and have content-heavy online lectures so that the in person lectures could be more natural. I also didn't like how all of the lectures by the TAs were scripted. Dr. Jung is a great lecturer and all of her lectures really flowed well, so it was hard to have the contrast of the stocky, scripted lectures by the TAs. At that point it would have made more sense to have them record theirs so we could hear more of Dr. Jung.",
                "Great and interesting material",
                "Very good",
                "I think Professor Jung's lectures were particularly strong compared to other courses I've taken at Yale. She clearly put a lot of time into making them clear and informative, and they were an extremely useful learning tool throughout the semester. A weakness of this course is, I think, the emphasis on memorization for the exams. I feel like I was able to show my understanding of the history and significance of obects as well as their cultural context withotu remembering specific dates.",
                "A strength of this course was definitely the section. I learned so much by going to section every week, and it was the highlight of my week at the Yale University Art Gallery. A weakness was definitely the online lectures we had to watch. Personally, I would much prefer to learn in the classroom during a live lecture, and I think even a zoom would have been better than watching pre-recorded lectures.",
                "The videos are really useful and make homework approachable, and having only one meeting a week made my schedule so much easier. I think communicating earlier on what we were going to be tested on would have helped with studying, specifically with the necessity of memorizing dates and names.",
                "Professor Jung used prerecorded videos from Spring of 2021 (Covid year) to teach the class this semester which was a strength of the class because they were very well-made/produced, allowed you to do the class on your own time, and take good notes to do well on exams. Definitely don't let them pile up though because binge-watching makes the content annoying and it is a bit to get through. \r\n\r\nWeakness: sacrality, or what is considered sacred, is never defined and instead taken as a given. I felt this question was the most fascinating and the most confusing, and the fact that we completely skip it was a major drawback of the class. Many lectures make leaps in their discussion of sacred sites and art (the Lincoln Memorial is considered sacred, i.e, and the class didn't really give me a reason to believe so). Because we never address this question, I feel there are many holes throughout the rest of the class, and many moments where it feels like Prof. Jung is grasping at strings as she teaches the content. It also led me to do a lot of bs-ing in the class and get away with it because that was simply the standard. I don't feel this is okay because, at the end of the day, we are talking about people's religions. I also felt the class could benefit from closing up its range and discussing less, but doing so more deeply.",
                "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!!! One of my favorite Yale classes ever. If you have any interest in traveling, this class will help you understand art and architecture around the world. I personally loved all of the assignments, especially the paper that had us visit a religious space. I loved the lecture format; there were outstandingly produced online lectures and one in-person lecture per week that had a mix of interesting content / guest lectures.",
                "It's strong in giving you an overview of the history of sacred art and Professor Jung is a really dedicated teacher. It was nice to have section in the art gallery every week. The content was not convoluted and really introductory. However, it is disappointing that this class was a flipped classroom - you can see why it would have worked really well during online classes, but it was a shame during this semester. The videos were definitely educational but they were time consuming, and the weekly lectures didn't really add anything to the videos at all. It would have been easy to fall behind on the videos and not engage with the class until the exam period. I found myself staying on top of the lectures and making notes but still having to rewatch them to study as the professor covered a ton of content every video. I felt that if the class were recorded, met twice weekly, and covered the content in the videos, the students would be more engaged and get more out of it.",
                "It felt kind of inappropriate that there was so much more time dedicated to the various European Christian arts than to arts in other parts of the world, such as African art. I understand that this is Prof Jung's specialty and she did a good job of acknowledging the shortcomings, but I'd like to see them actually addressed",
                "A major strength of this course is that the course material is very interesting. I think the in-person lectures could have built off of the online lectures better. For example, sometimes the in class lecture would be a repeat of the online lecture and other times it would be new material (which I preferred personally). I think this course could also be improved by removing the TA presentations, which had little to no relation to the topics we were discussing. I was surprised by the fact that most of the TA presentations involved the TA reading word for word off of a prepared script. When presentations are done in this fashion, it is VERY difficult to remain engaged.",
                "Strengths- nice overview on a number of different cultures and monuments. Learned a lot of information\r\nWeaknesses- the class was only actually taught once a week in person and the rest through video lectures. The informations should be taught in person twice a week, not in video lectures. It would be much easier to learn and absorb the information that way.",
                "I think the course would have been better with more timeline linearity and continuity. Jumping between cultures made it harder to contextualize some of the art. I also think that the videos were a bit too tailored for someone with no attention span. The information popping on the screen made it engaging but harder to learn. Often it was hard to discern what was important art to know and what wasn't. This made it harder to retain information. For example, sometimes the prof would pop an art piece as comparison on the screen for 10 seconds. I don't know if I really should commit time to memorizing that, and that made it harder to memorize the pieces that I did need to.\r\n\r\nThe in person lectures weren't very informative. I would have retained better if the online videos went over art and then the class went over the same art.",
                "I think this class was strong in its course material, subject, and its professor. One thing that I found especially powerful was that Professor Jung had guest speakers who were experts in a topic we were covering speak at lecture each week. I also thought that having section at the YUAG every week was so special. We were able to apply ideas we learned during lectures as well as see an expanded collection of works that weren't covered in the lectures.",
                "great lectures and sections",
                "This course's greatest strength is the presentations by teaching fellows each week during lecture.  Hearing about their research and projects, the fields they are expert in, was absolutely incredible.  I looked forward to it each week.  The course's weakness was the video lectures for homework.  I loved the way Prof. Jung presented the information, but it reminded me of zoom school.",
                "I think one strength of the class was the format. I really enjoyed being able to watch the lectures on my own time and pace and review them later to study. The supplementary lectures on Wednesday were always interesting and added a new perspective to each topic. At the same time, I think the online format  meant it was easy to tune out the class and feel less engaged with the content.\r\n\r\nThe assignments for this class were engaging and interesting and allowed us to apply the skills we learned in class to topics we were each individually interested in. The section was also fantastic, and it was great to learn about many of the galleries in the YUAG in a more intentional way.",
                "The material of this class was very interesting. The video and in-person lectures were entertaining, and the discussion sections were always super engaging and fun. I always received clear feedback on my essays that helped me improve my writing and further inquire on my thoughts at hand. Overall, it was a great class, and I don't think there are any weaknesses. Professor Jung is super kind, and my TF was amazing.",
                "The professor is really nice and engaging.",
                "I wish there were a wider variety of religions and spiritual movements represented, as Christianity was definitely over represented compared to other major world religions. The best part of this class were the sections which met in the YUAG.",
                "Its really exciting to go to the YUAG for discussion section because you get to interact more with the art and also get exposure to the museum. This will definitely change how I perceive art galleries in the future. I missed being able to come in person for lectures and wish the model was flipped back, such that we could do lectures in class and then some of the supplementary presentations outside of class, especially since there was not much participation anyway. This would have increased my engagement with the course. The class also assumes much more knowledge about Christianity and does not go as in-depth in other religions.",
                "Strengths: This is honestly a very fun class. I enjoyed the way we travelled across the globe with the course material and how clear expectations were. Professor Jungs use of various forms of media to deliver the material was excellent, and having discussion sections in the YUAG was amazing too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a couple weeks when the material converted in that week felt disjointed, mostly when the lectures diverged from the one culture in one time format Im thinking particularly of the power figures week.",
                "Guest lectures can sometimes detract from the material. Class could be used to cover content more. Everything covered on the exam can be gained exclusively from the online lectures. I enjoy class because of this fact; I feel that I can learn for the sake of learning but that might not be for everyone.",
                "I think the online lectures are well done but should not be used in place of only a single lecture when they are about 2 hours of time each week. I think the class should either be completely online or that the recorded lectures should be replicated in real time during class. Because of the expectation to watch the lectures and gain the most important and relevant content from them, in-class lecture each week felt a bit pointless. I enjoyed section in the YUAG+ as it was very informative and pretty fun.",
                "I really enjoyed discussion sections.",
                "It was difficult to be  compelled to watch the video lectures as the class was happening because it always fell to the bottom of my list of to-dos.",
                "so engaging but i wish the lectures were all entirely in person. the online lectures were a challenge for me.",
                "Strengths: The weekly in-person lecture with Professor Jung was incredible. I love how she used this time to invite a variety of speakers and to supplement the material from the lectures! This course also had one of the most enjoyable sections I have ever experienced -- because section meets in YUAG and because we could directly engage with art pieces featured in lecture there, this added another level of immersion to the course.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Albeit well-made, the asynchronous remote lectures do not compare to how engaging the in-person aspects of this course are. I also would have loved to see the unit on indigenous art earlier in the semester -- keeping it towards an end made it seem like it was a bit of an afterthought.",
                "This was a great class with no weaknesses",
                "Classes were skippable",
                "Recorded lectures were engaging and made it much easier to come to class prepared to have a robust discussion, really enjoyed them. Professor is passionate, responsive, available, and accommodating and really cares about her students despite the large lecture size. Some guest lectures were sometimes more relevant/interesting than others, but added a lot to the interest and breadth of the material. All assignments were interesting, meaningful, and reasonable.",
                "Professor Jung is outstanding and super friendly, easy to get in contact with, and wants everyone to do well and be engaged with the material. She gives extra credit opportunities and is flexible and kind.",
                "The strengths of this course was how open ended it was, which allowed for a lot of open discussion and input from the students. The discussion sections were also one of the highlights of this course because of how immersed us students could become with the class material, and how hands it got by going to the YUAG and walking around campus, analyzing the different styles of architecture. There were no weaknesses for me.",
                "The strength of this course is that one gets to engage with the artworks in cultures in a variety of ways. The mixed-media form of teaching matches the diversity of artworks one is confronted with. The online video lectures provide specific details that are then amplified upon in creative ways and modernly contextualized in the in-person lecture. These discussions then propel and feed our museum studies, which is probably the highlight of this course.  I think this course could be improved by incorporating more of that detailed lecturing in the in-person lecture."

                "YES!!!!!! Take this class please. It is AMAZING and will open your eyes up to a whole history and canon that you probably never saw so closely juxtaposed. The entire class frames different ways of celebrating the sacred by different cultures. It does not go into the philosophy of why people practiced the way they did, which is a really refreshing way to learn about different cultures. Instead, we just appreciated that they did what they did instead of questioning why. Dr. Jung is really respectful of different cultures and always makes sure to be honest about the way that she fits into the context of talking about them. I learned a lot about how to talk and think about sacred art and the hard questions that we're facing about museums and preservation of art. I highly highly recommend this class if you want to learn about how to engage with art, museums, and if you want to understand the variety of ways to celebrate the sacred. Definitely one of those classes that makes you a better person",
                "Yes. Very interesting class",
                "Yes! It's very fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to broaden their cultural awareness and learn a new set of skills. However, I would not add this as a fifth class given the heavy workload (2 papers and 2 exams).",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I loved the teaching staff, the course material, and the overall workload was bearable. I would highly recommend because of how much I truly loved this class and the section.",
                "I've always wanted to take an art history course, this was perfect for that desire.",
                "Yes, I think the class was engaging, enjoyable, and really informative. As a non-art history major, this class was a pleasure to take.",
                "Sacred Art and Architecture is absolutely among my top 5 classes ever. It completely changed how I think about religion and perceive physical spaces (buildings lol). You MUST take this.",
                "I would recommend this class if you're interested vaguely in art history and looking for a supplemental class. It covers the foundations but definitely requires a lot of work if you're trying to get a good grade, with papers and exams at the midterm and final times. It unfortunately becomes easy to fall behind so you have to stay on top of the videos and not mind setting aside time every week to work through them.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in learning a little about art and how to talk about it!",
                "Yes for those who want a good intro to art history and the sacred monuments of the world",
                "absolutely 100%",
                "If you like art history --- not too tough but not a true gut",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This was a perfect first art history class. It was a fascinating topic and Professor Jung is exploding with excitement about the course material, her energy was infectious. Plus the workload is super manageable, and the papers she assigns are great opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills you develop during class and section. I also just found that I walk around campus differently, now having the vocabulary to explain art/architecture and the insight of how space and images are deeply influential in our lives.",
                "Yes! especially if you have never taken art history before",
                "Yes.  This course is a great introduction to art history, and it is not too much work.  It introduces you to some of the world's greatest artworks through the lens of curiosity and passion for artwork rather than pure memorization.  I loved the lectures.",
                "I would highly recommend this class for a new art history student, if you are looking for something interesting but not too difficult as an introduction to the subject. If you are a more advanced art history student, this class may be a little easy for you, and you may be bored with the content.",
                "If you're interested in art history, or are simply curious, you should definitely take this course. It is a great introductory class that gives you a survey of sacred art.",
                "Yes absolutely if Professor Jung is teaching.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic, especially for non-art history majors who want to learn about art.",
                "I think so! I didnt love the online lectures but it was definitely a great introductory course to art history. Also, thinking about the art in the lens of sacrality allows for more in-depth and well-understood discussion of the pieces, since these are more familiar concepts to many. I definitely did learn some things, and section was very cool.",
                "Yes! I loved it.",
                "Yes if you are interested in even the slightest to learn about art, world religions, history, architecture. Still treated like a level 100 course so not too demanding and does not expect you to be an art history major.",
                "Depends what you are interested in. The course is cross listed under Architecture, which is why I took it, but its much more of an art history class and given that Professor Jung is not an architect, I found that when structures were covered, they werent explained / studied as well as they could have been. Furthermore, although the course title includes global perspectives there is a larger emphasis on the western culture and Christianity than other regions and religions.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to any Yale student. Prof Jung is a wonderful lecturer and every part of this course was super engaging.",
                "Yes, this class made me switch my prospective major to Art History.",
                "This is a great chill class if you're interested in an introduction to art history and visual analysis.  My absolute favorite part was section. I had a great TF who would facilitate discussion in the YUAG and the time would fly by every week.",
                "yes, this course made me wish i have taken art history courses throughout my whole time at yale!! i loved this course.",
                "YES! I would sincerely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their academic pursuits or aspirations. Professor Jung and the TFs are extremely knowledgeable and genuinely care about the wellbeing of students. The course material is fascinating, accessible to non-art history majors, and not too demanding workload-wise.",
                "Yes it was a very good into to art history and taught well",
                "Yes, interesting content",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone because it covers topics that I think touch all corners of the earth, so in one way or another you will become more aware of other people and their beliefs, and may even relate to the material at some points. The material covered in this course and the discussions were not only academic in relations to the topics of architecture and art and how they are analyzed, but also very wordy issues that are worth discussing.",
                "Yes! This is a great introductory Art History course for anyone interested in gaining a global perspective of the arts and wanting to learn how to visually understand images and want to create a relationship with the spaces that surround them."
