We learned to engage with the period from many different angles, and the real star of the course is the support in the essay-writing process. I've written several 20-25 page papers at Yale, but Prof. Freeman's thorough feedback was still very helpful. I think this class would be an especially great one to take on a first long writing project in.",

                "Gained a more comprehensive understanding of politics in early national America, moreso concentrated in the 18th century. Kind of operated like a political science class, but I had the opportunity",
                "This course not only helped me understand the foundation of the United States and its politicians but also how to be a better writer and view historical works with a more critical eye.",

                "I became a better writer. Professor Freeman's feedback was very helpful in aiding development of that skill.",
                "The class focuses on early national American politics in different forms -- elite-level politics, popular politics, personalities and politics, etc. You read a good chunk of a book each week on various aspects of these topics, and through overlapping discussions in class each week, the thematic focus becomes more clear. It's not organized chronologically. Also really interesting discussions on founders chic, Hamilton the Musical, and our cultural understanding of the \"Founders\" today. One of the main takeaways for me was that the \"Founders\" didn't think or work as a bloc -- they were people who didn't agree, and it was messy. American politics were improvised on the fly, and there was a sense of contingency that influenced all of their decisions. With one wrong call, they were worried the whole country might fall apart.",

                "The course is overall very strong! The readings and assignments are very conducive to student learning. The only thing that I might suggest would be a minor restructuring of class timeit often felt like our seminar discussions were just students making comments and Prof. Freeman responding, and I wish that there had been more natural conversation in the classroom.",
                "few weaknesses. maybe would like a few more primary source readings. strength is joanne freeman - gem of the history department, one of, if not, yales finest.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Freeman, class discussion, interesting and fresh viewpoints of the time period, lots of freedom when picking your term paper, line edits given to your paper by Prof. Freeman.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings can be a bit dense, had to read 100-150 pages of historical texts weekly (one week of primary source reading (letters))",
                "This course was focused on early United States history and specific early American politicians; I would just advise a student to read the syllabus carefully before enrolling and ensuring that the week to week topics are of interest.",
                "This course was a phenomenal experience, not just as a history major but as an American. The professor is an expert in her field, the assignments are incredibly worthwhile, and the pace is challenging yet manageable. I have no improvements.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman is amazing. The chance to have a paper line-edited by a professor of her stature is itself reason enough to take this course. In addition to vast knowledge, she's also incredibly understanding, and very good at facilitating discussion. The syllabus and readings are very well cultivated. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing in particular. Workload varied a lot from week to week, but that was more because I left much of my work to the last minute.",
                "I enjoyed the course. Class discussions were engaging and the paper/feedback allowed for me to improve my writing. One change that I think would improve the course would be to cut the opening weeks' reading responses and allow for more time to be devoted to brainstorming for the primary essay.",
                "I wish Professor Freeman spent more time helping students improve their ideas and writing  she did a lot, but considering how important the final paper was... could have been more.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman is amazing. She (and all her expertise) is why I wanted to take this class, and she made it worth it. Her ability to pull out specific details and niche stories from letters and this period of American history is so impressive, and I sometimes felt weird because I would just start giggling in class listening to the absurdity of these great anecdotes. Listening to her talk is truly a joy, and I wonder if I would enjoy her lecture even more than this seminar; open-ended paper project is a really cool opportunity if you find something you're interested in; readings are dense and a little long but also pretty solid. Weaknesses: Maybe this was just because I'm not a history major, but I thought a quick overview at the beginning of the class could have been helpful for reviewing the key dates and events of the American Revolution and early national America -- just a quick AP U.S. Historystyle run through of dates. Lots of the academic books we read would mention events or specific things from early national America that history buffs and historians focused on the period would know immediately, but I kept needing to remind myself what the Whiskey Rebellion was or when X thing happened, etc.",
                "The main strength is Professor Freemans deep knowledge and valuable feedback. At times the readings were very long and discussions would feel meandering as a result. I wish the seminars had more direction at times."

                "Absolutely, especially if you are at all interested in the founding period. You will have the opportunity to learn from one of the world's premier academics in the field of early American history. However, you must do the readings or you will sound like a dumbass in class, as class is just a weekly 2.5 hour discussion section.",
                "Absolutely. This course was far and away one of the best academic experiences of my time at Yale. I would take any course with Prof. Freeman in a heartbeat but the subject matter and timeliness of this class (not to mention the value of the essay timeline) made it a rare opportunity.",
                "100%. If you possibly can, take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class. Professor Freeman is an expert in her field, and this course provides an excellent opportunity to engage both in the classroom and 1 on 1.",
                "Its good for trivia but I wish Prof was more willing to make theoretical claims. Posit theories for why she think things turned out the way they are. Shes phenomenal at research and really does know the material, but, something that people like Paul Kennedy and Timothy Snyder do really well is offer reasons for things happening. This class just doesnt do that.",
                "Yes! Professor Freeman is so knowledgeable, warm, an expert at the top of her field, and literally famous (on Twitter and in real life). If you're already interested in this period of history, there's no better professor to learn about it from than her. And if you're not, she highlights the details, human drama, and larger trends that will still loop you in. Be prepared for a chunk of reading each week and a big research paper. You'll have a draft due a little more than halfway through the semester, and if you turn in a full one, you'll get her detailed feedback and be in really good shape for the rest of the semester. Meeting that deadline, and then finishing up the final draft, felt stressful for me though, and the fact that there are two deadlines spaced out by 3 or 4 weeks means this term paper feels like a much heavier lift than a normal final paper.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in American History who has a desire to do original research. If someone is not interested in research or prepared to spend many hours on a long paper, this course may not be enjoyable."
