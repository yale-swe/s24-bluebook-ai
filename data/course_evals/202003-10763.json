I understand that there isn't really a way around that, but it would have helped to have a few more breaks.  4 hours of lab straight is fine when you are constantly moving and doing things, but 3-4 hours in front of a computer it quite tedious.  Multiple short breaks would have increased my attention span.  \r\n\r\nI think the setup of the lab is great.  Having each lab session be part of a large research project shows how all of the different methods can be used together.  It also made the lab report at the end meaningful.  After having read many scientific articles for other classes, it was fulfilling to write a lab report that was in the style of published research in a journal.",

They are at the end of class, and by the time youre done with the lecture, youve forgotten everything because of Zoom fatigue.",
