I enjoyed most of the novels we discussed in class and the wide range of topics they dealt with while still being classified as an artist novel. Being able to get feedback on a draft before submitting the final paper was extremely helpful. Discussion was good but hard to understand at times.",
                "I thought the pacing of the course was really nice, and I'm glad that we talked about fewer books more extensively rather than trying to get through the whole syllabus. It was a little confusing that the syllabus kept changing, though, so maybe putting fewer books on it at the beginning of the year could be helpful.",
                "I think that the books can be a bit more diversified. I was really happy with all of the books read this semester, and have come out of the course with some unforgettable reads but there were a few I would have switched out. We always covered great topics during our discussions and the smaller class size made for a comfortable atmosphere.",
                "I think there are very few activities designed to enrich understanding of close readingclass was very limited to discussion, and essays were largely done alone outside of class."

                "I would recommend it if you feel ready for a discussion heavy English class with some tough novels. However, this is probably one of the best English classes to take because you get paper feedback before submitting it. McGowan is a great professor who provides helpful feedback for every paper. If you enjoy reading a wide range of novels then the homework shouldnt be too much.",
                "Yes; I loved the conversations we had in class and I discovered some of my new favorite books through this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I genuinely enjoyed exploring the definitions of the \"artist\" and I can see it being incredibly relevant and significant as art mediums change with technology.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were truly interested in learning about literature in an environment where writing was the main expectationif they wanted to read literature otherwise, I would recommend another course."
