                "Strengths are the readings (most of which are really interesting) and Professor Lazarev, who is really knowledgeable and approachable. Weaknesses are the student presentations, which can go on for a long time and could be more question-oriented to engage those not presenting.",

                "I would not reccomend this course to another student. The class was not well designed and it was not clear what the purpose of the class was. Moreover, it was a seminar that ran like a lecture and I don't feel this was at all conducive to learning.",
                "i'd definitely recommend this course.  Prof. Lazarev is great and the subject is super interesting and useful.",
                "Yes! The readings are really interesting and Professor Lazarev is really knowledgeable and approachable. I gained a new perspective on the law, which I would've have got from any other law-relate class at Yale. As long as you start the research project before Thanksgiving, the workload in manageable.",
                "Yes--Professor Lazarev is first class in his ability to simplify tough concepts and trends within comparative legal studies while providing the class with ample resources to succeed. The first few seminars\/readings are a little slower as the class begins by focusing on laying a methodological and conceptual foundation that is imperative to understanding and analyzing the following readings and legal frameworks. Once the foundation is laid, the class begins to explore the status of law in a comparative nature. From comparing social change, legal consciousness, colonialism, democracy, to authoritarianism, gender, conflict, and policing. Throughout the semester, the class was regularly engaging with the readings, each other, and current events. Personally, I found that the entire class enjoyed most, if not all, of the readings and material. Professor Lazarev is understanding yet particular about his standards for the work submitted. This has been one of the more rewarding seminars that I have taken and would strongly recommend any PLSC senior (or senior interested in LAW) to enroll in the seminar.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in law or comparative politics I think you would find the course very engaging and intellectually stimulating."
