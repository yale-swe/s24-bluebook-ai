                "Strengths of this course - varied and interesting mix of assignments and readings, Professor was always enthusiastic about the course materials, guest speakers were amazing, discussion was always lively.",
                "It is a great course that is not just interesting but applicable to anyone interested in social movements. It integrates a broad range of examples of social movements. Another strength is that it integrates different types of assignments so they do not feel monotonous throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: The class is really tailored to students' learning, from the sheer amount of guest speakers Professor Hierro brought in, to the great environment our class was able to foster during the Zoom session. Out of all my classes this semester, it came the closest to replicating the feeling of being in a physical seminar. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the sheer bulk of assignments got to be overwhelming. None of them were too difficult individually, but it could be a lot to juggle two larger papers, three reading responses,  two film responses, and three quizzes.",
                "I can't decide whether the discussions or the readings were my favorite part of this class - both were interesting, engaging, and made me excited to learn every week. Readings were not overwhelming and clearly laid out both political theory and its practical implications, and the discussions each week were fun and captivating. I don't think the course had any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: engaging, interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings sometimes too dense",
                "This course has many strengths and almost no weaknesses. The readings were an appropriate quantity and always engaging. There are many short papers, of which I was initially skeptical, but they are a great opportunity to explore new topics. Prof. Hierro is a very fair grader and facilitates class discussions in an incredibly-engaging manner. We had many guest speakers throughout the semester which made the course even more engaging."

                "I loved how the professor began sending out \"summary google docs\" for each session and we could comment on the google doc to facilitate further discussion outside of class. \r\nThe only things I can think of for improvement is maybe put in more breakout rooms and come up with a more orderly way of figuring out who is talking in what order during discussion (perhaps using the raised hand function? not sure).",
                "Breakout rooms during the seminar really helped facilitated closer relationships with my fellow peers, and allowed for collaboration. The online setting also made it easier for us to have multiple guest speakers, which I really appreciated.",
                "The virtual seminar was shockingly effective and successful. I took many seminars this semester, and by the end I was almost always ready to shut off the computer, but in this course I found myself hoping for more time for discussion. I didn't experience \"Zoom fatigue,\" even when we forgot to take breaks (because the conversation was so interesting), and almost every student seemed excited to participate.",
                "The documentaries were fascinating and informative",
                "Prof. Hierro utilized the breakout rooms feature on Zoom, giving students the opportunity not only to discuss topics from the course but also to get to know each other on a more personal level. Prof. Hierro gave us a five minute break in the middle of the seminar, which helped with Zoom fatigue. Prof. Hierro was incredibly attentive to students' needs and feedback regarding the pandemic and utilized many tools from the Poorvu Center to make the course engaging over the Zoom format."
