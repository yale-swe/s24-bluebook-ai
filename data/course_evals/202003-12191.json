Weakness: Sometimes a tad disorganized and the \"no negative feedback\" rule is inspiring but sometimes can lead to less thoughtful comments from classmates.",

Checking in at the beginning of each class was great, too, and something I really appreciated during an online semester. I always wished we could discuss the weekly assigned plays more in-depth, so a few more minutes for this each class would have been appreciated. But I think everything about the class",

If you need more clear, regular feedback or structure, this course probably isn't for you, but if you want to just be creative and let inspiration come, go for it!",
