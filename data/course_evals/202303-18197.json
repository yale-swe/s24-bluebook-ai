                "The incredible breadth in this course, historically, geographically, and in terms of primary source materials, offered a condensed and invaluable experience for exploring the course's themes thoroughly. Though I've taken a few writing seminars within the History department by now, I did not tired or get bored at all of each lecture's content. While certain historical periods could have used a bit more depth in the syllabus, the limitation hardly outweighs in any serious way the opportunity this course offers for a remarkable synthesis of cultural and historical perspectives, through a diversity that remains somewhat lacking to this day in high-impact queer criticism."

                "As mentioned above, easily the course's greatest strength was its breadth and ambition, which opened me up to many unconventional sources. And I doubt I'm alone on this front!\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I'll again just flag that certain historical periods may have lack sufficient depth, although this may entirely be a matter of the scholarship readily available. For example, I felt there were many themes in the colonial period that remained underexamined, and the queer valences were examined, to their possible detriment, somewhat independently from settler-colonialism's politically and epistemically violent consequences."
