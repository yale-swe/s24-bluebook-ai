                "the difficulty of this course depends so much on the tfs assigned to it. this year's tfs were strict on grading.",

                "The pace of the course is extremely fast and I had to be very deliberate about paying attention and staying on top of information. The material was generally interesting but it was not always presented in the clearest or most engaging way.",
                "Honestly lecture is pretty fun but it does get a little long at an hour and fifteen. Often I found myself zoning out because it was just so much information. Exams are really annoying. You have to memorize a ton of facts and just regurgitate them all scrambling for time.",
                "Strengths: if you like ecology, the lectures are interesting, fast paced, and full of fascinating/funny nature documentaries. Prof. Wells is a wonderful person and knows what college students like. The readings are well chosen and the paper is fun to write. The final is more creative and open ended than the other exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there are 80+ slides per class and so Prof. Wells is flipping through so fast that it's hard to remember what she talked about. The exams are mostly memorization.",
                "Some small discussion sessions at the end of each lecture would have been good. Exams could be open book like final exam with more interesting application questions instead of rote memorization",
                "Strengths include intriguing lecture topics, interesting and informative videos, and a professor who is passionate about the subject.",
                "Strength: The content (especially the videos) could be interesting at times.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We literally did not get any grades back except for the first two exams. The TAs also didn't post the answers to any of the midterms before the final. The TAs were also very hard graders. EVERYONE told me this was a gut, but a lot of people taking this class this semester would tell you otherwise. The average on the first midterm was an 85%. Be warned if you have Petra and Haysun as TAs. We had to do 3 midterms, 1 paper, and 1 final. I almost had to Credit/D/Fail this class. Thank goodness I was saved by online finals.",
                "I felt like",
                "This course covered a massive amount of content, but little was done to convey what content was actually important to memorize and what was not. Exam questions would occasionally reference very niche subjects that were only briefly glossed over in lectures, and exam feedback was rarely clear. Grading was inconsistent, with some students receiving more credit than others for responses that were virtually identical. What's more, the TAs were ill-equipped to answer questions about the course material, and would often just resort to googling students' questions. Accordingly, success in this course almost entirely hinged on one's ability to memorize trivia.",
                "This course has really interesting and engaging lectures, but there's so much information presented that it can be difficult to tell what is important. Even though different facets of arthropod behavior and ecology were presented with particular examples from various species, it was occasionally hard to know whether those species were indicative of broader trends in arthropod ecology or just isolated curiosities used to illustrate arthropod diversity. Overall, though, the course had a lot of strengths and not many weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating topics and Marta did an amazing job of incorporating engaging videos and papers that fit well with each topic. Weaknesses: Our only grades were three midterms, a final exam, and a final paper. In an in-person setting, the closed book exams were actually challenging.",
                "I really liked the lectures, they were always very fun and illuminating. The paper was interesting to write as well.\r\n\r\nI thought that the review sessions were not that great, since it didn't seem like the TFs were very prepared for them.",
                "The strength is it gives you a lot of knowledge about bugs, insects and arthropods. The weaknesses is the lectures are very boring and not at all engaging. The course is simply a lot of memorization.",
                "This course is really interesting and Professor Wells is kind, super knowledgable, and really funny. In terms of weaknesses, some of the academic jargon is a bit difficult to get past unless you have a background in ecology and/or biology. Additionally, the teaching fellow team didn't provide clear feedback on any of the exams/papers, misgraded exams based on inaccurate information, and often struggled to clarify course information (or gave incorrect course information) during review sessions.",
                "Really great content, not the best organization/structure.",
                "Strength: the material is fascinating, Dr. Wells and the TAs are great, and I appreciate that we had to turn in a proposal for our final paper long before it was due\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there was a 5-minute break in the middle of class, or that we used Poll Everywhere or had discussion questions. It is very hard for me to focus for 75 minutes straight.",
                "They mad this class more difficult due to the fact that it previously was a gut (someone in the administration probably forced them to). Seems like they overcompensated, however, since the exams asked obscure questions about trivial topics we barely covered in class and were graded harshly.",
                "This was a very fun science lecture, and I felt very supported by Dr. Wells and the TFs, significantly more so than in any other science lecture Ive been in. Dr. Wells is an awesome lecturer, and I was always excited to come to class.",
                "This may be an unpopular opinion as a die hard humanities person but I felt lectures couldve been more engaging, however there were a lot of attempts made to engage students like bug videos etc",
                "Stop brute memorization",
                "Strengths: absolutely fascinating content. wonderfully animated, vehement professor. great lectures brimming with examples (how bees can suffocate killer wasps, how assassin bugs can lure good samaritan termites, how peacock spiders dance to attract their mates). Fair, rather lenient grading, which may reassure first-time E&EB students like me. Weaknesses: NONE! As a new E&EB student, I didn't realize (until the first midterm) that we had to memorize a good bit of information/examples--make sure you know this beforehand.",
                "Professor Wells is definitely the best part of the course: she is super passionate and is very engaging. The only weakness I could think of is that the slides often went into such incredible detail, even though it was not required for exams which sometimes made studying a bit difficult. Although we were able to drop one of our three midterms, three midterms, a short paper, and a traditional final felt like quite a lot at times. Some of the exam questions seemed oddly specific, while others were relatively straightforward.",
                "The course is memorization-intensive which requires endlessly thumbing through dense notes. Professor Wells is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about her field, though that sometimes meant she would speak quickly and only partially explain an important topic. The two midterms will determine your grade and are evaluated oddly. Expect to regurgitate multiple paragraphs of information from your notes only to have points deducted for failing to properly evaluate the unique semantics of the question. Ultimately, if you study hard and memorize easily, you'll be rewarded.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course. The tests are not bad if you just study. There is no other work at all except a final and an essay. You will also learn a lot and if you are an EEB major it is a good organismal class.",
                "This is a tossup. The lectures were honestly very boring despite trying my best to stay engaged with the material. the workload was low, and the exams were straight memorization. But be warned that they are often very specific and require a faire amount of time invested in studying/memorizing. However, if you are able to do this, you should do totally fine in the class.",
                "I would recommend the course to someone who has a genuine interest in the topic and who knows other students also taking the course. Without other students to study with or discuss the material with, I often was lost and did a lot of grueling work trying to re-learn or search for the information I couldn't grasp during the lectures.",

                "Yes, but it's NOT a science gut. You actually do have to study, and quite a lot, for the exams. But if you weren't looking for a gut, Professor Wells is lovely!!",
                "Yes! High fun quotient and low workload. This is my favorite science class I've ever taken",
                "Yes. Especially if you are an Environmental Studies major. Good to have an ecological perspective",

The TAs also didn't post the answers to any of the midterms before the final. The TAs were also very hard graders. EVERYONE told me this was a gut, but a lot of people taking this class this semester would tell you otherwise. The average on the first midterm was an 85%. We had to do 3 midterms, 1 paper, and 1 final. I almost had to Credit/D/Fail this class. Thank goodness I was saved by online finals.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in arthropods (e.g. bugs). If you do not like bugs or are scared of them, dont make the mistake I did. Despite being grossed out by the insects, I learned a lot and it was interesting so if you dont mind bugs I would recommend it.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to anyone! Even if you have no background in arthropods or in ecology, this was a very interesting course that will help you learn to love insects and arachnids. Dr. Wells is an excellent lecturer and the material we covered was always unusual and interesting; she did a great job showing how arthropods are intertwined with human lives in many ways and how important they are. This course presents a lot of interesting information but has a very reasonable workload, which makes it valuable and worth taking.",
                "YES. This is a great science credit for non-STEM people and honestly interesting for anyone. Marta is amazing and as long as you keep up with lectures and the powerpoints, you will be fine.",
                "Imagine walking into class, and an excited and knowledgeable professor tells you fun facts about bugs for 65 minutes (not 75, because the class usually ended early). The fun facts frequently include at least three David Attenborough videos. You listen to the fun facts, and then you tell your friends about them. Soon enough, you hear your friends repeating your arthropod facts to others, because they are so cool. You no longer refer to things as \"spiders\" and \"ants\": you just call them arthropods. You might even have an arthropod themed birthday party. Are you imagining it? Well, that is this class.\r\n\r\nDid you know that when Japanese honeybees see a killer wasp, they heat themselves up to 105 degrees, swarm the wasp, and cook it alive? Neither did I.\r\n\r\nThis class is not extremely easy: don't be fooled by the workload rating. The exams are actually pretty challenging, even though you do get to drop the lowest midterm. That being said, the class has almost no work. There is only one assignment, which is a 3 page term paper, and it is not hard.\r\n\r\nI spent 38 hours on this course over the semester, which is less than half of a typical course. Breakdown:\r\n25 hours in class\r\n10 hours studying for exams\r\n3 hours writing the term paper",
                "No, the course was not necessarily difficult, it just took a lot of time and basically memorization of the every single lecture was necessary because there was no clear guide for the exams. If you aren't greatly fascinated by bugs, do not take this class.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a science credit and are willing to put in some studying time to learn some different examples, this class is really interesting!",
                "Absolutely! The course content was incredibly interesting and Professor Wells is an absolute gem. Her enthusiasm for the course content is infectious and she makes the class that much more enjoyable!",
                "If you like bugs or anything related that it would be useful for-- agriculture, ecology, etc., then yes :)",
                "Yes! The material was fascinating.",
                "No, 3 midterm exams, final paper, and a final exam is way too much work",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Its not necessarily the kind of gut that many humanities students may be looking for, but thats a good thing in my opinion. You do have to come to lecture and you do have to spend a night or two studying for exams, but the content is super interesting and helps you understand more about the natural world around you. Im a stem major, and this course was one of my favorite courses Ive ever taken. It strikes a great balance of being scientifically rigorous while also being approachable to those without a background in biology.",
                "Yes if you like bugs! This was a pretty painless science course as a humanities major but I wouldnt call it a gut because you have to spend a ton of time memorizing a TON of biological facts, I routinely spent a lot of energy on this class",
                "No it was a very bad experience",
                "YESSS! Such a wonderful course to take regardless of whether you are an E&EB major, you were elected \"human grasshopper\" in pre-school and still hold that distinction, you shriek in horror when those tufts of cotton grace your elbow or recoil when a microscopic spider is just chilling in the shower, you want to get to the bottom of \"social butterflies\" (why?), or you just think (certain) bugs are cute. You will genuinely learn so much in this course if you review content, read, and study. It is not a gut by any means (the midterms are a rude awakening if you don't review), but it's not hard at all to do well in the class! You just have to invest the time it deserves. It's among the most fascinating science class at Yale, promise. Take the lab while you're at it!",
                "Maybe. If you need another science credit, this may be a good option. Or, if you are simply interested in arthropods, this is an excellent choice. Professor Wells is amazing, but the content can get a bit technical at times.",
                "Not sure that I would, especially if you're struggling to fulfill your science credit and are considering this course. The knowledge you'll emerge with will rarely translate beyond Yale and the exams are labor-intensive and at times convoluted. If you're super into bugs, this is a good bet, though otherwise I'd steer clear.",
