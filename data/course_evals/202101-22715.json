One suggestion I have for the class is that it could be organized better, but I think that was largely due to the online semester.",

Annie gave us room to find out own visual language while also supporting us in exploring techniques which might feel unfamiliar to us. I think if there is a political commitment it should be made explicitsometimes conversations about race, class, and gender felt vague."
