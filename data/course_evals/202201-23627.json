I would've appreciated more opportunity to have learning that was paced for myself, rather than trying to keep up with all the due dates and deadlines, especially with the final lab report that is really really extensive.",

                "Strengths: the TAs and professor were extremely helpful with regards to learning new techniques and thinking conceptually about our findings and why we were conducting certain experiments. We learned the importance of staying organized--keeping a well-maintained lab notebook makes writing a paper much easier. Weaknesses: sometimes it would have been helpful to have the thorough in-class explanations in-writing as well to reference later on."

                "yes! Professor Moreno is excellent and very invested in bettering her students for the real world. I learned so much for the real world.",
