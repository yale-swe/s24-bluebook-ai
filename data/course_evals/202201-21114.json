                "I learned about gender from a variety of different access points (in public, in universities, in a reproductive sense, in a queer sense, etc.)",
                "I didn't have much background in political philosophy, so looking at Rawls and Kant through the lens of WGSS was an interesting way to consume usually boring material.",

I also gained a lot of new language and perspective with which to discuss these topics going forward.",
                "I learned so much from this course! I had a basis in gender theory already, but I learned much more in this class. This was also the first time I have ever enjoyed philosophy; discussing the philosophy of modern-day issues like abortion and the question of what justice is was so meaningful. I enjoyed nearly every reading I did for this class, and I gained priceless knowledge about current movements working to reconceive gender, justice, power, and institutions (what they do, what they believe, etc.) in the public eye. I reference this course in conversation often, to the point that my friends get annoyed by it; it is just that good.",
                "I learned a lot about queer theory and feminist theory. As the course title states, a lot of what I learned was focused around gender, justice, power, and institutions.",

                "Having never taken a WGSS course before, I learned a lot of about theory surrounding the field. However, I also just learned exactly what the title says, ideas on Gender, Justice, Power, and Institutions and how all those are interrelated.",
                "I learned more about major debates at the intersection of WGSS and PLSC, such as the elgalization of polygamy, porn, and prostitution. I also learned how to analyze current media through the lens of a WGSS scholar.",

                "Strengths: topics chosen to cover were very interesting, and sometimes we had a variety of media instead of just readings (videos, documentary, etc)\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were very long and hard to get through, which made my engagement lower than it may have otherwise been for certain weeks when preparing for lecture\/discussion in section",
                "I very much enjoyed the lectures. I think a little bit less recap would allow for more time to cover content.",
                "Both Professor Fischel and the TAs did a fantastic job of keeping everyone engaged in the course topics. It's clear that everyone is there because they have a genuine interest in the course's content. Although the class qualifies more as a lecture because of the 50ish people taking it, I wish there were less people in order for classes to be more of a seminar\/open discussion format.",
                "The lectures were always incredibly appealing. I really appreciated the rather light reading load and Professor Fischel's understanding of the various other obligations and stressors each of us had as students - especially given continued pandemic-related factors. I also loved getting to hear from guest speakers from other universities!\r\n\r\nWhile this class was rather low-stress, I would have appreciated more extensive feedback on my writing. I often felt that the work I submitted was by no means my best work, and while I learned tremendously from engaging with the course material, I didn't really feel that my writing improved from this class.",
                "strengths: readings, engaging assignments, never a hassle \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sections could be more engaging",
                "no weaknesses",
                "the course is a very good introduction and summary of the basic ideas of many important thinkers. I felt at times it was too introductory or too easy. I think there could've been more readings. Section was an absolute waste of time. We just answered questions in small groups that summarized the main points of the readings.",
                "Strengths  super interesting subject matter, Joe is great, and the grading is relaxed so it does not feel like a high-pressure environment!! Definitely a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of classes at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses  section could have been structures better (this is a very small issue, overall the class was great)",
                "The strengths were very interesting course material, and Professor Fischel is an incredible, engaging lecturer. He was also very understanding of absences due to illness and made sure lecture material was accessible to all students.",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of topics; Great for anybody interested in WGGS who is looking for something with a more intersectional lens than perhaps other courses at Yale. Prof. Fischel is really great, very knowledgable and accessible to students. If you are looking for deeper engagement with course material (see below), he is a great resource to make that happen.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Since it is an intro-type course ppl in the class will have varying levels of engagement with the content, meaning discussion section conversations are not always as engaging as they might be in a smaller class.",
                "the lectures felt very boring and didn't really understand the purpose of them, felt like that could have been done better",
                "course was well-structured and assignments weren't stressful, prof Fischel was immensely encouraging and emphasized that assignments\/quizzes\/exams were to gauge our learning and not meant to be added stress, which was a wonderful. the course felt a little messier towards the end, I think too much content was packed into each lecture and it felt rushed",
                "Strengths: low pressure, so engagement with material primarily for interest. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were disorganized and not challenging enough, they primarily just discussed the readings of the week.",
                "idk mostly weaknesses...lectures were scattered, section wasn't interesting, and the prof\/TAs did not draw upon much more than the readings. If you didn't do the readings you didn't really learn anything because lectures just regurgitated what we read\r\n\r\nhow to improve: remove section and make lecture an hour and 15 min, or make this a seminar",
                "Strengths: engaging and interesting assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: back-end heavy",
                "The assessments were really good. I especially liked the cultural artifact analysis and recorded conversation because they were interesting, engaging ways to get students to think deeper about the course material. The discussion sections were also really helpful because there were a lot to unpack in the readings. \r\n\r\nOn that note though there was a lot of very dense readings that I couldn't really make sense of on my own outside of class. We went over them in class, but still maybe a little less volume in readings would encourage students to spend more time really unpacking the scholarly language?",
                "This course was designed in a way that brilliantly surveyed gender, justice, power, and institutions while tying them all together along the way, and all the readings were topical and fantastic. I never felt like I wasted a minute on this class, and it was clear to me that the instructors valued my time and well-being. We had so many incredible guests, and getting to actually speak to some of my favorite queer writers\/theorists was incredible. I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: absolutely loved it! Professor Joe was very lenient and understanding as long as you communicate, evidenced by how he had both remote and in-person options. There was a lot of reading somedays but you could get away with doing a reasonable amount of it. The discussion sections were great as well, and the assignments were very reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: the material\/readings are very interesting and engaging; professor Fischel and the TFs were great at facilitating discussions  \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures didnt really discuss the readings and sometimes were fast-paced",
                "I really enjoyed the format of the course! The lecture is a great fifth addition to any schedule. And, the guest lectures + TF lectures were always fantastic. The only issue I've heard from my peers was with the pop quiz system; I wish there was a way for us to \"make-up\" quizzes due to COVID or other extenuating circumstances. But Prof. and the TF's were always so accommodating and were able to work with us (even if it meant doing Zoom lectures during COVID surges).",
                "The lectures and slides were a little all over the place and difficult to take notes with",
                "I think the strengths of the course is that Professor Fishel is enthusiastic and draws your into what you're learning. The topics themselves are actually pretty interesting as well. I would say that the class itself could have been a bit more organized in a way that topics could flow into each other.",
                "The readings for this course were generally very enlightening and interesting, although some of them were a bit dense and there could have been more support with interpreting them. Lectures also could be kind of hard to understand due to the speed of the course  more focused attention to fewer topics may have been beneficial (to my learning personally)",
                "Strengths: information was straightforward and approachable, assessments were fair; lecture was interesting; I felt like I learned a lot; I also felt like Prof Fischel took our feedback into consideration, which is nice\r\nWeaknesses: half the time, the readings and lecture felt one-sided. The class was taught as if there was a correct answer to all of the political\/philosophical debates; depending on your TF, section was not helpful\r\nImprovements: use a part of lecture to discuss multiple viewpoints on one topic",
                "Content is interesting, but quite difficult to understand especially since it is designed to be a gut",
                "Class could use more structure around lectures. Felt like there wasnt a clear path in terms of philosophy and issues",
                "The class topics were varied and so interesting; I was always engaged with the content. The readings were well selected and I enjoyed doing them. The professors and TFs were very kind and dedicated to our learning and success. The assignments were fun, and the exams were straightforward. I very much enjoyed this class!",
                "The course was engaging and the speakers that were invited added extra interest. This might not apply at all next year, but it would've been nice if lectures were still recorded for students who were very sick and it may have been hard to focus on Zoom.",
                "I wish we covered more content during lecture and went over readings in a more substantial way. Additionally, because it was a twice a week lecture for only 50 minutes, reviewing what we went over last lecture seemed super unnecessary and ended up eating up a ton of time.",
                "Some strengths of the course was that the information was really interesting and was taught in dynamic ways at times. There was a good structure laid out for the course, which made the information easier to follow."

                "Absolutely! I had engaged with gender theory extensively prior to this course, so I don't think it was a particularly intellectually challenging one (though certainly generative), but I think it's a fantastic introductory class on gender.",
                "absolutely. Tackling a wide range of issues, this course delivers exactly what you expect from its title. An intersectional approach to the role of gender, justice, power, and institutions as a whole.",

                "Yes, I think the course is set up really well to facilitate student learning and foster engagement in what feels like a low-pressure environment. The assignments were very interesting and creative, which I think allows students to make more personal, long-lasting connections with class material. And Professor Fischel includes so much diverse material that students from all backgrounds and with a variety of interests will all find something to connect to.",
                "Yes! Incredibly important topics and discussions, taught in a stress-free environment.",
                "I would recommend it as a fifth class to anyone interested in an introduction to queer and feminist theory. Overall, you get a nice overview of some important discussions in WGSS, but you don't dive into anything more deeply.",
                "nah, you could learn a bunch of this stuff yourself.",
                "Yes! I think the subject matter is very relevant and it is important to understand, from an academic perspective, a lot of the debate happening today.",
                "Yes definitely. It was super fun, prof fischel's lectures were super engaging, content was fascinating, and I learned so much. I brought friends to lectures a couple times just to watch because it was so interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to students in a heartbeatin fact, I already have. I have multiple friends taking this course next semester on my advice because I could not stop talking it up throughout the semester. I might end up a Political Science\/Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies major in no small part due to this class. I learned so much about justice and power alone, and then I was able to tie that into gender theory and what I know about institutions to form a new view of the world. I've learned about new conceptions of justice and what they mean, and I feel like a more informed political force for it. This is by far my favorite class I've taken in my first year at Yale; if you have any interest in gender\/sexuality theory and politics, take this course!!!",
                "Yes!! This is such a rare combination: a GUT that's actually INTERESTING. Low\/very reasonable workload but what you get out of it is so much more. You'll walk away with a familiarity with many contemporary writers, a deeper understanding on topical issues like abortion, and the feeling that you've grown as a person and thinker. A must-take course for any Yalie willing to engage with their perspectives.",
                "Yes. Professor Fischel is a great lecturer and the content we learned is very relevant and interesting.",

                "Yes! I learned so much and loved the teaching assistants. The readings and discussions were so thought provoking.",

                "Yes! It was an interesting class, and even if you've taken WGSS classes before or are familiar with some of the ideas we talk about in class, they're presented in an interesting way and it still feels engaging.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. The readings and discussion were extremely relevant to day-to-day issues that society faces.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Fischel is a great lecturer and a great person to learn from. Lecture was interesting; the material is interesting, and it was a great 5th class to learn about interesting topics in a low-stress environment.",
                "I will if they are looking for a gut, or have substantial background in WGSS and are genuinely interested",
                "Little work and very interesting.",
                "I definitely would! The class content is interesting and I love the openness surrounding the topics we discuss. The professor is very kind and an energetic lecturer. The workload is very low and the grading is kind, so I would especially recommend this as a 5th class or if your other classes have a high workload. Despite this, the class was not boring at all and I was engaged in the content throughout the semester.",
                "Absolutely!  This is a really solid introduction to, well, all the topics in the title, but it's also not an overwhelming amount of material. The professor and TAs are really invested in your getting what you want to out of the class.",
                "Yes, I think this course was a very low-stakes way to learn about women's and gender issues, such as the abortion debate.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it teaches you valuable information about justice and women studies and theories, which I think is important for everyone to learn about to understand others better. You also get more information about policies surrounding the area and what is being done or said, or not being done or said about the issues."
