            "comments": [
                "The strengths are the problem sets because this is where I learned the most. Sometimes it was hard to follow everything in class because if I missed one line of code I could no longer follow along on my own computer.",
                "A lot of practice with R, so this class is excellent if you want a good introduction to data with R. Probability is covered but not with that much depth, but we went really deep on probability with simulation on R, so it makes probability more intuitive and less computational.",
                "Strengths: Good overview to lots of topics in statistics if you've never taken a statistics class before. Problem sets are very manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, not many. I wish we had spent a little bit less time on probability (much of which was very intuitive) and a bit more time on the statistics, especially since we didn't get to ANOVA and only briefly touched on chi-squared test and multiple regression.",
                "I enjoyed the mix of in-class coding (learning how to use R) and lecture (covering the statistical concepts).\r\n\r\nThere weren't any big weaknesses in this course, but it would have been nice to have a complete practice exam before midterms / finals instead of just some suggested textbook problems.",
                "I guess the biggest issue I had was the divide between the computing and the statistics portion of the course. The course was mainly taught in R and the textbook was based on R and teaching stats through R, but I feel like one compromised the other. When the final exam rolled around, I felt unprepared for the paper portion because we never practiced without R.",
                "I think one of the strengths was the way in which the coding was taught. The final project was interesting to do, but I think there was a lack of practicing the skills needed for the project during class and on the homework.",

                "Yes, because the R language is important to learn for data analysis.",
                "Yes. The course, although intensive, is somewhat laid-back while making a lot of connections between mathematical functions for probability, hypothesis testing, and other topics with R. Overall, the practice with R, from simulations to ggplot to transforming data sets, has been very valuable.",
                "Yes. This class was honestly not very intensive, at least this year. Problem sets were typically only a couple of hours a week, and exams were not overly difficult. It will definitely be a bit more difficult if you're never had any exposure to R before, but honestly, learning R is a pretty useful skill and one of the things you'll most appreciate from this class if you've never learned it before. Overall, a pretty solid introductory statistics course for anyone looking to major in stats or even for people who just want to take one stats class at Yale to learn the basics.",
                "Yes! This is an excellent course, and didn't have a very high workload - it's not actually that \"intense.\" Since the class covers coding and is taught in a much smaller setting than S&DS 100, I would recommend taking this course instead S&DS 100.",
