                "The course is an immersive course using the Capretz method, meaning everything is taught entirely in French. This is a strength and a weakness, especially when there are students who have taken French before and those who haven't. The professor will say something with new French vocabulary that some will not understand and because some students will respond affirmatively, there will be no further explanation. Without adding an English explanation (because it's difficult to have a direct translation) the class will feel like it's moving too quickly for some.",
                "Strengths: I really learned a lot of French very fast. The videos (French in Action) are engaging, and they provide the basis for the course, giving it a plot and storyline to follow and stay interested in. The course blends a variety of assignments to cover every facet of the language (grammar, speaking, pronunciation, etc). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is quite fast-paced. Especially in the weeks with 2 videos, it seemed almost impossible to complete the homework assignments, compositions, and prepare adequately for the test (those occurred every week on Mondays). The courses really fast pace occasionally discouraged me, and I think it could be slowed down without losing its strength in teaching French well. Also, the fact that we could not keep the tests we completed was really difficult when studying for the final.",
                "I wish things were uploaded sooner (slides, worksheets) so we could review them throughout the week. More consistent updates of the gradebook. More opportunity to practice speaking in class. I think the Docuprint workbook is more useful than the workbook that accompanies the textbook. Outside of the listening activities, much of the blue workbook felt like busywork."

                "I would definitely recommend taking French language courses at Yale. The department is wonderful and you do learn a lot quite quickly, you just have to keep up with the workload. Without daily study, it becomes difficult rather quickly. Make sure to balance this course with your others and make time for it.",
                "Only if the student was very interested in learning French and had a schedule which could accommodate a significant workload from this course. The course is really fast-paced. It teaches French well, but at a pace which really seems quite fast and excessive at times. This might be a good course to Cred/D/F if the option is available to you."
