    "I learned how to converse in Chinese in different topics and learned how to read and write a lot more Chinese.",
    "Learned many new Chinese words and grammar structure that taught formal writing and communication skills over colloquial speaking.",
    "I developed my Chinese language skills. I mostly sharpened my writing skills through the essay assignments and the daily quizzes. I learned a lot of vocabulary that one would typically not use in everyday speaking.",
    "In this course, I learned how to discuss issues of cultural identity and global issues such as politics and education, all in my native language. This has been an incredibly empowering experience.",
    "I learned how to write critically and raised my vocabulary to real-world applications, learning vocab for economy-related matters, relationships, and majors.",
    "Developed more advanced language speaking skills, intermediate writing and reading skills",
    "Better Chinese usage in real conversations",
    "I really improved my chinese vocabulary and my writing ability. I learned so many new words and grammar structures that I had not known before.",
    "Learnt relevant terms in Chinese, how to use Chinese grammar more appropriately, how to be more comfortable speaking Chinese in a conversational manner"

   "comments": [
    "This course prepares students well if they want to travel abroad. Sometimes this course is a lot of work. It's hard to do all of it with the work from other classes.",
    "Strengths are the lessons are very interesting and the textbook and instructors were helpful. Weakness was that it moved a bit too quickly so it was difficult to memorize and comfortably use the vocab.",
    "really really difficult course with a lot of busywork",
    "The greatest weakness of this course is the lack of communication and oral practice in class. We rarely ever converse with classmates and I don't think my speaking ability improved very much throughout the class since we just constantly repeated after the teacher instead of creating our own conversations. The strength of this class was in its reinforcement of vocabulary and sentence structures. However, I feel that this strength would be furthered if we talked and conversed to reinforce this vocabulary. I wish there were more interesting topics.",
    "Because each student in the class was of such a different ability level (that might just be characteristic of all native speaker classes), sometimes collaborating with other students could be difficult. \r\n\r\nI think the greatest strength in this class was the breadth of topics we covered. I loved how every week we moved onto a new lesson. I also found the textbook and online work to be well integrated with our in class assignments.",
    "Strengths: understanding Chinese culture, the professor's willingness to explain confusing parts and questions\r\nWeaknesses: too little grammatical support, class is too big, too few oral practices and chances to speak in class",
    "Would have been nice to have more practice with sentence structure\/vocabulary that was not graded; it sometimes felt that, outside of class itself, we didn't have a lot of opportunities to engage with the material.",
    "Strengths: improved my chinese, small classes which made it easier for me to speak, engaging texts that the teacher wrote herself\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there needs to be a bigger focus on speaking; for a majority of every lesson, we would listen to the teacher teach and talk about grammatical structures but we did not spend a lot of time actually speaking with each other",
    "I think it was a pretty good chinese class and can't think of many weaknesses. It was good because it used a variety of methods to evaluate our performance (presentations, exams, participation, debates, movie discussions etc). I guess in a way that could also be construed as a negative because it meant that you had to put in your fair share of effort and work to get them all done well."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the teacher I had was very good.",
    "Yes.",
    "no, but you probably need it for the language requirement",
    "I would recommend this course to any native speaker of Chinese who is interested in learning more about their identity.",
    "Yes if you are willing to put in the time and effort to actually commit these words to memory. If you pour time into this course, you will get a lot out of it. I would suggest getting a Chinese tutor to balance out the speaking aspect of developing Chinese skills.",
    "Yes if they are willing to put in the work",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in improving their chinese in terms of writing ability and vocabulary. If the student is looking to speak chinese better, I don't think this class would help them because I don't really think my speaking improved.",
    "Yes! Wang laoshi is really adorable and genuinely interested in helping students do well and become better at Chinese. I learnt relevant terms in Chinese, how to use Chinese grammar more appropriately, and how to be more comfortable speaking Chinese in a conversational manner. It was good because it used a variety of methods to evaluate our performance (presentations, exams, participation, debates, movie discussions etc). I guess in a way that could also be construed as a negative because it meant that you had to put in your fair share of effort and work to get them all done well."
