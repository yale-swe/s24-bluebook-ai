    "A weakness of this course might be the lack of structure it has since it is mainly free discussion on the pieces of literature we read. That being said, this format has also allowed students to have deep, analytical discussions.",
    "It was a very good course.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed almost all of the texts we read, and the reading load is really manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion had an awkward vibe, and there was not always a ton of room for speaking.",
    "Love the way the class is set up with weekly readings and then some class reading then discussion. Assignments were evenly spaced and fairly graded.",
    "Strengths: interesting material; engaged professor; manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: none"
