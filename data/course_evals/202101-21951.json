I think that for non-native speakers, reading about 60 pages a week is challenging. Moreover, I wish that we had discussed what we had read in class to learn more about different themes and writing styles. I also believe that it's important to encourage non-native speakers to talk in Arabic and more importantly, make mistakes without fearing judgement, which this class did not do all that successfully.",
                "The strengths are that the readings were very interesting and I enjoyed writing all of our papers. The weaknesses are that the classes often felt repetitive. I would have liked to have done more diverse activities in class. I would have liked to have discussed the reading more in class with the professor and other students.",
                "The course was tailored to the needs of students. Also, all of the texts chosen were very different and unique and allowed for good discussion. At first, the workload was quite high, but Ustath Aziz is great and corrected it accordingly.",
                "I would say to include more poetry and really focus on literature rather than allowing students to present about current issues or politics.",
                "This course could have been more engaging at times, because the structure was repetitive and some of the work felt like busy work. It was very good of the prof to shorten the lengths of the papers, but the weekly presentations became repetitive and it would have been nice to have different ways to engage in discussion."
