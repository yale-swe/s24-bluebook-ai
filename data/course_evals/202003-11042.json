                "This course didn't translate very well to being taught virtually. The cancellation of the lab made it hard to understand how the concepts we were taught in class were applicable. The slides were very confusing, and I feel that the material moved too fast. The textbook was also very confusing.",
                "Strengths: lectures lined up really closely with the textbook and had a lot of content overlap, so it made the textbook extremely useful. Professor Tang also was very knowledgeable and was available to answer questions. Exams were more concept, rather than math heavy, which made the course much easier to manage\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading wasnt very timely, so it was hard to gauge how you were doing in the class. Review sessions for exams were sometimes scheduled last minute and without student feedback on a time that worked.",
                "I would have liked to have all of the classes recorded. Personally, zoom lecture could be a struggle to follow along with and I felt I could better understand the material when I am able to pause and stop the lecture to digest what was covered.",
                "lectures were done well, perhaps there could have been some better communication with the TA(s)",
                "The course was well taught. The professor was willing and encouraging of questions. He took time to answer any gaps of understanding. I would have liked the lectures slides to have more text to accompany the pictures. This would help to guide studying after class."

                "Recorded lectures would be nice because it is a very complex and high level topic. Plus there were no defined office hours, you have to email to meet with the professor or TA, which can sometimes discourage students from reaching out to ask questions. Lectures slides also had very little info on them besides graphics, so the slides were not helpful at all while studying",

                "Yes, but only if you are interested in the physics of semiconductor devices and you're willing to put in the time to study the textbook. A lot of the content requires that you develop some intuition about how current flows through semiconductors, properties of junctions, etc. Simply attending the lectures may not be enough to get a good grasp of these topics. Hence you might need to follow along by reading the textbook on your own.",
