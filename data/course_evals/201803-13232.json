    "I learned about the domains of health and illness in the U.S., with some coverage of international\r\ntrends and topics. We analyzed how our personal health and public health are shaped by\r\nsocial structures, political struggles, expert knowledge, and medical markets. I learned about the \r\ncultural and social meanings associated with health and illness; inequalities in health and health\r\ncare access and provision; controversies surrounding healthcare, medical knowledge production,\r\nand medical decision-making; and the social institutions of the health care industry.",
    "This class was surprising to say the least. I kind of wish we spent more time of certain subjects as opposed to a new subject each class period because the end of the class seemed somewhat less important (topic wise) and, in my opinion, were less interesting than the topics discussed in the first half. Overall though, great class!",
    "I learned a lot about healthcare systems and how we as a society socially construct health and healthcare. I learned more about the interconnections of society and public health.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the U.S. healthcare system. It was enlightening to gain a firmer understanding of why we don't have a single-payer healthcare system.",
    "Taught me a lot about a variety of subjects concerning medicine, society, and the way topics therein are socially constructed.",
    "I learned a lot from this course, and it encouraged me to think about health in society in a new light. The material was very interesting, and it made me interested in exploring this in my career.",
    "I learned so, so much about health and healthcare, which some of us take for granted. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of this course was understanding the difference between a disease and an illness, and how the latter was socially constructed! Also, for the book review assignment, I read \"Being Mortal\" and it turned out to be one of my favorite books ever.",
    "I gained so much insight into the healthcare system of America and abroad. I learned a lot about the health disparities and inequities faced by many different groups in the US, the benefits and drawbacks of different types of healthcare systems, health insurance, and the relationships between society, illness, and healthcare.",
    "I gained much greater insight into the social discrepancies in the healthcare system.",
    "this was an incredible class- i learned so much, and it had flexibility integrated within it to allow you to explore and facet of the topic you please.",
    "Knowledge about the history of medicine and current health trends from a social perspective.",
    "I learned that there is a whole lot more to medicine than just biology.",
    "This class was a good survey course on some important sociological terms related to medicine and other course concepts that broadly relate to health as a whole.",
    "learned lots about medical sociology",
    "Health and illness in the US",
    "social construction of illness, health inequality, healthcare systems including the US's, medicalization, very interesting applications of each of these major topics. applications varied from topics such as breast cancer and malaria to vibrators and viagra.",
    "Not many. Course was too broad and needed to be focused more on sociological concepts and theories.",
    "Learned some important things about the healthcare system, how medicine and sociology intersect, why health disparities exist, etc.",
    "This was my first sociology class at Yale and it taught me to view health issues from a more wide scope view instead of at the biological level. It was interesting to learn about policy and healthcare across the globe and country and think it will make me a better prospective physician",
    "Understanding of social determinants of health, social construction of illness, great overview of how health and illness interact with race, SES, gender, identity, etc.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of healthcare in the US as well as other countries and the flaws that exist within that system. The course also helped me to think in a more global sense.",
    "I learned a lot about sociology and how it relates to medicine, which is extremely valuable for my realm of study. I really, really enjoyed it and will take a lot away from it. Planning on taking more sociology courses.",
    "Great sociology class about the different issues surrounding health and health systems in the US",
    "I learned about health and illnesses in context within what was going on around the word at the time. I learned how to evaluate and review a book, as well as develop insight into what the public's role is in helping social illnesses.",
    "I learned a lot about how the healthcare system in the US works, and about how broken it really is.",
    "I learned a lot about medical ethics which was a pleasant surprise, and you also learn a lot about the field of public health as well as how it has been conducted historically. There's also lots of sociological theory regarding disease and illness creation.",
    "This class was an accessible sociology class for those who do not have a strong sociology background",
    "This course provides a great overview of inequalities in health.",
    "I learned to think sociologically about the construction of health, illness, and medical knowledge. I learned to think about the gendered, racialized, and classed distributions of illness and health, and I learned to think less binaristically about what it means to be a body.",
    "The most useful part of this course for me was about healthcare. I also LOVED reading Being Mortal by Atul Gawande. Great text. In this course, you'll learn about health disparities and the social foundation for such disparities. It's an informative intro sociology course.",
    "I gained a new lens though which to examine healthcare systems across the U.S. and around the globe, health inequalities, conceptions of wellness, and more."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the structure of this course. There were never any surprises and i knew what to expect. Lecture was very straightforward. The midterm and paper assignments were fair and quite constructive.",
    "This is obviously a new course. I think above all, there needs to be a reason to be in class after the midterm. I think this was an accident, but after the midterm, there was only two paper grades and section participation left to be accounted for. Therefore, you really didn't need to be in class for the second half of the semester, which a lot of the class clearly took note of, which was sad. They missed out, but I feel like this could be fixed with a final (I don't know if that would be as conducive) or something else. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Really kind professor, great material, amazing introduction to health pathway!",
    "The readings and topic were very interesting and formative for my learning experience. Prof. Menon was really understanding, communicative and flexible. \r\n\r\nImproved by:\r\nMore interaction in lecture",
    "Professor Menon is an INCREDIBLE lecturer. I thoroughly enjoyed each class and many students still attended after the midterm despite there being no final.",
    "Covered a lot of topics efficiently, no particular critiques",
    "A strength is the scope of material we cover in a short amount of time, but overall I think the course was slightly unorganized. I think it would do better as a smaller class where students could engage in discussion more. The assignments also seemed to be out of a need to assign students a grade, so I think they could be tailored to allow students to explore things they are interested in. Sometimes, it was very unclear what was expected from students for the assignments.",
    "The course is wonderfully organized in terms of topics, which are all very interesting in and of themselves. Professor Menon is a terrific lecturer (I love how she puts \"Key Takeaways' in her presentations) and the TA's are all wonderful as well. The workload isn't bad at all, and the readings are always interesting. There's something in particular that I would change to the course.",
    "This course is extremely interesting, organized, and well-structured. Every lecture makes sense on its own, but makes even more sense when seen in the broader context of the course as a whole. The class structure works well- having readings before lecture, as well as a midterm, a review paper, and a final paper. I do not have any recommendations to improve this course.",
    "Great professor and interesting material! She tried to cover a lot of topics in a short period of time. I felt like the assignments were open-ended but then had overly particular grading rubric.",
    "Very interesting topics, well lectured",
    "The content was very interesting but I think there were moments where the information could be conveyed a lot more concisely. There were many nuggets of gold but also some pieces of fluff. Overall a very interesting course.",
    "Strengths: clear and engaging lectures, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: not very engaging",
    "Prof. Menon is a good lecturer and the course concepts are interesting. I think the midterm and final paper were fair. I do think that the book review didn't contribute to my learning, and that the book selections weren't that great.",
    "Strengths: engaging material and lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class got bogged down in the sociological theories and jargon, so it felt a bit too (and unnecessarily) theoretical at times.",
    "STRENGTHS: Prof Menon and the TAs were really helpful and understanding. The course was slow-paced which is helpful for those who are new to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Some assignments were confusing in the delivery of instructions and (confusing in the grading), but that could just be me being bitter. Sometimes some of the lectures could feel a little bit entry-level but also this is an entry-level course. The lecture slides when referred back on were really empty and unhelpful in terms of reviewing.",
    "The awesome TAs and the fun assignments were the strengths of this course.",
    "Great lecture topics",
    "great lectures that had a mix of theory and application. great assignments including a book review and research paper. the book's selected for the review could have been more interesting or at least different from what the course taught. it seemed like i was reading things i had already learned. I read the death gap for reference.",
    "It would be beneficial to have a final. There was lackluster attendance after the midterm.",
    "I really liked how there was only a midterm, book review, and final paper because you could focus on learning rather than being stressed about the material. The final paper allowed you to explore a topic of interest, which I found to be rewarding. One the flip side of the coin for the low workload, it was difficult to be motivated to attend class after the midterm.",
    "This was Professor Menon's first time teaching at Yale. She was very engaged in the material and helpful to students who came in with questions. However, the assignments and midterms were often unclear in terms of her expectations and left a lot of room for error that was penalized when grading. I think more practice midterm questions, clearer rubrics etc would have made the assignments more managable.",
    "Strong course, interesting material. Perhaps a greater focus on dialogue and conversation in section as opposed to just reviewing what happened in the readings and lectures. Tons of interesting content in the course, but it didn't feel like we had the chance to really interact with one another about it, so perhaps more focus on having conversations about the implications of course material in section.",
    "The course was really engaging and Professor Menon is a great lecturer. However, the section for the class was a little bit disorganized and did not help me understand the material.",
    "Strengths: Lecture is absolutely fascinating, workload wasn't too high, readings were interested (albeit a bit long). Professor Menon is a significant part of why this class was successful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section was sometimes less than stimulating\/less than helpful. Somewhat a waste of time with the way that it was run.",
    "I think there should have been a final because that would have kept students more engaged",
    "Dr. Menon was a huge asset to the class - her lectures were always really engaging, and made sense of pretty complicated topics. I think the main improvement to be made is to have a better defined arc to the class, since the topics didn't always seem to complement or naturally follow one another, especially in the second half of the semester",
    "Strengths: really interesting material, an engaging lecture and very interesting readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: after midterm a lot of people would not go to class...so it would have been nice if the attendance was better.",
    "Strengths - We covered so much interesting content! I also really liked how we touched on historical concepts such as the Black Panther Party in the mid and late 1900s, and the creation of black hospitals.\r\nWeaknesses - N\/A",
    "Strengths: Varied topics, we kind of wade through history and sociology as well as bits of science. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It felt kinda open-ended in the end. Like we were introduced to medicalization and biomedicalization theories through texts which painted them in a kind of damning light... but not to different lenses that we could use to analyze illness and disease in society.",
    "Strengths of the course included the lectures, the readings, and the structure of assignments. Could be improved by lectures slides that were a little bit more conducive to exam review.",
    "There was some miscommunication between the professor and the TAs, which resulted in confusion about the expectations of the assignments and what we needed to know for the midterm.",
    "This class does a great job of combining theory\/overarching concepts and specific examples from U.S. and global history\/current events. In terms of weaknesses, I was a little frustrated that assessment of essays was based exclusively on a very strict rubric (the emphasis on the rubric sometimes discouraged me from really engaging with that I was writing about or taking it in a direction that I thought was meaningful). It seemed like strict adherence to the rubric was more important than anything else in terms of essays. This focus on the rubric seemed a little out of place in a class that otherwise encouraged students to speak up, make their own interpretations, challenge ideas, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. if you are pre-med, interested in public health or our healthcare system..TAKE THIS CLASS. It opens your eyes to a lot that most people don't know of when it comes to health and our healthcare system.",
    "Yes, it provides an important foundation for understanding public health within a societal lens and relates the topics to current issues.",
    "YES! Take this if you get the chance to better understand our healthcare system and to learn important insurance terms that are necessary to know (think: deductible).",
    "Yes, this course was very interesting and engaging. Workload is super reasonable.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in sociology or thinking of pursuing a medical career. Overall, the material was very interesting and though-provoking.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student, no matter their major or interests. Everyone definitely can benefit from learning about health and healthcare, and this course is a wonderful way to do so.",
    "Yes. It's a well-rounded mostly sociology course that branches out into feminist, race, and other intersectional theories. There's something for every student.",
    "This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale, and I would highly recommend it to another student. Every lecture is very engaging, and the material is very interesting and relevant to a wide variety of fields. It is the ideal combination of sociology, biology, medicine, public health, and policy. The workload is not too high, and I actually looked forward to reading the book, writing the review, and writing the final research paper. If you are interested in any combination of the fields listed above, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes very interesting course with a manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was overall engaging and the workload was very manageable (two papers and a midterm). The content in the class was really interesting and something I don't think you can find in many other courses at Yale. Prof. Menon is a very good lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's one of those \"tool belt\" classes, where the information you learn is information you should know as a human in today's age.",
    "Yes. It provides valuable conceptual frameworks. The sociological lens, when applied to health, is fascinating and is worth engaging with.",
    "Yes! Very interesting course! Professor Menon is incredible as a lecturer and as a human :)",
    "Yes, I would. Prof. Menon is caring, invested in her students, and a great lecturer. Additionally, the material is important for anyone to learn to be a more informed citizen, but especially important for those who are planning on a career in medicine or biology.",
    "I would recommend it to those who require it OR if you haven't had much exposure to health inequity-related work. This is a great entry-level survey course. But if you've done a lot of work in medical sociology or HSHM then this might feel repetitive or slow.",
    "absolutely",
    "Yeet.",
    "Take for an introduction to healthcare in the US!",
    "If you're looking for a low workload class and some pretty interesting material about the healthcare system from a sociologist's perspective, then take it. Professor Menon is great and will do anything she can to make sure you understand the material.",
    "Yes! Professor Menon is a wonderful professor who cares a lot about the subject material and the students in her class. Well organized and interesting content and readings, engaging lectures, interesting assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting, the workload was manageable but challenging, and Professor Menon is clearly very passionate about the topic. It is easy to do well if you put in effort and go to class.",
    "Absolutely- Professor Menon is wonderful and the course material is really, really interesting. It applies to a lot of HSHM and broadened my understanding of how healthcare and sociology are intertwined. Highly, highly reccommend.",
    "It would be a good first year class as they are good at outlining how to write an essay",
    "Definitely, it's an awesome class to complement all the science that goes into medicine. I think this kind of class is really important for people considering a medical career since it does such a great job of showing the more human ramifications of advances in health tech",
    "Absolutely would recommend to any student interested in learning how social illnesses and the context of illnesses affects the entire world.",
    "Yes! Take this course! Professor Menon is incredible, and you will learn so much about how structural violence is perpetuated by the US healthcare system. Also, this class really should be a requirement for pre-med students and students interested in health policy.",
    "Yeah! It was pretty interesting. If you like sociology and medicine I think that this is a pretty good nexus.",
    "yes! super interesting and very managable workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great introduction to sociological thinking and should really be required for anyone entering a field that engages with illness and health.",
    "I think the topic is very important no matter what field you're going into, and as a non-SOCY major definitely enjoyed the class.",
    "I would reccomend this course! Highly interesting material, insightful TA's, and great fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course."
