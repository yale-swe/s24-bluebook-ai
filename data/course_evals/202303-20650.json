                "This was an interesting perspective on a physics lab course, which I enjoyed. It felt like physics but in a different font. Material is presented in new ways and analyzed in new ways. Questions are asked which I would not have thought to come up in physics lab before. Definitely a strength. The class can be slow at times and a bit redundant. I felt like I could have been more challenged intellectually.",
                "The course was good in not requiring much prior knowledge. I dont think the python needed to be done in groups since there were differing skill levels. Maybe we could have used that time to learn the basics of the code and then individually pursue other appropriate tools for our skill level. Also, just having the code in the documents didnt give many opportunities to learn the code on our own.",
                "The strength of this course was in the teaching staff and how friendly and supportive they are. They made everyone feel very supported and clearly have a lot of passion for the subject and for teaching.",
                "Strengths: the teaching staff were very engaging and helpful, and taught in a hands-on fashion. Majority of the work could be completed within the class time, aside from practicing for presentations. Additionally, the course was structured to allow students with all levels of physics knowledge to learn and succeed. Weaknesses: none that I can think of!",
                "The course was taught in an engaging manner with hands-on activities and a learn-as-you-do format, which facilitated proper mastery of physics lab topics. It could be improved by giving more clarity regarding the presentation guidelines and rubric. Many students struggled with the presentations because they were unclear regarding the rubric and guidelines. The research components (research ethics, research presentation) were very useful to my development as a STEM major at Yale.",
                "The strengths include effective course organization and meaningful mentorship from the instructors.",
                "Strengths: supportive environment created by Professors who had genuine interest in the success of their students. I never felt discouraged from asking questions. The professors in this class are one of the kindest I have come across at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The biggest weakness from this course were the lab assignments which honestly left most students confused. The questions lacked clarity and the experiments which were prone to a lot of systematic error that were difficult to explain and only loosely connected to the physics concept at hand.",
                "the professors are the best people. they are so understanding and make the learning experience fun. however, the class needs to be a bit organized",
                "Strengths: Very engaging and the teaching staff is very helpful. Shoutout to Kate, Caitlin, and Steve for making this class great. The instructors will explain everything like you are five and there is no such thing as a dumb question in this class especially if you are stuck or not understanding something. \r\nWeaknesses: Can seem like a long time class time, especially with a discussion section and class back to back but it is very manageable and there isn't much work outside of class"

                "You should take this class if you have a very rudimentary or no previous experience in physics. It's a great introduction to core concepts and does not assume you have virtually any prior knowledge. The class is structured very well to facilitate student learning, though it may not be engaging for students who are already advanced physics scholars, per se.",
                "Im not sure whether it fits into any major/interest field well, but for general learning its good and engages a variety of skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, but I feel that it may be more suited towards first years and people with less background in science.",
                "Yes, I would! As a introductory physics lab, this course teaches you how to design an experiment, give experiment- and research-related presentations, use python, and operate different sensors/technology. If you are looking to expand your physics knowledge, I would recommend another course, as this class applies physics, but doesn't go into depth about any specific topic. Despite that, though, it has been a very enjoyable experience and a great introduction to physics labs!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The class is taught in a very approachable and engaging manner. It is not cutthroat or competitive like many other premed and science lab classes are. Also, Caitlin and Prof. Schilling are the best! Also, the class spends a significant amount of time teaching about research ethics and presenting research; this is something not many science classes spend time doing at Yale. This is a great class for everyone, regardless of what year student you are.",
                "Yes, this is great for premeds who are trying to start exploring physics in relation to biology and medicine. Lots of flexibility to ask questions that you are interested in. One weakness would be that the large portion of work is in Jupyter Notebook, so it felt like there was less hands-on time.",
                "I would not.",
