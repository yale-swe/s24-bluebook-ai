            "comments": [
                "Strengths: very good at teaching us chemistry\r\nWeaknesses: too many prelab lecture videos. Many were unnecessary. Lab reports guided us through calculations to the point where we didnt have to do any thinking ourselves. They should be made more open ended.",
                "Course was well organized and information was clear but I wish there was some flexibility in deadlines.",
                "This course has a huge workload, especially in the summer. The grading of our assignments was also extremely critical, which is reflected in the low class average. I think that eliminating a few of the many quizzes would help as well as the shortening of the lab reports that we must complete.",
                "Strengths: dr g was very helpful and always ready to answer questions. he never seemed annoyed with our constant questions. also the grading was very generous -- bonus points were often rewarded. the course was honestly not bad at all. \r\n\r\nthe pre lab lectures were very informative and helped my understanding of the concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the post lab quizzes. the time constraint was very restrictive, especially given that we had to type up all our work. I think it would be better to either a) increase the time limit of the post lab quizzes from 22 min or b) allow us to scan our answers. I don't know what the quizzes are like in non-covid times, but having them online and having to type out all the work was pretty frustrating and time consuming. there wasn't enough time to actually think about what I was doing. it also sometimes felt like memorization was prioritized over understanding. there is no reason why I had to have the formula of acetone memorized. this is genchem not o-chem. I think making the post lab quizzes open note would help prioritize understanding over memorization.\r\n\r\nalso class time felt like a waste. he basically just repeated what he said in the videos, so I felt like I wasn't gaining anything from logging onto the zoom session\r\n\r\nsome of the lab reports were quite long\r\n\r\nI don't know if they're going to stick with the grading policy in the syllabus, but if so, that needs to be changed. the grading policy in the syllabus states that the average grade in the class  will determine the barrier between a B & B+, and the grades above average will get a B+ or higher and the grades below the average will get a B or lower. this kind of policy pits students against one another. what if the average grade is a 95? it's unfair for grades to be curved down. if we did 95 work, we should get a 95 in the class. this is the only class I've taken so far at Yale where grades are curved down instead of up. I don't see a reason why the average grade should automatically be determined as a B+.\r\n\r\nso many videos. I didn't watch them except for the pre lab lectures or unless the lab report required me to. save your time by not watching the videos",
                "Dr G goes through the experiments thoroughly during class time. To ask for office hours, you have to email him for the zoom link, I think It would be easier if it was posted on canvas",
                "Not much of the materials tested in the pre and post lab quizzes are actually taught/ covered in the lectures, which makes it extremely difficult to get an A. However instructor, Dr. G, is very caring and loves students asking questions. He is very welcoming, which is always good to see.",
                "Strengths: being on zoom was actually a pro for this class because it was nice to have direct contact with Dr. G. Dr. G isn't a bad person at all, even if the course is not great, and I'd highly recommend asking him if you have questions about the lab. The labs themselves were interesting enough, and I appreciate that we had always learned the concept in Lecture before doing the lab on that topic. Weaknesses: The grading expectations in this class were detrimental to the experience of the course; there's a way to make the class better by not making such an unpleasant curve. It was really disheartening to feel like no matter what you do, the final grade will not be particularly great. Also some of the labs were unnecessarily long and the quizzes took ages to study for; for a half-credit class, this was a full credit of work. It was just as much work as Gen Chem Lecture.",
                "The strengths were the professor and course content. Very detailed lab manuals and pre lab videos and interactive live lecture. The assessment quizzes, though sometimes difficult, were a great resource to check my knowledge. Weaknesses were the online format.",
                "Strengths: Dan DiPrimio and the clarity of the experiment\r\nWeaknesses: Lengths of the lab report and the time limit for quizzes was way too low.",
                "I found the videos in the Media Library very helpful and informative, but I did not find it too helpful for the content in the videos to be repeated in a live Zoom lab session.  Perhaps live Zoom lab sessions could be more focused on the science behind the lab itself.  This got better as time went on-- I noticed Dr. G perhaps realized this, and the lab Zoom sessions were less repetitive, which I appreciated!",
                "Strengths: Plenty of instructional material. Reasonably spaced-out deadlines.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Live instruction was too long, repeated much of the material in pre-lab videos / lectures.",
                "Strengths: There is a lot of help available if you need it. Dr. G. is really enthusiastic about the material and helping you understand it.\r\nWeaknesses: The course material is pretty repetitive. You are asked to watch pre-lab videos which cover almost the exact same material as the live lab. This felt like a waste of my time and made the live lab feel boring because I had already seen most of the experiments.",
                "Strengths: Dr. G has gathered lots of content - videos, manuals, an extensive course description document, and blank lab reports - for our use, so if you have the time and are interested, there is a lot to watch and learn. He's truly committed to the class, and the experiments are pretty thought-through and make sense. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading on the lab reports can be a bit harsh. The prelab videos and lab reports can be very long. Sometimes, despite the class being an intro chem lab, the fundamental definitions/concepts are skipped over, unexplained, or merely touched on, leaving you to fill in a few fundamental gaps. Likewise, some of the questions at the end of lab reports or in post lab quizzes require a deeper understanding of the concepts than is provided in the course, in my experience."

But it is a huge time commitment (just as much as Gen Chem lecture) and prepare to feel very frustrated at certain points.",
                "Yes, the course is necessary for many  requirements but is still an enjoyable and interesting class.",
                "No but most students don't take this by choice.  This is probably the worst lab course at Yale, and I didn't learn a thing.",
                "Only if it is a prerequisite.",
                "Yes, Dr. G is very helpful and informative in his video lectures on Canvas and when you reach out to him.",
                "Yes, especially if you're taking Gen Chem II (CHEM S165) concurrently. It reinforces lecture content in a very useful way. Content doesn't overlap 100%, but you'll find that the content you're doing in the ~2 weeks before the Gen Chem II final significantly decreases the amount of review you have to do!",
                "I personally had to take this class for a requirement, it is decent. There are some cool experiments and Dr. G. is really enthusiastic which made the course decently enjoyable. I would recommend this course to anyone who really really enjoys chemistry or has to take this course for a requirment.",
                "I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who didn't have to take it - I love the idea of gen chem as a basis of chemistry, but I feel like this class requires too much work and time to justify a half-credit course. However, it is certainly a rigorous course working with relatively introductory chemistry concepts - valuable if you're interested or need the hands-on lab experience."
