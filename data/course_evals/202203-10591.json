I think I wasn't super ready to take it, and I would have gotten a lot more out of it if I was more preparedperhaps a few philosophy or literature classes. Beyond that, I think the design of the class is worthwhile in of itself: students working together to understand the text. The key is probably to get students who are best fit for this class and will function well in this environment.",
                "Strengths: very interesting set of texts on the syllabus that are fun to read, really pushes you to become a better writer and think more critically about passages and how to connect them, encourages a close connection to the text and pushes you to take your thinking and writing to the next level\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: really small class size sometimes made discussions feel like they were dragging on, there isn't really room for creativity in class discussions or the papers because there are really specific things that Prof Levene is looking for and she grades the papers really harshly, felt like the texts were disjointed from each other which made it hard to suss out main course themes, felt like it would have been helpful for Prof Levene to guide and focus discussions a bit more",
                "I feel that this class could really be improved if participation counted toward students grades. While I understand Professor Levenes philosophy behind not grading participation (ie. Some students learn by listening), I think that can discourage students from challenging themselves to participate in class, and place a pressure on more talkative students to fill up the space. I also think it would benefit this course if students were given a chance to revise or rewrite their essays for extra credit in line with Professor Levenes feedback."

                "I would recommend it, but I would emphasize that you should take the class with the intention of working hard and taking it very seriously. This isn't like many other seminars where you can sort of read the text and be fine. Nancy will not make you speak, but you will get a lot more out of this class if you did the readings thoroughly and carefully and follow Nancy's guidelines on expectations for class preparation. I wish I put a bit more time into this class or took something else before it so that I was more prepared coming in. But that shouldn't deter you from taking it. I imagine it would be one hell of a class if you treat it as such.",
                "Unfortunately no. The texts for this course are really good and I think there is potential for a good course here, but as is, I don't think the format of the class allows students to learn a lot. Prof Levene is a harsh essay grader, and because of her very specific expectations, it often felt like there was pressure to say or write the things that she was looking for. If you take this course, I'd strongly recommend making use of office hours and discussing your essay plans with her, but still be prepared to credit/d this class. Prof Levene is a very kind person, and if you ask for help, she will definitely push you to become a better writer and thinker. In order to talk about the texts the way Prof L wants, it takes a ton of planning and thought before class each week (way more so than other reading-based courses I've taken), and I'm not sure this extra effort would have been worth it in this course. Because my section was so small, the 2 hour discussions sometimes dragged on, and the vibes of the class felt off. I don't feel like I got a ton out of the class besides stressing about the papers and knowing I was going to do badly on papers that, if submitted for another course, would get a higher grade.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that are willing to take it on a credit/D basis. I truly did learn a lot from Professor Levenes teaching methods and the unique way that she leads discussion."
