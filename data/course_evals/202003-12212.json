                "This course provided not only interesting content regarding North Korean history and ideologies but also a broader overview of what it means to be religious. In addition to learning about the specific role that religion plays in North Korean society and in the lives of individual North Koreans, students learned to reflect on our own definitions of religion and how these might play out in our own lives.",
                "Through taking this course, I gained a more nuanced understanding of North Korean society mostly through the lens of personal memoirs. What information the memoirs couldn't provide, Professor Kim was very helpful in giving the broader historical context. Since the class name sets out to examine North Korea's Juche ideology through a religious studies lens, I was able to rethink critically what it means to be \"religious\" and the necessary means people will take for the sake of their \"religion.\" Studying North Korea through that lens was a helpful tool in understanding how North Koreans see their relationship with their East Asian neighbors and the wider international community.",
                "I learned that there were multiple definitions of religion. I also learned about the day to day lifestyle in North Korea. We read a lot about policy but also about the memoirs of multiple perspectives of those who lived in North Korea. Juche was also heavily emphasized.",
                "I learned to expand my view of North Korea and religion.",
                "This was my first Religion class and I learned how things we consider to be secular can actually be considered religions. I also learned so much about North Korea and its complexities, as opposed to the traditional monolithic depiction of North Korea put forth by Western media.",
                "In this class I learned about the current state of North Korea and how it got to be this way, starting from the late 19th century. We use the lens of religion to analyze why this state operates the way it does and how people are impacted and react as a result. I learned a lot about the current reality of north koreans, and all the nuances that the contemporary american understanding of north korea doesn't cover.",
                "I learned a lot about North Korea's history and some religious philosophy (how do we define religion and religiosity? what counts as a religion?). Most of our readings for this class were primary sources from people who had lived\/been to\/been imprisoned in North Korea, which helped us build up a good knowledge base about what it is actually like to live there.",
                "Learned a lot about North Korea and religion",

                "This class was honestly incredible, and really one of its kind. Professor Kim sought to reconfigure our understanding of North Korea and North Korean state ideology, juche, as a religion. Of sorts, at least. We talked about numerous definitions of religion, focusing on Frederick Streng's definition, a path\/means to ultimate transformation. Then, through that lens, we contextualized juche ideology, and were able to look at North Korea from a different perspective. The bulk of the course focused on firsthand accounts from North Korean citizens\/defectors, from propaganda films, to memoirs from camp survivors or those who successfully crossed the border. We also read from Bandi, a North Korean writer still living in the country. We also got to hear from Monique Macias, who spent the majority of her childhood in North Korea and had Kim Il-Sung as her father figure, which was perhaps the most incredible aspect of this course. I've learned a whole lot, and have come out of the class not an expert on North Korea, but I now have an extraordinary breadth of knowledge regarding the country, especially from a sociological perspective. How do we classify religion or religiosity? What makes something inherently religious? And especially from the American demonizing perspective of North Korea, how can we humanize the country, without ignoring its human rights violations, while simultaneously understanding the way it functions and not just dismissing it as a rogue nation?"

                "The biggest strength of this course would have to be the diversity of the personal memoirs. It's not everyday that we get to hear what North Korea is like from the voices of North Koreans themselves or other nationalities who have lived for extended periods of time in North Korea. Some of my favorite memoirs included Bandi's The Accusation and Masaji Ishikawa's A River in Darkness. The former includes stories written directly inside North Korea, and the latter recounts the overlooked story of Japanese nationals who migrated to North Korea. Overall, reading their stories has helped me challenge preexisting narratives about North Korea and its people that don't give North Koreans a chance to speak for themselves. Moreover, examining North Korea from a more \"micro\" level (on the grounds approach if you will) also helped me empathize more with everyday struggles that the people face. Their struggles and aspirations are no different than what people all around the world face. \r\n\r\nI wished that we had the chance to read more personal memoirs because they were that enjoyable to read. I was at first worried that I wouldn't have been able to read a whole book a week, but the stories are so fascinating that I couldn't put books down sometimes. I understand that it's impossible to know everything about North Korean society within one condensed semester, but this class was more than enough for an introduction. Maybe in the future, the head instructor might consider making the class at least twice a week to allow for more discussion and lectures.",
                "Strength: Professor Hwansoo Kim himself is a strength. Weakness: Sometimes I wished Professor Kim would lecture more than having more student-led discussions.",
                "Strengths: its content\r\nWeaknesses: a decent amount of it is student discussions, and I wish we had varied up class structure more. Like, if we had done group activities or debates or something",
                "I thought most of our readings were really engaging and revealing, and our discussion posts helped me clarify what I thought and understand my peers' perspectives. Our last class was on North Korea moving into the future-- I wish we spent more time on what is happening in the present that could signal change for the north korean regime and people.",
                "The readings were very versatile and interesting: we read academic papers, memoirs, fiction, news articles, interviews, and even watched documentaries and films. Because Juche ideology was a focus point in the class, I would have also liked to have had the chance to read and discuss more primary sources  like Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il's speeches for example.",
                "I think this course had a really interesting thesis (can we treat Juche ideology as a religion), but I was somewhat disappointed in how we developed that driving claim. It seemed like the course was more \"North Korean history through a religious lens\" which was still really interesting, but I was hoping for a more modern view on the interactions between religion and global affairs and how the parallels we can draw with Juche should impact how we look at North Korean government and society. I also think that this course was a little too focused on Christian ideology, and I would have loved to see more critique of this rather than viewing it simply as a \"saving\" force for North Korea.",
                "The course gave me a really good background on the establishment of the DPRK as a state and about North Korea culture. I learned a lot about the inner workings of the country and gained an appreciation for how North Korea's history and cultural attitudes influence its action in modern times (with issues like nuclear weapons). The books we read were really interesting and useful in learning about the country.  I do wish the course had focused a bit more on the religious component of the class. We talked about the idea of religion a lot, but it never felt like we were really getting anywhere to me, and I wish we had focused on developing a definition a firmer definition of the term earlier in the course than we did.",
                "Strengths: There was a lot I liked about this course. For staters, this course had interesting material, and I learned a good amount about North Korea that I had never known previously. Dr. Kim is a very sweet and approachable professor. He structured this class well in terms of order of units where it felt like it followed a logical progression. People were very ready to participate so it never felt like there was a lull in conversation. I really enjoyed being broken out into breakout rooms with my peers because everyone wanted to participate. I also liked that therre was such an explicit effort made to switch up class structure. The assignment workload was quite light. We just had one seminar to lead, weekly 500 word discussion posts and a final paper. One of the best and coolest facets of this course was getting to meet Monique Macias on the last day of class. Getting to meet and interact with someone who was raised in North Korea and has close ties to the Kim family was incredible and truly once in a lifetime. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest is that this class was very anti-North Korea, pro-Western world. I felt many of our discussions got into bashing the North Korean way of life which is not fair (and also not the point of this course). Iljea (our TA) was the great balancing force in this dimension always forcing us to rationalize the biases we have against the DPRK and for the Western World. North Korea is far from perfect (what place is), but it's not our job to make an executive decision or summary judgement on their way of life. On that same note, it was easy to tell that the class was made up of almost all Christians. As a result, our discussions on issues like \"missionaries\" were not in the least bit critical. There's something seriously problematic about a missionary saying he \"saw the need for saving in the DPRK people,\" yet no one wanted to acknowledge this (especially in thinking about how imperial powers had messed with the Korean Peninsula for centuries). Second, although I thought the class was organized, I felt we were given too much in reading assignments every week. We often had a whole book and a film. In truth, that just means not everyone will read which will only hurt the conversation. Third, it felt like the same conversations were repeated class after class. In particular, \"Is Juche a religion?\" was asked in basically every class. Relying on different students every week to craft the conversation undoubtedly resulted in some of that repetition. On the note of seminar structure, I felt the non-student led portion also became repetitive and somewhat disorganized. In the beginning, we used that time to talk about religion in North Korea, North Korean political structure, and Korean history all of which I found interesting. After we had gotten through that material, the early lecture portion of the course became more disorganized. Lastly, on the note of assignments, I think the workload was great. However, truthfully, we got NO grades before our final papers (except for our discussion leading). It would be nice to get grades for some things prior to so we could know where we're at heading into our final paper.",
                "This course, for its first time, was structured very well and seminars were not boring in any regard. Whether it were virtual or in-person would not have had much bearing on the course material or facilitation.",
                "I felt like the weekly readings were pretty long. But theyre all engaging so its worth reading and fun to read. I wish I had gotten more feedback on the weekly discussion posts I made. I wasnt sure if I was doing them correctly or if there were ways that I could improve.",
                "Seminars are exciting and interesting, and Prof. Kim is an amazing professor!",
                "Everyone in the class was engaged and very interested in the subject, so discussions were that much better and enjoyable. The films we watched and the memoirs we read were very thought-provoking and emotionally touching. There is a fair amount of reading, but the work is certainly worth it and if you enjoy the subject, it will often not even feel like work. \r\nI wish we received more individual feedback because our main source of feedback was peers' responses during discussions. Also, this class focused more on the North Korean aspect and not so much on religion. I enjoyed the class regardless.",
                "Prof Kim and Iljae created a wonderful environment that felt open and welcoming even over zoom. They both have an incredible amount of knowledge and insight. I wouldn't necessarily say there were any weaknesses other than I wish there was more time to discuss certain topics or go more in depth because the material is truly fascinating and even after an hour or so there is still plenty to talk about!",
                "Almost every aspect of this course is perfection in my opinion: the structure, assignments, readings, discussions, the TA, and of course, the professor most notably, who drives this course with insight and passion.",
                "Strengths: this class is truly one of its kind, and I don't regret for a second that I chose to take it. Professor Kim made a wonderful introduction video that sold the class to me within the first few seconds. Take this class for Professor Kim, but also for the subject matter. This is an extraordinary opportunity to study North Korea in depth, without demonizing the country. Reading memoirs and firsthand accounts, while watching films and discussing the way the government functions, and contextualizing it with a little bit of Korean history (from the foundations of the country to Japanese colonialism, to the Korean war, and finally to modern day North Korea) we touched pretty much all the bases. And this is an incredibly unique perspective from which to learn about the country; a religious one, which provides numerous avenues of study. We also had incredible guest speakers, like Monique Macias and Ria Chae, who brought their expertise (and lived experience) to the class, which made it even better. The discussion posts are entirely open ended and graded on completion, so there's little stress involved and you're really allowed to give your opinion, whether that's airing your grievances or engaging critically. And the final \"essay\" can be a project; I chose to avoid writing an essay and made a video project, which allowed me to present my findings and my argument in a completely different fashion, which was fantastic in terms of flexibility but also goes to show that there are multiple ways of showing competency in a subject area. Professor Kim brought in contemporary resources, like BTS and BTS Army, and we loved talking to and with him in class. The readings were also chosen really well, save for Kenneth Bae's memoir and some of the longer, dense history texts. The memoirs were a fantastic addition to the course, as were the movies selected. The films were incredible.\r\nWeaknesses: While this class was highlight of my week, there are certainly ways it can be improved. At times, it felt like a glorified book club. The second half of the class, wherein one to two students led discussion... frankly, I did not get a lot out of this experience. Discussion leaders gather information and formulate questions from our discussion posts, making a presentation to summarize the week's readings and then diving into discussion. Perhaps it works better in a classroom setting, but over Zoom, it was rather awkward raising our hands via Zoom and then jumping around from student to student in a very inorganic way. Iljea, the TA, would jump in, but only to disagree or provide another perspective. It was really free rein at that point. I would have preferred more lecturing from Iljea and Professor Kim. The discussions didn't really teach me as much as the readings or the lectures in the first half of the class; I could've discussed the same things with my family members or a friend outside of class. More involvement from Professor Kim would be great, because the structure just gets repetitive. We had one class where Iljea lectured, and then after 10-15 minutes of his lecture, the floor was opened to questions. It was silent for a few minutes, because no one had anything to say. At all. Then people scratched their heads and came up with inane questions, just to fill the emptiness and silence. Not super effective for making the class very engaging. But on other days we'd have incredibly lively and fascinating discussions, or we'd watch something provocative and it would be lovely to hear from everyone. There was just something off in the balance and grand scheme of things. This class was a wonderful experience, but it could definitely be improved in these respects. I want to learn, not just listen to my peers. The professor and TA know more than we do, right? So I want to be taught!"

                "We made heavy use of Canvas' discussion feature, which proved very effective. However, only once did Iljea comment on each and every post. There wasn't any incentive to engage with each other's posts, unless you were using your post as a means of responding\/expanding upon a peer's post. Perhaps more engagement with the posts of the other students in the class could be implemented. We also made use of breakout rooms in the beginning of most classes, which was an okay way to get to know the other people in the class, and also hear varied perspectives on the readings and viewings for the week. We then came back to a large group discussion and lecture, which proceeded into a discussion led by students in the class. While it was a great structure, and perhaps it works really well in-person, it gets repetitive on Zoom, and leading discussion (especially when it's not being done by the professor\/instructors) can get really awkward over Zoom. \r\nMaking use of more visual material, or presentations with more content on them would be extraordinarily helpful. We did go through a map and talk about various landmarks, which was great. We also made use of the share screen feature several times so that we could watch things together, which was great. Do this more often! It helps break the silence while also giving something particularly engaging to do in an online format."

                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in either the broad study of religion or learning about North Korea not so much in the context of politics but as a society made up of individuals with unique personal experiences from which we can learn. The reading load may be heavy for someone who is not used to taking humanities classes at Yale. However, if interested in the content, the readings are also incredibly enjoyable and provide a unique way of learning by focusing on individual stories and memoirs rather than broader studies.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about North Korea or in Korean studies as a whole. Even if neither of those things are particularly pertinent to your academic interests, I would still say take this course if you can. Since Yale does not offer many Korean studies classes to begin with, this class was such a rare treat for me. I'm grateful for the privilege of taking this course. The Korean Peninsula is a very important regionally in East Asia and globally that deserves continued research and analysis from all academic fields. If that isn't reason enough to take this course in the future, America's own complicated relationship with North Korea means North Korea itself will remain relevant in international discourses for years to come.",
                "Yes!!! All the readings are super fascinating and interesting, and Professor Kim and Iljea were both very helpful, especially as the final project approached.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!! It transforms how you think about North Korea. Professor Kim gives out fascinating material that is so worth reading and discussing",
                "Yes, I think it really gives insights into North Korea's current state, and how it got there. Viewing North Korean juche ideology as a kind of religion was also a very interesting lens to explore.",
                "Overall this course was still interesting and very little work, so I would recommend it to someone looking for a fun class to add into their schedule. I still wish that some things were changed, especially the way we approached some topics of discussion and the difficulties due to the large number of students, but I enjoyed it overall.",
                "Yes, I definitely enjoyed the course. The grading isn't super clear because (as long as you complete all of the assignments leading up to the final paper) your grade is just the final paper. But, overall, the class conversations were interesting, and I actually really liked doing most of the readings.",
                "Overall, I would recommend this course with some caveats. I also have to say that I would recommend any course with Dr. Kim as he's great. This course has a lot of strengths and there is a lot I liked about the course. For staters, this course had interesting material, and I learned a good amount about North Korea that I had never known previously. Dr. Kim is a very sweet and approachable professor. He structured this class well in terms of order of units where it felt like it followed a logical progression. People were very ready to participate so it never felt like there was a lull in conversation. I really enjoyed being broken out into breakout rooms with my peers because everyone wanted to participate. I also liked that there was such an explicit effort made to switch up class structure. The assignment workload was quite light. We just had one seminar to lead, weekly 500 word discussion posts and a final paper. One of the best and coolest facets of this course was getting to meet Monique Macias on the last day of class. Getting to meet and interact with someone who was raised in North Korea and has close ties to the Kim family was incredible and truly once in a lifetime. Bringing more speakers next time this class is taught will only elevate it further.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this course had several weaknesses in my eyes that should only get better as it's taught more and more. The biggest is that this class was very anti-North Korea, pro-Western world. I felt many of our discussions got into bashing the North Korean way of life which is not fair (and also not the point of this course). Iljea (our TA) was the great balancing force in this dimension always forcing us to rationalize the biases we have against the DPRK and for the Western World. North Korea is far from perfect (what place is), but it's not our job to make an executive decision or summary judgement on their way of life as so many people seemed to try to do. On that same note, it was easy to tell that the class was made up of almost all Christians. As a result, our discussions on issues like \"missionaries\" were not in the least bit critical. There's something seriously problematic about a missionary saying he \"saw the need for saving in the DPRK people,\" yet no one wanted to acknowledge this (especially in thinking about how imperial powers have messed with the Korean Peninsula for centuries). Although I thought the class was organized, I felt we were given too much in reading\/watching assignments every week. We often had a whole book and a film. In truth, that just means not everyone will read which will only hurt the conversation. Further, it felt like the same conversations were repeated class after class. In particular, \"Is Juche a religion?\" was asked in basically every class. Relying on different students every week to craft the conversation undoubtedly resulted in some of that repetition. On the note of seminar structure, I felt the non-student led portion also became repetitive and somewhat disorganized. In the beginning, we used that time to talk about religion in North Korea, North Korean political structure, and Korean history all of which I found interesting. After we had gotten through that material, the early lecture portion of the course became more disorganized. \r\n\r\nAll to say, I think this course is 100% worth taking, but it's by no means a perfect class which will hopefully shift to being less Western focused in the future. This course is a great 5th class with a professor who really cares about his students focused on a country that isn't often spoken about.",
                "Professor Hwansoo Kim is the GOAT. One of my favorite professors at Yale; he puts in many hours trying to make the course material engaging and includes very pertinent, gripping readings for the class.",
                "Yes. Professor Kim is literally one of the nicest and kindest people at Yale. Just take any course with him. It doesnt have to be this one. But he provides such interesting perspectives and is very much worth your time.",
                "Absolutely! The content is very interesting and makes you think in new and challenging ways. The seminar discussions are fun and thought-provoking, and Prof. Kim is an amazing professor",
                "Definitely! If you are curious about North Korea, you won't regret taking this class!",
                "Yes. I was so excited to take this class because I had been interested in North Korea before but never got the chance to learn about it systematically in an academic setting. This class was very eye-opening and taught me a lot about the country. It is more focused on the ideology rather than international relations though.",
                "Yes, I absolutely loved this course and would recommend it to any other Yale student. This was my favorite course this semester and it made me look forward to Mondays.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of those kinds of courses that you'd do a disservice to yourself should you miss the opportunity to take it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially one who is open minded and open to having their preconceived notions of a volatile enemy nation challenged, and challenged frequently. You read a book a week for the most part, in addition to sometimes an entire movie. And every movie is top notch; some of the best movies I have ever seen were in this class. Korean films are phenomenal, as are the memoirs we read. Some of them were a little... iffy, like Kenneth Bae's, but I can understand its importance in the context of a class about religion. Aside from a couple of structural changes, this is a great class, and you'll learn a great deal. And Professor Kim is fantastic, and you'd be remiss not to take a class from him. I could listen to him speak all day. He's incredibly kind and adaptive to this new Zoom format. Ask him about how much he stans BTS."
