    "- field techniques for managing forests\r\n- research methods for developing ecosystem management plans",
    "I learned the principles of ecosystem delineation, constructing a nutrient budget with raw data, and forming a management plan for a real system. This course was great in applying the lecture topics to the field, and it will be very helpful in pursuing future fieldwork.",
    "I learned how to construct a carbon budget from field data, as well as techniques and methods through which to collect field data.",
    "This course provides opportunity to build research and data collection skills in an area of great interest to me. It was incredibly valuable, accessible, and positive."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- really incredible to do work that's actually out in the field. escaping campus every friday was so worth it\r\n- working with the instructors actually in the field was much more rewarding than in the classroom\r\n- group exhibitions at the end of the semester \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- 8 am arrival time on Fridays, especially coming all the way up to Marsh from the college. Not to mention one day where I had notified my TF that I was coming late, ubered all the way to Marsh to get there by 8:10, and watched the bus roll out without stopping for me. \r\n- little guidance on actual methods for sampling from the landscape. Instructors left a lot of our sampling decisions up to us as a group, which wasn't very useful having never taken an ecology or sampling design class.",
    "There are so many strengths for this course including: the positive atmosphere of working closely with a team, connecting the lecture to the field, and learning by experience\/mistakes. The instructors (Mark and Pete) were in the field with us and engaged in our work, so we got the opportunity to get to know them. The TAs are amazing resources and incredibly accessible. \r\n\r\nSometimes the assignments in this lab were not accompanied by enough information\/context. It was usually addressed in lecture a few weeks later, but more organization between the lecture\/lab components would have enhanced the lab experience by providing students early enough with the tools to delineate an ecosystem and form its budget.",
    "I honestly loved how the course was split between field work and other skills sessions in the lab and Center for Earth Observation. The work was much more enjoyable than I often gave credit.",
    "The lab thrived when it felt like we were really doing our own research on our sites, the times when it was iffy was when we were all together as one group."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend only taking Ecosystems and Landscapes if you plan to take the lab component as well. It really makes the class feel more coherent and useful having to do something tangible in the field.",
    "This was a great lab and necessary to take with the lecture! It helps connect the information in lecture to real ecosystems, and if you plan to do any fieldwork in the future then this course will help prepare you.",
    "There's no way around it: the time slot for this lab sucks. However, the work is actually pretty refreshing and low-stress. About five weeks into the semester the start time is pushed back to 9 am because you will no longer be going into the field and instead be spending easy days working in the lab or receiving guest lectures from people in the Isotope Lab or the Center for Earth Observation. You'll gain a lot of skills in this lab that you can't get from the lecture alone. Additionally, by taking the lab you'll get out of writing an individual final paper for the class--the group report you'll have to write is definitely the preferred way to go.",
    "Do the lab! Fun, not a lot of extra work, and a great primer for field work with excellent professors."
