However, I think the class could have been better organized so I learned more."

Reymundi is very kind and thoughtful, but pretty confusing in her expectations.",

We occasionally got lectures from the professor about content (all review from what we learned in past semesters), but other than that just filled out worksheets with partners. It wasn't that engaging and I didn't learn very much. Past semesters were a lot more interactive, with more full group discussions, projects, interactive activities, and so on. I rarely felt bored or disengaged, while this semester each class didn't feel very fruitful. I liked the court case at the end of the semester, that was fun, but each class was overall not too exciting, engaging, or educational."

                "The course is obviously a lot of work, but that's the nature of language courses. In terms of recommendations, I would focus more on the process of professor selection and tell the student that Professor Reymundi is a very relaxed, sweet professor but that at times the class could feel disorganized and it could be difficult to know what we needed to do or how we were doing more generally (given the lack of consistent feedback on the work we turn in). That being said, again, Professor Reymundi is more relaxed than the other Spanish profs I've had, so I would recommend her to a student if that's what they are looking for and if they're willing to tolerate occasional frustration.",

                "I would say that it is a helpful course if you are just looking to strengthen the Spanish you already learned, or if you want to talk more about Spanish culture and art, but overall I wouldn't recommend it that much if you don't have to take it."
