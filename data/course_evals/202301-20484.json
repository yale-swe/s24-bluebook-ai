                "Strengths: prof, partner engagement with this class. \r\nWeaknesses: my prof was fantastic but the overall course director was very scattered",
                "A strength of this course is that there was a lot of room for discussion and practicing Spanish-speaking, writing, and reading. A big weakness is that it's asking us to discuss complicated and touchy topics in a language we half-understand, so a lot of the time we would resort to finishing the rest of our thought in English or just repeating \"colonizacin es muy mal\" a lot.",
                "Strengths: High level of engagement thanks to several modalities of learning, frequent small homework assignments, and the necessity of active participation in class every day.\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it was clear that the syllabus was formulated by a course coordinator other than the instructor. For example, if there was an unreasonable due date or policy for an assignment, this could not be easily remedied; the instructor could not take full responsibility because she did not set the policy in the first place. Also, it was sometimes unclear what the overall goals of the thematic units were (e.g. it would have been helpful to do some cumulative recap from the \"brujas\" unit to come away with some more concrete ideas rather than just specific analyses of works of art, etc.).",
                "This course is strong in how it keeps consistent practice for learning the language throughout the semester. It can be improved by providing more opportunities to quiet students to practice their speaking.",
                "The course is well structured, although the material can feel a bit repetitive at times.",
                "Strengths: Profesora was very enthusiastic and supportive. Assignments were relevant and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "I really enjoyed being able to collaborate with different people. I think sometimes the topics that we were covering felt a little bit random, but I still enjoyed being able to cover a variety of subject areas. I also feel like it would have been nice to have a greater emphasis on grammar.",
                "IT was very rigid and stuck by the syllabus strictly.",
                "I think that the strengths are that it has a lot of collaboration, but one weakness is that the curriculum is very scattered and I didnt feel like we focused on improving our Spanish ability, just practicing what we already know how to do.",
                "Strengths: well structured, interesting topics, great environment to learn the language\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt very much like a high school class with a lot of busy work",
                "This course demands your constant investment in outside of class work which did exercise my ability to read, speak, and write in spanish. However, in class, I felt like I was less compelled to participate because some of the content was opinionated and I didnt always feel my opinion was welcome or that I even had the capacity to explain my nuanced opinion in my limited vocabulary.",
                "I thought that the content was very unique but varied a little too much.  If there were more related units, it would be easier to follow.  Overall, a great class!"

                "Yes, this is a great intermediate Spanish course, especially as a first-year who had taken a significant amount of Spanish before coming to Yale but was not quite confident enough to place into L5. Be aware that this course meets in-person four mornings a week, so do not sign up for the 9:25 slot if you have a hard time waking up early every morning.",
                "Yes, it is a great continuation in developing Spanish ability.",
