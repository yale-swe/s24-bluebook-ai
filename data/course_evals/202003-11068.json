                "The lectures didn't always relate to the readings or feel relevant when combined with the readings.",
                "This course had interesting readings and the best discussion was in small groups. Those were both strengths, and the willingness of all the instructors to engage with students was great. However, the full-class discussions were not as good as they could have been, because no one really contributed. The online discussion board was similarly not ideal; it worked successfully as a tool for forcing us to do readings but I don't think anyone really enjoyed making discussion posts and there wasn't much real back-and-forth on the forum. Perhaps these problems could be solved by decreasing the amount of comments necessary online but forcing students to defend their discussion posts in class. This would decrease the burden of posting online and ensure that the remaining comments are higher-effort while also creating a mechanism for student contributions.",
                "I liked the lecture with a small amount of breakout rooms. The ~20-30 minute discussions were a nice amount of time and I thought they were actually useful and not just a way to spend time",
                "I think the biggest strength of the course was that the readings were interesting and gave good insight into a lot of different aspects of wetland ecology, conservation, and management. I also think that because we were required to write a discussion post about the readings and reply to other posts every day before class, it forced people to actually read and engage with the texts. However, we were often expected to discuss the readings at length during class time, which resulted in one of two things. Either we were asked basic questions about the articles that felt pointless after having written a discussion post or we were told to have an open-ended conversation about the readings that usually fell flat because everyone had said what they already wanted to say on the discussion board. I personally would have appreciated more formal lectures because it felt like we exhausted the readings but there was still more to learn about the topics. A traditional lecture would have filled in those gaps in knowledge and also stimulated some more interesting discussion with new information.",

If you already have practical experience with wetlands in the field or extensive experience in certain types of wetlands, this class will feel repetitive at times. However, the material is interesting and the course is well-taught so anyone would benefit from taking this course.",

I think this course is particularly good for E&EB majors who want to learn some practical things about conservation\/management or EVST majors who want to learn about ecology as the scientific underpinning for conservation\/management\/regulation decisions. Anyone else broadly interested in taking a deep dive into an interesting ecosystem would also enjoy this class.",

Also, the TA's were a bit nit-picky with grading on the written p-sets. However, the TA's were really great, as well as the professor. As a science credit, definitely not a bad option.",
