We first learned about the history of data and human experimentation, then about the predominant policies, regulations, and ethics codes that encompass data governance in the modern world. Once having acquired that knowledge, we looked at current events, from Cyberwar to COVID-19 data management, and learned how to apply knowledge of current policies to real-world events. \r\nI learned so much about data governance from a technical, historical, and legal point of view, but more than that, I learned how to apply that knowledge in the context of current events.",

This course is designed to be fast-paced, real-world, and applicable to what we use, think, and do on a day to day. The assignments are structured to combine personal interests with course materials, which made them exciting to work on. \r\n\r\nI learned about the history of data regulation, US vs. EU data protection, COVID-19 data implications, biases in data algorithms, and more.",
                "Data governance is a field of growing importance, and it is absolutely necessary that statisticians and politicians, alike, have a working knowledge of this field. Professor Raymond is a remarkable teacher who genuinely cares about this space, and I can only hope that Yale S&DS\/PLSC\/GLBL begins to offer more courses like his.",
                "I learned about the historical precedents surrounding data governance efforts, as well as current measures. The emphasis was on the US context, but also Europe. There was a brief mention of data governance approaches in several Asian countries and African countries as they related to specific case studies (ex: the Liberian government during the Ebola outbreak). We looked at a variety of harms caused by targeting, exploitation, and exclusion related to data use. We discussed the data life cycle.",

                "I absolutely loved this course. The topics in the syllabus built on each other perfectly, and the professor did a terrific job of contextualizing course material into current events. Every week, we would look at the news, and tie the weekly topic to what was going on, and I really felt like the content I learned was extremely applicable to real life. I appreciated the midterm (not in the moment, but retrospectively), because it allowed me to test my knowledge of data regulations and their antecedents, and I loved being able to write about data privacy, and attempt to solve real-world issues through assignments for the course.\r\nNo weaknesses - I had a great time.",
                "This is a stellar course with a stellar professor. The material at the beginning was a bit of a slog (some dry history about international law, etc) but the way the course synthesized the content into a comprehensive framework for understanding data governance made it worth it.",
                "Strengths: Natty is fantastic and one of the best things about this course. The class also covers a lot of different but all interesting and highly relevant fields\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes reading assignments and assignment instructions would be posted relatively late",
                "Strengths: AMAZING Prof, committed TFs, wonderful class cohort, and engaging discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of at the moment, to be honest. The course was designed thoughtfully and really has been a highlight of my Yale experience. I recommend this course to any and every student, regardless of academic major or interest area, because of how applicable this course if to our real lives.",
                "Strengths: this course teaches about a new field and provides students with a foundational understanding of the harms of unchecked data practices.\r\nWeaknesses: solutions to these issues are approached through a nontechnical lens, and are mostly rooted in policy, which is fine and well for a Jackson course. However, this course should be supplemented by technical course offerings where students learn how to make ethical algorithms, unbiased classifiers , etc.",
                "Strengths: professor engagement, course material was FASCINATING and well-organized, everything built on top of each other and professor continuously brought back up old topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  a couple of times Natty seemed unprepared for class, and the 50 minutes felt like a waste on those days. This was especially true towards the end of the semester. Though everything was fascinating and overall the quality of lectures was high, it did fizzle out a bit towards the end.",
                "Strengths: The material itself is incredibly interesting and incredibly applicable. The syllabus is well-organized and structured to take students through historical precedents up to contemporary issues and data harms. The class covered a lot in a variety of different spheres and gave students freedom for the final paper. The professor and other members of the teaching staff were really flexible, especially recognizing all the specific challenges of this semester. It was clear that each and every one of them cared about students as individuals and as people with lives and responsibilities beyond the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignment expectations were not always clear or made available when they were planned to be. We definitely focused on the US and European contexts. It would be interesting to learn more about how other countries approach data governance (we got a little bit of this when looking at COVID-19 and Ebola virus tracking, but it was brief).",
                "The subject matter is fascinating, and I greatly enjoyed the mix of papers and exam assessments. The workload was extremely reasonable and well explained. I also thought section was great.\r\n\r\nAt times, lecture felt a bit vague, off-topic, and unstructured. Personally, I would find more structured lectures, perhaps with slides of images or text, to be helpful.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, for a lecture course, I was surprised by how much discussion took place during class. I had expected section to be discussion and class to be lectures. As a result, I would have preferred more lecture content, rather than discussion, during class (at times, it felt that discussions brought our class off-topic)."

They were also flexible with deadlines and technological failures (such as with the Midterm exam).",

In fact, I think more students should be required or encouraged to take a course like this at Yale, because it teaches you the fundamental knowledge about data rights, ethics, and harms that are essential for anyone looking to go into cyber, data science, experimentation, or research in general. \r\nThis has been my favorite course at Yale because of the teaching, the knowledge I'm taking away from it, and the general experience that pushed me to learn more about human rights, data rights and data governance as a whole.",

                "YES. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are reading this and thinking about taking it, I strongly recommend doing so. The course has changed some of my primary interests, by adding in a lens of data protection and data governance into what I think about\/ research\/ want to learn, in the future. Learning from Prof Raymond is also a HUGE reason to take this course, because he is super supportive and empowering as a Prof. This is a great course to take and definitely will be one I continue to recommend to other students.",
                "Absolutely recommend this class, ESPECIALLY if youre a CPSC\/S&DS major. Both of these majors wrongfully lack an ethics requirement, and this class will help you understand why one is needed. \r\nData governance is a field of growing importance, and it is absolutely necessary that statisticians and politicians, alike, have a working knowledge of this field. Professor Raymond is a remarkable teacher who genuinely cares about this space. Hes a wonderful person to work with, cares about his students, and really challenges you to think in new ways. \r\nThis course has also fundamentally shifted my outlook\/career interests in a way that few other classes have; 10\/10 take this course.",
                "Yes, I would. First of all, Natty is a fantastic lecturer. He is highly engaging and down to earth, two qualities that are great for facilitating discussion, even on an online format. I found the structure of the course to follow a logical sequence that allowed for Natty to re-incorporate older material into new topics. It was a fantastic way to learn about data governance...honestly I think it has been the best class so far at Yale for naturally learning material given how interesting it was and how reinforcing the structure of the course was. Maybe THE best class I've taken at Yale in that regard.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The material in the class is essential for anyone working with data in any capacity (so pretty much everyone!). Our rendition had a nice mix of students from a variety of disciplines, ranging from computer science to political science. The syllabus is well-structured to give students an understanding of the historical precedents and current efforts in data governance. We looked at examples of data regulations, harms, and documents from spheres including cyber warfare, privacy law, healthcare, 2016 US Presidential Election, COVID-19 tracking and more. Additionally, you are given almost complete freedom for your final paper to explore a specific problem relating to data governance. In general, the readings were pretty interesting and informed class discussion and lectures. Also take advantage of opportunities to meet with the teaching staff, many of whom had really interesting backgrounds and perspectives on lecture material! Professor Raymond knows his stuff and really led lectures with gusto (and plenty of metaphors).",
                "Yes, this is a (somewhat hidden?) gem! You get out of this course what you put into it - there's technically not a lot of work outside the midterm and final essay but unless you wanna be a little embarrassed in class, you'll end up doing most of the readings and getting deep into the material.  Which means you'll learn a heck ton because it's pretty much all interesting and (as we often discussed in class) painfully relevant to our current world and lives.  Take this class!!!",
                "Yes! Fascinating and topical course. Professor Raymond is an approachable and reasonable teacher, and he has a lot of experience in the field.",
                "Yes  it covers important content in understanding the digital age and how that intersects with human rights and vulnerable populations. Prof. Raymond does a really good job in making you rethink your existing understanding of political and legal frameworks."
