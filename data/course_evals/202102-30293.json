                "Strengths: Plenty of resources - pre-recorded videos + lecture notes - to supplement the lectures. Both Professor Loewenberg and Rostacia, TA, were easy to approach to ask for further clarifications. The textbook was clear and informative and the course material closely followed it. Problem sets were mostly directly from the textbook, which again were a helpful mix of theoretical/applied questions - plenty of help with them in Recitation.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures mostly clear, but Professor Loewenberg sometimes will go back and forth with the material which can be confusing. However, If you missed something, just ask and/or reference with the same content in the textbook.",

                "If you're considering taking this over the summer for whatever reason, I do encourage yo to do so, especially with Professor Loewenberg. The content goes fast but it's not overwhelming. It's manageable even taking 2 courses in a session, depending on how much time the 2nd course requires. You don't necessarily need to do much more outside what Professor Loewenberg provides - psets and exams closely follow his lectures, however I recommend also going through the same sections in the textbook as there is some better context and helpful examples provided.",
