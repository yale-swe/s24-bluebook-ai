I learned a lot about the current topics of debate in this field as well as some different ways of resolving these debates. What was super interesting about this class was that these questions were also analyzed through a psychological lens. This means we read a lot of psychological literature, something I was less familiar with and I found super interesting. I also learned how to perform some basic psychological research via questionnaire on the final project, something I hadnt done before."
