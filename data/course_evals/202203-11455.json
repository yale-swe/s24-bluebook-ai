                "I gained more fluency in reading, writing, speaking and listening in Modern Standard Arabic, especially with respect to authentic texts and video. I also got to have a long-awaited introduction to the case system of MSA, which was exciting, and worked through the vocabulary, grammar and cultural content of Al-Kitaab Volume 2, Edition 3, Units 1-5.",
                "I learned far more vocabulary and grammar than I knew previously.",
                "The case endings",
                "My reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension skills in Arabic greatly improved. I learned a lot of greeting and informal things as well, in addition to information and history about Arabic and Arab culture.",

            "comments": [
                "Very rapid pace, homework and expectations often unclear.",
                "Strengths: Work levels were very manageable and the schedule was flexible. I feel like it wasn't rigidly structured, but I mostly improved my Arabic through writing and debate with peers. I genuinely went into the class not really understanding anything Prof. Elbousty said on Day 1 and now I am a much stronger conversationalist than I was at the end of L1/L2.\r\nWeaknesses: At times it was a bit difficult to keep track of the topics.",
                "I think the strength of this course was our in-class time, which Prof. Elbousty always used really well to make us actively engage with Arabic in ways that stretched us and pushed us. I think the course could have actually benefited from more homework, from having the order of homework assignment correspond to the order of drills in the textbook, and from doing the earlier bits of grammar a little more explicitly in class.",
                "Strengths: Relaxed environment, every day in class was different (debates in arabic, analyzing songs, going over homeworks)\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Prof Elbousty is very patient with students and goes the extra mile to help us understand difficult concepts. class can be improved by using a different textbook and practice tests.",
                "This course's strength was in its structure: Jonas gave us lots of freedom and it helped us learn, but used more strict lessons when necessary, like when teaching us grammar. As for the weaknesses, the only real thing I can think of is that a lot of our oral skills weren't tested a lot-- though we practiced them a lot with the in class exercised.",
                "Strengths: The professor prioritized practicing articulating our thoughts rather than just checking over assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred doing a lot more reading exercises in which we read long excerpts and translated them. Additionally, perhaps also selecting more videos for us to watch, translate, and, in addition to filling in the blanks, write about it.\r\n\r\nI know the weaknesses section is longer than the strengths section but that should be no indication of my review of the class. The class was very well taught, and I greatly enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: constantly stimulating and interesting; taught us to be creative and constantly on it in order to do well in class; I really enjoyed having things like debates in class; Professor Elbousty cares very deeply about each students success and is very personable and encouraging, and always happy to stay after class or meet to explain things students dont understand\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could have been more organized, so we knew what to expect when the syllabus changed; tests and quizzes often included vocabulary we didnt know and had never learned, which made it hard to grasp concepts in reading excerpts though I understand part of these issues was that it was a difficult semester for the professor with health issues"

I think that, by the end of this course, you will have a much more solidified grasp of your Arabic and some solid skills in each of the four classical language skills, compared to if you stop at L2.",
                "yes, beacuse you learn important info needed for how to read and write in Arabic.",
                "I absolutely would, especially with Prof. Jonas!! He made every class super fun and interesting, and I learned a lot with him as the professor. He really helped make Arabic fun, and taught us a lot despite a bit of a crazy semester.",
                "Yes. If they wanted to really learn Arabic, I would recommend supplementing what they learn with outside practice in the form of reading and watching videos, but so would their professors.",
                "Definitely. I learned so much about the language in a very uplifting environment, and I think Im prepared for the next level of Arabic"
