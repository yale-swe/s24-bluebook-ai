                "Dr. Datye is not a good professor. He makes fun of students and criticizes other professors during class and lab. I didn't learn anything from the lecture slides because they were poorly made and poorly explained. Lab groups are assigned.",
                "I enjoy the fact that all of the labs are connected by the fact that the same samples and specimens are examined in each lab. This makes it easy to compare different techniques that give data for the same quantity as well as confirm known behaviors of the material with multiple tests across multiple labs. Some places I could see the course improving is in getting better testing equipment. One example would be improved modulations on the Instron machine, we had to use a frankly incompetent friction testing setup that gave completely unusable data. It could also be useful to get access to machines capable of forging. In my final project lab for the class, I had the idea to research how Katanas use the technique of folding the hot steel to strain harden a material however Yale does not have any facilities to do high-temperature testing of alloys and metals. Thus my research was limited by Yale's low range testing capabilities.",
