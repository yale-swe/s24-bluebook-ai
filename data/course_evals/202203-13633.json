The required readings were easy to find, but the powerpoint labels were sometimes confusing without a summative title of the content contained within them for studying. \r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the flexibility of the syllabus, I felt that it was too flexible at times, which resulted in my spending too much time on one assignment and not enough on another, on more than one occasion. \r\n\r\nI loved each of the guest speakers, but felt that what we learned about on those days didn't necessarily line up with the content that we were currently engaging with in in the course material."
