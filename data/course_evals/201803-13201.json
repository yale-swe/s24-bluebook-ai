    "This class helped me a lot with reading scientific literature. Most STEM classes we take are heavily based on PSets and textbooks so it was awesome to dive into learning how to read research, and focusing on research techniques during the lectures.",
    "probably none, it's a gut engineering elective",
    "A thorough understanding of the relevance of, physics behind, characterization techniques for, and applications of nanotechnology.",
    "Introduction to basic nanomaterials, their practical fabrication and properties, and nanoscale characterization techniques",
    "Different types of nano materials",
    "I learned all about nanotech (in a both a broad  & deep sense) and a little about scientific writing, reading, & presenting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Since there was only one midterm, our progress wasn't really checked throughout the semester. Maybe instead there should just be the term paper and small quizzes spaced out throughout the semester.",
    "Midterm was wildly different from problem sets and what we did in lecture, so near impossible to prepare",
    "Strengths: very focused on modern advances, with lots of reading research papers.\r\nNegatives: grading was seemingly arbitrary. On essays and presentations, large chunks of points were removed for things that werent true (for example, not having works cited when they were while others didnt lose points for not having them)",
    "strengths: clear notes, carefully designed assignments, willingness to answer questions and the occasional jokes that Judy has a sound reputation for.\r\nweaknesses: could feel a little disconnected with their purpose when topics were stretched across several weeks. You forgot why you were here and how you could ever find these bullet points useful.",
    "I felt the course as a whole was interesting and overall well-taught.  Lecture was generally engaging and well-organized, and I enjoyed class time.  Sometimes I did feel it could get a bit granular and focus too much on nitty-gritty details without taking a step back to look at practical examples, but this wasn't too often.  Although I enjoyed writing the final paper, I will say that the lack of assessments after the midterm dramatically decreased class investment in lecture.",
    "More numerical psets",
    "Well organized presentations and usually engaging lectures, but sometimes their were large jumps or gaps in the material.",
    "This class was very much a survey class so you got out of it what you put into it. A lot of information kind of gets thrown at you and it is not always clear what you are expected to learn. It's very interesting but you could also get by without learning much if you wanted to. The presentation and final paper are probably when I learned the most."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another engineering student looking for an engineering elective. This was a really cool class on nanotechnology and the workload wasn't as bad as some other electives, so it's definitely one to shop.",
    "only if you need another engineering elective, it's extremely boring regardless",
    "Yes.",
    "A great elective for engineering students! Workload was definitely manageable, and Judy was kind, approachable yet no less knowledgeable on the subject matter.",
    "If you are interested in materials science or nanomaterials, this is a great way to get introduced to a broad overview of the field and learn some practical techniques along the way.",
    "If you suspect any interest whatsoever in nanotechnology or nano-materials, or even the connection of size\/shape to physical property then this is a great class to take!"
