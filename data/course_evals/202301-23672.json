I also loved the TalkAbroad component where we got to converse with native speakers (although there was a fee for this platform even though it's required for your grade.) Professor Sybil is incredible and really cares about Spanish and native heritage students. She gives great personalized feedback on all homework assignments that really helps you learn where you fall short with grammar and vocab. She's also a lenient grader and very understanding when it comes to absences and extensions. The weaknesses of this course are sometimes redundant homework assignments and unclear rubrics for assignments, plus having to write a reflection for things that seem a bit self-explanatory.",
