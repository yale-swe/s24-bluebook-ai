    "This course is a broad survey of mathematical models gathered under the header of \"complexity\". We cover bifurcations, chaos theory, strange attractor, Kuramoto synchronization models, fractal structures, basic earthquake models, self-organized criticality, and then move on to study a number of inverse problem techniques such as linear algebraic regression and markov chain monte carlo.",
    "This course is a survey of nonlinear analysis and numerical methods. We deal with \"complex systems,\" which is a catchall phrase to encompass systems which cannot be modeled and solved using straightforward mathematical techniques. The course makes you familiar with scientific computing tools and the mathematics behind them. It makes one more confident in linear algebra and differential equations. The course picks up where linear algebra and differential equations end, incorporating numerical methods, algorithms, differential equation bifurcations, chaos,  synchronization, coupled and nonlinear systems of equations, cellular automata, Markov chains, singular value decompositions and linear inverse theory, Monte Carlo tools, procedures to solve nonlinear inverse problems, spectral analysis, and regression filters.",
    "Learned about complex systems, and how to analyze them in both the forward and reverse problem situations. Fairly consistent with the syllabus",
    "This class is mainly broken up into two parts: how to understand the behavior of a system given its governing equations, and how to determine the equations of a system given its behavior. The first part is linear stability analysis, chaos, and some cellular automata. The second part is mostly statistics and probability, involving things like regression and singular value decomposition.",
    "An interesting introduction to complex systems. Some of the topics we covered: 1d-3d linear and non linear systems, numerical integration, cellular automata, inverse problems...",
    "Most prominently, I learned how to use Matlab. The course content, however, was a bit all over the board, which made it difficult to understand what we were learning each day. Two major topics were nonlinear systems and discrete maps.",
    "I gained understanding for chaotic and complex systems, and learned techniques for creating mathematical models of real-world data.",
    "General knowledge of linear and nonlinear systems, models of complex systems, power laws, etc.",
    "In short, I learned how to qualitatively analyze -- as well as construct and appropriately apply-- a variety of complex systems.\r\n\r\nI improved my ability to use linear algebra and other statistical\/mathematical methods to fit predictive systems to data, to evaluate said systems fit, and I began to learn how  to choose a particular system from an array of possible (continuous) systems using non-linear inverse theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was incredibly disorganized, to the point where each week felt like a different class. In addition, the lectures were not useful for the homework or exams, which presumed different skills than were presented in class or in the textbook. The expectations for this course must be elaborated on in order for it to be improved, as otherwise we were left guessing at what material we had to know.",
    "I think the material is quite interesting. I also found the problem sets (which are coding psets where you implement the methods or models learned in class) were quite enjoyable and not cumbersome. However, I can't say that I found the instruction clear. We would often talk about quite complicated mathematical ideas without the corresponding mathematics, which left me a bit lost. The exams were also quite confusing, as it sometimes felt like the material on the exam were not things that were emphasized during the course. I would recommend that the instructor think more about what the desired learning outcomes for the students are from this class, make those clear to the students, and then find ways to measure for those.\r\n\r\nFor me personally, I think the course could also have benefitted from more rigorous mathematical expositions of the material. I think I struggled to grasp the intuition of some concepts (such as strange attractors) with the level of math we covered them.",
    "The course is a survey of a variety of topics. This is a double-edged sword: While at times it lacks a coherent structure, the breadth and flexibility is a clear strength. In the future, I would reconsider the organization of the course materials, and clarify the transitions from one section of the material to the next. Altogether, I would expand and add more detail to the syllabus. The wide variety of materials is a great thing. I genuinely had fun doing the problem sets; they make you proficient in implementing a variety of problem solutions. This course fills a gap in Yale College's course offerings. Students should just note ahead of time that it is a sampling (no pun intended) of topics from different subject areas that complement other courses, such as algorithms, differential equations, and linear algebra.",
    "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and on the side, I was fascinated by my own research into the subject.\r\nWeaknesses: In most instances, it was difficult to follow the lectures, especially when it came to the notes on the board. I found that it was always necessary to consult my suitemates (who had prior experience in statistics) to explain concepts. In many cases, topics were left unaddressed as prior knowledge, even when members of the class did not have that prior knowledge.",
    "This is a solid course with a reasonable amount of work and not too difficult material.",
    "The topics covered are interesting and come from a variety of fields, the first half of the course is also accompanied by a great textbook. I also thought the psets were good, enforced the material well and weren't insanely time consuming.",
    "The homework assignments were good. The lectures were hard to follow, and I didn't understand the course trajectory week to week. The exams felt very out of place - they tested a random assortment of material in a very conceptual way, which is not the approach the lectures or homework took.",
    "Although the first half of the course was excellent, I felt that the second half focused a bit too much on the theory and the abstract algebra. Also, the fact that the problem sets were due every one-and-a-half weeks made it difficult to come up with a consistent schedule, and overall made the homework feel strangely disconnected from the lectures.",
    "The material is really interesting but was presented in a pretty disjointed way. It felt like each lecture was all over the place and random and not well connected to previous material. Also, the material wasn't presented at any depth, yet we were expected to understand it in detail, which was frustrating. I'm glad I got exposed to the really cool material though, and the homeworks were reasonable in general although the exams less so. I loved the project option for final assessment though.",
    "Complex systems are systems with many degrees of freedom that exhibit, by the repeated application of simple rules, emergent behavior not encoded in the rules themselves Often times, complex systems (in the form of cellular automata, algorithms, or systems of differential equations) form the backbone of the models which are used to evaluate an ever-increasing array of phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis course does an excellent job of doing what it says it will do -- provide an overview, understanding, and intuition for those systems. If one approaches it as what it is -- a survey of the various types of complex systems and ways to fit those systems to given situations -- they will enjoy the course.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of this course are that Professor Korenaga has a passion for the subject (as a geophysicist, applying complex systems is the majority of what he does) and it shows in this class. Hes knowledgeable about both the history and recent developments of this relatively new field, and does a (mostly) great job of conveying the mechanism and excitement of these powerful, important, and interesting techniques. His exams (though difficult to me) seemed fair and interesting, and the overall structure of the class -- with interesting seven interesting (mostly matlab) problem sets, a midterm, and an optional both\/either final exam or final project was a fairly good set-up for facilitating students learning. As this course is a survey, models and statistical methods which are important to the field of complex systems (and which the class lacks time to cover) are often mentioned but not expanded, and learning the details of those models are left to depend on students interests and free time.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course mainly rest in Professor Korenagas lectures. He had taught the class at least four times before this Spring (2019) but at times he still ran almost ten minutes beyond the scheduled end of the lecture, and he did not have a set plan for the things which he would like to cover. This led us to spending extra time on some things, like non-linear inverse theory and Baysian v. Frequentist Statistics (which was good) while totally neglecting some things which he said we would cover, like neural networks (which was bad, though given the current spotlight on neural networks I honestly appreciated the increased focus on applying statistical methods to models and data). Professor Korenagas lectures were, for the most part, fairly clear and were often quite interesting (walking in on a running sandpile model and sitting down to a lecture on self-organized criticality stands out) but could, at points, have been slightly better organized and less driven by tangents."

   "comments": [
    "No, it was far less interesting, useful, or approachable than it seemed at first. Lectures were far too theoretical, and examples of what we were tasked to do were hard to find in the textbook or in the literature. There is little to no feedback provided, and it seems as if the professor had no desire to see us succeed. Just take physics instead.",
    "I don't think I would unless Professor Korenaga decides to put more effort into his teaching. He did not seem to be too concerned about whether students really understood the material he was teaching, and was fine putting questions on the exams that he hadn't really discussed how we solve or think about. For example, one question asked us to find the order of a numerical method, which he had only mentioned how to do in passing during the course, or perhaps not even.",
    "Yes, definitely, if that student is interested in numerical methods, differential equations, and linear algebra. This course presents unique and useful applications for concepts in each of those fields. It extends and complements your existing knowledge. Note that students should have a good preparation in the subjects indicated on the syllabus. Students should also be proficient coders (Python or Matlab preferred languages, others acceptable).",
    "Only if you have prior experience in statistics, linear algebra, differential equations, and nonlinear systems.",
    "I would recommend this course to a subject looking to learn some neat things about modeling with statistics and understanding systems given by differential equations.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the material. The course requires a but of self study as the exams are fairly challenging so I would only take it if you feel like you wouldn't mind spending a bit of time with this material.",
    "No. While the syllabus of this course sounds quite interesting, the execution is poor and frustrating. The professor has little respect for Yale college rules (attempting to move a final exam, assigning a term paper due after the end of the semester, and attempting to rectify everyone's bad grades by offering extra credit that was worth way too much).",
    "This course is okay but honestly you'd probably be better served to just read Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos by Strogatz instead.",
    "Yes this is a good course to grow and challenge your understanding of complex systems. While the material can be heavy at times, the problem sets are well organized to help you understand the material that you are currently learning. As for the tests, they are hard, however Prof. Korenaga does a good job at offering opportunities to augment your grade in case of catastrophic exam grades, such as doing a term paper on complex systems; this both allows for further learning and takes some of the stress away from his more rigorous exams. To my understanding, this is the first semester that there were exams in this class, so I'm not sure what he will do in the future, however if you are excited about learning about Chaos, Complex Systems, and how they are applied to real research I would definitely recommend this classput in the work and you'll do well.",
    "If the student has an interest in modeling, a fairly good background in differential equations and linear algebra, and enjoys basic programming (python or matlab), yes. If not, they should either brush-up on those two mathematical fields or take a more basic course in modeling."
