                "Advanced my proficiency in Chinese reading, writing, listening, and especially speaking. This course definitely pushes you to practice speaking even if you don't feel comfortable with it, and you are writing much longer essays, sometimes on pretty complex topics. The material from the textbook, in comparison, to CHNS 150, felt more relevant, so I found myself learning a lot more vocabulary that I felt like I would actually use when speaking Chinese."

            "comments": [
                "A great strength of this course is the emphasis placed on listening and speaking, both inside and outside of class. All the aspects of the course are well-tuned, and I thought it was very helpful to have the listening material from the textbook to understand the dialogues better after the first listen. Based on the tradition, I believe it is still important to be able to handwrite characters, and I thought the phrases used for character learning were very beneficial for understanding collocation. However, given the existence of pinyin-based typing, I think being able to recognize characters, pronounce characters, and understand the system of Chinese characters is much more important. I think the character quizzes requiring memorizing and handwriting characters could be reduced significantly. It might be useful to turn character quizzes into recognition and explanation. I envision this as a quiz where beforehand, students study the origin of the characters (I've done this on my own using Wiktionary, which is comprehensive and easy to use) and their components. For the quiz, students provide the pinyin for the characters in a phrase, and for select characters with common radicals and pronunciation components, students explain the character: which parts provide which pronunciations, which parts provide which meanings. I believe this will help students to recognize the characters we learn in the long run and to understand the system of characters in general.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized. also the small class size is very helpful (my class was in the early morning class time). Having to learn to write the same characters repeatedly for quizzes over the course of the semester helped cement them in my brain.\r\nWeaknesses: not much!\r\nImprovement: I do wish that we would be able to see the correct answers to the grammar questions on Canvas after we finish the \"grammar quiz\" homework - when I finished those and saw that I got one wrong, I couldn't see what the correct answer was, so I wasn't able to learn from my mistake.",
                "I think the greatest strength is Chan Laoshi! She is literally the best! She is so kind and understanding to students, while always challenging them in the classroom to make sure they are constantly pushing themselves and improving. Another strength is the way the class is structured. It is very organized and set up in a way so that it is fast-paced but still allows for teaching and review of each lesson."
