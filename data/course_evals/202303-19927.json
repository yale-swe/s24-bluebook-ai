                "Professor Skillings is amazing, definitely take it with her if you can!!! The whole course is well-organized but also flexible. Prof. Skillings was able to adjust the schedule when we needed more time on assignments. We were given many prompts to choose from for each assignment, which I appreciated. I also loved having the guest speakers. No weaknesses.",
                "The course is well-structured and very enjoyable.",
                "The course had a lot of strengths. You can develop your writing with clear feedback and consistent assignments. You read a lot of great texts in various genres. It's easy to enjoy the readings and not consider them as 'work'. It is fun and engaging! The only weakness is that there are many genres to cover in a short time so you don't go into too much depth in each one. But that's expected and communicated!",

                "Everything in this class was very engaging and fun for me. I would say though, we have to put all of our work together and submit a final portfolio at the end, but we never get feedback on it (even though we open up a lot about our confidential, private journey!). Having feedback in our final portfolio would be very nice:)"

The readings for this class were great- I always looked forward to doing the readings for this class. The assignments were all fun to do, if you like writing you would definitely enjoy all of the homework. The workshops were also a great way to learn about other people's writing styles and receive feedback on my own.",
                "yes! if you are interested in writing, this was such a fun class to explore different types of creative writing.",
                "Yes!! If you have any interest in creative writing, take it, especially with Emily Skillings. I was more worried about the drama/fiction sections since I hadn't really written much drama/fiction before, but I found it so much easier than I thought. The prompts, guest speakers, and readings for each unit made the class engaging and interesting.",
                "I would! I had a wonderful time picking up new skills and exploring creative pursuits!",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in strengthening your creative writing and you have the chance to take this class, take it. No matter your major.",
                "Absolutely! While the course itself is designed well, take it with Emily Skillings, if you can! She's a really kind and thoughtful professor who gives great feedback and fosters a friendly class environment. As someone who is usually shy and hesitant to speak in class, I found myself wanting to actively participate because the material was so exciting to discuss. I appreciated that we were given the opportunity to write in a bunch of styles and genres, and that experimentation and risk-taking were encouraged. It was also nice to leave the course with a strong portfolio of pieces from each unit that I would be excited to have my peers read.",
                "If you want an easy writing credit, sure. It was difficult for me to engage with this course, largely due to the instruction (or lack thereof), and I would not be so quick to recommend the experience."
