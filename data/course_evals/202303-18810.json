                "There are few strengths, perhaps only in the merit of the material as the foundational logic upon which all math is built. The professor provides no lecture notes, etc. Class could be cancelled less often.",
                "Strengths: material is kind of interesting and the psets are honestly fun. Weaknesses: lectures moved too fast and (this is hopefully unique to my semester) the course fell off after thanksgiving break. We did not have a pset on content after October. This made studying for the final stressful and there was generally a lot of confusion about what was going on both in terms of content and logistical matters like psets and grading.",
                "Strengths: None.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Smart. Professor Smart is shockingly incompetent and transgressed all expectations that a student might have regarding the quality of instruction. Throughout the course, when he actually came to class and taught, he would make frequent--what he termed \"catastrophic\" errors in class. Due to his lack of preparation for each lecture, these errors would occur in every lecture. This most frequently occurred when the notes that he prepared for his lectures at the last minute contained a small gap in the proofs logical reasoning, which he would be unable to supply ad hoc. He would ask, \"Does anyone know what is going wrong here?\" to which a student would genuinely reply with a helpful answer. He would then embarrassingly reply, \"No, it's actually because I'm such an idiot.\" It was not uncommon to have these errors waste approximately 30 minutes of our class with errors going unresolved and proofs unproven--even into the next lecture. The incoherency of the lectures made learning difficult. \r\nAs a student, I might've been willing to countenance that if Professor Smart didn't just stop coming to class. Prior to Thanksgiving break, Professor Smart canceled class at the last minute ~4 times. He had a substitute one of those times, but she couldn't read the notes that he had only a little while before the lecture sent her. After Thanksgiving break, Professor Smart never returned to class. He had the sub teach 1-2 times, but his notes were riven with errors and unusable. The sub did her best to come up with solutions to the proofs in the moment. He then canceled class again, and held the final class on Zoom. \r\nProfessor Smart shirked his other responsibilities, too. He never returned our second midterms that we took at the beginning of November, and he never assigned PSETs after the 6th PSET, which was due Nov. 2. When we asked him for problems for our final exam on the Monday before lecture, he finally provided an optional PSET 7 on the last day of reading period. This is consistent with the our first Midterm; after asking for information for over a week, he finally gave us information about the exam on the Monday before our Wednesday exam. He was also generally unresponsive to emails.\r\nProfessor Smart is a reminder that as difficult as it is to become a Yale professor, and despite the care and consideration for each faculty hiring decision and the safeguards in place, mistakes are sometimes made.",
                "The course content is interesting. The Halmos textbook makes things seem less overwhelming (since it is shorter), but it is a worse book in my opinon compared to Enderton. I had to go read Enderton (especially on the natural numbers) for a more complete understanding of what was glossed over in Halmos. I'd recommend returning to Enderton. The class started out alright but really went downhill the second half of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Prof Smart is very nice and understanding, and overall a good lecturer. The homework was fun and not daunting like a lot of other math hw is.\r\nWeaknesses: We were pretty behind by the end of the semester, and I think we missed out on some of the coolest material of the course. Prof Smart was sick/out a bunch, which contributed. We didn't have any psets after midterm 2, and we didn't get midterm 2 grades back before the final, both of which made studying for the final somewhat stressful.",
                "As a lecturer, Prof Smart delivers the topi well and follows the textbook closely.\r\n\r\nOffice hours seemed disorganized from a student and instructor perspective. Multiple times, Ive caught myself waiting for someone to show up for the scheduled office hours only to leave when no one arrives.",
                "The content is interesting, but the course got extremely poorly organized towards the end of the semester. I'm not sure if the instructor had some urgent health/family matters (which could have made the situation more understandable), but he cancelled class once or twice without giving us any explanations. For other two classes, he asked someone else to sub for him on the same day as the class (so they had no time to prepare, which made the content unnecessarily confusing). We also stopped getting any pset assignments after the second midterm (maybe there weren't that many set theory problems to practice with, but I would appreciate at least getting an email explaining the situation). Plus, the psets grade were released extremely slowly and we didn't get our second midterm grade back even after the final exam. Thankfully, there is an optional project that could replace 1/2 of the final exam, which was not optional for me at all because I got so lost towards the end of the class. To be fair, Professor Smart is really helpful and patient in office hours and did a good job in lectures in the first half of the semester, but I would appreciate more communication between us if there are reasons that prevent him from doing so towards the end (And we would have understood! But we never knew what happened.).",
                "Lectures covered core concepts and at the beginning of the course, the problem sets helped the understanding of the concepts. However, I wish the problem sets could be offered more.",
                "More regular assessment because it was extremely difficult to study for the final given there were no problem sets past the second midterm. Also he did not release grades for the assignments very quickly so i never knew how well i was doing in the class. There were also constant typos in the problem sets that were only noticed by the ULA, not the professor himself. While Prof Smart is very good at explaining material, the course was just not very well organized."

                "Probably not, unless you need it for your major; if you do take it with a different professor and TA. By the last week of school, the grades for problem sets 4, 5, and 6 (4 had been due the 4th week of school) still had not been released. The grades for our second midterm (from November 8th) are still not released as of the END of exam period. Many students asked for them (especially before the Credit/D/Fail deadline) but the Professor didn't even respond to their emails. There was not a single problem set assigned after the second midterm and so the content barely featured on the exam. The TA also was really not great -- her answers felt like bare minimum responses to questions, and she almost never took effort to explain a problem more fully (i.e., by going up on a board) in the way my best TAs have. The course content is reasonably interesting and the assessment were pretty fair -- but the professor has an attitude of not giving answer keys because he thinks you need to know when something is right for yourself.",
