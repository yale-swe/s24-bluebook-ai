                "I learned tips and techniques for the process of pitching a story, interviewing subjects, and writing a piece. I also learned more about other facets of the journalism world, such as the business model.",
                "Although I had prior journalism experience, I had never been taught any hard journalism skills outside of the newsroom. This class concretely taught me techniques for interviewing, sourcing, when to give anonymity, etc, and even just this semester I've found myself frequently employing the techniques in my journalism work outside of class. This class definitely made me a better journalist!",
                "This course is a practical guide on how to be a good journalist. You walk through every step of the process from ideation to interviewing and writing. Brill takes you one step further and makes you examine the economic model of journalism. I am a more confident writer, editor, and interviewer after this class. 10/10 would recommend that anyone interested in journalism, regardless of your involvement in the Yale journalism scene, should apply to this class.",
                "I certainly developed my writing skills as a journalist and refined my understanding of the journalism industry.",
                "I gained a more thorough and practical understanding of the do's and don't's of journalism -- from the best ways to structure articles to how to ethically go about reporting an investigative piece. Moreover, the readings provided me with a wide variety of perspectives not just on how to do journalism, but on the current state of the journalism industry.",
                "I learned a lot about journalistic writing and the business of journalism. I learned especially that journalists should be surrogates.",
                "I knew I wanted to be a journalist, but, before this class, I never fully understood the scope, meaning, and implications of that job. This class provided me with both a wide understanding of all aspects of the journalism industry--from the reporting to business side, from past to future, but also a glimpse into the heart of the industry--and made me examine the values, import, and significance of what being a journalist means and how I want to conduct myself as one in the future.",
                "Interview strategies, how to write an effective lede, etc., but most concisely summarized as how to be a good journalist!",
                "I learned about accountability reporting and reporting with documents/sources that don't want to talk to you. I think that a lot of my learning happened during the reporting process outside of the classroom.",
                "I learned how to be a more conscientious reader and writer of journalism. I learned about the business of journalism and received helpful career advice. I learned to own my words while also being aware that the things I write can have a real impact on people's lives."

            "comments": [
                "The course is a great way to practice and sharpen writing skills through the multiple, long-form assignments. I appreciated the outside of class feedback opportunities as well as all of the in-class work learning about journalism and how actually works in the real world, as well as all of time spent critiquing recent articles.",
                "Strengths -- class is exceedingly well organized (Brill has taught it for many years and it has clear he has crafted an amazing syllabus,) the readings are interesting and helpful, the skills are applicable to journalism outside of class, and the projects are enjoyable!\r\nWeaknesses -- Prof. Brill clearly has his favorites. That's a two-way street  if he thinks you have what it takes to be a journalist, he will do whatever it takes to mentor you and help you get a job. But if he thinks you are not cut out for the work, he will be very transparent about it, which I know was off-putting for some. I personally think that Prof. Brill is extremely warm and cares deeply about his students, but it is worth being prepared for some harsh feedback going in.",
                "Strengths: practical skills of journalism, class was always interesting and entertaining, readings aren't too heavy and are worthwhile pieces of writing, projects are enjoyable and let you follow your passions.\r\nWeakness: this was an awesome class, so I hesitate to even put anything here. Brill is a little chaotic, though most of us grew to love his chaos. He'll email you Saturday night telling you to read an assigned piece in a different way. But I don't mind that. I would've appreciated a little more guidance on the profile assignment -- it felt a little like he was looking for a specific, biographical piece that he didn't fully explain in class or in the syllabus.",
                "I enjoyed all the speakers that Professor Brill invited to this class because they were inspiring and contributed immensely to my understanding of journalism as a career.",
                "The strengths of this course revolve around the fact that you are sitting in a room with 10-15 other students who really, really care about journalism. Many of the students want to be journalists, and some don't, but everyone seems to care. Brill brings a lot of experience to the seminar, which allows him to share crazy stories and helpful insights to all the material we discuss. You should know that while the course is a seminar, a very large chunk is just Brill talking; since he's a good lecturer it's not necessarily a bad thing, but this is not a hands-off, let the students figure it out kind of course.",
                "Strengths are that I learned a lot, and Brill chooses good articles for us to read to illustrate his points. Weaknesses include but are not limited to the dip in self-esteem that I received from this class. Even though I feel that I learned techniques for effective writing, the feedback in the course and the atmosphere of the class made me feel like I was actually not a good writer. Brill's feedback sometimes bordered on mean, and I found that to be unproductive for my learning style. I also think I let other classes suffer so I could let things slide in this class since I had the mindset that the real world of journalism is tough, so I had better buck up or get out. Brill would email us on Saturdays or Sundays with a new article to read for the week's Monday 9am class. It felt like we were supposed to drop everything for this class at a moment's notice. It consumed every spare hour of my week because I had 15 interviews per article to conduct. And Brill would criticize students in front of the whole class when they turned their papers in on time but \"too close\" to the deadline. The course could be improved if Brill somehow made clear how his criticisms should be received, if he stopped sending surprise last-minute assignments, and if he simply accepted work turned in before the deadline that he himself set.",
                "This class was wonderful. The readings and class discussions were fruitful in teaching me about all aspects of the journalism industry. Professor Brill's knowledge and stories were inspiring, engaging, and invaluable. The assignments felt like a privilege--they taught me so much and made me think critically about a job I hope to one day do. The profile assignment taught me what it is like to be written about, which made me act with deep consideration about how to tell a story with delicacy and care and empathy--while also getting at the truth. The final assignment also provided an opportunity to practice getting to the depths of a personal curiosity, taught me the value of sourcing widely.",
                "I think the class has a lot of valuable things to teach students. I wish there was more flexibility with deadlines given that students in the class usually have other journalism commitments which can be unpredictable and extremely time demanding. Sometimes, one more day on an assignment would have yielded much better work or the ability to more thoroughly edit with a partner.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and have only one main concern -- compared to the other writing workshops I have taken, it was less of a community. Writers felt like they were competing against each other a bit -- maybe this is accurate to the real-world environment of journalism? But something about that first profile assignment sowed some discord in the class, with students trying to dig dirt on each other or griping about how much or how little time their profiler was spending on their piece. I think the profile assignment was valuable, but it certainly didn't set us up well for friendship."

                "If you want to be a journalist, 100% yes. This class will teach you hard skills that are extremely applicable to any newsroom; I have used them myself and I am confident that I am a better journalist because of this class. Prof. Brill is also a wonderful person to have in your corner  I have no regrets about taking this course with him rather than the other professors who teach in the spring. Being part of YJI is also great, and I really loved the cohort and comradery this class built!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in journalism, you must apply to this class. Brill is awesome -- a real character. Don't let him scare you off. He comes off tough, but he's super accessible and has a much smaller ego than he puts off... This class will make you a better writer, no question.",
                "I would, especially if you want to become a journalist. Brill can be tough, but only because he really wants to help you. You'll be met with the brutal realities of what journalism is in the 21st century, and you'll get the chance to work on a few challenging, in-depth assignments.",
                "I cannot recommend this course to another student because their calculus may be different than mine. I shall simply list what I have lost and gained, and they can decide whether it is worth it. Gained: knowledge about the role of a journalist in today's world; a better grasp of the business of journalism; good tips for writing; an almost guaranteed good grade (provided a lot of leg work); a practically guaranteed job in journalism; a lot of connections. Lost: saline water (from my eyes); a lot of sleep; self-confidence; a desire to work in journalism.",
                "Yes, if you want to be a journalist, this course is an essential class to take. It teaches you how to think critically about the job--and gives you on the ground practice completing the job, with the opportunity to receive feedback and practice, and learn from mistakes, in a relatively low stakes environment (that will disappear in the real world). This class gave new meaning and understanding to what journalism means, what a journalist does, and how to go about being a journalist.",
                "Yes  I grew so much as a writer and journalist and am proud of what I produced in the class. That being said, it is a lot of work!! Id recommend taking a lighter course load the semester you take this class.",
                "Yes, this is a good class to take if you have some journalism experience already and want to sharpen your writing skills and gain some insights on the industry. If you're newer to journalism, I'd hold off.",
                "Yes! This class made me a far better journalist and I made valuable connections with professionals in the field. If you want to go into journalism, absolutely take this. The skills I've learned are already helping me."
