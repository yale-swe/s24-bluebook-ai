                "This course was really nice when paired with ENGL 125. This course filled in the second half of contemporary poetry following the poets we read in 125. I recommend taking the two courses together in sequential order, because its a wonderful way to gain insight into a chronological analysis of the greatest poets of all time. This course was very focused on improving close reading skills and analysis at the level of the small unit.",
                "I learned a lot about poetry and its cultural and historical significance, especially in Europe.",
                "This course covers many really essential poets--Wordsworth, Keats, Pope. If you are an English major, this course introduces you to really important poems and themes.",
                "I think I actually developed a really deep appreciation for poetry, even though I had literally none going in!",
                "I gained overall knowledge of major poetic movements from Alexander Pope into the present day. Listening to other people in the seminar style class was the most useful learning tool; one learns interpretive methods from others, such as paying attention to diction, meter, style, rhyme, etc. I learned how poetic movements change and stay the same over time, and how the form influences the meaning and reader's reception of it. There were also opportunities to connect the poems to contemporary real life situations, which was a valuable exercise."

            "comments": [
                "Providing all the reading material for free would be nice for students with financial difficulties, otherwise this course was amazing!",
                "Strengths - The feedback given on papers was wonderful, definitely gave me a good idea of what I needed to improve. I enjoyed the way we focuses on one poet per class period, it really felt like each poet that we studied got their time to be fully considered and appreciated by our class. Weaknesses - It would have been nice if there was a course packet with the supplementary readings so that we did not have to read the majority of the poetry from our computers, that felt a bit cold.",
                "Strengths: the selections were interesting and important, with a mix of subjects and poets. We read romantic poetry, talked about nature as portrayed in poetry, and also covered various historical time periods. The course also does a great job stretching into more modern poets. Weaknesses: The standards and expectations for the papers were not very clear.",
                "The strengths are that many of the readings are fantastic, the class remained really engaged all year, and Prof. Kramnick is genuinely just such a smart and insightful professor. There were certain classes that felt like they werent as great as others, but I think that mostly was because the occasional boring reading we would be assigned.",
                "Strengths: phenomenal discussions, even better Professor. Its hard to think of a weakness for this class with Kramnick!",
                "The selection of poems with a loose genre of \"nature poems\" provided structure for the course and made the chronological journey more cohesive in that we looked at similar themes and tropes and how they change throughout time. The discussion posts are a strength to the course, and the choice to talk about the selections from either day was another accolade. It gave each person an opportunity to interact with the poems even if they did not speak on them in class, and the choice was valuable because I never once was forced to write about a poem that did not interest me. The essay prompts were very good; not so specific that they are confining and don't allow for creativity, but also structured enough to guide the process of writing and idea flow.\r\nI do not have any recommendations as regards the structure of the course."

                "Take it! A wonderful way to gain a chronological understanding of some of the recent great poets.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in poetry, need a foundational course, or want an English course without a super high reading load.",
                "Yes, if you are an English major, you should take the course. The readings are essential and the poets should be read by all English majors. The discussions are great as well, although I think this would vary from section to section.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are or are not interested in poetry. If you are not yet, you will be by the time you are done with 126!",
                "Yes!!!!! Kramnick is incredible. You will leave with a much better understanding of poetic form and shifts in style over time. If you like hyper-specific text based readings of poetry, you will love this class! My favorite English class at Yale so far.",
                "Yes absolutely, I thoroughly enjoyed talking about poetry in this course and listening to my peers. Even if a student is not an english major but merely enjoys poetry, or wants to enjoy poetry, I would recommend this course. It is interesting, reveals a new side to an art form I had seldom considered, and is close enough connected to the modern day that is does not feel antiquated."
