                "My experience taking this English seminar was of much higher quality than the college courses I took for dual credit in high school. I was able to explore writing in a much more freeing way, especially so with the research paper we conducted. I got to develop my writing style and take my writing to the next level with all of the feedback and assignments. As a result of drafts and peer reviewing being built into the class schedule, I was able to not only improve my procrastination problems but also analyze writing in a much more constructive way. The class was also able to attend a creative writing workshop, giving me a lot of insight into the editing process of a professional writer. I went into the class with the mindset that I already had a relatively high ability to write and think critically about writing, but I was able to see through our lessons that this wasn't necessarily the case. Through our lessons, I got to see all of the faults in my writing and improve at thinking more globally in my writing.",
                "I learned how to engage in the abstract concept of time. Whether it be through movies, or short essays, I learned to accept that it's okay to read or watch something over multiple times before fully understanding the meaning behind it.",
                "I improved my research skills and analytical writing. I learned about the concept of time through exploration of different media: books, films, articles. I also worked on public speaking and presentation towards the end of the semester.",
                "I gained valuable knowledge of how to effectively format my papers. I learned the importance of streamlining as well as effectively supporting my arguments. I also learned the impact a counterargument has on your claim and the ways in which you can use altered perspectives to aid your own points.",

                "The biggest strength of the class is the fact that it exists as a seminar. I was able to interact a lot with my peers and hear everyone's comments and questions about different steps of the reading and writing process. The professor was very receptive to constructive comments and used our mid-semester feedback to help cater more to the individual needs of the class. Having the smaller class size was a huge benefit to our learning and allowed us to work as writers in a collaborative way as well as individually. Very few weaknesses come to mind in regard to the way the course was taught. There were some points in the semester where there could have been more clarity on how some of the assignments could have been done, but that was a problem that was quickly addressed and fixed by the professor.",
                "Weakness: Lot's of writing papers but not enough conferences with the professor\r\nStrength: Wrote my first research paper!",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I don't have suggestions for areas of improvement. The topic of Time that was explored was fascinating and the workload was a good amount.",
                "The strengths of the course were allowing the students ample time to properly approach the writing process. The material was also interesting, weaving a fusion of philosophy, science, and history together. One thing that could be improved is focusing on the writing itself and the precise ways how to make one's writing better\/clearer.",
                "I wished classroom discussions were more lively and involved."
