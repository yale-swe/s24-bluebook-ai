                "I really love how there is a big emphasis on speaking and listening; thanks to French in Action, I got to learn how French people speak in real life to each other (using idioms, etc.) rather than just learning a ton of vocabulary topically unit by unit (which would have been helpful, too, but it wouldn't have actually given me any insight on how to speak normally in a conversation the way French people do). My speaking and listening (as well as grammar) improved immensely!",

                "This course's strength was how dedicated the faculty is! And the videos called French in Action helped a bunch. A weakness would be how intense it is, but rather than making the course less intense, maybe they should offer more courses beforehand for people who want to take it slow. Just a thought.",
                "I really don't see any weaknesses! Professor Ngame was amazing, and although learning two lessons in one week was sometimes hard and tedious, but the more you practice, the better it is with language learning.",
                "Strength: high level of engagement in a small class, all-round language skill development \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish grammar was taught in a more focused manner",
                "I think the oral presentations and sketches are very useful in helping students speak the language and learn new vocabulary. And the FiA videos are also quite interesting, and helpful in learning the language.",
                "Weaknesses: we didn't receive our grades back on any assignments except the paper versions of weekly tests, we couldn't ask questions in class because the Professor was upset when we didn't understand concepts, there wasn't enough explanation of grammar concepts in class, pretty much you have to teach yourself French if you even want to pass this class because the organization of it is poor, the FiA videos are dated and confusing, and the teacher in class doesn't provide any type of student support",

                "Yes! Well, if you're planning on learning French from the beginning, this is the only option anyway, but my experience was fantastic!",
                "Yes, definitely.\r\nI think French L1 is stressful, considering you meet every weekday. But it's worth it since you'll be able to fairly speak the language at the end of the course.",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course at all; I took it as a Credit/D/Fail and I was still stressed out because we never got the grades back on anything except our weekly tests so it was impossible to know what grade we were making in the course even by the end of the semester. The French in Action videos are not helpful and when you ask questions in class we would get shut down with \"We covered this __ weeks ago did you not learn it.\" (clearly we didn't if we still have questions on it.)",
