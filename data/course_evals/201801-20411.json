   "comments": [
    "not a huge alignment between the textbook and what is said in class, and whats on homework.",
    "This course is full of interesting information, but moves too slowly at the beginning and doesn't really get interesting until the last half of the semester. It would be good to speed through the beginning a bit faster and spend more time on the evolution of stars and other objects like black holes, neutron stars, and gravitational waves. Also, this semester Professor Zinn would assign PSET's on Wednesdays that would be due the next Wednesday, but not teach the material necessary to do it until Monday. The PSET's should be rearranged so that we have a full week when we can actually work on them.",
    "Material interesting, more practice homework problems in class would be good",
    "This course focused too much on minutia of units etc. and not enough on theory.",
    "Most of the lectures contained conceptual information whereas problem sets and exams contained a lot of calculation based questions. It would have been nice to do more calculation examples in class. Additionally, the material covered in our problem sets didn't match up with material we had covered in class. Lectures could also be a bit dry at times, which was frustrating."

   "comments": [
    "Not super engaging but somewhat material",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in astronomy and wants to learn more about the universe. The math needed for this course is very basic, and the PSET's are pretty easy, although Professor Zinn tends to not cover the informaiton needed for them until a few days before they're due. Class can get pretty boring sometimes, but if you're looking for a low workload class that covers really interesting information, you should take it!",
    "I would if you are looking for a relatively low workload but interesting science class",
    "Yes! Professor Zinn is great. Beware though, even if you're an intensive physics major this class is actually difficult to ace.",
    "This course is an excellent, broad introduction to astronomy. It is not a gut class, but it is not incredibly difficult either. If you are a student with minimal physics background, like myself, it will be more challenging, but doable if you work on problem sets in advance and stay focused on material in lectures. If you are truly interested in astronomy and would like to avoid taking a course filled with students who are only there for the credit, then I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course because it isn't too challenging and most of the topics that it covers are interesting. However, you have to do a lot of self-teaching."
