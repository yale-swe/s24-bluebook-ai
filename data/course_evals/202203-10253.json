                "Strengths: discussions go deeply into the text while keeping the reading load manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: it would be nice to add more diversity to the reading list and to include more modern thinkers",
                "I think that the course was very well organized and laid out to cover all core philosophers and their most important theories. I enjoyed the discussions that stemmed in class",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kapustin is unbelievably knowledgable and helpful in understanding these philosophers better, the sessions are a great balance of discussion and instruction; Weaknesses: the weekly reading is a bit overwhelming (I was very rarely able to finish all of it), but that won't stop you from being able to follow along during sessions",
                "Kapustin's lectures are awesome, I love hearing him speak and he does a wonderful job explaining complex topics. The class feels more like a lecture, which is not a bad things. I think focusing on 6 thinkers was great because we time to dive into each. However, we did always end up behind every week.",
                "Professor Kapustin is a great teacher. He is obviously very knowledgeable regarding the topics but he truly went out of his way to explain quite difficult texts to us. He is the course's greatest asset. \r\nThe texts are difficult and intimidating but trust that Kapustin's seminar explanations will be incredibly helpful and ease anxieties.",
                "Strengths: Kapustin is a wonderful lecturer, organization of the assignments was very clear, readings were well chosen and all spoke to big questions through different lenses\r\nWeaknesses: More active student engagement (not enough people spoke up or did the readings), more seminar-style discussion than lecture",
                "Strengths are 100% Boris. no real weaknesses",
                "The course is excellent, mostly because of Professor Kapustin who is one of the most incredible instructors at Yale. You would do yourself a great service to take a class with him for his knowledge and kindness as a professor.",
                "Prof Kapustin is a wonderful man and a great teacher/lecturer. However, the course canon jumps a considerable stretch of time from Bentham to Schumpeter etc. Further, it only included white men no women, or people of color were covered. I understand that this is a classics course, but surely we could have included other perspectives."

If you just want to take a class with Prof. Kapustin but are not an EP&E major, I'd recommend one of his other ones just because the content might be a little more generally appealing.",
