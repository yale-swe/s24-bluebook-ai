                "The course's main strength is the broadness of the lectures as a complement to the extremely detailed reading for students to capture a general and meticulous picture of the history. While I heard differing viewpoints on students' section experience, mine happened to be an incredibly useful addendum to our classes since we spoke about new material with a captain who had real-world expertise in the often theoretical concept of sea power.",
                "Strength: Professor Kennedy really knows his history and can competently build a narrative of military history in often surprising ways. My discussion section was also great. \r\n\r\nWeakness: TA training could be better. Some of the rubric instructions were very unclear.",
                "Strengths: Kennedy is a gem, take any class he teaches. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were very loosely organized and took a lot of outside work to connect ideas. Lots of readings that are literally the same thing over and over.",
                "The strength of this course was the instructor.",
                "This content of the course should be learned by all.",

A lot of readings that don't connect to what's discussed in class. Mandatory section.\r\n\r\nPros: sometimes interesting, only required work is the midterm and final.",
                "Awesome lectures. Readings were so dense and long people just stopped doing them. Fewer readings would allow us to engage better.",
                "Great lectures, fair exams. Section was a bit boring at times. Maybe it should be worth more of the grade to encourage more riveting discourse.",
                "Strengths:\r\nPresentations \r\nLectures \r\nMaterial\r\nBooks\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nA bit too generalized",
                "Great workload, great readings, great lectures.",
                "My TA was definitely a weakness. There is a lot of unnecessary reading as well. The reading could be cut down and the same material would be covered.",
                "Professor Kennedy is very interesting and great to watch in lecture. Lecture slides are only pictures, however, and have no writing.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting subject material. \r\nWeaknesses: A prereq for this class should be a knowledge of military history of the west since 1500. Significant World events are often alluded to, but never actually taught. For example, we will look at planes used during WW2, but will never learn what WW2 was. This would be fine, except a comprehensive knowledge of historical events and their details are required for midterms/finals. The readings for this class are uber-specific and rarely relevant(whole readings on cannon dimensions or wood for ships). In class, it is quite the opposite, clicking through 30 pictures with little explanation.",
                "The readings are enjoyable but fairly repetitive, so it would be nice if the syllabus could be trimmed down or some indication could be given about which readings essentially provide the same information over again. The lectures are fun to listen to, but sometimes wander and can lack clear direction and organization.",
                "great class! No notes! One of the best classes I ever took!",
                "The course was great in that it was structured both conventionally and unconventionally. Kennedy's lectures would feel almost like a \"story time,\" but one could see easily that he was both keeping right on top of the content at hand with his slides and also clearly organizing the lecture around a chronological \"major theme of the course.\" He would flow seamlessly from \"small tangents\" to detailed looks into the HMS Dreadnought. The readings were manageable, even if sometimes they were burdensome (there was one where he wanted us to do effectively 300 pages of reading in the span of two days fairly close to finals period).",
                "The course is broad and covers very engaging material. The lectures could be too broad sometimes and light on details making it difficult to determine what the biggest ideas were.",
                "The course felt more based on readings than lectures so I wish they could be tied together more.",
                "It is a superb course.  Some of the readings were dense, but otherwise, it was fantastic in every respect.",

                "For students prepared to do the readings, engage with the material, and add additional research about how different technological evolutions and engagements relate to one another, absolutely. Simply having the privilege to study under Prof. Kennedy's direction makes this course an excellent experience, and students exit with a firm grasp of crucial historical material that is often neglected today.",
                "Not really, unless you need it. I have a feeling that a seminar with Kennedy would be a lot better.",
                "Sure, Professor Kennedy is great, but keep in mind that this is a ROTC class and that the final is literally 60% of your final grade. If you're up for an old school class with a huge reading commitment, blue book exams, and interesting content, this is for you.",
                "I would recommend the course. If you do the readings, you will get a lot out of the course. Professor Kennedy takes things very slow during lecture and focuses on very broad themes in military history, however the discussion section conversations are generally very focused on specific readings. Section can get very dull as doing the readings was largely not necessary as long as you have at least a rudimentary background in military history.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is interesting and relevant to today.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I think it is an excellent in-depth military history overview that would benefit any all students.",
                "A great course taught by the man who wrote the book on Great Power Competition. If you're interested in international security you should take this course. The course is taught in the standard history lecture format so it is pretty straightforward and not too difficult.",
                "Maybe, if you have time to do the readings or are willing to cram for the two exams. It's very easy on a weekly basis but they grade is 90% exams and you don't learn everything you need to know for them in lecture so it's easy in terms of workload you actually have to do but hard to do all the readings and hard to do that well on the exams.",
                "Lectures are incredible, gotta take a Kennedy class while you still can. He's a legend. You don't have to do a lot besides midterm and final grind, but overall the class was better when I did the readings and engaged. Section was actually a plus, which is rare.",
                "Yes! Great survey course taught by the legend himself. PMK is a very funny and skilled orator. Take one of his classes before it's too late. You'll regret it if you don't.",
                "Not really. I felt as thought most of the information we learned in this class could have been learned on my own.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to gain an alternative perspective on world history and global affairs.",
                "Yes. Professor Kennedy is a legend and makes the class a pleasure to be a part of.",
                "Yes! It is an interesting overview and you learn a lot if you pay attention in lecture! Great for people with interest in military history but have very little background.",
                "Yes - great for Hu credit or/and if interested in military history.",
                "If you are interested in the subject matter, definitely take it, but don't see it as just an easy course. The reading load is quite substantial if you choose to do all or most of it, and putting the pieces together is a task you'll have to take on yourself.",
                "Yes! Wonderful class",
                "Yes. Professor Kennedy is a wonderful professor and the lectures are incredibly interesting to see, and he will truly give you a complete picture of the state of the military at the time. There are also guest lectures sometimes that are also quite illuminating.",
                "Interesting class that I would recommend to any major. If someone were only to take one history class it does not get much better than a survey course like this.",
                "Yes. it is very interesting and taught by great professor.",
                "Yes it is fundamental.  All Yale students should have a grasp of this kind of history, because it is this kind of thinking that allows us to refine our futures.",
