Additionally, being a physics and psychology major, this was a great way to bring my majors into a philosophy class through Metaphysics.

We also attended lectures and then seminars with leaders in both metaphysics and psychology and learned about current works in these fields.",
                "I learned about the intersection between psychology and philosophy -- not only how the former can provide insights into the latter, but also how the latter can drive questions in the former.",
                "We read literature from both philosophy and cognitive science to motivate our discussions of some very fundamental questions of metaphysics, such as the nature of time, reality, events, etc. I gained a deeper appreciation for the role of philosophy in not only motivating psychology research with questions but also with genuine answers that may or may not correspond to human's perception of the world.",
                "This class was a true synthesis of cognitive science and metaphysics. Having never taken a psych or cog sci class, I learned so much, and it really informed my philosophy education to examine it through the lens of cog sci."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are that the professors treat us as adults, they give us the readings and the assignments once a week and they do not baby us but during the lectures or throughout the week, the class is engaging and if you want to participate you do need to do at least some of the readings which also forces you to learn. They take every question no matter how naive or \"stupid\" it may be. They also include good tangential conversations and stories to reduce the monotony. They are fun to listen to and fun to engage in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include that the professors I think end up talking with each other a little more than with us than I expected. Additionally, because of the size of the class and the wide range of skills (from grad students in philosophy and cogsci to first years) there wasn't always enough time to ask questions especially as the conversations and topics changed quickly. But this is a weak weakness as there is not much you can do about this and really it just means that I wanted more time in the class which is a good thing.",
                "The concept for the class is creative, and I thoroughly enjoyed discussion every week. That said, the ways that the fields of philosophy and cogsci interacted were not always super clear to me, and I generally had trouble with understanding the metaphysics side of things.",
                "Our class discussions were incredibly interesting and substantive, though they could be disorganized at times.",
                "Laurie and Brian are unquestionably the biggest strengths of this class. At times, it didn't seem necessary for the class to be a seminar at all, for their arguments with each other were so intellectually stimulating that we could have sufficed with just their cross-questioning to explore certain topics. Another strength is the diversity of opinion that the class attracts, from undergraduates to PhD students strictly focusing in philosophy, psychology or even further removed subjects.",
                "Guest speakers are a big strength for the course, as is the teaching. \r\nOnly weakness is that it could be fun to have more robust discussions in class with back and forths among the students."

                "ABSOLUTELY! If you don't think you like philosophy, especially if you are a STEM person, PLEASE take this class. Brian Scholl is an amazing professor, seminar professor, and advisor. Laurie Paul is also an amazing professor and will make sure that everything is questioned but questioned correctly. You will spend a lot of time on readings but they are worth it.",
                "I personally was not a huge fan of this course despite loving psychology. I was looking for some exposure to philosophy/metaphysics and hoped this course could give me that. At times it did, but I was generally disappointed with it. Brian and Laurie are probably both great individual instructors, but together they spend most of the class talking to each other, resulting in a pretty inactive and boring seminar. Also because they're presenting different sides / approaches to something, it often seems like they're battling for the attention of the class to discuss their side of psychology or metaphysics, which is also not super interesting. The guest speakers were great, but again spent a lot of time just talking with Brian and Laurie, so don't quite expect a normal active seminar.",
                "Would recommend for any students who want a general primer on cogsci (esp study of visual perception) and metaphysics, and who want the experience of thinking in an interdisciplinary way.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in these topics and are okay with not understanding everything you hear in class. Sometimes, the majority of the discussion might be hard to comprehend, if the topic isn't your specialty.",
                "Yes!  It is a great class for both psychology and philosophy students alike, bridging the gap between the two fields in an approachable way.",
                "I would without a doubt recommend this class to another undergraduate student, provided that they are ready for the intellectual challenge of this class and are comfortable with listening to thoughtful debates between the two professors. Laurie and Brian would bring very different perspectives to each issue that we covered in class, but each of their viewpoints illuminated genuine thought. Although the readings can seem rather tough, they are useful introductions to both the philosophical and psychological sides (which could be starkly different) of some very interesting issues. I cannot recommend the sheer thought that this class makes you put in about your ideas enough.",
                "Yes! I really, really enjoyed this course. One of my favorites that Ive taken at Yale.",
                "The course is a seminar but often feels like a lecture, or at best a Q & A with the professors. Also it is more like a survey of a bunch of topics in metaphysics and cogsci- you see how they connect which is cool, but we don't actually dig deep or have discussions about any of the topics"
