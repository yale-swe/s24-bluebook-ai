Although I might not have been the most outstanding student, my math level definitely increased. To do well on the class I was also forced to input a lot of effort and time outside of class which made me improve greatly. Although that might come to mean that my experience with the course teaching in itself was a little bit unsatisfactory.",

Often way better than the professors themselves.\r\nWeakness: The PSETS were way harder than anticipated (I was told by my instructor that the overall head of the department liked to create them that way). Poor job at explaining the theorems (even though we had several exam questions about theorems and such).",
                "I think the strengths lie in the challenging level of it. Even having taken Calculus 1 before, you were still challenged and forced to learn the subjects more thoroughly. It could be improved with more class time, perhaps, to account for the superficiality of the lectures in comparison to the exams/homework.",
                "Very good Peer Tutoring program. Teacher was alright. Could have been better at time management, but I liked him because he was personable and explained the material well.",
                "I liked how the class was thought by my professor",
                "The strengths of this course is it gave us enough time to get all of our work done. The weaknesses is that OH were hard to attend and the class was only 2 days a week, so if I didn't know something I had to learn it on my own.",
                "Seems to cater more to the students who are better at learning rather than helping other students learn",
                "Overall, I think there was a big discrepancy between different professors. I believe the course also felt too fast paced as we were learning many different new topics in one class. The problem sets were also extremely difficult and not a good representation of what was on the midterm/final exam.",
                "Strength: organized material, coherent path in understanding calculus \r\n\r\nWeakness: may dive too deep in some topics and only scratch the surface in others"
