                "More interaction than just reading papers",
                "Strengths: Lectures were diverse in topic, and guest speakers did a nice job of tailoring their presentations to an audience of undergraduate students and engaging with students throughout their lectures (pausing for questions\/opening things up for discussion periodically). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course assignments were mainly summaries of papers for each guest lecture. Reading the papers was a good way to get a feel for the speakers work prior to class, but I think it might have been helpful to have a few guiding questions for the assignments to better direct my focus to lecture content. I also do think the course is quite long (especially for a half-credit course  it is the length of a typical one-credit, once-a-week seminar). I feel that I could have effectively engaged with the content of lectures in an hour or hour and a half period."

That aside, I think the content is really interesting and its a great help in getting started with research in terms of finding an area that interests you and connecting with professors in that field. Just something to keep in mind when you are choosing your schedule: this semester, there was a Friday and a Monday section of the course  the Monday section was a lot larger than Friday. I was in the Friday section, and found that the smaller class size facilitated meaningful discussions (compared to what I heard from those in the Monday section). I dont think the section you choose will make or break the experience, but thought this information might be helpful to some."
