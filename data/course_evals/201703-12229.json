   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "The course talks about Chinese wealth inequality, which is related to a lot of other modern sociological issues, like marriage\/gender (which Professor Davis studies!), education, health etc.\r\nYou also learn a lot about reading, interpreting, making graphs.",
    "I learned a great deal from this course. I gained a solid understanding of the forces behind inequality in modern China, its determinants and its effects. I also learned a great deal about doing research through the final project.",
    "Being able to read journal articles with a very statistical focus.",
    "A stronger understanding of modern China, and a solid foundation for understanding inequality in general (there was a lot of comparison with inequality in the US).",
    "Learned about the specific driving forces behind recent inequality trends in urban China.",
    "This course has a great ability to catalyze student thinking and synthesisit is not just about inequality in China and causes of it, but thinking critically about the realities that someone the poorest and richest people in the country face. Things cannot be completely understood with statistics. One must think beyond broad, generalized statements to fully understand how inequality is produced.",
    "A very in-depth course on current states of inequality in modern China, with an emphasis on primary sources or studies examining how existing gaps were formed",
    "I learned a ton about China as I expected. Especially as things in china are changing so fast it was great to be updated on what is happening. But more importantly then that I learned about how one needs to change ones view on china from the classic western way of thinking about it. Professor Davis really gave us a very insightful lens into how best to go about thinking about how china works.",
    "In this course, we learned to examine wealth inequality in China from a variety of sociological perspectives, including health, education, and capital. We covered major trends in Chinese history and society as well as academic principles in economics and anthropology. Overall, this was a good overview of Chinese society and why it is the way it is today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I took this class even though I had no background in sociology and found it so useful. A few students took this class without much knowledge about China and also enjoyed it. Professor Davis creates a supportive seminar experience but also pushes students to create work that is thoughtful. The readings are also a reasonable length, which is not always true of seminars.",
    "Strengths: This class was fantastic. I think it achieved an extremely rare level of depth and nuance in the subject that few classes reach. I came away with a detailed understanding of not just the social conditions in modern China, but a framework for evaluating inequality anywhere. It was a perfect combination of empirical studies\/work, and theory.\r\n\r\nI thought the assignments were a huge strength and were pretty unique for a Yale class. They allowed us to research something interesting to us and give more context to the papers we read. They could have been spaced out a bit better over the semester though.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more time to cover all the readings! I understand the need to get a good breadth of readings, but sometimes I felt like class could feel rushed. I think slightly more structured lecture could have improved on this.\r\nI also think Prof. Davis could have maybe done a bit more for those more unfamiliar with modern China or Chinese (maybe she did this during office hours, I don't know).",
    "The strength of the class is its diverse coverage of the social issues in China. Professor Davis is so well-versed in her field that she could always answer your question or point you in the right direction. \r\n\r\nI would benefit more from the class readings and the class assignments if we could include a lecture on how to evaluate and analysis data with various regression models.",
    "Strengths were Professor Davis's wealth of knowledge and years working in China, interesting assignments, and strong syllabus. All the readings were really current and clearly relevant to understanding China today. Discussion was dull at times, but overall because Prof Davis is unafraid to challenge students and push back, discussion managed to keep people fairly engaged and made paying attention in class definitely worthwhile.",
    "There were so many interesting topics and facets that cover inequality in China, and as a result, this course looks at numerous facets of sociology and Chinese society. Professor Davis' insights are beyond helpful in guiding the student through the readings and discussions. However, I do think that there should be more opportunities to synthesize information. There was a debate\/memo that required drawing on numerous themes and readings which helped me think about problems in a high-level approach. With more assignments or discussions to do the same type of thinking, I think the course could truly be amazing.",
    "The course is wonderful in that it covers a lot of content-- the many different aspects of why inequality exists and persists in China. Professor Davis is so incredibly knowledgeable about China specifically relating to this subject and in general, and she led class meetings efficiently and engagingly. The only thing to note is that there were many dense scholarly readings every week that were difficult, at first, for someone used to humanities readings, but overall they were well worth it.",
    "One of the best features of the course is the Chinese language section that allows students to converse in Chinese about the topic that week. The class is very well formatted.",
    "The biggest strength is that we cover so much of a huge wealth of data. the breadth of this course is astounding. Also as I said before the level of understanding here is great. That being said a weakness I see is that it is hard to bring oneself to the discussions without having to rely heavily on previous knowledge. This is a upper level class but with different backgrounds in understanding Chinese society it can be daunting.",
    "Strengths - Prof Davis is a genius and she is a real expert in the field. Having her facilitate seminars was truly a wonderful experience, especially because she pushes back against students and really makes them reconsider what they are saying. The readings were also great, even the academic papers. Optional language section was also a good opportunity to practice speaking Chinese for those who wanted.\r\nWeaknesses - classes felt a little disconnected from week to week until we had special days like debates that tied everything together."

    "Take this class! In the last class, it was clear that everyone had so many unanswered questions and that the class had really engaged them. Professor Davis is also one of the kindest, sharpest seminar professors I've had. If you take this class, definitely come by her office hours.",
    "100% take this class! If you're interested in modern China, inequality, or its combination, then take it!\r\n\r\nYou HAVE to go to office hours, but you'll enjoy it! Prof. Davis is a bottomless well of resources, insight, and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't taken any class on China before, however, you might need to do some catch-up at the beginning, but it's definitely worth it. Oh, and start the final project as early as you can.",
    "This class offers a great window through which you can learn about the social inequality in China. Both Chinese native speakers and those who do not speak Chinese will gain a lot from the material.",
    "If you know you're interested in China, 100% take this--I don't know if I could imagine a better class for understanding the nuances of modern China. Professor Davis's experience in China is very impressive, and you will benefit from learning from her. That said, I found this class challenging and required more time than an average class, but I thought it was absolutely worth it because I came out not only way more knowledgable in China's inequality issues, but a sharper, more critical thinker.",
    "Yes, the professor is great and very knowledgeable. Good readings and stimulating discussions",
    "Yes! Professor Davis is an amazing, smart, and dedicated teacher. She is extremely willing to provide students with the help and assistance they need to think more deeply about China, as well as conduct thorough background research on the topics of their final paper.\r\n\r\nI do believe that it is a little hard to connect everything studiedan assignment or discussion that focuses more on synthesis might help students emerge from the course with a more tangible, unified understanding.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about China and have prior knowledge about the country! Otherwise, it is a lot of work with a very specific focus. I also felt like there was a true learning curve to this class. In the beginning, I struggled with the readings and the class structure, but by the end I felt much more at ease, and much more productive.",
    "Absolutely. Without Prof. Deborah Davis teaching, if it still exists, it may look very different but the course itself is extremely interesting. Inequality is a growing concern globally, and if you have high interest in China, then this course is a must-take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. But please note that this is an advanced glad cross-listed course. There may be no prerequisites but having knowledge about either china or sociology\/econ is a must. If you want to learn more about Chinese society though this is a great way to do that.",
    "If you are interested in both sociology AND China, take it! If you are only interested in one or the other, this course is probably too specific for you."
