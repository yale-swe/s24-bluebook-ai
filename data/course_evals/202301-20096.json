                "This is a great class to understand refugee issues from the perspectives of refugees themselves; to critically examine the current refugee system and the way it arbitrates protection and truth; to see how other forms of oppression and inequality intersect with refugee law; to engage with art and film relating to refugee experiences.",
                "I learned about the international refugee regime and how to think critically about these legal institutions",
                "I learned a completely different way to think about learning about refugees beyond traditional academic conventions. I learned a lot about the value of hands on work, and the connections between modes of cultural production and political issues",
                "This course really shifted the way I understand and think about refugees. I learned about the field of Critical Refugee Studies which greatly differs from traditional works, perceptions, and scholarship about refugees. Instead, the course taught us to view refugees as critical agents with their own contradictions, contestations, and unique personhood, through engaging with refugee scholarship, media, and stories.",
                "Global refugee policy regime, refugee narratives, grounding refugee experiences.",
                "This course really opened my mind to the field of refugee studies, and all the ways in which some conventional ways of treating and studying refugees miss the mark. This course helped me with academic reading, and with how to integrate real-world experience (in this case, volunteering) with academic study! It also taught me a huge amount about my own background and gave me the skills to start discussing my family refugee experience with other family members, which is something so, so valuable that I appreciate so much.",
                "Critical Refugee Studies transformed the way I think about borders, migration, global movement, and refugees of course. I will never again approach these topics without thinking of CRS.",
                "Greater insight into refugees as both subject of their own narratives, along with a more complicated understanding of how to interrogate these narratives, in policy, art, etc."

                "Good amount of reading- very doable and allows for our class conversation to actually cover what we prepared for class.",
                "Strengths: course was set at a great pace and readings were fantastic, Prof Tran is a gem, Weaknesses: can't think of any",
                "Love the class structure and mode of final assignment so much, wish other classes adopted something similar \r\n\r\ndiscussions began to feel a little repetitive by the end",
                "i enjoyed how open the discussion floor is - it was a very safe safe to discuss a plethora of topics on refugee issues. I would have appreciated a stronger focus on refugee policy to shed light on possible policy solutions (in addition to community level cross-understanding).",
                "All strengths. Just a great course. Only way to improve is that I almost feel like the volunteer portion should be mandatory, because it contributed so much to my class learning and I feel like could've been really cool to consistently discuss as an entire class.",
                "I think there were a lot of peoples and parts of the world left unexplored in this course which would be really helpful in understanding critical refugee studies.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tran is hands-down, one of the best instructors at Yale. She facilitates discussion beautifully and draws connections between readings and students' comments. She is also incredibly kind and understanding. The readings, screenings, and art she selects are interesting, diverse, and engaging. It's also clear that Professor Tran centers community and embodied practice (along with the theoretical), as the final project has an option for people to meaningfully engage with community organizations. Weaknesses: none"

                "Yes",
                "For sure!!! even if you don't plan on entering any field related to migration, this class teaches you how conceptions of humanity and citizenship are formed. Prof tran teaches you to be a compassionate as well as a critical analyst about the refugee regime. this is not the kind of class where you'll emerge with policy recommendations and a clear solution for how to proceed, but you also get why that's not the goal for the class by the end.",
                "Absolutely, especially for those looking to understand these issues outside of convention and those wanting to work in a range of mediums\/ways",
                "Yes 100 percent! This course should be required for anyone that wants to work in refugee\/migration work, scholarship, and policy in the future. And even if you don't plan to go into those fields, I would recommend that whoever wants to should still take this course as it will completely change the way you think, no matter what field you are going into.",
                "Yes. 100% Prof Tran is such an incredible professor and helps foster a perfect balance between giving us the opportunity to discuss while also providing structure to the conversation by posing really interesting and engaging questions. The readings we were assigned were long, but so fascinating and offered new perspectives that challenged our preconceptions of refugees and humanitarianism. So many of the readings were also so emotional and life-changing to read and I really appreciated how Prof Tran cultivated such an incredible collection of works.",
                "Yes, Professor Tran is a very encouraging individual and the class pushes student to take their knowledge outside of the classroom to engage with refugee communities\/ spaces.",
                "Yes!!! Especially if you come from a refugee background, or have studied refugees in more conventional contexts (ie through UN frameworks.) This will expand your mind in such important ways.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students who have yet to encounter Critical Refugee Studies scholarship and are prepared to come to class with an open mind.",
                "Yes, you gain a lot of insights that ultimately leak into and make great conversation in various other classes, from topics in ethnic studies and even to math and science classes, like forestry or programming. The seminars are very engaging, and offer a challenging but respectful environment to think about a field of study in constant motion.",
                "Absolutely. This is a well structured introduction course. It makes you think about and question the ways in which the world is structured, why and how definitions of refugeness are constructed, and how to always center refugee voices."
