I learned how to better present arguments in a concise way, and I improved in identifying areas in which I disagree in established philosophical papers. I appreciated the exposure I got to students of other institutions, as well as their different backgrounds. Both encouraged a richer and more open philosophical environment.",
                "I learned so much about the definitions and applications of lies, deceptions, misleading, manipulations, and all sorts of other concepts during this course. I learned how to keep up a philosophical discussion with a small group of peers and I honestly think I grew as a person.",
                "Everything from definitions of lying and deception to whether or not novels lie. Honestly one of the best classes I have taken!",
                "It was mentioned in the first class that by the end of the course, we would be experts in lies and deceptions. This was not a lie. The copious amount of literature and diversity of perspectives around the definitions of lying and deception, the morality of lying and deception, and the evolution of academic works on the subject of lying and deception all enhanced my knowledge and insight into the field. I am incredibly grateful as well for the stupendous feedback I got on my writing assignments.",

            "comments": [
                "This course translates very well to an online format. The required readings were very enriching and relevant not only to critical philosophical lying/deceiving debate, but also to current social contexts in which lying is a point of contention. The course content naturally produced rich conversations which allowed us to further explore ideas in assignments and papers. One weakness of the course is that it didn't feel like there was adequate feedback between assignments, on a class-wide level. It was hard to know sometimes how I was doing in comparison with my classmates.",
                "I don't really have complaints, this was a great course, I highly enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
                "Professor Mahon is literally the best. Most engaging professor I have ever had.",
                "A great strength of the course was the conversations produced in class. The discussions we had were very productive and I feel like I was learning something new every day from talking about the course materials with my peers. I really see no weakness with the curriculum, but if I had to pick something to choose, I would most likely prefer there being more class time and resources dedicated to the morality of lying and deception. This class was the first time I genuinely learned about Kant, and again, I am very appreciative of this. I highly recommend the professor to continue teaching Kant on Lying and other moral philosophers.",
                "It is a discussion-based class.  Sometimes the discussions are a bit forced down a specific line of inquiry, but since so much is covered in each class, it isn't too big of an issue.  The writing is philosophy writing, and it takes a while to adjust to that style if you haven't encountered anything like it before.",
                "A great course overall - I don't think it can be improved content-wise. I believe that class hours can be a little bit longer (perhaps three hours a day, three days a week)."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was challenging and forced me to reconsider ideas I previously had about the course content, but this was done organically. I was presented with multiple perspectives, and I was allowed to consider them all for myself. I was able to learn from my classmates which only enriched my own thoughts. That should be the goal of any philosophy course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is even a little bit interested in philosophy because I learned so much and enjoyed discussing this topic with a group of peers.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of readings and the classes are never short of discussions, but it is well worth it. Professor Mahon makes the class so great.",
                "Absolutely. More than just the very interesting course curriculum, Professor Mahon engages the students in a way that I have not seen other professors been able to do so virtually. He seemed very down-to-earth, despite his vast amount of knowledge concerning the field of lies and deceptions. There were also classes in particular where he invited the authors of the literature we read to be guest speakers in our class discussions, adding to my already positive perception of the class.",
                "The topics covered are fascinating, even without a philosophy background.  If you are not used to philosophy writing, just be aware that you may need to consult with the professor a few times before submitting your assignments, which can be time-consuming.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students purely interested in philosophy. If the student is not familiar with philosophic writing, the course might be boring and challenging."
