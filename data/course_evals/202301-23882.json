                "Professor Schillinger has a methodical approach to class that always sheds incredible insight on the course material. You wil learn to participate well as well as write a clearly structured argumentative essay.",
                "The curriculum this semester was terrific, probably the best in all DS sections both semesters. The semester gave me a clear overview of the evolution of early modern political thought.",
                "DS H&P track for spring was highly enjoyable. It provides a good overview of Western political thought. It is also nice to be able to see how each thinker connects to and is influenced by others.",
                "DRST: H&P Spring Semester was a really incredible intellectual experience. Early on, I became aware of Prof. Schillinger's very unique and honest approach to our texts  he seemed to understand them on a level that I had not seen before, how they interacted and what the authors were truly aiming at. Because of this, I quickly understood the value of close-reading and comparative reading, of looking at a text honestly and giving an honest report of its contents. Especially in comparison to the fall semester, I have noticed a distinct development in my ability to evaluate the texts, both contextually and subtextually.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I feel that my intellectual understanding both of classical and modern political thought as well as the philosophy behind political thought has vastly improved. I feel that I have a more acute grasp on modern intellectual history, and I now have the ability to evaluate the contemporary era through the lens of the texts which formed it  to understand how we got to where we are.\r\n\r\nMy writing has also vastly improved; Prof. Schillinger's standard for papers is extremely high, and this encourages the student to put in time, yes, but more importantly to submit an honest and specific intellectual take, to attempt to prove something they believe. \r\n\r\nFinally, I will cite my improved ability to discuss and debate as an advancement from the fall. My peers were extraordinarily intellectual and pushed me not only to accept all viewpoints but to defend mine with evidenced argument and rhetoric.",
                "How to analyze modern political thought and to read texts carefully and systematically",
                "I developed my ability to close read historical texts and to understand the political theories of political philosophers.",
                "History of political theory from Machiavelli to Arendt. I think the course focused more on our writing skills and ability to think creatively about the texts we read instead of just taking interpretations for granted",
                "My ability to think and write about political theory vastly improved -- this was an excellent class with a top-notch syllabus.",
                "Communicating and writing analysis of historical and political works.",
                "This semester of HP DS seemed much more political science focused, and it was extraordinarily interesting. Through reading the various authors, I was able to understand where the idea of modern democracies came from, but also critiques and evaluations of such states throughout history and from various different angles.",
                "During this course, I learned both academic skills while studying extensive content of political philosophy an theory. Although it is not necessarily the subject I was most drawn to, by reading and practicing my writing on complex ideas, that have constructed the modern world in which we live today, has given me thought provoking insights for understanding fundamental political issues and where they are rooted in history."

                "No weaknesses, one of if not the best H&P instructors.",
                "As expected, the reading load for DS is high. Having to balance this with other DS tracks and also trying to write an essay every week and participate in the discussion sections is oftentimes difficult. But, it is highly rewarding, and I enjoyed it a lot.",
                "I would say that this is an extremely strong course. The texts are incredible  a truly fine and solitary intellectual experience. Prof. Schillinger's introduction to the text are also very helpful to contextualize and should remain. I will focus on debate.\r\n\r\nAs outlined in \"On Liberty\", debate and discussion are the forms in which we improve our ideas. This particular classroom was more honest and willing to debate than most I encounter at Yale; however, there is always room for improvement. It should be outlined in the beginning of the year that students are not only allowed but encouraged to share honest opinions about what they believe in a text. There were a variety of times in which a student would strongly agree with or strongly defend a textual point, or disagree or agree with their classmates or Prof. Schillinger, and these were genuinely the richest times in the classroom. We should make sure that these moments are harnessed and fostered even more so next year, and the texts and professors should be geared not only at driving the correct points of the texts but at evincing the ideas of the student.",
                "I love the DS format and feel like I learned a lot. I do wish that the essay assignments allowed for more creativity and originality; I felt as though all I was asked to do was restate what the authors said in my own words, which was not particularly exciting.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of material weaknesses: does not go in great depth\r\nI wish the reason why we were studying Nietzsche in both HP and Philosophy was a bit more explicit because we basically covered the same topics in both classes.",
                "A great class -- loved the syllabus, lectures, etc. Political theory is a great thing for those interested in philosophy, history, politics, and the humanities more broadly.",
                "Strengths: material, especially how it builds off past material\r\nWeaknesses: pace, but that is inevitable",
                "Sometimes I felt that the readings were a little disconnected, as in we would read a litany of excerpts which could be jarring. However, given the very long nature of the works, I'm not sure this could be resolved without assigning excessive amounts of reading.",
                "guiding questions for readings prior to class were definitely helpful in understanding the main take away in sections. Also the feedback on essays was quite broad and made a general comments or pointed a further question rather than explaining concretely how and where I could argument better, and which part lacked which explanation -- something I needed help with."

The foundational works of political philosophy are essential to anyone who wants to understand global politics and effectively participate in it as a politician or citizen. The course enhanced my understanding of the role of civilization, the nation state, the global order, and my place in it.",

                "100% yes -- take this class if you have any interest in history, politics, etc.",
                "Absolutely. This was my favorite track of directed studies, despite initially thinking it would be my least favorite. It goes far beyond history or politics and into how to live.",
                "Like all other DS courses, I would be willing to recommend this course to anyone who wants a crash course on Western political thought. It is intense, but ultimately one is able to learn a breadth of information unparalleled in almost any other course.",
                "If you love reading complex texts that discuss very vast yet fundamental terms such as freedom, justice, virtue, morality then this course is definitely for you. It is challenging but strongly rewarding in many ways. It will improve your analytical , writing, reading and argumentative skills."
