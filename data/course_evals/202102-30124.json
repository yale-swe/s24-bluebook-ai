                "I gained a broad and deep understanding of ethics, both in terms of the views of historically important philosophers, such as Bentham and Kant, and in terms of the development of my own thinking about how I should live. Through many discussions, during class and after, and writing, both low stakes and graded, as well as through argument mapping, I developed my ability to analyze, synthesize, critically evaluate, and creatively develop philosophical views and arguments. The valuable insights I gained are numerous. This course has inspired me to further pursue several areas of research, including how ethics may be founded on love, and unconscious moral choices.",
                "I learned a lot this summer: how to construct solid philosophical arguments, how to evaluate our world in terms of various academic ethical systems, how to properly discuss philosophy in a group setting, and more. I really loved the course.",
                "Understanding towards some basic Ethics theories, and improvements in writing skills. I was also able to have a deeper understanding of Kantian philosophy and free will."

                "Strengths are that it's incredibly organized. Weaknesses are that the in-class discussions didn't always connect with the essay prompt assignments.",
                "This course was extremely engaging and I found the class discussions to be a great way to learn more about the readings and philosophies that we studied. I had trouble with fully understanding the works, so being able to hear other students' opinions and takes made me feel much more confident in the information",
                "This was an extremely engaging course that was heavily discussion based, which helped me develop my critical thinking skills as well as staying highly engaged in class. Not much to improve!",
                "Strengths: Engaging instructors. Class was well-structured.\r\nWeakness: Despite it being an introductory course, sometimes it felt as if the instructors expect you to have some background knowledge already.",
                "Strengths: open class environment made it easy to participate; good balance of student and professor led discussions\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of material to cover in a short period of time which at times led to superficial conversation",
                "The course is very strong and I can't think of any weaknesses",
                "Strengths\r\n1) Plenty of time dedicated towards discussions and debates \r\n2) Excellent help from instructors when asking questions \/ seeking help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1) Not enough time dedicated to lectures (almost none) or active content loading\r\n2) No formal introduction \/ class instruction on writing philosophy papers",
                "I thought the course was structured very well  there was a good balance between short lectures, discussions, writing activities, and personal working time. Although I understand that there was a lot of material to fit into five weeks, the fast-paced nature of the course made it a bit hard to absorb all the information.",
                "This course far exceeded my expectations, and I had high expectations. The readings were all interesting, inter-connected, and a good balance of levels of difficulty. Practicing argument analysis mapping and writing skills in parallel to reflections on and discussions of readings accelerated the development of those skills and our processing of course content. The seminar format, both with students calling on other students, and students called on by the instructor, was also a good match for course content. This format helped us to develop our own opinions on ethical ideas and arguments, and to reflect on our degrees of confidence in our views. Student collaborations were very enthusiastic and productive. The course was artfully and highly efficiently structured to fit the compressed summer schedule. My only wish is that the course would have been longer, just because it was so interesting and important.",
                "I really enjoyed how it was very discussion based. I really do love the course content and the instruction provided by Dr. Mapps and Dr. Hall. No weaknesses :)",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the course's attention towards writing, which is an important part of philosophy that gets ignored a lot. Also, the communication with teachers during office hours helped a lot in the course's learning process. The weakness of this course was mainly on the limited amount of time that we had, which was due to the fact that the course was during summer."

                "Yes. Lovely discussion with extremely interesting topics. Reading was actually fun and the writing was open ended so that engagement was very high",

Furthermore, if the student is interested in debate\/discussion based learning, this course would be a perfect fit. On the other hand, if the student preferred to learn through lectures \/ formal content learning, then this course may not be the best option.",

This course is an opportunity to reflect on ones values and how they relate to ones actions and life plan - with expert reasoning guidance. By thinking through ones own ethical views, one makes them, ones actions, and life, more fully ones own. It is a deeply beneficial intellectual challenge with important implications for student careers and fields of study.",
                "Yes definitely. This was one of my favorite courses. I would also recommend the two instructors to other students.",
                "Yes, I will recommend the course to students who are interested in philosophy but have limited knowledge of ethics. This is because the course's main focus was ethics and during the course, I was able to learn a lot about ethics, which helped in expanding my own philosophy knowledge system. Also, the difficulty of the course was suitable for new philosophy learners."
