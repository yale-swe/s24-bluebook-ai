Greater ability to connect such arguments to wider historical, economic, social, political, and philosophical contexts, and to synthesize such contextual information into arguments about gender, sex, and sexuality.",
                "This course introduced me to what academia is like on a broader scale. This familiarized me with the language used to discuss academic concepts and engage with literature on an incredibly theoretical level. I think that the course content is incredibly necessary and super valuable to anyone who takes this class. It's essential knowledge that should be informing the ways in which everyone approaches their respective disciplines. This course challenged me in a plentitude of forms and led me to really reconsider the ways that I perceive and navigate.",
                "I learned so much about how to think about gender, the experiences of transgender individuals, the uncertainty of gendered existences in general, ways of doing scholarship and ethnographic research about gender and the ethics of various kinds of such research, and the history of transgender as we know it. I also learned a lot about how to voice my opinions about trans issues respectfully and honestly as a cis woman (and in a primarily gender queer space).",
                "Intro to trans studies and gender theory",
                "This class was a fabulous introduction to trans studies and gender theory historically and through a modern lens. I learned how to write and read about these kinds of theories as well as their overlaps and intersections with areas of study such as Black studies, indigenous studies, queer studies, women's studies, feminism, history, and medicine. I gained insight from readings and movies as well as my peers, the TF, and Greta.",

There were a bunch of fantastic readings from a wide array of authors, which, if you're looking to get into gender/sexuality studies at all, you must read.",

            "comments": [
                "This was quite possibly my favorite class I have ever taken. I loved this course. I felt that Professor LaFleur was very good at balancing allowing us to speak about what we wanted to talk about and steering the class in a productive direction, although I sometimes felt like we didn't get to interesting parts of the readings because we would get stuck on a place where we had a lot to say because it was simpler than the heart of the readings. I don't know how much scholarship there is on this at this point, but I would be curious to read about how non-binary identities are/are not shaping/changing trans studies/activism/understanding.",
                "Strengths: Wide selection of challenging, meaningful, and insightful texts; a good amount of fiction and popular writing, but also, appropriately, a focus on academic writing. A good mix of foundational texts with great impact and more marginal, counter-narrative texts. Professor LaFleur does well explaining the argumentative thrust of more challenging pieces and encourages students to connect their arguments to specific moments in the texts. The amount we had to read felt appropriate.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions sometimes departed from the texts in unconstructive ways, especially personal feelings unconnected with larger course questions. Professor LaFleur asked students a couple times to connect their points to shared texts or ideas but was, understandably, reluctant to divert students from sharing their personal experiences and opinions.",
                "Unfortunately, there was not much literature on Asian experiences. However, this course touched on an immensely broad breadth of experiences. The professor has worked carefully to craft this course to be as seamless as possible. I find that the structure of the course did not work as well for me, because I learn best when working reverse-chronologically; I was a bit lost later in the semester as we read literature that referred to texts that we had analyzed previously because I had struggled to grasp the context and material of that older material. In general, I think that these texts can really benefit from a lot of context before we start reading them because I found myself really frustrated as I tried to parse out what the literature was saying. \r\nI think that the demographic of the seminar contributes significantly to the enjoyment of this course. There were a lot of strange dynamics that occurred with this group that made conversations feel uncomfortable. Part of it is because of the language divide for those who are upperclassmen and have taken several courses in these disciplines and have familiarized themselves with the vocabulary to discuss these texts and then those who are underclassmen who are grappling with how they should read, understand, and discuss the texts in a form deemed acceptable to the academic language. Additionally, it can feel incredibly uncomfortable to discuss these texts if one is a part of the marginalized identity that is discussed during that day. There is such a heavy focus on the theoretical and it can often feel as if there is an active discouragement to consider these texts in practice, particularly with what these texts mean for the every day and what they should actually /do./ It's difficult to have those kinds of conversations in this class, but it's also generally difficult to be in this class. There is a high level of academic rigor and you really have to be incredibly engaged with every single second of the course if you want to be able to say anything that you're confident in. It really shows when someone has not done the readings; this is not a seminar you can skate through. \r\nThat being said, I think that I really do value the time that I dedicated into this course because I know that I came out the other end of it far more knowledgable. It's like cough medicine; it hurts and sucks to take it, but you know it's going to help you. It takes a massive amount of humility to take this class because you have to get really comfortable being wrong and questioning the ways that you think about writing, literature, and, of course, gender, but also a ton of different power structures that are also related to these dynamics.",
                "The readings were fantastic, as were discussions. I loved the nature of our assignments (apart from the TikTok assignment which was fun, but, ultimately a bit inane and certainly too heavily weighted) and the way there were plenty of small assignments throughout. The reading responses were a great way for me Tian to ally engage with very difficult readings and form my own thoughts about them before discussion. I think perhaps a discussion format that involves less lists of speakers waiting to speak and was more free-flowing would have been nice, though I understand that everyone was always eager to speak.",
                "A great strength is that the syllabus is really varied in terms of types of texts assigned. I loved having films, novels, and intellectual works assigned throughout the semester. The reading responses are also a great way to get students to really digest the readings before coming to class. \r\n\r\nAs far as improvements go, I love that this course is a seminar, but it seemed that there was generally a pretty harsh divide between class years (of course with some exceptions) in terms of level of preparedness for a theory-based seminar. I wonder if students may get more out of this course if it was at least recommended as a higher-level seminar for juniors and seniors. \r\n\r\nAnd one more tiny note: it would be great to update the syllabus with themes or units for the week so that students can understand where we're headed.",
                "This class was so interesting! I loved going to class every week, and the readings were really fascinating. Difficult issues were approached with care but not fear, giving us the chance to really investigate them as well as the emotions and controversies they evoke. I think the structure of bi-weekly response papers forced me to think deeply about those readings in the context of previous readings without it becoming a chore. Additionally, the variety of assignments (reading responses, Wikipedia page, tik tok, final paper) kept the class engaging and gave me a chance to explore the content in a variety of mediums.",
                "I loved the clarity on readings and assignments, and I enjoyed the variety in readings, films, and discussions. All of the content was great. I think class time could have been made more interesting if there had been a little bit more reining-in of discussion about personal experience / if the content of class time had been more grounded in the readings themselves. However I understand that is not 100% Greta's fault.",
                "The readings were organized really well. I also enjoyed the assignments in this class - the Wikipedia and TikTok assignments were a fun and engaging way to bring trans knowledge to the mainstream  I thought I was getting much more out of them than writing a paper only an instructor would see.",
                "Strengths: How we managed to simultaneously cover both a lot of material, as well as go into that material in-depth. There were also a bunch of course assignments that felt really relevant to our modern situation (making a TikTok, writing a Wikipedia page on something trans-related). The course also drew very intentionally away from frameworks of white transness or white feminismwhile we talked about those viewpoints, we did focus on a decolonial sort of discussion of gender as our main ideology. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nDiscussions at times were a bit hard to follow? The way that the seminar ran was that people would raise their hands to speak, Professor LaFleur would note down everybody who wanted to speak, and then discussion would follow in that order, with people who raised their hands afterwards getting added to the queue. But oftentimes, that meant that the first person would say something about topic A, and then the four people afterwards would talk about a different topic, and the sixth person who wanted to respond to the first person about topic A had no way to actually segue the conversation into talking about it. \r\nAlso, while I understand that it was important to cover a lot of material, I did think that there were too many readings. We hit 70-80 pages per class regularly, and with 2 classes per week, it was very hard to keep up with all of the readings.",
                "I thought that some of the assignments were a bit open ended, however any questions were answered quickly and fully."

                "Yes: If you're interested in engaging politically with questions of gender that are often presented to media consumers as depoliticized, this class will provide you with the tools to do so.",
                "Most definitely. As much as this class tossed me through the ringer, I know that I would take it again a hundred times over. Especially because I know that if I were to take it a hundred times over, I would learn something new every time! You learn so much from this class and the curated texts are so valuable far beyond the course. I know that I am going to continually revisit the knowledge that I acquired from this class.",
                "Yes! Its a great gender theory class for anyone who either has taken lots of gender theory or hasnt at all. I loved the readings, Professor LaFleur, and found the class to be a very safe, welcoming and patient space in which to work through sometimes contentious and always difficult ideas and issues.",
                "Definitely! This was such an amazing class that brought together a largely queer teaching staff and group of students. It was a safe space for students to share their personal experiences but also never felt like an echo chamber. It is a great WGSS class for anyone interested in the subject, regardless of major of background, and Greta makes it accessible for everyone to engage. This greatly expanded my understanding of gender and conversations about gender, situating it in cultural and historical debates I had never studied before. It is also a great way to learn about more media (fiction and non-ficiton) made by and about trans people and trans experiences.",
                "Yes! It's a great combo of not requiring an excessive amount of prior knowledge but also engaging with the subject material in a way that is intellectually challenging / not pedantic. Lots of good questions are asked.",
                "Yes! Prof. LaFleur is a great instructor and the readings are really interesting.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! Professor LaFleur is fantastic, and this course reframes your entire outlook on gender and sexuality and personhood. I thought I was fairly well-versed in themes of WGSS, but this course showed me just how wrong I was. Only thing is that you should be prepared to do the work; there are a lot of important readings.",
                "I would. I believe that everyone should take courses like this, which are eye opening for people with all different backgrounds and identities. The course was well organized and taught, the discussions were very welcoming and interesting, and the material was interesting and engaging."
