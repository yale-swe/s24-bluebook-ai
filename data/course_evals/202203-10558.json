A lot of people debate how we could know if AI is conscious (if you haven't heard these debates yet, you will in the next few years). This class didn't answer the question for me, but it helped me understand the debate in a much more detailed way. I think it's been surprisingly useful for that!",

There is no pressure inherent in the design of the course to do this; the material was just extremely useful for my thinking."

                "A great course, not much to suggest for improvements",
                "The strength is its style of each class, where you discuss the day's topic in little groups. This really made me think about the topic every class, and also it was interesting to hear what my classmates had to say, especially since this field has no \"right answers.\"",
                "I think this class was difficult for students who had never taken a philosophy class before. As someone who was considering majoring in cognitive science, I had no background for this philosophy class, so the adjustment to writing papers in a specific manner was difficult.",
                "Strengths: The weekly homework assignments and class discussion really enabled engagement with course material\r\n\r\nWeakness: N/A",
                "Strengths: Professor Greco! He was amazing. So knowledgable in all the topics. He also is extremely organized - creates a handout for every class which help streamline harder readings and shed light on their most important parts. Also helps raise very interesting questions. He also gives thorough feedback on papers and is more than willing to meet either to discuss a paper idea or elaborate on feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were sometimes (very) dense. Could make reading responses difficult, but wasn't too bad because you definitely don't need to fully understand the readings to raise a good question.",
                "Enjoyed the mix of discussion and lecture. Readings were all very interesting.",
                "Strengths: the format is great! I love the lecture and then discussion after. Also, the handouts are incredible  they lay everything out perfectly. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly I sort of wished there had been more time for discussion? 50 minutes of lecture and 25 minutes of discussion was great when it happened, but sometimes lecture ran long and I didn't feel like we got to talk about the topic for as long as I'd liked.",
                "The readings were interesting and engaging and Professor Greco always did a great job of synthesizing the key points in our handouts. I also felt that the weekly homework assignments were a great way to make sure I was keeping up with the class.",
                "Professor Greco's note sheets are absolutely amazing. He writes down what he is going to talk about in the most brilliant format so you can follow along with the lecture. I also really liked the class format, which was lecture followed by small group discussions.\r\n\r\nSometimes it felt like the readings varied a bit in difficulty and length, and it might have been better for them to be more spread out. But this is mostly quibbling.",
                "Strengths: Course structure was great by design: I loved the themes and readings, and assignments were reasonable in workload and flexible in choice of topics and overall efficiently helpful for learning. I especially enjoyed receiving feedback and further recommendations for my reading responses. Professor Greco is an extremely clear, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and engaging instructor. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Group discussions vary in quality and tend to be derailed. I wish this was a seminar with more moderated discussions instead."

                "Yes - it was a new way of thinking about things! The papers can definitely be a bit challenging, but there is a lot of flexibility in what you can write about, so you can structure the papers so you're writing about something you genuinely find interesting. However, proceed with caution if there is your first philosophy course - definitely did not feel introductory.",

                "If you like reading and discussing philosophy and you are interested in philosophy of mind, you will like this course. I would highly recommend it! If you think you would be bored about talking about consciousness for half a semester and reading variations and responses on the same few arguments, then maybe take a broader philosophy class. I personally really enjoyed the level of detail we went into.",
                "Highly recommend for philosophy majors (would probably also recommend for other majors, but cannot speak from my experience): even if you are not particularly interested in phil of mind (which I would think you have good reason to be), there are deep and interesting connections to metaphysics and epistemology in early modern philosophy and also features many seminal contemporary thinkers & works e.g. Fodor, Chomsky, Dennett. You have control over how much to put in this class and could learn at lot at any level of commitment (I think I put in a lot and have not hit diminishing returns)."
