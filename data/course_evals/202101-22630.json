                "great course, great content, great professor. I probably got less out of it due to its asynchronous nature, but still really enjoyed it",
                "Strengths: Prof Latham was a really engaging professor and the recorded lecture format worked for me. Also having a wonderful TA who led a great discussion.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the videos were posted a bit late, so I lost track of which video I was supposed to be watching.",
                "The combo of recorded lecture and discussion section was great for facilitating learning. The weekly reading responses allowed us to cement what we'd learned in lecture and discussed in section, and we were well prepared for all exams.",
                "The textbook is unnecessary and too expensive. It should be taken off the syllabus.",
                "The course was great - the lectures were very clear and informative and section and reading responses were really useful in absorbing the material.",
                "Very cool content\r\nLimited opportunity for prof/student interaction",
                "I would have loved to take this class in person, since the pre-recorded lectures made it feel very un-engaged. I would have loved to attend live lectures with Professor Latham, as he is clearly a talented lecturer.",
                "Very engaging content and Latham is an enthusiastic lecturer. However, sometimes the lectures would be uploaded hours or even days after the scheduled class time, which was kind of inconvenient.",
                "The material was very interesting and easy to follow. Professor Latham laid out the material in a very comprehensive way. For the virtual setting, having lectures posted consistently at the given class time would be my only recommendation for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Professor Latham is a very funny and engaging lecturer (even via prerecorded videos which is so impressive). I learned a lot, not just about bioethics, but about the U.S. legal system more broadly. The material taught in this class is so important and practical beyond the academic context.\r\nWeaknesses: My one qualm was that there were often delays with the uploading of the videos to Canvas, which was frustrating for students who wanted to watch the videos at the scheduled course time. Also, there was a lot of variability in the course depending on the TA. Some were very engaged and provided helpful supplemental materials / review sessions, while others did not.",
                "I think this course was very interesting. I learned a lot and Professor Latham was very comprehensive in lecturing the material. He made legal concepts digestible and I was able to follow everything really well. I thought the class addressed many bioethical concerns in the world and even managed to address the coronavirus crisis that made the course an online format. My only gripe with this course is that I found that it wasn't very consistent in grading. I know many people that took this class and we received grades that were very inconsistent for responses that were likely very similar as we all spent time studying together and making study guides together. Professor Latham said that he would work with TAs to maintain consistency, but this did not translate to reality unfortunately and came to the detriment of some of my friends' grades.",
                "The course would have been improved if lectures were post regularly each week (the schedule was not super organized). Also, the fact that there were no synchronous lectures made it hard to feel connected to the course and my classmates. Still, Prof. Latham is a great professor, very knowledgeable, and provided a really nice overview of bioethics law.",
                "the lectures are short and digestible. Section could be more engaging.",
                "Strengths: lots of interesting material, recorded lectures were engaging, not a demanding work load\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections can get off track from focusing on the law to discussing people's personal opinions; people can be unwelcoming to certain beliefs in discussion section. Sometimes, the way contentious material is presented in lecture is politically biased.",
                "This was the best virtual course I have taken, and I expect (and hope) that it always will be. Prof. Latham's recorded lectures were of a digestible size and were consistently funny, entertaining, interesting, and I left every single one of them feeling that I had learned something valuable. This semester of PLSC 257 should be a model for how every virtual course should be moving forward.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Latham is a great lecturer. And there is not a huge amount of workload in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Mandatory section requirement, my TA was unenthusiastic, and the essay-based exams that determine the whole grade seem a bit nerve-wracking.",
                "loved professor lathem and his teaching style, even though it was a recorded lecture he still made each video very entertaining and interesting to watch and learn",
                "A weakness of the course is that it felt like it did require a bit of background on the topics although the course syllabus said it did not. A strength of the course was that it was well organized.",
                "Strengths - Professor Latham is an incredible Professor, very funny, and clearly genuinely cares about his students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish that the lecture format could have been a live lecture so that it would have felt less impersonal in this semester of virtual learning and some technical issues might have been avoided.",

                "Professor Latham was often extremely late in posting the videos and occasionally neglected to post them entirely for days at a time. I found this very frustrating, and it seemed like the TFs were also left in the dark about the upload delays as well. Additionally, there was no engagement from Professor Latham beyond these recorded videos. I wish he would have at least popped into section once during the semester. The supplemental readings were almost always mentioned in passing during lectures  the reading was far too much for far too little engagement with them. Supplemental readings posted to Canvas were unorganized, and I found it hard to know exactly what to read for each class because the syllabus was very vague. Course content was very shallow. Many of the exciting nuances about bioethics topics were skipped entirely in favor of broad gestures toward the law.",

                "Strengths:\r\n-Very interesting material (that made me think critically about my own life choices)\r\n-Engaging lectures that were very informative and well organized\r\n-An active section with a great TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Recorded lectures are just tough to keep up with in general (I tend to be more motivated when there's a synchronous option)\r\n-Sometimes I wished the grading was more clear (or entered in Canvas) -- I don't really understand the A-/A or B+/A- format of grading, but maybe that's just me",
                "The lectures were very well structured and easy to follow.",
                "This course was fantastic!!!",
                "Recordings are tough to engage with, but also nice because you can listen to them anytime! This course is incredibly TA-dependent (but sort of the nature of a course this large).",
                "Professor Latham was a very engaging lecturer! I enjoyed all of his jokes very much. The sections were also a helpful recap of the lectures.",
                "I definitely think I missed a lot from not being in person because it could get easy to get behind on the lectures. I tried to make up for it by reading the textbook but a lot of the times the assigned reading was too long and hard to remember/understand. I still really liked the discussion and lectures.",
                "Professor Latham is a very engaging lecturer and the class delivers a satisfying overview of the main legal issues of bioethics. Section sometimes feels like a chore and doesn't add much to the class as a whole.",
                "Strengths: The professor and the interesting concepts. Professor Latham is so dedicated to the concepts and passionate about the topics.",
                "Strength: Recorded lectures were so, so, so, so helpful to me. I really needed the ability to rewind or pause to write down notes. I've definitely had one of the highest levels of lecture comprehension in this class, because I was able to go over topics I needed to and subtitles were also really helpful (I'm very much a visual learner rather than auditory). I've also probably taken the best notes I've had in a class because of recorded lectures as well (which were extremely helpful for the exams). I hope that this class will be able to provide a recorded version in future classes, even if it's in person.",
                "This course taught me many valuable lessons about various topics of the health system around the world and various ways by which an ethical system is reasoned and justified. The large number of court cases introduced provided a close connection to the law aspect of bioethics.",
                "Loved this class",
                "Strength: highly interesting and new concepts. Lectures were captivating at every second and well organized.\r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Professor Latham is really awesome and engaging. The topics are all super interesting and relevant.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the course was a bit disorganized, because there was some repeated material between lectures and they sometimes didn't feel super planned out. Also, it would be really helpful if there could be a list of the relevant court cases from each lecture because sometimes I didn't know how the cases were spelled as I was trying to take notes.",
                "Strengths: Prof Latham gives fantastic lectures! Weaknesses: none other than that it's difficult to run a big lecture in a virtual setting",
                "Good material. Lectures were clear and engaging",
                "The biggest weakest of the course is that there are no opportunities outside of the exams to improve our grades. I don't believe that the exams are an accurate reflection of how much effort a student puts into the course, especially depending on who your TF is.",
                "The lectures, even though they were recorded, were very engaging and well-organized. I also enjoyed how the course incorporated recent events, including COVID, into the content. Overall, I can't think of how the course could be improvedit even had me considering going to law school!",
                "This course was very thorough and straightforward in the way the material was taught. I appreciated the relevance of the course and the inclusion of a discussion about the pandemic. However, the recorded lecture videos were inconsistently posted and were often not available on canvas by class time, which made planning the rest of the day frustrating. Return of assignments also took longer than expected.",
                "The grading system is really weird. The entirety of our grades is determined by exams, even though we have lots of other work to do. The final should be worth less than 50% and the weekly readings responses should actually count for something! Otherwise it puts wayyyy too much pressure on the exams.",
                "Professor Latham is an excellent professor and does a great job introducing complex bioethics topics to students who have no background in the field.",
                "I thought the recorded lecture format of the class was convenient, and Professor Latham delivered great lectures for us to take notes on. They were clear, concise, contained plenty of details and examples, and offered some personal opinions as well which was refreshing. Sometimes, he was late with his uploads, which was likely a technology issue but made it difficult for students to get caught up before discussion sections. This was the largest issue with the class, but overall, I had a positive experience.",
                "Great instruction, absolutely loved the professors. Thought the readings were a bit much. Also, the discrepancy between the TFs was too big. The TF I had was too harsh in grading, and other TFs were too easy.",
                "I wish we had some intro into how to read legal writings. I frankly could not understand the textbook.",
                "The professor is a very interesting lecturer, the TFs are phenomenal, and the exams are reasonable (and dare I say, even fun?). The concepts are fascinating, and I can see why many people say this is a must-take. But, online I was never able to meet Prof Latham, and I found readings to be fairly unnecessary to actually being engaged and doing well in the class",
                "strengths: interesting material, well-organized in lectures\r\nweaknesses: recorded lecture made it difficult to engage, slides to accompany lectures would've been helpful, as I am a visual learner",
                "Best class Ive taken at Yale!",
                "strengths: very interesting, great lectures, well-organized, clear expectation",
                "I think the recorded lectures were great! The only problem I had was that the videos would show up on Canvas a day or two late and would mess up my schedule. Discussion sections vary by TA. I liked that we were allowed to miss 2 discussion posts (really came in handy this semester).",
                "I wish we had live lectures, but the virtual lectures were done very well and I feel like I truly learned.",
                "Strengths: nice professor, TAs, and cool material\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were office hours or live lectures, exams didn't really have much guidance on what they were looking for",
                "The content of the course is good, and the lectures went along well with the reading.",
                "This course is very interesting and well taught, and I really enjoyed learning a new subject from Professor Latham. I would say the only weakness was the format of the tests, which were live open note essays, the criteria for which were not always clear, but I assume that was a result of having to be virtual and not standard for the course.",
                "Stephen Latham is a massive strength of this course. Even though it was virtual he was still really engaging and his lectures were fascinating. I appreciated that they were uploaded in 20min chunks rather than an hour and a half of straight information.",
                "A strength was Professor Latham and the content--I felt that he did a great job of explaining things and the content was interesting. A weakness was that there was no real clear guidance on how to do well on the exams.",
                "professor L is a great lecturer very engaging, think readings could be more interesting and cover more sides of issues (e.g. exposing us to the controversial viewpoints or debates rather than summaries)",
                "weakness - lectures being recorded is convenient, but sometimes deviated from the schedule or were posted a few days late, making it hard to plan schedules",
                "Professor Latham is the best and it is so so interesting. No weaknesses. Would have loved to see it live but I liked being able to re-listen to prof Latham in a podcast format!",
                "This is the perfect Yale class in my opinion.",
                "This was a fantastic course. It was typical lecture style. Professor Latham is an awesome professor and makes retaining the information easy. It's a really, really interesting course and would definitely recommend taking it.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material. Well-organized. Amazing professor and TAs.",
                "This course has amazing, fascinating material and Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer but the online recorded lecture format this year was a little less engaging than I had hoped.",
                "Strengths - good introduction to a lot of the legal background of bioethics, great lecturer\r\nWeaknesses - perhaps more grades than just exams would be better; also discussion sections weren't too engaging this semester",
                "This course was relatively low workload, but it would have been nice for the grading to be more reliant on participation in discussion section than just on the midterms and finals. The discussions sometimes fell flat and students didnt show up to section, so I also think itd be more engaging if the lectures were live rather than recordedotherwise it kind of just felt like a lot of work being done on your own."

                "It was fine",
                "This was a disappointing class. Professor Latham split each module into a series of videos of varying length. But these videos were divided in confusing ways and were uploaded inconsistently. His creativity in having a greenscreen background for each video was welcome, but I would have preferred if he posted the videos on-time and ditched the funky background. Working in this class from California between several other commitments, I found it aggravating that the course content was so sporadic and inconsistent.",

                "I highly enjoyed the lectures in this course, but the nature of recorded lectures is that sometimes its difficult to stay motivated enough to stay on track. That said, there were some advantages to this as well-- sometimes, I would be having a really tough academic week, and the recorded lectures allowed me to focus on other coursework during the week, and then watch lectures on the weekends (and still retain the same amount of knowledge, but at my convenience). Also, the nature of having a weekly reading response and 2 midterms made it nearly impossible to fall too far behind. I always caught up with lectures by the start of section, simply because I had to know topics in order to write reading responses.",

The material was very interesting, and discussion section was full of different opinions and debate, but the exams are graded pretty subjectively. My TA literally said that the differences between an A, A-, and B+ were very slim. It's difficult to excel, but it's also difficult to do poorly. The subject matter was really very fascinating though.",

It is very interesting material and Professor Latham is a very intelligent man that has worked in the field of bioethics in the past. I did think the material was interesting, however, my primary motivation in taking this course was its popularity. I'm not sure if it was the online format, but I found that this course fell short of the raving reviews it has. I wish I could have experienced this class in person as discourse with students and Latham in a live environment would like make this course ten times better.",

Why assign 100+ pages of a dense casebook on top of a smattering of supplemental readings on top of weekly discussion posts, only to never discuss the readings? You're not even graded on these discussion posts. They don't factor into your grade at all. I don't think I ever received a grade in this class. I had to ask my TF after section to get a vague answer for my midterm grades. Never received detailed feedback. It seemed like Professor Latham was negligent in answering my TF's questions, because it seemed like even he was puzzled about what was going on in the class logistically.",

I had never thought about what choice I would make in certain medical situations before this course, and now I feel like I have a better understanding of my own ethics when it comes to healthcare. Professor Latham is extremely knowledgeable, and is an engaging speaker who clearly cares about student learning. I would recommend this course to anyone!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in medicine, law, or simply want to be more informed for your own life, this class is a must-take. You learn a lot about why the US functions the way it does when it comes to medicine.",

                "Yes! It opened a whole different perspective on topics such as healthcare, abortion, assisted reproduction, assisted death, organ donation, and public health. it a MUST TAKE class for all Yale students and I highly recommend it.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend. I finally understood the healthcare landscape, and each bioethics issue was so interesting. The court cases were also a really nice way for me to analyze this type of literature.",
                "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed many aspects of it. The lectures were great.",
                "Definitely, I feel like everyone should know on some level the legal cases surrounding health that affect us all.",
                "Yes! This class made me think so differently about health as it relates to law, ethics, myself, and the world population. Professor Latham is an incredible professor, and the topics are both appropriate and fascinating.",
                "Yes absolutely!! The topics covered are all really interesting and relevant. Additionally, Professor Latham is a great lecturer (even through recorded lectures, I felt engaged).",
                "Yesit's fun and you learn a lot about the legal system",
                "Yes! Great class. Professor is very knowledgeable",
                "Honestly, I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to another student. Prof. Latham was an excellent lecturer, and I truly enjoyed reading the course materials. However, I didn't appreciate that our grades were completely dependent on the exams, especially given that my TF cancelled the three or so \"mandatory\" sections leading up to the final exam worth 50% of the grade (and he refused to host a study session before the exam).",
                "Would definitely recommend for anyone! A fascinating and very applicable course that is not too difficult or heavy in terms of workload.",
                "Yes, I would! It is super interesting and super relevant. I think it will make students consider things that they hadn't necessarily otherwise considered. It reveals a lot of the nuances with medicine and law that typically are overlooked. I think if a student is interested in the way precedent case determine a lot of the logic that is used today they would be successful in this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone because the issues discussed are not only pertinent to the field of bioethics, law, and legislation but because they concern issues that most people will face in their life eventually. The professor did a great job of framing the topics of this course in this way to highlight their overall importance in helping people determine where their values align when it comes to bioethics issues.",
                "Probably. I would warn them about the final being 50% of our grade and the weekly reading responses not counting for a grade but still being mandatory.",
                "Yes! I absolutely loved this course and would recommend it to anyone!",
                "Definitely. This class is very relevant to anybody interested in medicine and politics, as well as anybody who has an interest in engaging in recreation political discussion. I thought the class did a great job covering high-level concepts and properly discussing more landmark cases, like Roe vs Wade, in detail. The course also gave a lot of good supplementary readings for those who are more interested, and discussion sections were a great opportunity to discuss and learn more.",
                "Definitely. Very informative - I came out of the class knowing a lot more about the healthcare system and bioethics.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in this kind of subject. Prof. Latham is great. Wouldn't take it if you just want a 5th credit; your grade is too dependent on what TF you have for it to be a gut.",
                "I would recommend this to another student who is looking for a low-stress Credit/D/F. The course material is also quite interesting.",
                "Easy A-, but you have to work for the A.",
                "Yes! I think its a really well-done class and the concepts are super interesting and applicable to know",
                "Absolutely! Interesting (and increasingly relevant) content, delivered in an engaging way. 10/10.",
                "yes, if you're interested in the material",
                "Absolutely! So interesting",
                "YES-great lectures and manageable workload",
                "Yes! Important and interesting topics",
                "yes!",
                "Yes!! The workload isn't too bad, but you do have to put in work to get an A in the class. The course is very interesting and you get the chance to talk about different medical issues that are prevalent in our society today.",
                "Yes!! It's so useful for anything health related and is taught super well! You'll have a good time in this course.",
                "Yes!  Really cool stuff.  I definitely recommend this course to anyone thinking about law school because you can set this course up to treat it like a law course with the casebook and outlining.",
                "For sure!!! A Yale classic",
                "Yes I would, especially if you are interested in learning about law and/or bioethics and want a simple class where you can do that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Its a great and low stress way to learn about bioethics and law form Professor Latham, a true expert, and is very interesting without having too heavy a workload.",
                "YES! You learn so much about important and topical subjects in a low pressure environment. The course was extremely enjoyable online so I can't even imagine how great it is in person:)",
                "It's a great class to take Credit/D/Fail; I feel like I got to learn a lot about bioethics when I otherwise wouldn't have been able to. It might be difficult to pull out an A, though. It's not necessarily a gut.",
                "definitely - super super super interesting w relatively low work, u think u know ab us health and legal systems but dont really, viewpoints may be changed",
                "Absolutely! Very interesting, very well taught, manageable workload. Its nice not to worry about endless assignments and genuinely enjoy the content",
                "Absolutely, everyone should take this course.",
                "Yes absolutely! Like I said, Professor Latham is absolutely wonderful and the course content is really interesting.",
                "Yes",
                "YES!!! 100% take this class!!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I will remember a lot of the topics we covered, and as a pre-med student, I believe I gained a lot of important perspective.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. The lectures are very clear and easy to follow and the material is interesting and relevant. If you are looking for an easy fifth class this is it",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but would warn them that the grading of the course is not super forgiving since the only grades are three exams.",
                "Yes!!! Prof. Latham is a great lecturer, even recorded. Hes entertaining and provides just the right amount of information ona topic. Its a gutty class, but be warned that the midterms/finals are graded a bit harshly sometimes. So even though its low workload and also really interesting material, its important to not completely slack off since the final is 50% of your grade."
