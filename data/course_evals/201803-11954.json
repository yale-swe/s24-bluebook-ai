    "I know there are spanish tutors, but they can only meet with each student for a total of 10 hours throughout the semester. I dont believe this is enough for a language.",
    "strength is that the teacher encourages everyone to participate.",
    "Strengths: Taught very well (get Valle if you can, she's incredible), reasonably paced, reasonably difficult\r\nWeaknesses: None really",
    "I think the course was well structured. The textbook was extremely helpful. I dont think the course packet was necessary, since I felt we did not use it much nor did it contribute to me learning the language better.",
    "I really enjoyed how interactive this class was, and it forced me to be engaged and prepared for each day of class.",
    "This course was very well taught and quite enjoyable. It could be improved by more support in listening exercises.",
    "Strengths would be the teacher and its a very small class which encourages talking\r\nWeakness would be the VHL",
    "Strengths was that I thoroughly enjoyed the course because it was at a good level for me. I didn't have a weakness because I liked my partner in class very much, and the class had a very fun atmosphere which is important for something as foreign as a foreign language."

    "It is alot of work, but you get to learn Spanish very well.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes if you want to learn Spanish. Definitely not an incredibly difficult course. Great to take in your first semester of freshman year.",
    "Yes, I would recommend because it is a good introduction course to the language.",
    "If a student has any interest in spanish, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I feel very confident in my spanish-speaking skills currently.",
    "Yes, SPAN 110 was fantastic and engaging.",
    "Yes, very fun",
    "Yes, I think it is very useful to learn another language, especially Spanish. This is a good way to see if you would like to pursue language further at this college, but it is also a lot of effort because the class is everyday and we moved through a lot of material quickly."
