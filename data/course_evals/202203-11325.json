The first part of the course focused on rigorously extending single variable analysis concepts, namely rigorously defining mutli-dimensional derivatives, along with the inverse and implicit function theorems. Similarly, the second part extended the idea of Riemann integration to multiple dimensions, with key concepts including Fubinis theorem and the change of variables formula. Finally, the manifolds section (by far the most substantial), included definition and intuition regarding manifolds with and without boundary, along with discussions of tangent spaces, integration over manifolds, exterior algebra, differential forms, and Generalized Stokes Theorem. More generally, this course was a combination of a proof-based multivariable calculus course and a general introduction to manifolds; it gives you a good overall and theoretical understanding of all these concepts, with a mix of proof and application-based practice problems. Additionally, you develop good general mathematical problem solving skills and timed exam skills, as the homeworks and exams in particular are fairly rigorous."

                "This course was taught very well and the professor was both very knowledgable and able to teach the content well, something that is hard to come by here.",
                "Strengths: Neitzke is a great Professor. Hes very engaging, open to questions, and good at giving intuition behind the math. \r\n\r\nBecause this was only its second time being taught, I wasnt too excited about the format; a lot of the theories of integration we developed felt a little unmotivated, and the last portion of the class (dual spaces, differential forms, and Stokes thm) felt a little out of nowhere. The class went really quickly, and it felt a little too focused on volume of material rather than depth. I also found myself wishing the psets were slightly less computationally driven, as I think I didnt get as deep an understanding for the material through those types of questions. \r\n\r\nAll that being said, I still enjoyed the course, and suspect it will continue to get better each semester!",
                "Prof. Neitzke is an intelligent lecturer whose presentation of the material was clear and understandable. However, given the advanced difficulty of the material, I think it would have been helpful if he had more clearly delineated which information (i.e. which theorems, propositions, lemmas, etc.) were most conceptually important. Many of the propositions we proved were primarily used as stepping stones to reach more important conclusions, and when sifting through all the dense material to study for exams or work on problem sets, my time could have been spent far more efficiently had I known where to focus my energy.",
                "Neitzke is a great professor and the notes he made for this class were very helpful",
                "Strengths: Interesting and beautiful course material. Exams are open-book (!!!), and theres a good mix of computational problems and rigorous proofs. Office hours with Andy and the ULAs were relaxed and very helpful, and Andy is also extremely accommodating and great about accessibility. Having everything consolidated in the course notes was also supremely helpful. Weaknesses/possible improvements: Given all the computational problems, it wouldve been nice to have a few more examples done in class or in the notes. In particular, despite the fact that this course is supposed to not have multivariable calculus as a prereq, I still found myself having to teach myself some stuff from multi outside of class/not covered in the course notes to complete the psets. Moreover, the exams and a couple of the psets were much tougher than I expected. Fortunately, Andy is generous with curves, and getting a free one-week extension for one pset without penalty and having the lowest pset score dropped was really nice. There were also 11 psets, the last two of which were never graded. Also, its a 9am in Watson",
                "I really enjoyed the content of the course. Problem sets were pretty computational; I wish they were more proof-based as that probably would've helped build better conceptual understanding. Exams were very difficult but thankfully open notes. Lectures were also very interesting, though they moved at a pretty fast pace that sometimes made them very hard to keep up with, so I felt that I lacked the intuition behind a lot of what we were doing till the end of the course.",
                "Strengths: I think the course is designed very well to ease into the content, and provided a lot of support and scaffolding for the material. The definitions are reiterated with numerous examples, the problem sets give a lot of space to play with the definitions and see how to apply them, etc. I think the course also made me think a lot  - the content has a lot of connections to physics/geometry/topology, and seeing a lot of the connections hinted at was really cool. I think the workload was overall pretty manageable, we did get a problem set a week but I didn't find them as heavy as some of my other math classes (though this will vary based on your background). I also think there was a lot of support offered (office hours, ed discussion, etc.) that was very helpful. Overall, I really learned a lot and enjoyed this class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main thing I thought could be improved was maybe the exams - the midterms both felt a bit long, and in my opinion the point distributions made it so that losing a couple points could be quite drastic. This was mostly OK for short answer questions with partial credit, but there were also, e.g., true/false sections which were just hit-or-miss. (I didn't really like true/false questions, they weren't like the problems offered on the problem sets and I wasn't sure what skill they were testing/without partial credit offered for them they felt somewhat punitive compared to the rest of the test.) Overall though I felt that the exams were mostly fair.",
                "The course notes were top-tier and made the course feel like a story that you were going along with for a ride with. Im not sure if hes taught this course before but if he could expand on these notes with more examples and demonstrations, there would be no doubt in my mind that I would have mastered the content in the course. It wouldve been great to review the lectures afterwards if they were recorded but otherwise big fan",
                "Just be ready, content difficulty is very back heavy, don't grow complacent.",
                "Strengths: Clearly taught! Including nice use of pictures. The material builds gradually in a well-organized way. We spend just the right amount of time on each major concept to get an intuition for it before moving on to the next. The problem sets are very reasonable. Having a PDF with notes for the entire course from the professor was extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Overall, I'd say none! There is just one tiny detail: Especially in the second half of the course, the main challenge is simply being able to take in a barrage of new definitions. The course becomes less about proving things with a framework we already have, and more about expanding our framework to ever-more general situations. This isn't a problem---but it did catch me by surprise, and it took a while for me to realize the right way to approach the material. If the professor could warn us this was coming, it might help us know what to expect from and focus on during lecture.",
                "This class is an excellent overview of the topic and strikes a great balance between covering a lot of content in depth and remaining somewhat approachable. Professor Neitzke is a very good lecturer and makes things very clear. My only complaint is that the density of problem sets was very high (including one due after classes were over).",
                "I think this course is too dense. It tries to cover a lot of information very quickly, making it difficult for students to build the theoretical foundations needed to get to the big results of the course. For example, many of my peers never really understood exterior algebra, and it took many many explanations beyond the course for me to get even a rudimentary understanding. If the density of the class can't be changed, it would be best to spend a lot more time motivating the machinery needed to get to big results. I think being able to connect all of the elements of the course with more guidance would help students understand what they're doing and why.",
                "Strengths: very clear and engaging lectures, really well written course notes, highly interesting material.",
                "Strengths: reasonable psets, helpful professor, interesting content, useful course notes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt rushed at the end (didnt prove Stokes theorem or really examine applications), difficult exams",
                "I really enjoyed this course! A big strength was the course notes, and the lectures were very clear too. ULAs were also super nice and helpful.",
                "The class is well structured and the notes from lectures are very helpful and clear. The psets are very relevant to the material, however it would be nice to first give some topics on psets before giving them on exams so we could have some practice.",
                "This course was interesting, but there were way too many p-sets over the course of the semester and so it was difficult to keep up with the new content and internalize what youve already learned since you move on so fast. Of course there are always exceptions but I felt like the class was basically impossible without going to a LOT of office hours.",
                "This course was very interesting but went pretty fast for the amount of material.",
                "This course does a great job of formalizing the theory behind a multivariable calculus course. The problem sets reinforce the class material very well, and its important to dedicate significant time to them  in Fall 2022, this course assigned 14 standard length problem sets (three of which we didnt have to turn in, but each of those three covered entirely new content that was important for upcoming exams, so its important to do all 14 thoroughly.)",
                "Overall, I enjoyed the course. Its emphasis on working with computational examples to get a feel for the abstract concepts was very helpful. However, I think it moved a little quickly and could have benefited from another few weeks or a little bit less content to really cover everything at a more reasonable pace. I feel like we really accelerated after the second midterm, and I wish we spent more time building intuition instead. The lectures were generally interesting. The most helpful lectures spent more time on examples and intuition and less time on proving concepts that were already proven in the notes. The problem sets tended to be useful.",
                "Incredible lecture notes, and Professor Neitzke was so helpful and nice outside of class during office hours, etc",
                "Strengths of the class are that it is well-structured and Prof Neitzke teaches it really well. A weakness of the course is that it is truly really fast-paced and there are a lot of problem sets so expect to spend more time out of class for 302.",
                "The professor provided quite detailed lecture notes, which was very convenient and helpful. I found them a very useful resourceif you miss something in a lecture, or fail to take notes quickly enough, it's very easy to fill it in afterward. They had a few errors in them, but almost all were quite minor, and the professor updated the notes as the course went on.\r\n\r\nThe class is nominally proof-based, but I the level of rigor seemed slightly inconsistent in practice. There were several places where I felt that moderately important results were treated fairly informally, which was frustrating. Many of the problems on psets and exams were examples or calculations, not results requiring proof. This does reduce the workload, but I felt it made the course somewhat less interesting. For the problems that did require proof, I sometimes wasn't entirely sure what level of rigor or technical specificity was expected from our responses, especially given that some of them openly couldn't be solved without a certain amount of hand-waving (e.g. assuming that the interior of an unknown closed curve is a manifold with boundary equal to that curve, which properly should require the Jordan Curve Theorem or similar; or applying the generalized Stokes theorem to something that technically isn't a manifold under the course's definition because it has corners).",
                "In class exams should be made evening exams with higher time limits. Outside of feeling like there was no time for exams this was a perfectly run course.",
                "I think the lectures werent the most structured but the content was delivered well",
                "Very well organized, professor Neitzke's notes are very coherent and he is an engaging lecturer. The course content is also builds on itself very well.",
                "I think one more office hour per week would have been helpful",
                "The main strengths of this course were the strong overall curriculum, well-organized notes and lectures, and generally interesting and reasonable homework assignments. In general, the curriculum of this course, while relatively new, felt very logical and covered a wide breadth of useful topics. Moreover, the class notes were nicely presented in LaTeX and were usually updated before class, making it easy to follow along with the live lectures without worrying about writing down every little thing. The lectures themselves were also generally clear, with good drawings and intuition mixed in, though they sometimes got lost in small details or complexities rather than the big picture. Likewise, the homeworks were generally pretty reasonable in length (~5-10 hours) with useful proofs and application problems for understanding the content.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main weaknesses were overly time-crunched and difficult exams, a sometimes confusing sense of mathematical direction, unclear and scattered grading on early homeworks, and a few too crunched of a homework schedule. The exams were definitely the greatest source of stress and frustration, as the midterms just had too much content for the single class period afforded to us, leading to low mean scores, even if you understood the material well. Moreover, the problems were more application-based than the homeworks or notes, which was probably better given the time but were difficult to do quickly without much practice in the other coursework. I think shortening the exams and giving more practice beforehand would solve a lot of the issues (two things that did happen somewhat on the final and helped). Less pressingly, it was occasionally hard to understand why we were covering certain topics or where they fit in, often because we were only covering some small subset or application of a topic rather than the more generalized version (according to ULAs); this could maybe be improved by more closely following a textbook for the second part of the course. Additionally, while likely just an artifact of the graders, some of the early grading seemed more focused on single words or proof techniques than actually checking for valid answers; later on this was fixed with more leniency in general, avoiding unnecessary regrade requests. Finally, there felt like just a few too many homeworks were crammed into the given time, with confusing and shifting due dates as a result; this could be solved easily by just combining a few of the psets to alleviate the timing overlaps, e.g. after breaks or exams."

                "I think that this is all around a very nice course, and is very much both a good class to take for the math major (or adjacent majors, as the course has applications in physics and such) or just for fun, if you're looking for a fun math class. I think it's both a nice challenge without being too pedantic/lost in the weeds, and it was always a class I loved going to, even though it was a 9 am math class on the other side of campus from where I was.",
                "Yes. One of the best math courses Ive taken in a long while.",
                "Go for it, love prof Neitzke, super good at explaining topics",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about manifolds, or to anyone who wants to learn the \"right\" way to think about vector calculus. This math class is very much within reach of anyone who has one semester of linear algebra and one semester of analysis under their belt---non math majors with interest should give it a go!",
                "Yes. If you want to major in math, or even just pursue a good variety of higher level math courses at Yale, take this course. The class is quite challenging and has a pset every week without exception so be prepared for that, but it is very interesting material, the pacing is good, and it's overall very enjoyable.",
                "If it's taught by Prof. Neitzke, absolutely.",
                "Probably not to many economics students just because it's very unlikely that this course helps them. Economic theorists stand to benefit the most, and I would recommend this course to any economics students intending to pursue graduate study in mathematical economics or economic theory.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested. Some of the material is conceptually difficult, but the class was organized in such a way that these challenges could be overcome and the material itself is very rewarding.",
                "Great way to fulfill multivariable requirement for math major without taking 120 which seems strictly worse. Nice intro to differential geometry as well, and great professor.",
                "Yes.  I found the material to be pretty cool and Professor Neitzke is a very clear and engaging lecturer and a kind, thoughtful person.  He writes up lecture notes which are hugely helpful.  My one complaint is that there were some pretty important theorems which we didnt prove in class, and instead just presented and applied.",
                "Yes. Take this course instead of 120, especially with Professor Neitzke.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn how multivariable differentiation and integration is formally defined. You also get to practice visualizing objects in higher dimensions than 2 which is helpful in other related classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to math majors or other quantitatively-inclined students seeking a rigorous, formal treatment of multivariable calculus.",
                "Yes, with eyes wide open about the challenge and abstraction. Professor Neitzke really cares about teaching and feedback, and this course could get much better in the future (this review is from the first time this course was taught at any appreciable scale), but I think budgeting substantial time for studying for this course from the outset would be a wise choice.",
                "Absolutely. This class made me fall back in love with math after being discouraged by previous classes in the math major sequence. Professor Neitzke is the best math teacher Ive had, strongly recommend taking a class with him. Hes a real teacher at heart. 302 is also just a really conceptually interesting and beautiful class.",
                "Yes, if you want to take another rigorous proof-based math class. It definitely helped to further build my proof writing skills.",
                "Yes. The concepts it teaches are worth knowing.",
                "Nonlinear things can be approximated by linear things locally. This class starts to show you how.",
                "Yes, if they are a math major only",
                "Yes, with Neitzke.",
                "I would recommend this course to any math major or math enthusiast looking for a good, semi-rigorous introduction to multivariable analysis and manifolds. It is a good first course after the introductory sequences (225/6 and 255/6), with a structure and level of support in between an intro course and higher level course. Moreover, the course is generally well-taught and well-organized, and the workload is moderate for a core math class. The midterms were definitely difficult and frustrating in the given time, but the final was better and the final grade cutoffs were reasonable. So if you are at all interested in the concepts or want to pursue further math courses, this is a solid stepping stone that will teach you a lot. However, if you are looking for an extremely rigorous or high-level course, or conversely a very easy or approachable course, this might not be the right choice. It is definitely very much in the middle of difficulty level, rigor, and path along the major."
