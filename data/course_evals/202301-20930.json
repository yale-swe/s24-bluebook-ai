In particular, learned about different ways that natural selective forces can exert evolutionary pressure, and different ways that non-selective forces like drift can also change the course of evolution. On the natural-selection side, became much more literate in selective pressures operating at scales both larger than individual organisms (like different populations, subspecies, species, genuses) and also at scales smaller than individual organisms (like meiotic drive occurring in a genome or epigenetic interactions controlling genetic expression). \r\nLearned about a range of problems with basic models of evolutionary change, such as the ubiquity of horizontal gene transfer making vertical and rooted \"trees of life\" theoretically unsound, or the inapplicability of the reproductive-isolation definition of speciation to asexual reproducers.\r\nBetter understanding of how various evolutionary processes play out in microorganisms in particular. \r\nDeveloped a basic understanding of mathematical tools of evolutionary biology, mostly at a fairly abstract/theoretical level.",

                "Strengths: passionate professor and Teaching Fellows\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "I thought this class was well taught and the material was interesting. However, it requires BIOL 104 as a pre-req and this year the professor let in many students who had not taken BIOL 104 (and were taking this as a science gut). As an E&EB major this was frustrating because I feel I learned very little more than what I did in 104 (I actually think both exams in this course were easier than the BIOL 104 exams). I wish this course picked up where BIOL 104 left off because there's so much to learn in the field.",
                "liked that this class was recorded so if I ever had to miss a lecture I could make it up very easily.\r\nthe class followed closely with the textbook and doing the reading helped supplement the in-person material a lot and really helped my understanding.\r\noverall slides are easy to follow and review.\r\nsection was great! cool and low stress way to learn about scientific papers.",
                "Strengths are a rigid course schedule (each lecture was fairly contained within itself and was really well prepared & organized). The workload is super low and sections are manageable. Weaknesses are the lectures can be incredibly dull since the professor just copies everything from the textbook, though he is a good lecturer.",
                "Strengths: the class is low in terms of work, and a pretty chill science credit. Prof Turner was also a decent lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: the class was missing some overall organization and structure in the presented material. I didn't take bio 104, so I was probably missing some background information, but the depth of material felt very variable (ie Turner would assume a lot of knowledge and go into depth too quickly, or he would explain very elementary things over and over).",
                "This course was very well structured, and I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "The course overall was fantastic-- the TFs and professor were great and everything was very organized. My only qualm would be the amount of high-stakes multiple choice questions (5 pts each) on the exams, which could have some tricky wording.",
                "The discussion sections were really helpful in digesting material, also the recorded lectures really helped in reviewing for exams. A weakness is that it was hard to stay engaged in lecture",
                "The course provided a reasonable quantity of information for students to learn and the examinations were fair and straightforward. The class did not go much further in course concepts than Biology 104, however, it provided many more examples and examined each topic more thoroughly. I think that the papers were quite challenging to read, and it might be helpful to add some annotations of key takeaway points for students. Also, I'm not sure exactly how much some of them added to learning in the course. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness I think that the course has is its dependence on the textbook. The course at least outwardly said that students were expected to know each textbook chapter, and lectures largely covered each chapter and used mostly the same figures. I don't think that its fair to expect students to know each textbook chapter and in reality, the only examined material was from class lectures so I don't know if there's benefits to making students read/learn the textbook.",
                "Strengths: Strong, engaging lectures from a professor who obviously cares a lot and knows a ton. Very exciting examples provided, both in class and in the book. Tests were highly correlated with lecture material.\r\nWeaknesses: Textbook was not written at a high enough level. Did not learn much from the textbook at all. I also felt like we could have done slightly more involved mathematical application of the models we learned. Section was often not super interesting.",
                "strengths - the lecture follows the textbook, so it's very clear what we are learning. the lecture is engaging, with good powerpoints and is recorded for review\r\n\r\nweaknesses - the discussion section format is at times a bit awkward and not always clear how it is related to the lecture",
                "The class is simply bad all around. It is not difficult at all but that is its only strength. Professor Turner does little more than read from the textbook (including the textbook's many errors he fails to correct) and did not seem to care remotely how the students were doing or have any sort of investment into what we came out of the class with. The tests were poorly written multiple-choice tests that the TAs wrote on their own with no input from Professor Turner. The class was just a total waste of time.  Tests also went over material that was not covered in class, but were noted in single lines of the textbook.",
                "Strengths: As with the entire E&EB department, this class creates a wonderfully supportive environment for learning the principles of evolutionary biology. The topics are very interesting, even if we don't go into any of them in too much detail. You'll go through a broad survey of material that will change how you think about evolution, natural selection, and the origin of life (and humankind)!\r\nWeaknesses: First midterm was surprisingly difficult, while the second midterm was surprisingly easy. Quizzes were designed to be easy, but their high contribution to the final grade ironically made them high-stakes, to a stressful degree.",
                "All strengths no weaknesses. Definitely take this is looking for easy interesting class",
                "Strengths: felt like the course was organized well. weakness: felt like the professor directed the class to the textbook a lot so the readings were kinda a lot",
                "I liked this class a lot! I think it would be nice to have more practice tests available to get a better idea of what exams will be like though.",
                "Strengths: The discussion sections are great and really help with understanding the seemingly dense papers and reinforce the topics talked about in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures tend to gloss over some topics required on tests because you are assumed to have known them by reading the textbook. In that regard the lecture/slides are almost supplementary to the textbook.",
                "The lectures were very engaging, even for a non-stem major like me who came in knowing nothing",
                "Weaknesses: Really no observable weaknesses...probably, it might be better if the discussion session article can be uploaded earlier?\r\nStrength: Prof Turner's lectures are really fluent, enjoyable and engaging. All the TAs are friendly and give you valuable advises on studying evolutionary biology, and the discussion session is interesting and chill.",
                "Strengths the tfs are very understanding and very helpful! Weaknesses, theres a lot of material the class tries to unpack and the final exams format of making each question about 6 points especially for true or false and multiple choice can make or break the grade in the class way too easy. Its also not a great indicator of what a student truly learns because getting a few questions wrong can bring one down a whole letter grade as there are no other opportunities to earn points in class. This can make for a discouraging learning environment. Also discussion sections cover very hard to understand research papers that have very little relation to what is learned in class and can not feel like a good use of time. Itd be better to use discussion sections to cover material learned in class rather than going on research papers that are very loosely related to the topics learned (especially given the topics in class are newly learned).",
                "I think this class is WAY too much curved based on tests. I think that stopped by learning experience.",
                "Loved Prof Turner and you learned a lot but it was pretty easy and not stressful. ! never too much work or too hard",
                "This is a great course. The lectures were engaging, and the readings were interesting. It could be nice to have more graded assignments than just the quizzes, exams, and discussion section participation.",
                "Strengths: closely followed textbook, recorded lectures available for review\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths is that they only have two exams and your best one is weighted better than the other one",
                "Strength: very well-organized, chill science credit, the reading is interesting, PPT are well-structured which makes exam reviews easy.",
                "I liked the concise 50 minute lectures, the slides were set up in a very comprehensive manner that made it easy to know what material was the most important",
                "Make the final exam and midterm exam longer than 50 minutes",
                "Strength: Paul Turner's lectures! Super engaging, great voice, goes through content at exactly the right speed. He got me to trek up science hill in the morning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: none",
                "Strengths: Not high-stress. Very well-organized. Interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: didn't cover much new content. Left me feeling like I would need to go learn in-depth things about evolutionary biology in a later course because we didn't really learn much beyond what we learned in BIOL 104 in this course. Also, you were either very lucky or very unlucky with the TAs - it was possible to get a TA who could not answer any of your questions about the content of the course simply because they lacked the knowledge to help you.\r\nHow it could be improved: less hand-waving about complicated topics like QTL analysis and fitness. More thorough definitions and explanations for these concepts. To take fitness as an example, the prof basically was just like \"it's a measure of how well an individual does at passing its genes on to the next generation.\" This is a helpful general idea, but it would be better to also tell us what the actual number (e.g. fitness of 0.9, 1, or 1.1) means, like how it's calculated from raw data on population makeup from one generation to the next, so that we actually have a full understanding of the concept.",
                "This course was interesting and well-organized. I particularly appreciated the length of the lectures (50 minutes) and the weekly discussion sections. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course should have less overlap with the material from BIOL 104. By making 104 a prerequisite, a lot of repeated introductory material could have been cut down on, allowing for the class to cover the topics in greater detail and depth.",
                "Strengths: Material was super interesting\r\nWeaknesses: only having one office hours in-person on Fridays was not good. Need more OHs in case people have class. It didnt feel like there was a lot of opportunity to ask questions if confused.",
                "Strengths: The course was paced very well, with (in my opinion) exactly the right amount of content covered for a 200-level course. I didn't feel like we skimmed over things, but it was also clear that we didn't need to get into the weeds of various methods/techniques we discussed. I came away very satisfied with what I had learned. Additionally, the sections with the TA were amazing -- they put in so much hard work and it was very enjoyable to read and digest real key papers from the literature in a manner that felt thorough and connected well to the lectures. One of the few weaknesses: It's not that the lectures were unengaging (there were a lot of interesting examples/case studies of every phenomenon we talked about, and Prof. Turner is clearly both highly passionate and knowledgeable about the topics) -- but oftentimes lectures duplicated or copied the material in the textbook entirely, so much that they just felt like reformattings of each textbook chapter. We were told at the beginning of the course that we would need to read both the textbook and attend the lectures to not miss content, but honestly I stopped reading the textbook halfway through the course because the lecture covered practically everything and the textbook just felt like \"spoiling\" the lecture and telling me everything interesting beforehand. For future years, I would suggest either creating new lecture context that offers a complement rather than a duplication to the textbook, or simply emphasizing that the textbook readings are optional and for review only."

                "yes",

If you're at all interested in biological diversity and change, this is a deeply engaging and highly accessible introduction to those topics at all scales  from hours to millions of years, and from viruses to whales.\r\nI was surprised and impressed by how often Professor Turner would challenge the basic models we were using by pointing out real-world failures; it felt very representative of how evolutionary biologists really think about things (though obviously with far fewer details), and not at all like things were being oversimplified for us.\r\n If you're super into the math or theoretical side of this topic, though, you might want to take a more advanced class.",

                "If your only criterion is an easy class, I guess so. Beyond that, I would not recommend the class. Professor Turner does not care how his students are doing or if they understand the material, the TAs are completely lost (even though they are the ones in charge of writing the tests and answering all questions), and you are expected to read the entire textbook (I've never felt strongly about a textbook but this one was just bad) because tests will ask questions on material written only there. If it's not for your major, just take a different class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If you've completed BIOL, this is a very reasonable course to take. Alternatively, if you're not strong in the sciences but are good at memorization, I think you will find the midterms manageable as well!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to everyone. Light workload (two midterms and discussion section participation) but very interesting content. I think everyone should take evo bio at some point- its great perspective.",
                "yeah it was fine but probably more interesting if you like evolutionary bio in particular",
                "Id definitely recommend this class! Its a great environment to learn about evolutionary biology in. The lectures are super interesting, and the TFs and the professor are great.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, including those who are not taking this as a requirement for major. For the knowledge application side, the topic of the lecture is general and not very in depth, and Prof Turner can keep the depth to be just appropriate for everyone, also inspiring those in the field to look more into some of the knowledge covered. Due to this generality, it is highly suitable for everyone and especially for medical/molecular biology students, as well as other students interested in the evolutionary biology. It also serves as a very good prerequisite to those who are interested in any type of evolution, e.g., in society, morality, etc.",
                "No, it was tough. And I did not major in this subject so it was even harder. It was not enjoyable and required an extreme amount of my time.",
                "Yes! super interesting and p chill / easy",
                "Yes! It was really interesting. Professor Turner is a great lecturer, and the TAs are great!",
                "Course was hard to understand the material so no",
                "Yes! if you are interested in evolutionary biology or need a chill science credit",
                "Yes it is very interesting and accessible",
                "I would. The professor and the TAs were outstanding. I loved the course.",
                "Absolutely! My favorite science course that I've taken and one that I learned a lot in. My friend (who was also in the course) and I would continue talking about the topics we'd learned that day and this course was a highlight of my semester. No homework was also a plus.",
                "Tentatively yes, because evolutionary bio is really cool. Even though this course doesn't explore much beyond BIOL 104, what it does cover is interesting.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course! The material is very interesting, can be applied to many disciplines (not only biology), and highly relevant.",
                "Yes, if you havent taken anything similar already",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I can't speak to its quality if you're a E&EB/bio major or STEM person, but it's the perfect course for someone looking for a Science credit that's serious, well-taught, and not a \"gut\" -- but is still extremely accessible for those with little prior experience and relatively light in terms of workload. It introduces you to both a fascinating field and to important method of thinking -- there are metaphors to and techniques taken from evolutionary biology all over the social sciences."
