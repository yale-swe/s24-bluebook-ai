   "comments": [
    "I learned how to properly combine critical thinking, ethical considerations, and proper research technique in the development and summary of manuscripts. I learned what it is like to be a health researcher in this day and age.",
    "I learned how to prepare a scientific manuscript, as well as how to think critically about the scientific process and the ethics of global health research. I also got a chance to improve my peer review abilities and my writing abilities.",
    "I learned how to write a global health research manuscript. That is a huge undertaking! I learned how to break this endeavor into steps, plan it out, and stick to that plan (mostly). Somehow we also fit in really insightful discussions about what it's like to publish and present our work and learned about this field in the real world, which was super valuable. I learned a lot about how to collaborate, how to take constructive feedback, how to ask for help, and how to build a supportive academic community, which was ultimately what empowered me to take on this task.",
    "I learned how to write effectively in global health (both scientifically and otherwise), target a specific audience, submit to journals, give a persuasive and engaging presentation, and give constructive feedback and respectfully.",
    "From this course I learned about the current state of the field of Global Health, critical topics and challenges, how to create and conduct my own research project and more. This helped me look at the work of others, and more importantly my own work, with a critical view and to improve the quality of my skills in the subject."

   "comments": [
    "The greatest strengths of this class are in its instructors and its small size. Professor Curry and Casey were absolutely incredible - there is not a single negative that I can point out. Additionally, because there were only five students in this course, we were able to personalize the course for each person, tailoring assignments, timelines, and goals based on each person's project and specific circumstances. I really appreciated the segmentation of assignments (introduction, methods, etc.), which helped make the writing of an entire manuscript much more manageable and also allowed for more detailed feedback with each section. I am very grateful for this class and its ability to keep me on track in the production of the final writing assignment.",
    "I cannot emphasize enough how supportive this class was. We were so lucky to have a class of five teachers with a professor and a TA, but we really made use of our resources--we each got very, very personalized feedback and support, from our fundamental, overarching writing goals to our day-to-day needs at each step of this process. I have never gotten this much feedback on my work, and I appreciated this quality of my learning environment so much. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "A MAJOR strength was its size. The class was 5 people, a teacher and a TA which worked really well for the purposes of the course. We were able to workshop our individual writing in pairs and as a class. We also had fruitful conversations about the ethical dimensions of our work and were able to build a good enough rapport to give honest feedback. The only weakness was the narrow focus on writing and publishing for academic journals. Not every global health capstone has that same goal so I think in the future the class can be organized as a writing workshop for anyone whose capstone project involves writing and you can group people together with similar end-product goals (multiple small sections).",
    "Well structured and tailored to the needs of students. VERY helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student in the Global Health Scholars program, if it were to be offered again by Professor Curry. While you must be willing to put in the work, I learned so much throughout the semester, and I also grew much closer to my classmates. Plus, it was incredibly fulfilling to generate a manuscript with the help of the instructors and my peers, and this course is a really great way to expand upon summer work. Professor Curry and Casey were amazing and provided so much guidance, support, and feedback, and I truly learned so much from them. This has definitely been one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "This version of this course won't be offered next year, which really sucks. Dr. Curry's departure is such a huge loss for the global health program, and the course's format and individualized approach can't properly translate to the new iteration, which won't be specific to research and will be about four times this class size.",
    "I would strongly recommend that other global health students take this (or a similar iteration of this) course. It is difficult to say since the leadership of the program is tragically changing, but I hope that this class or a similar one exists in the future for the sake of student learning and the integrity of the program.",
    "Absolutely. I learned SO MUCH in this course, and it was a wonderful environment."
