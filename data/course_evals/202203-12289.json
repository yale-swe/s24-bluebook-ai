                "This course had an amazing roster of guest speakers, and the class discussion was always engaging. I wish more attention had been paid to the assigned readings (both selecting them and discussing them) as well as to the graded assignments. In addition, I received no graded work throughout the course, so it was difficult to improve my performance or gauge how I was doing:",
