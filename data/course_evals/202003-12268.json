I think that there were aspects of the course that would be great if the class could meet in person (movement practice) and I felt like class discussions might be a bit better if the class could establish some sort of rapport. Professor Robinson is lovely but I'm honestly not really sure what exactly I learned.",
                "i would recommend it if you're looking for a class that's a bit slower paced and not as intensive, but also allows you to get some movement regularly in your schedule since there are so few dance classes formally offered at yale. however, i would check for a syllabus and see if the course has gained a clearer structure because i think that would've made my experience of the class better. i also think the lack of clarity and structure was partially a product of covid and difficulties transitioning everything online in a way that worked for professor robinson."
