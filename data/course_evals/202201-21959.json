However, it was difficult to learn at times because of the weekly classes and long lectures, and the course would benefit from a TF. Material was disorganized and difficult to review.",

Again, it is super disorganized and hard to find what you need to do a question on a problem set, but in the search you subconsciously learn. also the prof is a goat and so fun. loved this class, it was a perfect way to end Yale.",
