At some point in the course, we would get to a new problem and I could guess how we would go about solving it. We also learned how to do industry analyses and the impact of artificial intelligence on many of these problems",
                "I mainly learned three things in this class. First, I learned more about the economics of innovation and the IP protection system (patents, copyrights, etc.). Second, I learned how we can analyze innovation and IP protection through economic, mathematical models. Finally, I learned how to do an industry analysis.",

                "This course applies some of the computational techniques learned in previous classes, but is largely about applying economic concepts to innovation. It was interesting to see how we may be able to model certain facets of businesses and innovation with economics, but this was not very vigorous.",

                "Strengths: Eva is extremely kind and knowledgeable about the topic, and she is very organized with her lectures. The material is an appropriate amount of challenge: it's essentially intermediate micro concepts applied in interesting ways. And it was definitely interesting to have models for things like searching costs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: professor is amazing and great teacher.",

                "Strengths: very reasonable homework and tests, pretty interesting lectures, office hours were very helpful, Prof Chalioti is great\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that lectures could have been more engaging is Prof Chalioti let us discuss more. Would have helped keep everyone engaged",
                "The course goes at a really nice pace, it was perfect for the way that I learned. There is a good number of problem sets and the office hours are always extremely helpful. The professor cares a lot and wants you to succeed. It's a really great senior seminar.",
                "This course has many strengths. I loved that the class revolved around applying the somewhat abstract models we learned in intermediate micro to more tangible scenarios like incentivizing innovation and firm competition. We learned the practical skill of industry analysis: how to research and get an overview of an industry, the major players, impactful technologies, and future trends. The midterm and final exams were very fair, predictable, and based entirely on what we had done in class or homework. The workload was extremely reasonable. There was no busywork and I never felt stressed about or overwhelmed by this class. Also, Eva is a wonderful instructor whose excitement for the material is infectious. She tries to make class fun and is very understanding.",

                "The course was about 2/3 content and 1/3 presentations. The content was interesting but at times felt a bit disjointed. Im glad we discussed Porters 5 Forces, but the industry analyses did not always have an appropriate topic to delve into these more. I liked the presentations and thought it was cool to go deeper into a topic, but I wish they had been more specific to peoples interests or past work. I thought all of the concepts were interesting and gave a really good introduction to how economics could be applied to companies, but do wish the material was more rigorous and mathematically complex to make it feel more like a senior level course.",

                "The strength is Eva is an amazing professor that makes the course so much better. A weakness may be that engagement during class is somewhat low (but this is somewhat due to the fact that Eva is very nice and students are lazy and the class was late in the day)."

                "Yes if you are looking for a relatively low-stress class to fulfill a senior Econ requirement. Eva is lovely and provides a lot of help with the psets and exams, so it's really a pretty easy class. However, I would hesitate to recommend it if you are not an Econ major and/or if you are looking for something a bit more intellectually stimulating. Much of the material is essentially profit maximization, partial derivatives from intermediate micro, and I don't think I will retain much of the models we learned. The student presentations were very informative though!",
                "ABSOLUTELY. take it. if you're interested in the future in ANY capacity, take this class. The world is changing around us, and this class gives you the tools to conceptualize that in the context of your own life.",
                "Yes, extremely relevant and interesting models you learn!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It's an excellent senior seminar taught by a great professor, and the material is interesting. Workload is reasonable (weekly psets + midterm + a presentation + final), especially if you go to office hours for pset help. Tests are always fair, as Eva makes clear what you have to study for.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "Absolutely yes. Really nice senior seminar and interesting content + not bad workload.",
                "I highly recommend this senior seminar. Eva is a gem, and the way she goes about teaching her class is top notch. Her exams and problem sets are very fair. And you can expect to get a good grade as long as you put in some sort of effort.",
                "Yes if you want an applied - micro sort of class with reasonable homework / tests",
                "Absolutely. I truly don't think there is another econ senior seminar as good as this one. I truly will miss having professor chalioti next semester. If you can get in, you absolutely won't regret it.",

She tries to make class fun and is very understanding.",
                "Take it! Eva is the best. This was an awesome class. The assignments were 8 psets, 2 podcasts, an in-class midterm, a 7-min presentation on an industry of your choice, a 4-6 page write-up about that industry, and a final. In the first half the class, you learn about how technology has changed/impact the basic economic ideas you've learned in micro and macro. Like for monopolies--think about Google. Like for searching costs--think about online e-commerce. Like for vertical integration and price elasticity--think about Amazon. The second half of the class is about industry analysis. Using Porter's Five Forces framework, each student researches and presents on a topic and there are subsequent class discussions. I liked how presentations were on a wide range of industries:  blockchain, streaming, Amazon e-commerce, Tesla electric and autonomous cars, fintech, etc.",
                "The professor, Professor Chalioti, is amazing and very kind. She definitely ensured this was a chill semester. I think you can learn a lot but just not very in-depth. Overall, the class was fun and engaging while not the most intellectually challenging. Id recommend it as a fun senior class.",
                "Yes!  Good senior Econ seminar",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!",

                "Absolutely! Take this even if you dont need an Econ Req. its really interesting to think about how tech is transforming our world",
