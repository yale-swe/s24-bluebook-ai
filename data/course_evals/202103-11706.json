This class grounds you, and opens your eyes to how all our stories are intertwined via world-systems theory, globalization, neo-colonialism and colonialism. It shows that underdevelopment is not just a function of poverty, and so more than wealth is required to get countries like Haiti on the trajectory to sustainability.",

I think I was also able to improve my essay writing skills, mainly in making myself more concise for the reader which I have always struggled with.",

                "The strength of this course was that it was reliant on students' own interests: Students presented seminars on topics of their choice as well as presentations on their own individual papers. The weakness of this course was the fact that much of our conversations about Haiti lacked actual Haitians' input, however, this would be difficult to solve due to the low number of Haitians at Yale currently.",
                "Very engaging and everyone is given a chance to share and explore their interest for taking the course.",

                "A strength of the course is helping transition freshman to classes at Yale. We were able to become more comfortable participating and asking questions as the semester went on. I believe the course could be improved by making it more engaging or changing up the style of presentations.",
                "I dont think the course focuses enough on sustainable development for an EVST course.",
                "I liked the structure of the course. I wish we did more projects about the culture of Haiti",
                "I think the main strengths of the course was the breadth of it. It covered a large amount of information and left me feeling like I understood a lot more about Haiti than I did when I started. I didnt think there were any real weaknesses.",
                "It was great that we read different books, wrote papers, lead class discussions and classes, learned how to find sources through the yale databases and libraries, etc. This class allowed me to learn how to create good group discussions, work with my classmates, lead a class, etc.",
                "A strength of this course is that it was a great introduction to the seminar format and what is expected in terms of participation, presentations, and writing.\r\nA drawback of the course was the fact that much of the information was presented as a discussion led by a student so at times it felt as if the information was slipping through the cracks and that we learned about a particular topic to the extent that the student presenter of the day had researched it. That being said, Dr. Geballe did preface the course by saying that we would by no means become experts on the subject matter which in and of itself was an important lesson."

                "Yes",
