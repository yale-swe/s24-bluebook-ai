                "I especially enjoyed the derivative computer, as it forced me to learn how to complete derivatives almost immediately. I would have appreciated if more real-life examples of differentiation were not merely saved for the end with phase diagrams and differential equations.",
                "Less focus on theory and more focus on how to solve problems/applications. There seems to be a disconnect between what is on exams and what the professors believe to be appropriate testing content. This was frustrating because it seems most logical for the professors to be the ones who are actually writing the exam content.",
                "I felt like we moved through content very quickly and I didnt have time to grasp the basis before getting harder versions on the problem set.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it is taught with a relatively small class size, so I was able to ask questions in class. A weakness of this course was that it was extremely fast paced and I felt that if I hadn't previously taken this course in high school, I would not have been able to keep up.",

                "I struggled very much with exams, however I felt that I grew in strength and confidence in my abilities to take exams. My final exam felt significantly stronger than my first two in this class.",
                "The strength and weakness of this course is the amount of material that is taught. Since there is so much material that is taught, the amount of material is both a strength and a weakness. It gives kids a comprehensive knowledge of Calculus but can also leave some kids not understanding certain topics.",
                "I think my professor was very good at explaining the concepts. However, I think we could have done more about applying the concepts like we are expected to do on tests.",
                "Strengths: they were lenient with p set due dates when we had a break etc\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the teachers. They all suck and do not know how to reach capsicums and the way they grade is terrible. You could get everything right and show your work and still not get full points because they wanted you to do something they didnt even specifically ask for",
                "I enjoyed the emphasis on collaboration (i.e through peer tutoring for psets). A weakness could be that sometimes it was easy to disengage during lectures",
                "The class definitely focused on theoretical aspects of calculus I, which is fine if one took AP Calculus AB in high school, so they already have prior knowledge to supplement what they're doing. But, if it is one's first time taking calculus I, there are a lot of leaps made because of the heavy focus on theoretical that can be very confusing. Moreover, some things we did not reach, like u-substitution, and it was not clear on whether this would be covered in Math 115.",
                "The in-class instruction was great however the actual assigned work could often be tedious. Additionally, if you did well on the first midterm but poorly on the second you're kind of screwed since the grades are only reweighted if you did worse on the first one.",
                "Some weaknesses include assigning new problem sets the week of the midterms which was overwhelming.",
                "The class size was large and I felt like the pressure to have to speak to other students in class was daunting especially if I didn't understand the subject at hand.",
                "Because most of the class was taught conceptually, it may have been helpful to have solve through more difficult questions as a group. There were also some difficult questions on the weekly problem set that I wish we could have gone over during class.",
                "Strengths: the math tutors were very helpful.",
                "strengths: easy to follow, one pagers \r\nweakness: none \r\nimprovements: some psets are very long",
                "A strength of this course would be that the material is taught very clearly and is somewhat easy to understand. A weakness would be some of the lengths of the psets and it's material, considering how they are usually due on wednesday and half of the material required to complete it isn't avaliable till class on tuesday or wednesday."
