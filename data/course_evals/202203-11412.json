                "I learned about tension between the three religious groups in Spain, and general historical information about the religions. I also learned how to write strong essays with both primary and secondary sources.",
                "I worked on skills to become a better writer and speaker in class",
                "I learned how to write an effective essay and I learned a lot about Medieval Spain.",
                "I became a much improved writer and learned to efficiently read long and dense texts. In addition, my eyes were open to the rigor required to unpack and discuss complex ideas. Personally, I found out that I find religion to be fascinating, and I value the seminar format of a class where students are free to discuss. I also became far more aware of the world around me and the underlying political forces originating in Spain and Europe but impacting the rest of the world.",
                "Not only did I develop a deep understanding of the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Medieval Spain, but I also was able to develop my skills in historical reading, writing and analysis.",
                "I learned how to better close read, take notes on text, make argumentative claims, and share my ideas with the wider audience.",
                "Skills: Engaging with primary source evidence in a way that considers many possible angles, finding points of contention between different historians' arguments, having meaningful seminar discussions using evidence and building off of other students' points, balancing a heavy reading load, writing essays that are clear and thoughtful\r\nI learned a lot about historical subjectivity. I think I used to view history as something fixed, and historians' perspectives on it as inherently correct or at least cohesive. This class revealed a lot of the doubt and bias in history. Not to mention, I now know a lot about Medieval Spain and the theological tensions between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \r\nI think some of the most valuable insights came from discussions about the role of religion in society. I had previously brushed aside that question, accepting \"separation of church and state\" as a good enough standard without looking into the complexities of that framework. This class taught me to ask more questions.",
                "I learned a lot about historical analysis and ways to become a better writer",
                "Taking this class has significantly improved my writing skills. Before the class, I struggled with structuring my papers and expressing my ideas clearly. However, through the writing exercises and feedback I received from the professor, I have learned how to organize my thoughts and present them in a clear and concise manner. I have also gained a greater understanding of the importance of referencing texts in my analysis and using evidence to support my arguments. Overall, I feel much more confident in my writing abilities as a result of this class.",
                "I learned a lot about the relationships between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in medieval Spain. I learned about the beliefs of the religions themselves, how they are connected, and their views of each other. Beyond the material of the class, I learned how to engage meaningfully in discussions and how to write effectively."

                "This course has a lot of strengths. It has a lot intensive, but very interesting materials. You will have to do a lot of secondary sources, and analyze a lot of primary sources. The discussions always edge to the point of brain-exploding in the highest degree. Professor Fancy is tough, but he is also very understanding.",
                "Strengths are the discussions and seminar style of the course. Another strength is in the writing assignments. Professor Fancy provides excellent feedback for the papers we write and he is always open for office hours. Some weaknesses are that there is a lot of reading and a lot of the times we did not fully cover all the readings in class.",
                "Strengths: feedback was highly personalized and the writing advice will help with all other courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the sheer amount of reading makes some assignments hard to approach genuinely.",
                "Strengths: speaking, weakness: technical writing issues",
                "Strengths are definitely the engaging material and having such a great professor. The only weakness is the large amount of reading.",
                "The seminar format allowed us to really take control of our learning; we could take a reading and go literally anywhere we wanted with it, of course with guidance in any direction we went. I suppose that if there are any negatives, it would be that we essentially had the same format of class every class, and the same type of media. We read many texts, but only watched 1-2 documentaries and didn't really have outside class assignments on anything else. That being said, every class was pretty enjoyable, so that was not necessarily a bad thing....",
                "Strengths: The readings in the course follow a nice storyline arc that makes thematic and chronological sense. The writing assignments built on one another and we were able to receive real feedback on each. Professor Fancy is a really engaging teacher and seminar leader which was an additional amazing asset to the course.\r\nWeaknesses: I cant think of any real ones. The only thing I would say is that there were many readings assigned that we never got to talk about, so either taking more time in class to talk about each reading or assigning less unnecessary readings would be better.",
                "The only weakness I can really think of is the short amount of time given for our final essay. I understand that the point was to show us how it's impossible to complete an essay in that brief a time frame, but I would have liked to work with the material a little longer after our presentations. \r\nA big strength of the course is that it moved between small details (individual, niche primary source documents) and big questions (the role of religion in society, historical bias, etc) very smoothly and frequently. Our class discussions got deeper and more interesting throughout the course because it seemed like everyone was really engaging with the small stuff and using it to talk about the big questions.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the variety of materials we covered. We read a diverse range of texts and had the opportunity to explore different perspectives and approaches to the subject matter. The discussions in class were always engaging and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed the opportunity to learn from my classmates as well as the instructor.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the number of books we needed to acquire. While they were certainly very interesting to pick up, I would prefer to have had the excerpts we needed to be included within the large packet that was put together and sent to TYCO.",
                "This class was incredibly engaging. The seminar style of the class made it a challenging but fun environment to discuss topics and question sources. I really loved the way the class was structured and wouldn't change a thing. Getting all the readings done was difficult, but it helped me learn how to manage my work well."

                "Yes. I think this is one of the class that I would kind of expect or partly want for college. It's so much more challenging and intense, but at the end of it, you will think to yourself: \"Oh I did get a lot out of it\". And the materials were also super interesting. Professor Fancy gives out long office hours sessions for you to get help or just talk. Take advantage of these. Prof. Fancy is tough. I myself would spare the first-years a bit but I understand that some professors prefer some heightened Socratic method. Don't get intimidated by the class discussion and seriousness. I was really daunted to speak for most classes, and that paralyzed my ability to think. Just know that Prof. Fancy isn't that scary and other people are in the same boat, and you'll be more relaxed.",
                "Yes, Professor Fancy is very caring for his students and made this course a great introduction to college academics. He would encourage participation from everyone in seminars and would also met 1-on-1 with students to understand their goals for the course.",
                "I would, as I feel like I was made a stronger writer and thinker, but be prepared to read a lot.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Freshman seminars should be mandatory for freshman to get their feet under them at Yale. Professor Fancy was an engaging and nurturing professor!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to other students. It really gives you a crash course on the true history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which is critical to understanding many aspects of our society today. And then of course, the actual topic of the class, which is their interactions in medieval Spain, was super interesting, complex, deep, and exciting to learn about.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. Whether you are a strong humanities student or only interested in STEM, Professor Fancy facilitates each students learning in a way that is unique and beneficial to them. The class is really engaging whether or not you consider yourself someone interested in religion or Medieval history.",
                "I would recommend this class for both the interesting topics we learn and the skills we learn. If you love either the history of Medieval Europe or religion, this class is for you.",
                "I already have talked about this course to my friends, and I'd recommend it to them if it weren't a first-year seminar (they'll all be sophomores next fall). Not only is the material interesting, the course taught me how to be a college student, teaching us how to write essays and work with sources instead of expecting us to make that transition on our own. I found that to be really valuable.",
                "I recommend this class to all students who enjoy history and want to improve their writing",
                "It depends on the student and their goals for the course. If the student is looking for a challenging and engaging course that covers a wide range of materials, then I would definitely recommend this course. The discussions and readings were interesting and thought-provoking, and I feel like I learned a lot from the instructor and my classmates.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the student is looking for a course with a lighter workload or is not interested in the subject matter, then this course may not be the best fit. The workload was quite heavy and required effort to keep up with the assignments and readings. Additionally, if the student is not interested in the subject matter, they may not find the course as engaging and may not get as much out of it.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to everyone. We explored how it is possible for different people to coexist, what problems it may cause, and how to apply what we can learn from medieval Spain to today's world."
