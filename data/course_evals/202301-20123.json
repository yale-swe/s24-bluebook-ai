                "I like the course size. The number of students was small enough to have discussions where each student could speak and ask questions. Instructor was great - so friendly, always answered our questions, understood that we wanted to discuss topics outside of the syllabus and have more \"conversational\" French classes so she built that into the syllabus. I love taking French language classes. It was great to have this class as a constant way for me to practice and improve my French every day. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-course material is SO irrelevant to daily French life. The vocabulary felt pretty archaic. \r\n-more contemporary readings and course materials, please. \r\n-Lingco exam results should stay open for longer so we can review our exams. We never got notifications that our Lingco was open to review. \r\n-Course packet grammar exercise answers should always be posted after review, so we can fully review them at home and before exams. \r\n-Course audio is pretty horrible. It was more an exercise in listening to old audio tapes than learning French (lots of crackling, lots of pauses and sound going in and out) \r\n-Symphony Pastorale should be removed from the syllabus. It's not only boring to read but also problematic course material. Also, the vocabulary we learn from this text is NOT RELEVANT at all to daily speech. I wish I learned from a text that I could better apply to my conversations when I visit France.",
                "It is really good course for improving the french reading skills (tons of novel)\r\nBut for speaking and listening skills I feel I am not much improved by the course.",
                "Loved reading Joffo and the books",
                "I felt like the homeworks could be improved and a new course packet should be made. I loved the books that we read but wish they tough us strategies for reading the language.",
                "I really enjoyed the course and don't have any complaints.",
                "I think the course did not allow for as much talking as I would have preferred. It focused heavily on the texts and was less focused on the discussions. When the discussions were emphasized, I thoroughly enjoyed them and thought they were extremely elucitory.",
                "No weaknesses! This course is the perfect blend of assignments, content, and class participation. The introduction of more cultural material this semester was especially interesting.",
                "I thought the course as a whole could be structured to better facilitate learning. The main course packet that the course is based upon lacks neatness and concision. It is filled mostly with exercises and instruction is scattered through. Some exercises also require listening to audio files that can be twenty minutes long with no time stamps. This makes the packet difficult to reference eficiently.\r\nOn exams, there are often new cases of grammar rules that weve never covered in class.\r\nLastly, I think there is too much emphasis and points taken off due to small details like spelling or tense agreement."
