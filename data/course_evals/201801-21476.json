    "We covered the basics of real analysis: measurable sets, Lebesgue integral, Fourier series, etc.",
    "Measure theory, Banach and Hilbert Spaces, Lebesgue measure and Lebesgue Integration, Fourier Analysis and applications.",
    "Some analysis, probably.",
    "I learned foundational concepts in analysis. It was really helpful to see the basic ideas of Lebesgue measure etc.",
    "I learned about the Lebesgue measure (and its foundations, and properties of a general measure), integration, L1\/L2 function spaces, Fourier series and lots of cool applications, projections, and some integration in 2D. I learned a lot of fundamentals in Fourier series, function spaces, and projections that I found very useful for other classes (plus very cool)!",
    "I learned the fundamental principles and theorems of real analysis.",
    "Lebesgue measure, integration, projections, Fourier analysis, Banach\/Hilbert spaces, differential equations.",
    "Some basic real analysis stuff, mainly.",
    "Sweeping overview of introductory measure theory and analysis in function spaces.",
    "Concepts from real analysis: lebesgue measure and integration, different norms, hilbert spaces, sigma algebras, projection, Fourier series...",
    "Measurability, the Lebesgue measure, L1 and L2 spaces, Fourier series, convolutions, a lil bit of ergodic theory.",
    "The biggest thing I gained from this course was a large improvement in the way I handle mathematical proofs. I felt like this class gave me a lot of innovative tools to help me prove harder math problems than I have been exposed to previously.",
    "In this class you'll learn:\r\nIntroductory measure theory\r\nThe Lebesgue Integral\r\nFunctions spaces, norms, inner products, L1 and L2\r\nFourier series\r\n\r\nExtra things that we covered:\r\nA grown up perspective on Fubini's theorem\r\nA brief intro to differential equations\r\n\r\nThis is essentially chapters 10-15 of Beals' Analysis: An Introduction with a few bonuses.",
    "We learned a lot about Lebesgue measure on the real line, along with the associated Lebesgue integral, various function spaces, Fourier analysis, and its mathematical applications. This class forced me to work on my mathematical proofs.",
    "This class made me more comfortable with thinking through proofs on my own, particularly on the problem sets, which I thought were often interesting to work through and just the right level of difficulty.",
    "It's a basic real analysis class.  We learned measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and the Fourier transform.  With the extra time we had, we also covered projection, convolution, and differential equations, but I'm pretty sure those extra topics will change from year to year.",
    "This course furthered my general math knowledge. It provided practice with the language and subtleties of set theory, which will surely be helpful for future math courses. I also learned the basics of measure theory, including outer measure, lebesgue measure, measurable functions, and L^1 and L^2 spaces. We also learned the complex formulation of Fourier series, and touched briefly upon differential equations. I thought this course would resemble calculus as I knew it a bit more, but the approach was quite theoretical and, at times, abstract. While I learned the basics of several topics, I feel that I never grasped the complexities of them; the methods for completing proofs, the subtle differences in theorems and notation, etc.",
    "I learned some things about math, specifically about Fourier analysis. Not much new about real analysis in general, because much of the real analysis content was also covered in MATH 230\/231."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Real analysis is not exciting, but it's important stuff.  The class was super easy in the beginning but then suddenly got nearly impossible to follow as soon as the material got more complicated.",
    "The material is interesting and the problem sets and exams were fair. I do think the class could be better organized and proofs in class could be done more thoroughly and carefully.",
    "Lectures were not great; we also got basically no feedback because the midterm was returned the last week of classes.",
    "I thought the problem sets were really well written and facilitated our learning well. Lectures could have been a bit more dynamic, and office hours weren't at a very accessible time.",
    "The course was a zig-zag train ride into hell. We never knew what we were learning, and as the course went on we seemed to deviate from our track more and more. The textbook helped in grounding Professor Levit, but this course was still incredibly hectic.",
    "The content of the course is really cool, useful, and accessible. Problem sets and exams were fair and the right level of challenging. The textbook is good on some topics but not great on others, and although we used other textbooks towards the end, I think splitting time between that textbook and another more evenly would help the course. The differential equations material at the end was also a bit rushed, so I think we could have gotten more out of seeing a more advanced topic in Fourier series or projections instead.",
    "This course was well-structured and covered an interesting selection of topics. However, expositions were often unclear or riddled with mistakes. Also, the feedback on the homework was often minimal and rather late.",
    "Strengths: good amount of material covered, with all the necessary proofs",
    "The material overall was interesting, particularly the applications we did toward the end of the class, like the isoperimetric inequality\/Gibb's phenomenon\/Von-Neumann's ergodic theorem, but the beauty was often hidden beneath technical proofs of basic concepts. The class was also pretty disorganized, and I never felt like I knew where we were going. I would have liked the professor to be more prepared for class, and to take time to finish proofs.",
    "The class is rather dull but necessary. A better teacher would be nice.",
    "I thought the coverage of the course was thoughtful and judicious. The material can feel a little dry at the beginning, but once you get to Fourier series, it all comes together rather nicely.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the peer tutor and the textbook used for this course. The peer tutor held review sessions twice a week which vastly helped my understanding of the material. The book was also easy to follow and made it easy to reference lectures given in class. On the topic of lectures, I'd say that's where this course was lacking. Often times, the proofs of theorems seemed to drag on forever and there were often mistakes that needed to be pointed out. On multiple occasions, the proofs were completed by email the next day. I also felt that the explanations of the proofs were unnecessarily complex since when read over in the textbook, they were often clearer than what was presented in class.",
    "This course was relatively easy to follow in that it primarily followed the book, with a few excursions from it. I think that was a strength and a weakness. It was easy to go back and review the material after lecture, but I feel as though we may have missed out on other interesting subjects because we focused on the book so much. I would like to see a more creative approach to the class.",
    "The strength of this course was the problem sets, which did a good job demonstrating what aspects of the lectures would be most important to know how to use and also helped me understand how to work through proofs. In general, I felt that the material covered in the course was interesting and it moved at a good pace. The things I thought could be improved were logistic, in particular, the speed with which problem sets were graded. Towards the end of the semester we did not receive problem sets back for several weeks and it was difficult to know how I was doing in the course without seeing that feedback. I also thought the final exam in particular was too difficult for the level of proofs we had been doing on problem sets and on the midterm, so even though I felt like I progressed over the course of the semester it made it difficult for me to look back positively on the course.",
    "The exams weren't the greatest, but otherwise the class was pretty much exactly what a real analysis course should be.",
    "The content of this course is great. After taking the course I feel that the topics are central to, or at least valuable to, a degree in Mathematics. However, the course structure and teaching style made for an unnecessarily challenging experience. Professor Levit routinely lectured directly from the course textbook (Real Analysis, Beals), and even then was often unsuccessful at completing proofs correctly or answering questions competently. Since the lectures were almost a dictation of the text, the text provided little support; each section was rarely more than two pages in length, and contained just the relevant theorems and barebone proofs. While many students did seem able to follow his lectures, I found them to be complicated, filled with minute detail, and uninspired. A more experienced professor would have made this course much more successful, meaningful, and enjoyable.",
    "As a required course for the math major, MATH 305 basically does its job. I learned the fundamentals of measure theory, and some interesting other topics were covered as well. However, the lectures were disappointing in format and presentation. They were hard to follow, and Professor Levit almost always failed to teach clearly or even correctlyeasily more than half of the proofs he gave in class were incorrect or incomprehensible, even when he was teaching directly from a textbook, and had to be corrected later on, or were left incorrect."

   "comments": [
    "If you're thinking of taking real analysis, it's probably because you have to take it.  At least it wasn't too much work with Arie.",
    "I would recommend this course only if the student is willing to do some learning of the material on his or her own.",
    "If you're a math major, you probably have to take it. It probably won't be fun though.",
    "If you're a math major, you should definitely take this course because the subject is so fundamental that you won't be able to go anywhere without it.",
    "No, unless it is taught by another instructor. This was a terrible experience from start to finish.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It's really cool material that is essential for other areas of math (applied or otherwise), and the variety of topics covered is very enjoyable. As long as you have seen very basic analysis (types of convergence, open\/closed sets) before, I also found it fine to take without 300\/301.",
    "Yes, real analysis is a necessary course for a math major.",
    "Since it's an into level analysis course, I suspect you might not have much of a choice. But note that, at least this year, the classes were often extremely confusing, guidance was limited, and psets\/exams were returned 5+ weeks after we turned them in. In short, unless a lot has changed, I would not recommend this class.",
    "If you're a math major you should take it. It's fine. Arie's pretty bad. The material's not glamorous but it gets the job done. As in all math classes, TA sessions will save your life.",
    "Definitely. If you're a math major, it's simply a must. If you're not, to state the obvious, be prepared for the rigor and thoroughness which typifies a 300-level math course.",
    "I would recommend this course based on the material it offers. For any math major, analysis is a must, but I would recommend taking it when a good professor is teaching it. This course has the potential to be a really interesting math class, but it's pretty contingent on who the professor is.",
    "Must take for a math major",
    "I think I would only recommend MATH 305 to a student who was very interested in real analysis and had a strong math background. For me, it was a somewhat difficult course and though I think the subject matter was interesting, it would have been more interesting if I had a passion for analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in math and who has experience with higher level math courses, but it is not a course to be taken just for fun.",
    "If you're a math major, you really should take it, but you already knew that.  If you're not a math major, but you're interested in learning some analysis, I would recommend taking complex (MATH 310) instead, but this is also good.",
    "Depending on who's teaching, you should or should not take this course. With Professor Levit I had a challenging time in lecture and attempting psets. The content, though, is quite interesting (and challenging!) and with a competent professor I'm sure would make for a great course.",
    "As a core course for the math major, MATH 305 basically does its job. I learned some things about real analysis, and Professor Levit also covered some other interesting topics, particularly Fourier analysis and ergodic theory. However, I would strongly caution against taking this class with Arie Levit if you can help it. As a lecturer, he is extremely unclear; his lectures were often impossible to follow and were almost always riddled with errors. He had a hard time answering questions in class, and in general did not provide the strong foundation in real analysis that I had hoped to acquire."
