One weakness this course has is the amount of Spanish spoken informally.  I believe casually adopting a new language without stress would be helpful.  I would create weekly check-ins for this course just to make sure everyone in the class is comfortable with their proficiency in an informal setting.",

It was also very helpful to have all of the assignments and learning goals available in the syllabus. It left no ambiguity with what I should be learning at any time.",

The class discussions were great and for the most part included everyone.  I think more oral assignments should be included, those being live, not recorded.  It would require students to proactively think instead of pressing, \"stop recording,\" and trying over and over again with no stress.",
                "Having synchronous class only MWF versus every day of the week was really helpful, and when we were meeting virtually, the level of engagement still remained high because there were so few of us in the class. Professor Sabe was also great about talking to us all.",
                "I liked the small class size which really helped me have my questions answered.",
                "I feel like we always had secret assignments that I was forgetting about, since we didn't meet for class everyday and the assignments were all online.",
