                "This class covered trans health care as a model and science, and it discussed issues of justice and access that surround it. It was so important to not only learn about the literal care itself but how care is contextualized in the US.",
                "We had the opportunity to learn about healthcare, procedures, erasure, and neglect of trans people in healthcare and beyond. Through our midterm and final, we also were able to focus more in-depth on a specific topic, which I found to be incredibly fulfilling and engaging.",
                "I am highly interested in LGBTQ+ public health, and this course is excellent for further developing skills\/knowledge in that area. I learned a great deal about surgeries, hormones, and other elements of medical transition while also engaging with political concepts and readings in theory.",
                "This course offers incredible insight into the world of transgender healthcare. Professor LaFleur and Professor Mukerjee are a team of passionate educators, who complemented one another every step of the way. Each professor provided a different perspective on the issue: Professor LaFleur examined the current crisis through its historical, theoretical, and political context, while Professor Mukerjee offered an in-depth understanding of the biological, medical, and ethical elements of the topic. I now feel confident challenging existing medical orthodoxies as they relate to queer bodies and being a more vocal advocate for those the medical field still fails to see  that is all thanks to Professor LaFleur and Professor Mukerjee!",

                "So muchit focused on trans issues (with a careful examination on how race intersects with those issues) across the gamut: within the carceral state, to children, to the border. A fantastic course!"

                "One of my favorite courses at Yale!! Loved the mix of lecture and seminar style, both Ronica and Greta, and the other students. I really enjoyed the guest speakers and the opportunity to see ither students research.",
                "I felt like the mixed lecture and reading discussion were sometimes disjointed, and I would have liked to see more coordination between them.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Having both Greta and Ronica's background and experience was absolutely fantastic\r\n-The course material and readings were excellent\r\n-Lectures were incredibly informative, and discussion was always active and engaging\r\n-Assignments were conducive of depth of learning, and they were all meaningful and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Perhaps having a bit more guidance in the assignments (such as written descriptions of expectations) would have been nice (although Greta and Ronica responded to questions promptly and were happy to meet by appointment)",
                "The syllabus was not always clear as to the requirements for particular assignments  I was able to better understanding course requirements by going to office hours, but the syllabus was not necessarily accurate throughout the semester. Other than that, I do not have any particular critiques of this course. The co-taught format was very engaging and I enjoyed the combined lecture-seminar discussion classes.",
                "The strengths are that it was a deeply well-researched and well-taught course that covers so, so much ground. One small weakness in an otherwise amazing course was that it was sometimes unclear what the exact expectations were for some assignments. I think it would have been helpful to offer more information about that from the get go.",
                "The strength of this course is the diverse swath of knowledge that it pulls from and its adaptability to the interests and passions of its students. The weakness is that the course meetings sometimes feel disconnected and repetitive. Professors Mukerjee and LaFleur are amazing as individual professor, but as co-teachers, I felt their portions of the class could have been woven together a bit more.",
                "Strengths: engaging content, felt like I was learning a lot of material data with Professor Mukerjee and was learning ways to discuss that data with Professor LaFleur.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think either a little bit too much time was spent on the lecture section, or maybe it could've been better punctuated with something to break through the endless data. I understand there's a lot, but it was difficult to listen to and digest the numbers."

                "Absolutely!! Its an amazing course for people with and without knowledge about the subject. I really hope that it will be taught again!",
                "YES! This was such an amazing interdisciplinary course that drew from multiple experts, including classmates, and fields of study. I felt like I gained and learned so much about how healthcare is administered, about queer justice, about the unique positionalities of trans and gender non-conforming people in the US today, etc. These lessons and skills will definitely benefit me as I move into the healthcare sector.",
                "Yes! This course is fantastic-- students get a breadth of knowledge in trans healthcare, procedures, policing, and incarceration, and are able to make connections between the injustices in each. The coursework allows students to specialize in a subject of their choosing, and work closely with other students (without the risk of the classic group project work disparities, because research is submitted and graded separately before group work begins). Having both Ronica and Greta allows for an intimate professor-student experience, and is an incredible way to learn from people with two different perspectives and backgrounds.",
                "Yes! I hope this course is offered again, because I thought the material was critically important to anyone interested in health and\/or LGBTQ+ studies.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This course was wonderful through and through. Professor LaFleur and Professor Mukerjee are amazing at what they do, and balanced being both warm and accommodating with teaching us a lot of information and having high expectations of us. I know from other classes that that can be a hard balance for teachers to achieve, but they did it really well! It was also really great for me to be able to get a science credit in an area that I am already so interested in and passionate about.",
                "I would recommend this course. It was, admittedly, an easy science credit, but I think it's an important course for any student who has an interest in EITHER medicine OR gender studies\/theory.",
                "Yes! It's a relevant course, with fantastic instructors, focusing on society's most marginalized. It's an extremely important course, and it's taught well. Also, for queer folks at Yale, it honestly feels like so much of a support group, which is absolutely wonderful!"
