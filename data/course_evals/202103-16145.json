We also did two research projects on a country of our choice so we got to learn about the energy consumption of any country we were interested in or had a connection to.",

                "strengths: excellent professor!, interesting readings, very engaging in-class discussion, and interesting final project topic",
                "This course was nice in that it was really a case of however much you put in you get out. The work load wasn't too bad and the format Dr. Oristaglio had (discussion first lecture last) helped with staying engaged during class. I think a little more communication about when discussion posts were needed or not would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: I liked the four graded assignments we did (land metric area of an energy source, paper on a country of our choice's 2030 energy plan, market electricity bidding exercise, and presentation on a country of our choice's potential for Net Zero by 2050).  Great professor. \r\nWeaknesses: The course had quite a bit of overlap with Renewable Energy, so sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning much new information.",
                "Strengths: Professor Oristaglio is clearly passionate about the subject and I found all of the topics to be very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it would have been nice for additional discussion about the topics.",
                "I think Professor Oristaglio is amazingly clear about his expectations in the sense that does not intimidate students and encourage risk-taking.",
                "I liked our discussions, and think that as discussion section would be a nice addition to the class.",
                "Strengths: because it's an energy studies class, everyone there is super interested in the material and clearly cares! material is so relevant and discussions were really fruitful. Also none of the assignments felt pointless, I learned something different from each one. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the powerpoints in class were really long and with a lot of text, so it was hard to keep up/stay engaged"

I also enjoyed the group projectsnot only were they helpful to learn the subject matter, they introduced me to other Energy Studies students. Especially after a year on Zoom, it was nice to meet people with common interests!",
