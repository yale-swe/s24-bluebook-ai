                "I learned how to take integrals and derivatives in more than two dimensions and how to conceptually think about integrals and derivatives. I learned how to develop a geometric intuition for calculus and things more generally.",
                "Very in-depth understanding of multivariable calculus conceptual and problem-solving techniques.",

                "Much more detailed understanding of multivariable calculus as opposed to the highschool class.",
                "Throughout the duration of this course, I cultivated a profound understanding of multivariable calculus, unraveling its intricate concepts and applications. Thanks to Professor Smith's teaching, I not only learned about multivariable calculus -- which turned out to be fascinating -- but also honed my analytical prowess, gaining a nuanced perspective on the interplay between mathematical principles.\r\n\r\nI initially enrolled in this course thinking it would be the last math course I would ever take; however, Professor Smith rekindled my passion for mathematics by not only broadening my theoretical grasp but also sharpening my problem-solving skills. I am now seriously considering the math or applied math majors.",
                "How equations look like on graphs",
                "I understood and learned how to apply the theories and techniques of multivariable calculus, grew my mathematical problem solving skills, improved my ability to visualize math problems (especially in 3D), and gained intuition for why a lot of these theorems and processes worked.",

                "Strengths: interesting applications\r\nWeaknesses: very demanding\/hard course load, inconsistency between the class\/PSets and the exams, very fast pace",
                "Strengths are definitely the lectures. This class is super fast paced, but the Professor Smith's lessons helped clear up confusion from the pre-class videos and visualize all of the 3D concepts. Weaknesses were the fast pace. I feel like I would only understand something when I was studying for the midterms\/final, and even then, course material continued so I would get behind on that week's work.",
                "This course is difficult but organized very well.",
                "Strengths: pre-class videos very helpful to introduce the concepts that will be taught in class the following day. Even if one doesn't fully comprehend the pre-class video material, being exposed to it in any capacity was beneficial. It would help combat the forgetting curve and make the concepts truly stick. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having 2 attempts to solve the pre-class quizzes was annoying. The problem sets were too long. Not even too difficult. Too long. Some integrals were unreasonable, as they only test your calc 2 skills and was a waste of time.",
                "This course had a lot of strengths in my opinion. My instructor was extremely good at explaining the material. His drawings helped me understand the material very well. He also was very good at answering questions, making it so that I wouldnt have to spend much time outside of class relearning the material. The peer tutors were also extremely helpful at answering homework questions and were a nice complement to the in-class lectures. One weakness was that we would have to watch pre class videos covering content that we wouldnt cover for another three or so classes because we fell slightly behind at the beginning of the semester. This may not be a weakness, but the homeworks would sometimes take an extremely long time to complete and I would bet money that other students would agree that the homeworks could be more condensed.",
                "The instruction in this course was incredible. Class time instruction was very in-depth and there were plenty of peer tutoring hours, review sessions, and office hours to aid in understanding the content. The only thing which I think could be changed is the length of the last few psets - which took a very long time to complete.",
                "I felt like it wasnt continuous going from lesson to lesson, which always made it seem like we were behind or missing some information. However, I must give credit to professor Smith for doing such an excellent job drawing pictures to help us visualize concepts and doing big idea recaps at the beginning of each lecture.",
                "This course was very comprehensive. However, the course was poorly organized. The majority of the learning I did was through the pre-class videos. The lectures then reinforced some concepts from these videos but often didn't cover everything needed to complete the p-sets. Furthermore, each of these three \"modes\" of teaching were asynchronous, with the pre-class videos covering material a couple days before the lecture material, and then the p-set material being from a week before. This made retaining information and actually learning more difficult. I think it would have been really helpful if we were able to get answer keys to the p-sets after we submitted them with detailed explanations of the solutions. This would've been enormously helpful in understanding how to tackle specific problems that we would see on exams. For example, even if we got the answer correct to a problem, it would've been helpful to see what the most efficient way to solve the problem was.",
                "Strengths include a very organized structure or lectures, extensive support\/supplemental network, and very elaborate professors. Weaknesses include a lack of student network fostered.",
                "I appreciated how this course comprehensively covered the fundamental concepts of multivariable calculus and how some applications were emphasized (although I think more applications could be explored together in class). The course effectively navigated through intricate topics such as functions with multiple variables, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and vector calculus, and had a wealth of resources to supplement learning (Professor Smith's visuals were extremely helpful).\r\n\r\nOne potential weakness is the pace of instruction, which at times went a little slow. While it was helpful to focus on examples, I feel that at times we focused on some less important and obscure examples (usually prompted by questions from students in class) and had less time to review harder topics. While I think it's great that our questions were valued and thoroughly addressed, I wish we had gone over those questions a little quicker and continued with the slide show. Otherwise, I think the course organization was great!",
                "Helps with critical learning\r\nTutorial vids are nice\r\nTests are pretty hard",
                "This is a great class!! I really enjoyed lecture and learned a lot. The psets were challenging but really helpful, and made sure I knew the material well. Peer tutoring was really helpful and the peer tutors all did a great job. Overall a great class!!",
