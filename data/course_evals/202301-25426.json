It's different material than we normally learn at school, I feel, so that made it especially interesting. I think the only problem with the assignments was that at times it felt we waited too long between when we were assigned the project and when we actually completed it--we, in some cases--had to relearn the material. But, this is not necessarily a bad thing and created a low stress environment which allowed us to enjoy the class."
