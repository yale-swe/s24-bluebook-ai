I connected to the same depth with the Cohort instructor.\r\nI learned to connect my ongoing educational experience at Yale with my future involvement in public education.

JUST ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET. \r\n- the entire cohort. they are just absolutely amazing. i dont know how the department does it but they really just gather the like best people. \r\n- that we can come as we are and be our full selves, and that assignments have a purpose beyond a grade or the scope of the course. the assignments actually have meaning.",
                "Literally no weakness, everything was wonderful",
                "TZB organizes the class to make students feel valued, appreciated, seen, and respected. I always looked forward to our Wednesday night seminars because of our \"come as you are\" policy, which made me feel engaged and excited even when I was struggling with the semester or with personal things. This was a space of catharsis and healing and made me really excited about being in education. The readings were fantastic and really engaging.",
                "this cohort class was amazing and i would take it a million times again. only thing i think could be improved is that there were a lot of talks that were at the same time as class which made it so there was like a month where we didnt meet, but that was more of a scheduling issue",
                "The community built in this class was hands-down the most loving and positive space I've had in a Yale class.",

                "This is excellent. It feels somewhat unnecessary to provide an evaluation since all EDST scholars have to take this and no one else does, but it is certainly an excellent course and feels extremely worthwhile. I would say this class is one major way that the EDST scholars program feels a lot better than doing the certificate, and that is getting to do the projects and readings and community bonding with the other students in this class.",
                "Strengths: The course was structured around what we as students wanted to do. It built such a strong, welcoming community among students and created a space where we could reflect on our experiences in education and ways we can improve it for others\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The emphasis on building community was immensely refreshing and often one of my favorite parts of the week.",

The early readings of the course prompt discussions that really enabled us to get at the heart of what we feel need be changed about the way schooling is often done, and the unhealthy attitudes and mindsets many students fall into. There is also something immensely energizing about being able to build community and sense of belonging with other people interested in education.",

Ed studies scholars are also incredible people to meet and interact with."
