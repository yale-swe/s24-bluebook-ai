                "A major strength is the use of TopHat for the textbook and hw, which I found to be much more intuitive to use than most traditional textbooks. Paul Cooper is also a great presence and helped pull us all through.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the entire course, seeing as it was online, was getting to be in breakout rooms for the biweekly sections. So many nice people!",
                "This course had a very compacted schedule, so there was no time to really study or absorb information before learning a completely new topic.",
                "This course is very intense, and while it was more narrow focus than Gen Chem I was still challenging. I think the 5-week format is an added challenge, but overall the layout of the course was solid.",
                "Everything was recorded so it was easy to go back and refresh on new material. There were a lot of Q&A sessions and practice material\/problems. The only hard part is keeping up with the material since it was everyday for 5 weeks in a row excluding the weekend.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Cooper is a great professor. He's a good, engaging lecturer who encourages us to ask questions during class. He's also very willing to meet outside of class which is nice. Tophat was an excellent Homework platform\/textbook because we could get feedback on our homework in real-time and have the opportunity to correct it, which was incredibly helpful for such a fast-paced class. Weaknesses: Fast pace of the course was challenging and very time-consuming, as is the nature of a summer session course. Be ready to spend a lot of your time studying outside of class.",
                "The strengths was the lecture content and the professor. The weaknesses was the online format and how fast paced the course was but that's just the nature of a summer class during COVID.",
                "Dr. Cooper taught the class content well-- I did not think I would enjoy Chemistry particularly, but I have gained a liking to the subject after this class.\r\nIt would have been better if classes were asynchronous, with extra office hours instead.  This was the format of another summer course I took, and I found it very efficient.",
                "Tophat was a glitchy platform, not user friendly, often graded incorrectly. I much preferred sapling learning.",
                "I think this course is better suited for an in-person and more spaced out format. Its a lot of material to digest over such a short time frame over the summer.",
                "Strengths: The course is focused on relatively few topics. It continuously builds on previous material; you don't find yourself forgetting content from the beginning of the semester. (That last point may also come about from the compressed summer schedule, however.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: New content was rushed towards the end. Practice exams could be longer \/ more representative of actual exam difficulty. \r\n\r\nBut above all, the greatest weakness was the Top Hat textbook. I already had a General Chemistry textbook that I rented for Gen Chem I, but access to the Top Hat online textbook was not optional because the course's homework was built into it. This thing cost $95. We only needed it for 5 weeks, and it cost $95. And it's not even a good textbook - there were several scientific mistakes pervading the in-chapter and homework questions, as well as many typos. The Top Hat textbook is currently the official textbook for the Summer Session Gen Chem I & II, but I sincerely hope that changes.",
                "Strengths: teaching style, organization, structure with daily lecture, weekly homework, and periodic quizzes\r\nLecture slides available far ahead of time and easy to take notes from\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Tophat online platform was not good (confusing\/poorly organized)",
                "Strengths: The material was pretty interesting, Dr. Cooper was a great teacher, and the homework and tests felt decently fair. Even though it was a fast paced course things were explained well.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated if there were more exam style questions featured in the homework or in practice tests. It hink we would have benefited with more experience in that format."

                "Yes, but be careful if you're considering taking Gen Chem 1 and 2 consecutively in the summer. I was super burnt out by week 3 of this course, and it seemed even worse for the people who were also in lab. The pace is relentless but totally doable if your set-up lets you put in the time (probably 4-5 hours per day).\r\n\r\nI liked GC 1 much better, because the first 2 weeks of GC 2 were a bit of a slog (endless equilibria problems). I'm neither premed nor a chem major, so take that into account. The later topics were much more interesting (electrochemistry and nuclear chemistry).\r\n\r\nThe best part of the course by far was the breakout roomsthe people in this class were so incredibly nice, and not competitive whatsoever!!! Everyone felt comfortable asking embarrassing questions, and even online there was a sense of community that was really a life-saver.",
                "YES!! Chemistry is so interesting and it explains so many facets and processes to life that we take for granted everyday.",
                "I would recommend this course for someone that needs to fulfill requirements during the summer session. It allowed me to fully focus on chemistry instead of having other unrelated courses during the fall or spring semester to divert my attention.",
                "Yes, it was nice to do chem over the summer.",
                "Yes if it is for a pre-requisite. If you really like chemistry then sure.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially with Dr. Cooper. You probably are taking it for a requirement, but it's really not a bad course at all.",
                "Yes. Necessary class for many requirements but is still an enjoyable class with interesting content.",
                "Yes, Dr. Cooper is great at teaching and is kind and respectful to students.",
                "I would recommend taking this course with Dr. Cooper if youre premed or need it for your major. If not, its a lot of material and pretty complex so I wouldnt just take it for fun.",
                "Yes. If you took Gen Chem I in the spring, it's a great idea to complete the general chemistry sequence over the summer. The course moves fast, but it's a rewarding process. Plus, it keeps earlier content fresh in your mind for the final. Also, you get plenty of attention from the instructor \/ TA because the course has lower enrollment compared to its fall \/ spring counterparts.",
                "Yes, mostly as a good way to get a required course completed",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has prior chemistry knowledge. Because of the pace of this course, it definitely helped to have a general understanding of some of the topics before starting the class. All and all though, it was a good way to get general chemistry out of the way over the summer so that you can take more advanced classes during the year."
