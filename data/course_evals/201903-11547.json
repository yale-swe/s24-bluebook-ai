   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- diverse set of labs\r\n- Lots of techniques\r\n- individual attention\r\n- swap partners (work with others)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- N\/A",
    "The course is well structured for student learning and complemented the lecture curriculum well (with the exception of the torque lab, as this was not taught in Phys 170). The workload was just enough to encourage me to review what I had learned in lab and extrapolate from this, but not so much that it was unnecessarily time-consuming.\r\n\r\nThe course's main weakness was that the finals require that students can think and carry out experiments very quickly, so the grade more accurately reflects the student's ability to finish in time and think fast enough than actual knowledge of the subject.",
    "It's a little bit dull and tedious at times.",
    "This course load is very fair.  You are expected to do your work, and get in and get out.  However, the final exam was extremely harsh.  It was way too long for the time allotted and did not compare to anything given for practice.  The exam's 3 portions were each labs that we completed with a partner in 3 hours, let alone 1 hour by ourselves with no help.  I thought the midterm and final were unfair compared to the labs we did during the course.",
    "the class didn't ask us to do any busy work--everything we had to do was useful for understanding physics\r\n\r\nthere should be diagrams in the lab manual--it's hard to visualize some of the apparatuses if you've never worked with that type of equipment before. also, the criteria for insight was super vague and I could never really figure out why I was getting points off",
    "Strengths: the lab report summaries don't usually take too long so the weekly workload wasn't too stressful\r\nWeakness: the final exam is 3 experiments in 3 hours, while normally we do one experiment in 3 hours, so timing is hard. Sometimes the experiments seem like busy work.",
    "This is the least relevant and applicable course I have ever had the misfortune of taking",
    "This course is well organized. However, it can be further improved by clearly pointing out the take home lessons of each experimentation after we have turned in our lab report. I believe that highlighting the important concepts and techniques in each physics experiment we do is very crucial in facilitating learning.",
    "The strengths are that the weekly labs aren't super challenging and really guide students through understanding physical concepts. The weakness of this course is its final exam. I found it very inaccessible for people like myself who did very well on every regular-class lab report, but struggled to (and didn't) finish the 3 labs that were given within the hour constraint. I felt like the exam tested my ability to move quickly rather than my physics knowledge, which I felt as if I had shown well throughout the course. Maybe condensing the exam to 2 and allowing more time for each (1.5 hours?) would be beneficial to other students who had similar experiences to my own. Other than that, I really enjoyed the course; I just left the course feeling horribly because of how the final exam went for me.",
    "Strengths: I had to learn how to work with many different people to get a task done.\r\nWeakness: The grades seemed arbitrary and there was very little feedback. The TAs and even the professor never knew what was going on. The midterm and final were terrible and made me feel like a failure, but I never got feedback on anything to improve. I hate that I have to take the second part of this class...",
    "The lab reports\/quizzes are fine, the midterm and final exam is what really gets everyone.",
    "This course was OK. Strengths: I think it did a good job pacing students throughout the class - exposing students to one new concept at a time. i.e. this week we'll learn about uncertainties, this week we'll learn about the photogate; this week we'll learn about y. And then at the end, we started to synthesize what we learned. That was nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes using LoggerPro can be frustrating, also sometimes the calculations can become overwhelming, especially if you're tired and 2.5 hrs into the lab.",
    "I learned that I do not like physics lab. I do not understand physics. I do not enjoy physics. The saving grace was my great TA, but the style of the labs was such that I was expected to teach myself concepts, understand equations haphazardly thrown at me, take a quiz, and then do an experiment that I felt was very redundant and roundabout.",
    "Strengths: Only 3 hours, lab reports are pretty straightforward and the quizzes are fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exams are horrible, I think they are designed to be as stressful as possible. They are almost impossible to study for, graded VERY harshly and arbitrarily (do not be surprised if you get massive deductions with no explanations, and if you ask your TA or prof why, they will more than likely have no idea), and are a massive time crunch. I am convinced that most of the TAs would struggle to finish a couple of the exam stations in time. Exams are 40% of your grade and, at the time of writing this, I still have no idea how the class is actually graded. Unclear if it is curved, if so to what extent, and if not what the cutoffs are.",
    "The labs are a bit dry, but I understand only so much can be done with these types of experiments.",
    "The teaching staff were fantastic - super nice and gave great explanations to our questions. The labs were, by and large relatively engaging, although some felt quite mundane and tedious. I think the main weakness of the course is the intensity of the midterm and final - they were incredibly fast-paced and pretty difficult and it felt like they weren't actually indicative of how well you understood the material and could conduct the labs. They also did not provide feedback on the midterm, which was annoying and seemed counterintuitive to the entire point of midterm exams.",
    "I thought that the course was well taught and organized, but we received fairly little feedback (particularly to our midterm) about why points were lost.",
    "The strengths are that the lab handouts provide relatively good background information for each lab. The weaknesses are that the lab handouts would be better if they included more stepwise instructions for completing the lab, and if there were more opportunities to practice with LoggerPro and the equipment before the midterm and final exam. Feedback on the midterm exam should be given to students so that they may learn from their mistakes in preparation for the final exam.",
    "this class is only facilitated to those who excel in a laboratory setting. It doesn't offer students without this area of strength to succeed. There should be a more diverse midterm and final exam.",
    "The labs were good at helping us understand physics principles. However, for the midterm, grading was such that we never got concrete feedback for how to improve\/why we got things wrong.",
    "Some of the grading and expectations were extremely unclear, and many of the instructions made no sense.  It felt like they were throwing out random grades. Nobody really knew what was going on, especially my TA.",
    "The grading was wildly inconsistent and unpredictable, particularly for the midterm (and presumably for the final). No one seemed to know what was going on, including the TAs. Notably, grading between TAs was also remarkably inconsistent, but that's no surprise. The instructors have to find some way to generate a curve, why not make it random? One good thing was that this is the first lab course I have taken that genuinely has a fair workload for a 0.5 credit class.",
    "I wish we received feedback on our lab reports and writeups earlier, rather than having a 3-4 week delay on grading and receiving them back.",
    "It was boring and tedious but overall could be worse.",
    "The labs are incredibly uninteresting. At best, they further no one's education, and often they incentivize students not to pursue STEM or physics. It's hard to tell if anyone cares about the class. Students don't, the TFs don't seem to, and neither do the professors. You can't blame them for not caring about something that is much more tedious than it is interesting. It's hard to believe that Yale continues to put resources into something that so few people care about.",
    "This is a very efficient and straightforward lab. You learn about experimental design, various tools, and error calculations and write up a 1-page reflection on your data and potential errors every week, which is a good way to process and internalize what you did without taking too long.",
    "The course is not very transparent about grading, and lab report scores are too variable among all TAs. Little feedback or rhyme\/reason is given for docked points. There was not enough preparation for the midterm and final exam.",
    "I think in the beginning of the course, TAs should spend some time on helping students understand \"insight\" and how to write the lab reports.",
    "Make it an even split between concepts from phys 170 and 180. I often felt at a disadvantage because a lot of the time, the lab would cover something that 180 had already covered but 170 had not (the most obvious example being the labs dealing with rotational torque).\r\n\r\nAlso the final is extremely stressful, and the labs feel too long for the time allotted. I would maybe do two labs in 3 hours instead.",
    "It would have been nice to have a more thorough discussion about the lab prior to beginning about the most important concepts. Sometimes I felt that I did not realize the main point of the lab until halfway through. It would be helpful to know this in the beginning.",
    "i don't feel like i learned that much and i was expected to know and apply random physics concepts that i didn't learn in class either, so lab was often inefficient. The environment is pretty chill which is good, but overall i wouldn't take it unless you have to (which you probably do) . Lab reports are pretty low workload which is good.",
    "I'm not really sure what this course is trying to accomplish, so it's hard to propose any improvements. I gained no increase in theoretical background in taking this course, but this is a lab course so that makes some sense. However, I didn't really learn any transferable lab skills either. Logger Pro seems like this archaic software that no one really uses in the real world, and I don't sense any of my statistical knowledge (or lack thereof) from this course will serve me in the future.",
    "The class is not really a class, there is little instruction to offer you a better understanding of material.",
    "Grading is slow. The labs are really long. Emphasis on uncertainties is annoying and sometimes time costly. The grading curve is anxiety-inducing. This lab is like Hell's kitchen. You mess up and that is it for you. You fail may fail the midterm and question if you should have Cred\/D the course.  Majority grading is based on one final. Overall, net negative course!",
    "The thing I dont get about this class is that its so easy yo to the final, which I feel like is just a way to drive down grades. It just feels anti-pedagogical.",
    "The course made me very confident in my ability to interpret a lab design and create an effective procedure. There were several \"wow\" moments when my expectations were blown away (i.e. gyroscope lab), and it was cool to see physics concepts from class in real life. I think the class relied to much on LoggerPro, which made most weeks thoughtless data analysis projects.",
    "A weakness is that it often times felt like doing pointless things for hours just to fill the time. A strength is that it was interesting to experimentally determine things like gravity and mechanical energy.",
    "I would want faster turn around time on the lab notes so that we can improve. I also wish comments were made on our mid term blue books rather than just points off because I am not sure where I went wrong where to lose the points.",
    "The weakness of this course is that it is super boring and the lab reports are tedious without being worth much. The nice thing is that they are max one page so you don't spend too much time on something that you would rather not be doing.",
    "Strengths: much less work than other lab courses \r\nWeaknesses: it's pretty mind-numbingly tedious and makes you think why it's a requirement for so many things. The practicals also never really seemed to truly test my understanding of the material since it was so easy to make one error and then fall irrecoverably behind. I don't get what lab instructors do these things",
    "This is a horribly designed course that doesn't really aim to teach you how to do physics lab experiments. It's more about weeding you out and trying to get you. The midterm and final exam are horribly designed as well and try to fit way too much in very little time. They need to focus more on teaching us concepts rather than just trying to get us with extremely difficult exams.",
    "Just kind of boring im sorry not my thing",
    "3 hours is a lot of physics lab",
    "The experiments are not super thought provoking.",
    "This course does not teach you about how to apply physics in a practical setting. It is tedious and emphasizes skills that do not correlate with understanding of physics. The curriculum should be overhauled and redone to either line up with the physics lecture course (i.e. two separate lab courses, one for each lecture) or to actually teach practical laboratory skills completely independent of the lectures, not this strange in-between situation.",
    "The one really good lab we had was the Gyroscope because it actually explained and showed us how angular momentum works. Some labs were not really necessary and felt like a time waste. The midterm and especially the final was painful to take because it felt like too much in such a short short span of time. I understand wanting us to apply concepts in new ways but to do 3 labs in 3 hours when it was new to do felt like a lot. I feel like two labs of the same length for the final would have been better.",
    "More clarity and consistency in grading would be appreciated.",
    "This lab lined up well with the lecture material. All the labs were fairly straightforward and did not take too much time. The lab reports were short and tailored towards understanding the material (much better than Gen Chem!). The lab quizzes and overall course grading was fair. I wouldn't say the labs were particularly interesting, and by the end of the course you will come to hate uncertainty calculations.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the fact that lab reports are capped at a page since it doesn't take very long to do them. However, one of the biggest weaknesses is the midterm and the final exams. I feel as though they do not do a good job of portraying how much a person has truly comprehensively learned over the course of the semester and more so is a measure of how well you memorized very specific programs or topics. I think this could be greatly improved by allowing people to know what the experiments are in advance such is the case in other subjects' labs that have practical exams to take the stress off of memorizing how to do many specific tasks and more so being able to study the actual Physics behind an experiment.",
    "My only criticism for improving the course would be to clarify the idea of \"adding insight\" to lab reports, it seems to be very subjective based on the TA. Maybe adding a paragraph explaining what's expected of students in the syllabus would clarify.",
    "The lab was enjoyable and short compared to other labs. The lab reports were a nice summary of the work that we did and I appreciated them. However, the midterm and final exams were honestly way too difficult compared to the labs that we performed in lab. We shouldn't be expected to do something that we've never done before when most of our grade is on the line. Also, the fact that the exams time-constrained is completely different from the labs. Some of us work slowly and precisely and don't like to rush.",
    "Strengths: facilitated my learning in Phys 180\r\nWeaknesses: felt final was unfairly difficult, in a way the midterm did not represent",
    "The experiments themselves were thoughtfully designed, easy to conduct, and insightful. The lab manuals were clear and questions could be resolved easily by consulting with the TA. One area of improvement could be clearer standards for grading on midterm\/final exams, as well as on lab reports. For example, the example lab report provided at the start of the class on Canvas was not a realistic example of the level of detail needed for the course.",
    "Strengths: The experiments demonstrated the concepts very well and helped us to better understand physics concepts. The workload was fairreading the lab report every week, a weekly lab quiz, and a one-page report for each experiment was sufficient for ensuring that we understood the experiment going into it and demonstrated what we learned going out of it. No unnecessary information was asked of us.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No feedback was given for the midterm; even some sort of grading rubric would have been nice to have so that we could know where we went wrong. The final exam could use some improvement. I did not like that we were given 3 hours but were only given 1 hour per project instead of being allowed to allocate the time as we pleased. It made sense given how the room was set up, but for some experiments, there was a lot of time left over that could have been spent revising the last experiment. Another weakness is that the lab tended to be ahead of the Physics lab course itself, so we were learning a lot of new concepts prior to learning them in class. I would have preferred it the other way around.",
    "strengths: labs were well-organized and quite useful in showing us how theories worked in our hands - esp with gyroscope\/bike wheel and momentum\/torque\/precession. weaknesses: midterm and final practicals can be difficult and stressful, appreciated practice labs for final but wished we had these for midterm as well",
    "I really hated and dreaded the time that I would have to spend in lab every week. It was very boring and I don't think I learned much. There was barely any overlap with the physics 170 course that I was taking that it made it feel like very different physics experiences. The very few times that there was some overlap is the only time that I felt some benefit from this course. Otherwise i think the labs were annoying because of how detailed the lab notebooks had to be and I don't think i benefited much from the experience. Additionally, the midterm and final were intentionally made very difficult which is just cruel and stupid and ridiculous.",
    "Strengths: you get to perform some cool experiments and you get to see physics concepts demonstrated in real life; this course helped my understanding of PHYS 180\r\nWeaknesses: experiments are often tedious and uninteresting; uncertainty calculations are a pain; grading expectations for lab notes and summary are sometimes unclear.",
    "Strengths- the course is a in-depth analysis of how you should work in a lab.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the labs get very repetitive and are very, very tedious and boring. And for a 3 hour lab it gets tiring.",
    "Lab can be a drag, and it often feels like the procedures expanded and often repeated so as to fill the three hours.  Many, if not all, of the topics can be effectively demonstrated and analyzed in simple procedures, making the longer and more tedious elements of the experiments especially frustrating.  The lab's obsession with calculating and analyzing uninteresting uncertainties exemplifies this phenomenon.",
    "The course was my least favorite this semester. For a half-credit course, the course was SO much work--consider making it a full credit course. One good thing is that each lab only had a one-page long write-up, which I thought was helpful towards reducing the workload, but more could be done to reduce the hours and hours people spend doing these labs. For example, having not as harsh lab notebook grading could be helpful, as I spent hours trying to clean up my lab notebook so that I wouldn't have unnecessary points taken off. \r\n\r\nThe midterm and finals were harshly graded and very difficult. The labs themselves were difficult and confusing, though luckily my TA was good so they were able to help a little.",
    "this class sucks.",
    "The midterm grading was too harsh.",
    "This is just tedious. I didnt learn any new physics and the concepts were all very basic. It was really just tedious to get through the lab and then tedious to write the write up. Mostly all busy work.",
    "Labs aren't hard just extremely tedious.",
    "Strengths were that the environment was low stress and that the TAs were very good at handling all questions.",
    "Strengths: the department really tried to make the labs fun and the labs were generally enjoyable. Weaknesses: we received our lab reports very late so I couldn't use that rubric to improve my subsequent lab report writing.",
    "The professors and TFs in lab were very supportive and happy to answer any questions, and would usually follow through to make sure students understood any concepts they were struggling with.",
    "This course is not good for students in 170 since most of the time topics do not overlap. Also not helpful for med school so I think there should be a different lab for life sciences. Many of the labs were not written well making it hard to understand the directions.",
    "Physics 165L is the dullest class I have ever taken. You are trapped in lab for three hours performing high school physics experiments. These experiments attempted to be thought provoking but with material an basic as is used this effort is futile. The procedures are lengthy and seem to stress the dullest possible aspects, namly error analysis and error propagation through equations. The over silver lining to the lab is that the reports are minimal work, so the only real pain is limited to three hours a week.",
    "the setup to practice for the final was terrible. there were too few stations, so people had to wait hours to get their hands on a station. there could have been a better system to ensure that everyone who wanted to practice got the chance to. also, some labs were very, very difficult to complete in 3 hours, so there was more work (e.g. completing lab notes) that had to be done outside of lab time than just the lab report.",
    "Strengths: shorter lab than other courses. Lab reports were not stressful or too time-consuming\r\nWeaknesses: the labs we did were very ratchet and not fun, midterm\/final were really bad - felt very underprepared",
    "Sometimes the things we do in labs seem trivial and the grading seemed very confusing. I think the grade break downs should have been more centralized and more balanced.",
    "Time limit was very stressful and put a lot of pressure on us.",
    "The grading, especially for the midterm (and hopefully not the final), can seem especially arbitrary. Like they agree to take off a certain number of points every few minutes and just write the number at a random point on whatever page they happen to be grading. \r\n\r\nIt is a very well organized course and is very smoothly and competently run.",
    "The final is anxiety-inducing and rough.",
    "The course is neither easy nor particularly challenging. It is mostly tedious. I think it could be made a lot more clear what relevant knowledge we are supposed to take away from the course, since it seemed like we were mostly doing the labs for the sake of doing them. The course is well structured, though, and the assignments are reasonable and rational.",
    "This course was interesting in the experiments we completed but was too heavily focused on formatting instead of learning.",
    "No strengths- this course was a requirement",
    "Course was well organized and well taught. Just a bit long for the simple labs we were doing.",
    "Strengths: Organization of labs and handouts. Weaknesses: Emphasis on uncertainties detracts from conceptual learning",
    "I thought that course itself was fine. I wish that the lab was more in line with what was expected of us on the final because the midterm and final felt sudden.",
    "The course material felt pointless and tedious. Experiments took a long time to perform but were mostly just repetitive tasks.",
    "The midterm and final were both very stressful since they were lab practicals. The quizzes werent difficult but they were very tedious each time. The TAs vary a lot on grading and the midterm was graded without leaving any reasons for point deductions.",
    "More preparation for the midterms and finals.",
    "A strength is that you get feedback immediately. A weakness is that there wasn't much guidance or anything you could prepare for the practical exam. A weakness is that none of the labs corresponded to the physics course material and honestly seemed pretty tedious and non-translatable to research.",
    "Some of the labs seem pointless and didn't help me better understand the material",
    "Strengths: good professor and TA. \r\nWeaknesses: Classes are extremely tedious and boring the only thing we really learned was error calculation. The biggest weakness of the course is the ambiguity of the grading. I received zero helpful feedback on my midterm exam to help explain what I did wrong. My TA was unable to tell me why I lost points on certain questions because there was no markings or explanation by the grader just a score.",
    "very helpful staff but the work can be tedious at times, especially uncertainties",
    "This was a great lab course",
    "There was not a lot of feedback on how to write the lab reports, which made them difficult.",
    "The strengths of the class are the TA as well as the lab procedure. Many of the lab was easy to follow and you had a partner to work with. The weaknesses of the course is the structure of the midterm and the final. Although the midterm wasn't as bad, there didn't seem to be enough time to finish 3 labs within the allocated time on the final.",
    "They dont give clear feedback. The practicals did not allow us to show what we learned but seemed like they wanted to stress us out.",
    "The labs throughout the course are managable, but the final was much harder in comparison",
    "This course is pointless and a waste of time.",
    "Strengths: Having all the materials available on canvas and for clarity in experiments. Great TF. \r\nWeakness: Midterm preparation and training exercises were unavailable unlike for the Final. Grading became subjective and towards a curve at the end? Experiments would exceed 3 hour class time unnecessarily (i.e repeat experiment but with different liquid) just has diminishing returns for learning\r\n\r\nWHY IS THE EXACT SAME FINAL GIVEN TO FRIDAY STUDENTS AS TO MONDAY STUDENTS? Super unfair as a Monday Lab student to see that I would have to take the final 4 days before some of my other peers, also hearing from some of the Friday \/ Thursday students that they were able to ask other students ahead of time what the Final was on so they would have an advantage.",
    "Lab instructions are detailed enough to avoid confusion during labs but not too detailed as to make results of experiments obvious.",
    "The course was not designed to help students learn from mistakes. I asked for feedback on multiple separate occasions on how to improve on my lab reports (e.g. what are you looking for in lab insights) or how to correct for the missed points on the midterm.",
    "It is mind numbing. An afternoon in a lab doing experiments you already know the answer to is a slog mentally.",
    "Some the labs were engaging, but others felt like they were designed to take 3 hours without much purpose, so it would drag on",
    "I honestly don't know how to change the course.  I think the entire course is flawed and should be removed or drastically changed.  The labs\/lab reports are a waste of time, do not help the student understand the material better, and can be very specific in its grading.",
    "I think the course was pretty good at increasing the level of difficulty of the labs, the last few labs were definitely a lot more challenging than the first. I had trouble with the pre-lab quizzes despite making sure to do the reading before hand, but that might be due to my understanding of the material as opposed to the difficulty to the quizzes themselves. I also thought the midterm and final of the lab were a bit interesting, especially since other labs don't have exams. The midterm was fair, but I felt that the final was extremely challenging because of the limited time to complete the three labs. If it were possible to make the final two labs with more time, I think that would be more fair. I admit I was unable to attend the review sessions, but when I was trying to study I couldn't find any of the content online. If it were possible to upload the practice questions that were shown in the review sessions to Canvas I would think that could help a lot students.",
    "I did not find this course to be helpful in learning physics. All I had to work with in terms of learning the topics that the course aimed to teach was from the lab manual which consisted of about 10 pages of reading for each lab and\/or the TA giving a 3 minute explanation. The organization and teaching method of the course was not effective for me. I often found myself just doing the work I needed to get through the class, with little engagement. The midterm and the final were very stressful with having to do 2 experiments in 75 minutes\/ 3 experiments in 3 hours, respectively. I felt I couldn't show how much of the material I knew with the way the exams are set up, since each experiment only focused on 1 or 2 concepts. The midterm was especially difficult since we were given little information about how to approach it, how to study for it, or practice exams. Additionally, the midterm was graded but little to no feedback was given back, so it was difficult to know what went wrong and how to correct for them with the final exam. I felt like students were on their own most of the time with little instruction from the professor. I rarely saw the professor the entire semester. The computers and LoggerPro software used were often slow and hard to use. There was very little connection to the topics that I was learning in Physics 170. I am not certain, but it's possible this course better connects to Physics 180.",
    "Strengths: good instruction\r\nWeakness: no commentary about how grading for midterm was done",
    "I wish that the TAs were more consistent in this class, and that the lab reports were less tedious to do. They are incredibly dry, and I often find that I have to rewrite calculations that I already know how to do just to fulfill the grading requirements. The final was also way too long! Very, very long! And I don't know anyone who finished all of it on time - it would be better if the midterm and final practical exams more accurately reflected the work we do week-to-week in the lab.",
    "I wish this lab reports in this class were less dry. Often, I find myself writing calculations that I already understand over and over just to fulfill grading requirements. Also, the final and midterm lab practical do not align very closely with what we do week-to-week in lab. I wish that students were better prepared for these exams, especially that very long final. Finally, I wish that the TAing was more consistent in this class! I think the experience in this course depends very heavily on the TA.",
    "Strengths of this course include the detailed instructions on the lab handouts that demonstrate how a physics lab is conducted and the partner-method of competing labs. I feel the quizzes are a potential weakness of the course. Occasionally the questions ask for us to memorize not general concepts, but exact formulas, which I feel does not exemplify understanding of the topic and demonstrate that preparatory reading was done.",
    "This course does not coincide with 170 at all. The only overlap was position, velocity and acceleration. I was prepared for this course due to my high school physics class, not because of 170.",
    "The course is extremely difficult because you are not taught anything",
    "This course complements any physics course on mechanics as it gives real life examples for many of the topics in the classroom.",
    "The midterm and finals were incredibly difficult and I felt that most of my classmates felt both surprised by the level of difficulty, as well as unprepared and very discouraged by these exams.",
    "This course is extremely boring. We play with pendulums and video captures for 3 hours a week and then write about it. They are extremely nit-picky with grading but do not tell you what they expect from you. The atmosphere is painful. The lights are bright. It's hot. Make the labs more interesting!",
    "Labs were well organized and not too long. Good array of stuff. Lab reports were not bad at all, but allowed us to reflect helpfully on the experiments which was great."

    "No, not unless it is required.",
    "If you are into physics, then sure.  However, if you are taking 170 and don't need to take the lab, DON'T . This course did not compare to 170 at all and it felt like I was taking 2 separate courses that had literally nothing to do with one another. If you haven't ever seen physics, don't take this course, you will be lost.",
    "Don't take it for fun. But it's not that bad if you have to take it. Not very interesting, but not hard.",
    "Yes if you have to take physics lab, it's not too much workload on the weekly basis, but make sure you prepare for the final exam.",
    "No; the midterm and final are unnecessarily difficult",
    "Yes, this course gives you the right amount of work. It is manageable and you learn a great deal of physics knowledge.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The lab is actually pretty fun, and you learn new concepts without having to stretch your brain too much. The professors and TFs are also there to really help you learn. I also liked learning how to use LoggerPro.",
    "Some labs were kind of boring and some took way too long and were a bit disastrous, but it was a fine course",
    "NO.",
    "This course isn't bad. But only take it as a req.",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "Not at all, but you probably have to",
    "Yes, if you need it for your major.",
    "I would only take this course if you have to for your major or pre-med requirements.",
    "Would only recommend if you have to take it as a requirement. There are more interesting labs that could be taken at Yale. The midterm and final exams are extremely hard, especially since you don't get much practice with the equipment outside of your lab time.",
    "no absolutely not.",
    "I would recommend if it's required or if you are very interested in physics principles.",
    "not unless you really need it. There is no way to prepare for the midterm\/final.",
    "This is likely required. If so, it's fine. If you have any choice or have any interest in learning, then no.",
    "If you take this class you are taking it because you have to.",
    "No, only students that have to take this class take it.",
    "If you want to learn more about error calculations and experimental design in a relatively chill environment, physics lab is a good way to do it. The class doesn't take too much time on a week to week basis, but the practical exams were somewhat more difficult - it's hard to go from working with a partner to doing everything alone in a time constraint.",
    "You are probably taking this course because you have to. It's not terrible but it's not the best course either because of the lack of transparency with grading.",
    "No, not unless it was a requirement.",
    "Yes, it helps apply physics to real life.",
    "probably not, but you also probably have to take this course. this lab is likely not any worse than any other physics labs, and its definetly better than chem labs",
    "Only if it's required. Useless if you're actually trying to learn something about experimental physics. My friends took 205L, and I suspect I might have preferred it.",
    "Not unless you have to.",
    "NEVER. Cred\/D it folks! This class is bad for mental health",
    "If you're looking to gain confidence in a lab or get through an easier lab requirement, go for it. It's largely mindless work.",
    "Not really... unless you need to take it for pre-med, which you probably do.",
    "Yes; take this course if you are taking Phys180, but not for fun. There are other fun courses at Yale like waterpainting.",
    "Physics lab is kind of tedious but it has to exist. Focus your energy on the midterm and final, as the lab reports are graded pretty arbitrarily. The calculations for uncertainties get very slow and unwieldy very fast. Most of the labs are not that interesting and don't come with any huge revelations. Protip: DO NOT sign up for the 3:30-6:30 slot on Thursdays because you will be hangry the entire time and it will make the class that much worse.",
    "No, but you probably don't have a choice.",
    "only if you have to.",
    "Absolutely not. But it's required, so there's not much to say. Just be prepared to get super frustrated with the course. It's super TA dependent, and the exams are actually so time limited. It's a horrible class.",
    "Nope. Super boring, tbh. Exams were also unreasonable for many students, very rushed.",
    "For some topics, lab helped me gain a deeper understanding but some labs just felt very tedious and pointless which was frustrating",
    "No. If you don't need to take it, taking introductory physics is enough",
    "Absolutely not. I had to take it, but would not recommend it to anyone who isn't required to go through it. This was the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "It's an okay lab. It's do-able. If you have to take a lab, I think this lab is easier than the higher ones.",
    "If it is required--yes.",
    "Not unless you actually need it. It's an easier lab than Gen Chem lab but it does prove itself to be very challenging at times. This especially happens when it comes to just understanding exactly what an experimental procedure entails since it isn't always clearly outlined for you.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have to take it. Spend your time taking another more interesting lab course. Although it's a well-organized class, it's not worth.",
    "Yes if they are taking Phys 180",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the subject matter. The course is insightful and interesting, but perhaps only so for students who are interested in physics beyond taking it as a required course. The workload is manageable and the labs occasionally were valuable for providing a sneak-peak at concepts that would eventually be taught later in the semester in PHYS180. This was actually surprisingly valuable, as it was helpful explore theory in a practical lab setting before learning about it in the lecture hall.",
    "yes - you likely will have to take this anyway, but not a terrible lab and one that actually supplements material in phys 180 in particular quite well. would recommend you take this with 180 (not 170) because the material directly correlates with 180 but i observed some students in 170 have a tougher time grasping concepts they were never introduced to in class",
    "No, don't take this if you don't have to.  It will bring down ur GPA for no reason. The labs are stupid, points get taken off for lab reports for no reason, the midterm and final are exceptionally hard.  A very bad course overall.",
    "No, not unless you have to take it. What you will learn from it is not really worth the amount of work you'll have to put into it if you're thinking of taking this for fun.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you had to take it.  If you want to understand the physics, simply take 180 or any of the other intro courses.",
    "Unless you must take it for requirements, no.",
    "no. it is not enjoyable in any way and i did not learn very much",
    "Sure, if you are taking this class you are probably required to do so.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is a requirement, otherwise, thought insightful, unnecessary.",
    "It's a manageable half credit if you're looking for that.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students taking physics  -- the lab is significantly less challenging than other courses, and generally aligns well with what is going on in lecture, allowing students to visualize the concepts they are learning about.",
    "Take this course if you have to.",
    "I would never recommend this course to a friend, but if your major requires this course, or you are pre med I think taking this over the 200 level lab is a good idea poorly looking at time spent on lab reports. If physics lab is a joy you seek in life then maybe the higher level lab is better.",
    "See answer to physics 180.",
    "no, unless you need to. the experiments are boring and frustrating. it's difficult not to question the purpose or relevance of some of them. i'm not sure if my understanding of physics has improved at all from taking this course.",
    "Nah, but if you're taking it you're taking it. Easier than chem labs on a weekly basis. It's only really stressful when the midterm and final roll around. All you can really do is pray that those don't go too poorly.",
    "Good introduction to how a college level lab is while also helping to learn some basic principles of physics.",
    "Only because it a requirement for most STEM majors.",
    "Do it if you have to.",
    "Yes but just to complete the requirement.",
    "Not at all",
    "I would not recommend this lab to another student. The experiments were dry and filled with a lot of busy work. The final practical was unfair.",
    "Yes, as a requirement.",
    "If you are a physics major or premed, sure. The class is as advertised, and it does its job well (much better than gen chem lab for sure), but outside of that it's a lot of experiments that at least to me felt kind of pointless. Maybe it'll be useful for physics majors as an intro to experimental design, but otherwise I didn't really get much out of it.",
    "No, I thought the class was extremely boring and badly taught.",
    "The lab was good. It was one of the least stressful labs I have taken at Yale, and the content was interesting.",
    "No, except its a requirement for a lot of people hence why people take it.",
    "Only if it is necessary. It doesnt cover any critical material or teach and necessary skills. However it is needed for many majors and especially pre-meds.",
    "Definitely a requirement for MCDB.",
    "No",
    "No, physics lab is the most tedious and least fun lab out of all the pre-med requirements.",
    "If the student needs the extra review of physical principals",
    "Not unless it is required or they want to do physics research. I felt the class was not relevant to what I want to pursue (engineering)",
    "Yes great course",
    "No. Don't take this unless you have to.",
    "I would only recommend this to another student if it is required. The length of the lab is ridiculous, but also even worse,  I was a Monday lab taker, and so it didn't make any sense to mean that people would take the same final that I would take or same midterm 3 days later cuz they were a Thursday lab? That's not exactly fair and I wouldn't be surprised if later lab times had higher average scores than Monday\/tuesday lab students.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I do not believe that this course is designed to help students learn but rather to compare students to a hard rubric without consideration of what is the best way to judge a student's progress.",
    "If it is a prerequisite for their major they must take it, but I would not take it for another reason.",
    "No, I would not, but most people taking this course are required to do so.",
    "Only if you have to take it. Be mindful that this course does not connect to Physics 170 almost at all; it's like taking two completely different physics courses. I thought that the lab for gen chem was bad, but this lab is far worse with little instruction and ineffective learning methods. I did not find this course to be helpful in learning physics.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to physics",
    "This class is likely a requirement! It is, however, less painful that general chemistry laboratory. So this is not the worst lab class at Yale by any means!",
    "This class is likely a requirement, and it is by no means the worst lab class at Yale.",
    "No. I would only recommend this if needed.",
    "No do not take this course unless you have to",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone taking a physics course on mechanics.",
    "No it is the most painful lab course I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "YES. if you have to take a physics lab, TAKE THIS ONE. You don't have to take 205 for many majors, and this is the best lab course I've taken at Yale."
