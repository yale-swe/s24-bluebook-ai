Before this course, I did not realize that colonialism is a central fact of world history, and that it has been systematically erased from Eurocentric narratives.",

                "I gained introductory knowledge about 20th century postcolonial theory and I was able to read a variety of novels (in both English & French!). I think I gained skills in efficient reading as well as forming an argument that relies on both complicated theory as well as fictional literary analysis.",

It seemed like a lot of people didn't feel the need to do the readings thoroughly, and the class conversations suffered a bit from that.",
                "Great feedback on my assignments, class discussions were always incredibly enlightening and enriching, texts on the syllabus were very well chosen. Weaknesses: N\/A",
                "I think the strengths of the course are just based on classroom engagement in discussion - I had really open and understanding peers who made each discussion wonderful! I honestly just wish the course met more than once a week, or at least that our weekly discussions were a bit more structured. Lastly, I wish there were a few more short assignments so we could receive more feedback on our understanding of the course material.",
                "All strengths!",
                "Strengths: Professor Habchi is very knowledgeable and cares about her students and their learning, and the syllabus is interesting and well-designed. Weaknesses: after the first weeks of the semester, which are dedicated to theory, we did not engage as deeply with the theory in a lot of the books we read, and the student presentations were not conducive to productive discussion. I was saddened by the difference in the intellectual \"rigor\" of the course after the beginning of the semester, which was excellent and challenged us, provoking some really interesting discussions. It would be great to see more theory texts sprinkled in throughout the semester, with the explicit goal in class of specifically analyzing how they manifest in the books we are reading. Otherwise, the discussions could feel shallow and get lost quite quickly.",

                "Yes - I thought the readings were amazing and Prof. Habchi is very knowledgeable. Sometimes the class conversations weren't the most in-depth, but if you're looking for a kind of chill class, this is a good one.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in engaging with postcolonial literature. I would also recommend this class to any student of French, as it focuses heavily on francophone literature and the legacy of French imperialism.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they want an introduction to postcolonial theory and if they're interested in applying theory to create their own unique arguments.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "I would, because Habchi is great and the texts are very interesting, but if looking to engage primarily with political theory, it may be worth it to look into another class unless the course's structure is altered.",
