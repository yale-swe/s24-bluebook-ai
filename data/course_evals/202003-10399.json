The course was genuinely about global poverty in that we focused very little if at all on domestic poverty in the US; the subject matter was more closely aligned with the type of stuff you'd see in a field like international development studies. In terms of skills, I worked on finding and evaluating primary sources (with mini-assignments throughout the semester and the final paper), and on different kinds of writing, mostly academic historical writing and one assignment that was more op-ed like.",

                "The readings are very interesting and there is A LOT of help\/guidance for writing the final paper, which makes you feel very prepared. I think weekly research assignments was way too excessive though, and I felt like discussion lagged sometimes.",
                "The readings were for the most part very interesting. If anything could be improved, it might simply be student participation. Professor Meyerowitz did the best she could to engage an online class.",
                "Strengths: As a whole, the organization of the course comes together really cohesively. Each unit was clearly distinct from the other and they built on each other well, which made it so that I could pretty concretely saw what new things I had learned from each week. Prof Meyerowitz also pulls together an interesting and diverse set of readings. Overall, too, Prof Meyerowitz clearly cared about whether or not we were engaged, and she tried different ways to organize class and facilitate conversation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I might have liked to see a bit more about how the approaches to international poverty were also related to strategies for tackling domestic poverty (e.g., how the premises underlying support for international aid in the '60s and '70s was related to the Great Society or the War on Poverty).",
                "This class was a good foundation for thinking about how development got to the place it is today. While we did engage in primary sources throughout the class, I would have appreciated more time spent on historical methods and writing.",
                "Prof. Meyerowitz is absolute amazing and this by far one my far one of my favorite classes I've taken! Her mini lectures at the beginning of each class are helpful in understanding the greater historical context; she also does a really good job of guiding the conversation during class. Overall, the course was very well-organized. The readings cover each topic comprehensively and present a range of perspectives. The additional research assignments were also helpful since I was able to look into topics more in depth using the library's database resources. Prof. Meyerowitz also did a really great job in structuring the term paper. We received feedback from her on our proposals and drafts, and I really enjoyed writing it."

Professor Meyerowitz encouraged us to start working on our final papers early in the semester in case some materials were only available in print.",

                "Like I mentioned in the strengths\/weaknesses question, Prof. Meyerowitz was good about keeping us engaged by 1) giving us mini-assignments many weeks that kept us thinking about the subject but weren't burdensome, and 2) organizing class in various ways, whether by setting up debates, using small groups, or just facilitating with helpful questions.",
                "The small class size helped, but the breakout rooms were not always effective, and sometimes it felt like we were just pushing forward reading-by-reading, getting a handful of comments on each text and proceeding rather than actually talking to each other.",
                "Despite being on Zoom, the seminar was still very engaging. We often did breakout rooms during class, which helped with discussion. Outside of class, Prof. Meyerowitz was always willing to meet with us individually, so overall I felt like I had a lot of support throughout the class."

                "Absolutely. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Meyerowitz  is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. The readings are excellent and come together incredibly well, and we have a high level of engagement with them due to a) the in-class discussions (I feel like so many Yale \"seminars\" are just the prof lecturing for 50 mins and then 10 mins of comments from the students-- that is absolutely not the case here), b) reading responses, and c) in-class activities. We also have small research assignments that supplement the readings very well. Working on the final paper so early in the semester has made finals week so much less stressful. There's also lots of opportunity to focus on something that interests you for the final paper, given the broad scope of the coursework.",
                "Yes. Totally fair workload--standard of humanities classes in reading 1 book a week or approx. 200 pages. I learned so, so much about stuff we don't talk about but things that are totally relevant to international affairs and politics today.",
                "Yes I would. The content is honestly very interesting and I feel like I learned a lot.",
                "Yes! The class was a great overview of development history.",
                "Yes, definitely, if you're interested in things like international development or generally curious about the issue of poverty. However, I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a course focused largely on domestic US policy.",
                "Yes, I think it is a useful class to take if you are interested in understanding how development theory was shaped to become what it is today.",
                "Absolutely! The course provides a really good overview for various trends in poverty alleviation. Prof. Meyerowitz is also a really wonderful professor and did a great job organizing the course and guiding our discussions during class."
