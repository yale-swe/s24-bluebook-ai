I learned how to approach engineering problems and became comfortable with complex problem solving. I also generally gained confidence in engineering thought.",

                "How to think like an engineer!",
                "This was one of the most challenging but rewarding engineering classes at Yale. The workload is about 2-3 times that of a typical engineering class but you learn how to solve general engineering problems that you never would have expected you could solve, not just memorize content or strategies for solving very specific classes of problems. Prof. Vanderlick is so dedicated to her students' success and lectures are very engaging. The class is designed so that you cannot fall behind on the work. Don't try to just submit answers to the homework without really understanding things just to get it done because you WILL have to learn the material eventually in order to pass. It is not easy but in my opinion very important to an engineering education.",
                "I learned about fluid mechanics and how engineers use approximations to model fluid flow through complex systems.",
                "Mass and momentum balances and their applications in various engineering problems; boundary layer theory; hydrostatics; flow in a pipe; Bernoulli's equation.\r\nThis is the first course in the chemical engineering major where you learn how to apply everything you have learned so far in real engineering problems. Most importantly, you learn how to use mathematics as a language and what an equation physically tells you in an engineering scenario.",
                "I won't regurgitate the Fluid Mechanics syllabus so I'll tell you what you learn, that is on the other side of the envelope. And this is really, the key. In this class, you learn how to wrestle with problems. Not the ones in your math class or chem class. But problems like the ones you will find in SpaceX, Tesla, Lockheed Martin, or any other company you decide to work on. And I say this not for the content, but for the *nature* of the problems. Rarely in undergrad do you encounter problems where you have to sit, digest, and chew, chew, chew a very specific problem under you take a stab at it, fail, iterate, and try again until you get it. The problems you'll encounter in this class are really hard, but I promise you will get good. And the KEY is you will get good at solving problems not just in Fluid Mechanics but in engineering in general. This is Vanderlick's \"trick\", which is that she teaches Fluid Mechanics (which is already a lot of content) and then SO much more. \r\n\r\nAnd in terms of the actual content, at the core you learn how an elegant and simple framework describes how mass, forces, and energy change through space and time. Which is honestly really cool."

                "It can be easy to feel discouraged when taking this class due to the workload and difficulty, but at the end of the day, it is a very worthwhile experience. This class has helped me feel more prepared in being\/becoming an engineer, and you have a variety of excellent support systems like the professor, TA, and fellow classmates. There is no curve for this class, so your peers are your collaborators, not your competition.",
                "Strengths - Dr Vanderlick Dr Vanderlick Dr Vanderlick. She is by far the most inspirational professor I have ever had. She lectures with such passion for the content and believes in every single student she teaches. She asks a lot from you, with 2-3 psets every week and very challenging exams, but it is all worth it in the end. You will leave the class feeling like you can now face anything. She pushes you to think creatively, to solve problems with dense mathematical operas, to stretch your intellectual curiosity to the max. She is also an incredibly multifaceted person and bring a wonderful personality to class. Honestly no weaknesses except that the content is extremely challenging to wrap one's head around. But with tons and tons of practice, you get there.",
                "The Professor was the highlight of this class. Professor Vanderlicks pedagogical approach was second to none. Everything from the way she presented the material to the class environment was both challenging and beneficial. This was a class that forced you to be confident and answer questions even when you didnt know the answer- a skill which I think is of utmost importance for any engineer.\r\nThe problem sets were pretty challenging and at times overwhelming, but this was ultimately a boot camp and I guess it works out in the end so just stick with it.",
                "Strengths: professor Vanderlick is by far the best professor I have had during my time at Yale. Not just the best STEM professor, but the best professor period. She will demand a lot from you, but in exchange, she will reward you with so much as well. Not only is she a superb lecturer, prof. V is also a fascinating person and an inspiring role model to look up to in terms of her career. I am so so grateful I had the chance to take this course with her and get to know her a bit better. Another strength is that you will definitely learn the course content thoroughly. There are a lot of problems to solve and it is very difficult to not master the content if you make an effort to solve them. I also quite liked the grading scheme. I believe it was relatively fair and not overly strict on the students. \r\nWeaknesses: oh my god, this course is so so much work. Just be prepared to be working on transport problems every single day of the week. The problems are also so difficult, but towards the end of the course you'll start to get the hand of things. But the sheer amount of work and the difficulty of that work can be emotionally and mentally very taxing.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is probably the most I've ever learned in a single course at Yale. The workload is intense, and probably more than I've ever had for one class, but it prepared me on the material. There was so much to cover in one semester but with all the practice we had it felt more manageable, and I don't know how all of this could be a taught effectively in any other way. (Praying for the students in the MENG class). The lectures gave us all we needed to know and were engaging for it being fluid mechanics. I knew I couldn't miss a class because of how much content that was covered in each lecture. The TF and Peer Tutor Julia and Kristjan were wonderful and really went out of their way to help us, working more hours than they probably should've just to make sure we were supported. There was a sense of solidarity amongst a lot of students in the class trying to help each other, and I hope that is true for all semesters of this class. The only weakness of this course is the insane workload, but I do not have any alternative solution for teaching all this material in one semester WHILE having the students get enough practice with complex and not straight-forward problems. This course is what ENAS 194 differential equations is trying to be. This is my favorite course that I have taken at Yale.",
                "It is a hard course. If you fall behind, it is really hard to catch up.",
                "I'll start by saying there are no weaknesses to this course. Relative to every single other course that I've taken at Yale, whether it be in STEM or in the humanities, this course was by far the most organized and best taught. \r\n\r\nThe biggest strength to this course is Professor Vanderlick. I think you'll struggle to find a professor at Yale, or anywhere, who will push you as hard as Prof V does. But you'll also struggle to find a professor, mentor, teacher, whatever, who is as enthusiastic, knowledgable, patient, and effective as Professor Vanderlick. That being said, our class also had fantastic support; our TA and peer tutor were both incredible. You may read in other course reviews that this class essentially has at least one problem to do every day. This much is true. But you have to embrace it. For those that do, you won't regret it. You'll find, after it's all over, that no other class will have left you with as much sheer knowledge as this class. \r\n\r\nSo, above all else, the biggest strength of this course is that I walked away from it feeling like I learned something, something that is really challenging to grasp. And what I learned seems permanent; I didn't just learn it for some final or test, but I understood it. That's a feeling you can't beat.",
                "I wish I had access to the lecture recordings as soon a lecture was over just because i need to review the class multiple times to understand the concepts. More Van der lick one on ones because I finally understood concepts when professor explained them to me.",
                "This class is 2-3x harder than any other engineering class but you will learn that much more",
                "Strengths: The course was very well-structured, and the lectures were really good. The homework problems were very good practice and completing them ensured that we understood the material. The exams were also very fair, and overall I greatly enjoyed this course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Only one (minor) thing- every problem had a separate submission on Canvas, which was a bit tedious to submit. It would have been easier if the problems assigned at once were grouped into problem sets.",
                "Professor Vanderlick is absolutely amazing and is really the best part of the course. Her delivery of the lectures was very engaging and understandable, where she circled back to how everything fits together in the larger realm of things. Her office hours were also very helpful in solidifying the material. \r\nThis class is definitely a lot of work and a tremendous time commitment, and sometimes I felt like there were not enough office hours to assist with the homework. However, this is truly the point of the course, where you have to independently work through problems and sometimes spend a few days thinking about them.",
                "Strengths: The course is designed in such a way that it will challenge you like no other class (by exposing you to really complicated content in sheer volumes of psets) but it does so in a \"directed way\" in that if you put the effort, you are guaranteed to get the content and succeed. And this guaranteed does not mean the professor will just give you a good grade if you show up but rather that you will actually learn because of how well designed and carried out the course is. Lectures are excellent, psets are hard but very insightful, and the teaching is superb. I promise you that it will be hard, but you will get so much out of it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No major weakness."

                "I would recommend this class for any engineering student as you are using the calculus and differential equations that you have learned to actually solve real world problems. The professor's goal is to get you to think and act like an engineer.",
                "If you're ChemE, you have to take this. If you're another engineering major that has to take a fluid mechanics\/transport phenomena course, TAKE THIS ONE. You will not regret the learning experience. You will be challenged to completely new heights and actually be trained to become an engineer. This is possibly the most valuable course I have taken in my engineering education at Yale.",
                "Youre probably taking this class because you have to, so my only advise would be to go in with an open mind. You only get as much out of this class as youre willing to put in. Professor Vanderlick is a great resource, meet with her and go to office hours. The problems are challenging, but the help that is available to you somewhat offsets that. This class re-shaped my perspective of engineering (positively) and I gained a wealth of knowledge out of it (as did most people).",
                "I would recommend this course to any student majoring in engineering or planning to take more engineering courses in grad school. We had a student who was a physics major but planned to do engineering for his masters and I believe even he got a lot out of the class. This class did not just teach me fluid mechanics, but how to approach problems as an engineer and built my confidence as a problem solver.",
                "Absolutely, no question. If you're considering this course, then you're most likely a chemical engineering major. DO NOT AVOID THIS COURSE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S TOO HARD. Seriously. It is really hard, but don't shirk it to take MechE fluids. You'll walk away from this course feeling incredibly accomplished in the basic foundations that all future engineering courses are built on. So do yourself a favor and take this course.",
                "If youre not ready to be in engineering boot camp dont take it. If you want to be challenged then take it!",
                "Absolutely but only if you can do it when you have a relatively light course load otherwise, this is the hardest class by far. Good luck",
                "Yes, I highly recommend the course to other students. Professor Vanderlick is an excellent lecturer, and the material is really important for engineering students. The course greatly emphasizes thinking like an engineer as opposed to a theorist, which I really enjoyed.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in fluid dynamics, and more importantly how to think like an engineer. However, this course is very challenging and time-consuming, and you will very likely feel lost in the beginning. However, it is really the case of trusting the process and putting in the work - specifically understanding the lectures and doing the problems independently - where everything will click. Sometimes, you will need to go over the same concepts over and over again, and have them re-explained to you, but it is absolutely normal as this course requires a level of thinking and application that you likely have never encountered before. \r\nProfessor Vanderlick is also someone who deeply cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed. It really shows in her delivery of her lectures and office hours. She is also a wonderful mentor and gives invaluable professional advice.",
                "Absolutely.\r\n\r\nMake sure that this is your main class for the semester. And look, I will be transparent in that it will seem like a lot initially, because it is a lot. But it will be totally worth it. It will be better than anything you have done, and beyond that it will be useful. This is really the closest you will get at Yale to REAL engineering (ie how people do work at SpaceX, P&G, etc and that is not just crunching spreadsheets) and it is super rewarding. \r\n\r\nBest class I have even taken (and this sets the bar really, really high).",
                "Yes I recommend this course! It's a challenging class, with a lot of homework, but I also think that Dr. Vanderlick makes it seem extra hard\/scary with her comments on the coursework and general attitude about the content. If you have solid strategies for studying like reading the textbook, doing extra practice problems, and making a thorough cheat sheet, I think you will be able to succeed fairly well in the class. Office hours are very helpful for completing the homework."
