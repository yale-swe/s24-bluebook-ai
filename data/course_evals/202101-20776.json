                "We learned a lot of skills regarding primary source research and analysis",
                "I learned alot about things that I were familiar with, but really have not taken the time to look into deeply. This includes events like Katrina, the Financial Crisis, the 2008 Election, etc. This course really helps in sharpening your knowledge on those issues that you may have grown up hearing about, but never fully understood. The Professor also does a good job in making sure she includes diverse perspectives for every event.",
                "I gained a better understanding of important historical events in the early 2000s, including 9\/11, Hurricane Katrina, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2008 presidential election. I also learned about many useful databases and archives for finding primary source materials.",
                "I learned a lot about 21st century U.S. history. I felt like this was a really valuable and even unusual classI was alive for everything we talked about, but didn't have much formal knowledge or even memory of most of the events. I also really appreciated the research tasks; I feel like I learned about different databases\/etc that I hadn't known about before."

            "comments": [
                "it's a great course that has really great readings.",
                "A strength is the research assignments and group project because it helped to keep me engaged in different ways, instead of just having a two hour discussion every class. The weekly research assignments were super interesting and helpful for when we had to do research later in the semester. I feel like Professor Meyerowitz guides discussion well so it didn't really seem to lag. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "The readings were really diverse in presenting each type of historical event from the 2000s. The Professor also provided a little background information in the beginning of each class for the topic which was very helpful. The readings were not too much nor too little and she does provide a lot of space and time in class to work on the final paper and final project which was really nice. Also, unlike other classes where you have a written response to summarize the readings and post on canvas, this class had little mini assignments for each class which included finding an article from the time period or finding a speech you like or finding a news reporting you like from the time period, which I found different from the typical canvas post and much more rewarding.\r\nNot much weaknesses.",
                "Overall, the mini-lectures at the beginning of each course were useful in providing historical context to the week's topic. Discussions were student-driven and the readings were always very interesting. A good mix of secondary and primary literature. There was a lot of class time devoted to planning the group projects, which I thought could have just been prepared during class time. Alternatively, we could have just used class time to discuss other topics rather than plan the projects. Professor Meyerowitz was a very thoughtful and supportive professor.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Meyerowitz, the syllabus\/readings, the research assignments, the freedom we got in terms of choosing project and paper topics. Pretty much the only weakness I can think of is that I wish we had had more autonomy for the group project; at times it felt a little hand-holdy, and I wished we could have more uninterrupted class time to work on it, rather than needing to check back in as a whole group so frequently."

                "Yes, it is a great way to learn about events we lived through from a historical perspective, and Professor Meyerowitz is a great instructor!",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this class. Professor Meyerowitz is AWESOME! She knows so much about the various topics in the class but, more importantly, does a great job of facilitating discussion. The weekly assignments are very interesting and not strenuous. Additionally, you have a good amount of freedom to choose final papers\/project topics, so you end up doing work on things you're passionate about! Really enjoyed this class, and I'm sure it's even better in person.",
                "Yes! It's a really great way to learn about topics you may be familiar with but not fully knowledgable about since much of the topics we discuss were during the time when we were growing up. Also, she provides lots of room to explore your own interest which is nice. The Professor also does a good job in leading discussion questions. Finally, I really felt in this course, the Professor's goal was for you to learn something new as opposed to finding some specific angle or viewpoint, which is really nice because it allows you a chance to explore your own interest,",
                "Yes! This course taught me a lot about events that I've grown up hearing about and experiencing on a personal level. Learning about the historical roots and consequences of pivotal events like the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2008 financial crisis were illuminating. This class was fascinating and gave me a lot of practical knowledge about recent\/current events.",
