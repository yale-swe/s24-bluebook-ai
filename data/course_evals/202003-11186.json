The professor put a lot of emphasis on making sure our intonations were correct for the quiz recordings and in-class reading exercises.\r\n\r\nUnlike other heritage students, I had more difficulty with speaking rather than writing\/reading because I dont speak Mandarin at home and actually formally learned it as a child (just forgot much of it due to lack of use), so I found the class relatively laidback."

Additionally, the consistent synchronous meetings helped facilitate a good learning environment, particularly for language learning. I think the pace of the course could be further refined.",

It was actually the highlight of my remote semester as I was able to talk to my professor and classmates. I didnt realize how much I missed that until I was at home, staring at a bunch of names on a screen. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated Chen LaoShis feedback on all the recordings and essays. She definitely pointed out the intonations and pinyins I needed to work on."

I dont think the breakout rooms worked very well in the beginning because the students werent very well acquainted with each other and others like me, felt inadequate in our speaking fluency. \r\n\r\nI think at the midpoint of the semester, conversations between peers couldve then been encouraged.
