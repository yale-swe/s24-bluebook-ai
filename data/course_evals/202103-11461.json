I learnt plenty about the culture and the language. There was a lot of speaking involved which is highly practical and forces quick uptake of the language."

The only thing I think we could do slightly more on is grammar constructs, but we definitely did more on it than other levels I have taken. It is hard though to fit in with the major emphasis on speaking (which is so so valuable)."
