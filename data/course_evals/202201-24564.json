                "So much! This course is nominally about agriculture but really also about democratic change-making, spheres of influence, and how we go about confronting the biggest issues of our time. I learned a lot about various alternative agricultural movement -- local and organic, vertical farming, cellular ag -- and mainly learned to analyze + be skeptical of most narratives of agricultural transformation. There's a little science involved, but mostly you gain insights into the narratives we use\/values we bring to discussions about food and how powerful\/dangerous those can be.",
                "I learned about different theoretical frameworks and approaches to the future of agriculture. These visions had many facets, including political, philosophical, social, and economic consequences.  The class sessions at the Yale farm also provided me with a hands-on experience.",
                "I was challenged in my assumption that sustainability is simple. For a long time I think I've felt like there is a way to fix things, and the problem is that we're just not doing it. My thinking is more nuanced now. I understand that there are paths to healing and progress, but that they are neither universal, simple, or easy",
                "I left this class with more questions than answers, which I think was the purpose of the class. Most of the class centered around breaking down concepts like organic, local, or urban and learning how to question the underlying assumptions inherent in the ideas. I enjoyed learning from my classmates in the discussions we had, and also from Professor Bomford.",
                "overview and deep dive into past and current approaches to agriculture, analysis through social\/cultural\/historical\/quantitative lenses",
                "This course threw a lot of information out and although it could feel very overwhelming, professor Bomford encouraged us to pick out what we could through our weekly reading responses.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: so many! The professor is one of the most ~professorial~ people I've met -- i.e. he seems to know everything about everything -- so it's always fun to listen to him lecture. The farm sessions at the end of the semester are a ton of fun and very illuminating. Many of the readings are fascinating and the reading load isn't ridiculous. Lots of flexibility with the final project, which is very cool if you have a directed sense of what you want to do. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions were sometimes great, sometimes stilted. Sometimes it felt like we were rehashing the same themes multiple weeks in a row -- at first they were fascinating, but by the third or fourth time they just felt disheartening (*is* there any way to solve the world's problems?). Felt like at times we would have benefited from a little more technical specificity instead of spending so much time on the abstract.",
                "Strengths: The course structure and contents are laid out very clearly, and the weekly readings and discussion posts worked really well for sparking conversations in seminar. Writing the reflective reviews was challenging some weeks, and pushed me to think more deeply about the readings. The mixed-methods aspect of the course also provided a really unique perspective on the course content. \r\nWeaknesses: At times, the material felt very theoretical or abstract.",
                "The strengths of the course are really both mark bonfords personal level of experience and the embodied experience of classes on the Yale farm.",
                "Strengths; Fantastic TF, great trips to the Yale Farm, cool final project, the other assignments keep you engaged with the readings, and the class structure is pretty good (mix of presentation, discussion, and small group discussion).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings can be super dense and difficult to get through (or hold your attention). Also, I think the small group discussions went on too long--30 minutes is a long time to be in the same group! The reading response comments seemed kind of like a throwaway assignment...we weren't required to do them on certain weeks, so there was less accountability, and it seemed like people were just posting for the sake of it (which we were). I wish we covered more on food justice. I also wish we zoomed out sometimes to look at current food policy proposals or systems, or that we did a case study of New Haven food systems and policy. Lastly, Professor Bomford can sometimes be hard to follow, and I think slides or a printed out lecture would be helpful for us to follow along.",
                "I think the flow of class topics was very successful and that they built on each other well. I think that the small group discussions were not always the most fruitful because we ended up just talking about what we understood the best - maybe more classes with large group discussions or other forms of conversation would work better. I also wish that we had had class presentations on our final projects at the end of the course: we talked about them a little bit on the last day of class, but I would have loved to learn more about what people were doing, since we had such different projects. I also think working in more different types of reading material (like the Portlandia sketch lol) could be effective: seeing what farmers are reading about organic through an organic certification manual or a FERN expose on CAFOs might have worked well to break up some of the more theoretical readings.",
                "Wonderful (imo ideal) balance of lecture\/seminar discussion and farm sessions; really liked alternating between breakout group discussions and whole-group discussions, reasonable workload and assignments, huge freedom in final project. accessible for students who don't have a background in agriculture.",
                "Strength: if you are interested in the ideas presented in this class (I highly recommend checking the syllabus before you sign up), then you will not be disappointed with the work we do to study these topics. \r\n\r\nWeakness: there was a good deal of pessimism sourriunding almost all the approaches we studied and it often felt hard to imagine  what options we might have left.",
                "I think this course is very unique and unlike many other courses at Yale. I really enjoyed the field experience at the Yale Farm. The readings in this course were also really engaging and a great balance between theory, research, and more casual writing. The in class discussions were usually interesting, but sometimes difficult to engage with. I think sometimes Prof. Bomford would offer an overly complex topic to introduce the weeks theme and then it was difficult to base our discussion off of something we knew nothing about."

                "Yes! Definitely my favorite class this semester. There were multiple sessions that I left with my mind blown. The concrete information about agriculture is interesting, but I think more valuable were the insights you get into democratic politics and social change. Also, you get a chance to go to the Yale Farm (one of the best places on campus) and put your hands in the dirt. Not every session is 100% amazing, but most of them are pretty great, and the class as a whole was very supportive and friendly.",
                "Yes, take this if you have the opportunity! This seminar has been one of my favorites at Yale. As a non-EVST major, I didn't have much background in a lot of the topics and readings we discussed. Engaging in conversations with my peers about the course material was really fascinating, particularly due to how relevant food and agriculture are to our daily lives. This course really encapsulates what a Yale College seminar is meant to be, bringing together a diversity of perspectives and critically assessing real-world issues.",
                "Absolutely. Understanding the problems in the food system with this level if nuance is something we should all aspire too.",
                "Yes, asterisk--It's really important to think more critically and deeply about food systems, and this is a good place to do it, with the leader of the Yale Farm and such an amazing TF. The class is well-structured and well-thought out. I sometimes found the classes a bit of a drag and rambly, but the presentations were good. More food justice work needs to be incorporated and not just mentioned. It's a pretty high workload but interesting stuff and the final project allows you to be creative.",
                "I would recommend this course to an upperclassman who has some background in ideas surrounding human geography, interactions between humans and nature, ecology, or food and agriculture. I think this is not a good course to enter without some familiarity with the ideas being discussed, because Prof Bomford does get pretty into the nitty gritty of these concepts. That said, the class culture is very generous and flexible. Isabel and Mark give all the students a lot of grace when personal or health issues override ability to participate well in class, which is sometimes rare in these upper-level seminars. I think this is one of those classes where what you put in is what you get out of it, so while it's best to come in with some knowledge to build off of, I think everyone could benefit from this class.",
                "Yes, abosultely",
                "Yes, if very interested in the course material. Mark is very knowledgeable and puts together a great overview of food and ag."
