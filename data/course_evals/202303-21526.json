                "Yes! I loved my capstone. The project was incredibly interesting, and I was so lucky to work with such a committed group of students and with an awesome instructor. The course provided amazing opportunities to meet with high-level staff and leaders at the OSCE, and it was one of the most engaging learning experiences I've had."
