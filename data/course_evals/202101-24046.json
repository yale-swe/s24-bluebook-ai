I liked the SuperSite questions. We also received timely and great feedback on our assignments. The only weakness of the class was that we received a lot of handouts on Zoom, and I would have preferred the documents to be more organized - perhaps all the files could have been uploaded on Canvas so we could go back to them. I think having answer keys to all the practice questions would have been helpful, as well as more (low-stake) opportunities to speak and practice our grammar would have been helpful."
