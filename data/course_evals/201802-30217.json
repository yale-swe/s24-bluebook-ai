    "This course taught me to analyze films, their cultural context, and what they\/their reception says about American society at the time. A good lens for looking at American history through multimedia.",
    "how to connect films with history, learn more about history and culture through films",
    "I watched a lot good movies that I have never watched before, and enjoyed analyzing their role in American History. I have learned how to write more efficiently and faster. I also saw the overall evolution of film through the years, and the impact it had on society.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for the portrayal of American history through movies and genuinely enjoyed watching all of the films on the syllabus.",
    "Methods on how to assess a movie with a certain historical background.",
    "1. Evaluating a film from the perspective of history and society;\r\n2. Watched more clips and films and learnt more about it that are screened before 1970 that may not be so focused on by me before;\r\n3. Ways of finding both primary and secondary resources, especially magazines and newspapers.",
    "This course has explored my vision of the relationship between the American history and the development of the American film. The book Movies and American Society which was recommended in the syllabus is very insightful and helps me to understand more about race, gender, class, politics and ethnicity around the film."

   "comments": [
    "strengths - very effective, good discussions\r\nweaknesses - sometimes lectures or discussions just went too long and people lost engagement",
    "strengths: the clips and films selected are really good and typical of certain eras. the teacher is really nice too. feedbacks are detailed and comprehensive.\r\nweakness: when I prepared for my final essay, I did some research on certain films, and I found that many important themes had been mentioned in our discussion, but not as deep as what is elaborated in the papers. so I think it may be better if teacher can provide some ideas of the papers on certain themes when we have come to the point, rather than leave all of them for us to discuss.",
    "The strength was that the content was very packed together, and there wasn't a moment where I was not learning something. Also, I liked the way of how we discuss the films, I could learn from peers as well as the teacher. I think the class can improve by having better equipment to play on that doesn't break down all the time.",
    "The only way I believe the course could be improved is if the screenings took place in a more comfortable location, but that was not Professor Vielkind's fault!",
    "Strengths: Rich readings; Multi-media; Free discussion;\r\nWeakness: Maybe discussions can be done in small groups.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1. Very informative and have a holistic view;\r\n2. The two main topics of this course, which are film and American history, are closely related and connected;\r\n3. Plenty of time for on-class screening, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Sometimes some topics and historical period are not fully discussed because of the arrangement of the course, while some are sort of over-discussed."

    "yes, because it is a great way to learn American history in a visual way, where you can physically see people of certain era talking and moving. Through the movies, you can also derive their opinions from the way they present certain things.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the intersection of American history and film, this is the perfect class to take. The discussions were insightful, the movies were enjoyable, and Professor Vielkind is very nice and helpful.",
    "Yes. I have watched a lot of high-quality movies and learn more about American history.",
    "Yes, since this course is perfect for someone who is interested in film or American history.",
    "Yes. This is because that this course helps students to build a basic, steady base for their further learning of American film history."
