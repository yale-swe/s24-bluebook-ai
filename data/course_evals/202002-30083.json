    "I learned Latin grammar, which spanned the conjugation systems of verbs, deponent and intransitive verbs, the declensions and cases of nouns, adjectives and adverbs (including demonstratives and possessives), interrogatives, constructions of the subjunctive (including conditionals, sequence of tenses, purpose clauses, indirect commands and statements, result clauses, relative clauses, and independent uses of the subjunctive), direct and indirect questions, participles, periphrastics, gerunds, gerundives, infinitives, imperatives, ablatives, accusatives, datives, genitives, and additional topics. We also had readings and exercises from Moreland and Fleischer's Latin: An Intensive Course book. We also learned how to translate Latin to English, including original Latin writings from Ancient Rome, and how to write our own prose compositions in Latin."

   "comments": [
    "The course is at a fast pace and accomplishes a lot by the end. Weakness is that the class is not very well-organized, we deviate quite a bit from Latin language acquisition, and too much time on exercises and practicing the same concepts over and over again",
    "Professor Robinson is incredible. He made learning the entirety of Latin grammar in five weeks both manageable and approachable. The strengths included how we followed the textbook (Moreland and Fleischer's Latin: An Intensive Course), which allowed for independent review, and the prose composition assignments, which allowed us to learn grammatical structures by writing Latin ourselves. Office hours with Professor Swalec were a tremendous help, since she was able to explain concepts from class in new ways, reinforce our understanding of older topics, and work through examples. Even as a STEM major who struggled with other language courses at Yale, I found this course manageable. Do note that you will have to still spend a lot of time learning the language and practicing translations. Great course, would highly recommend!"
