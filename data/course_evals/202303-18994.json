                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It may very well be my favorite class I've taken at Yale. I looked forward to our discussions every week. We had thoughtful, interesting discussions but still laughed and had fun. The small class size made for a really great environment where I felt confident to share my opinions. We had weekly readings with reading responses which helped me think about what I liked or found thought-provoking about the reading that week. I actually really enjoyed the research paper project and the feedback I received on it was truly the most helpful feedback I have ever received in a humanities class. And everything about this class made me more excited about art history and about learning in general. Definitely recommend taking this class!"
