It crams a little bit too much, and the structure of the course and the order of grammar does not make the most sense at times. It also seems highly dependent on the calibre of instructors to deliver the material effectively to be a good course.",
                "My greatest frustration with this course was the fact that exams tended to come without much in-class preparation, and there was not always the chance to check the work that we had done, making it difficult to track our progress. I really enjoyed the WWII research project and would have loved more frequent creative projects during the semester. Additionally, I didnt always find the audio programs to be very helpful. Sometimes, they were difficult to make out due to the quality of the recording. I wish there had been a way to practice listening comprehension as opposed to simply repeating from the example. This being said, I enjoyed how much speaking aloud and answering questions we got to do during class time.",
                "One strength of this course was its organization. Each lesson was introduced to the students both in written and auditory form for homework and then was reviewed during class, which worked for me. One weakness of this course is that feedback is not always provided for each lesson, making it hard to ensure that you understand the content.",

The first part of the semester is very heavy in grammar and the second part is very heavy in French readings, so if you strongly dislike one or the other then this is not the course for you. Also, there is approximately 2 hours of work for this class a night, which may be too much for some people. However, as someone interested in French, I did find the course very enjoyable and rewarding.",
