                "I felt that the discussion each week was rather poorly run, there were many times where Professor Landis would repeat questions we already discussed and would leave the room in an awkward silence. There was also an excessive amount of reading, with 60-100 page legal journal articles assigned that would prompt maybe one question in the subsequent class period, and so by the end of the semester it seemed like a waste of time to read them.",
                "Fewer readings and more opportunities for feedback",
                "more structured discussions please",
                "It very much pains me to write this, but I think the real weakness in the course has to do with the professor. Professor Landis is very kind, yet I think in his retirement and age he is very divorced from the actual class itself, and he maintained a very hands-off approach to the entire course. Everything was uncertainexpectations in class, assignments that needed to be completed, and grades. Even now as I write this, I have literally no idea what my grade will be, as we received no feedback in the entire course, and only received grades for our midterms in the last ~2 weeks of class. The discussion is entirely led by the classentirely. When the class would go off on interesting tangents, it would be interesting, but otherwise it would usually be dull and repetitive points made by the same people while the majority of the class sat silent. While I genuinely found the Shavell book to be interesting (and reading it did teach me about some foundational aspects of economic principles in law), I learned next to nothing in the class itself.",
                "Strength of this course was the foundational book on which it is based is excellent and incredibly informative. Weakness is that discussion is not particularly well facilitated ted and often fell flat as there was little to no input other than a few series of pre-written questions offered by the instructor.",
                "The course really only follow Steven Shavell's book and doesn't really stray from the content from there. If you find his book interesting then this course is for you, if not then do not take it. Prof. Landis is a nice professor who means well, but not necessarily the best seminar or discussion leader (he asks very repetitive questions and does not engage very much in students' answers). The course is kind of all over the place (due dates changed from what was on the syllabus, he got rid of most of our papers with little notice, the exam was a different length than previously promised, etc.) but was very manageable."
