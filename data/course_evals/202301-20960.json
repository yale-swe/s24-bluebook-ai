                "Professor Wang, despite being an incredible researcher, is not a good lecturer. His slides were screenshots of the textbook, and he did a poor job of defining concepts straight from the beginning. I think having a clear foundation from the start of each unit would have been helpful, but the lack of it made class confusing. Elisabeth and Madison (our peer tutor) did the best they could to fill in the gaps.",
                "The materials follow the textbook really closely, so the up side is that there's not too many surprises while the downside is that I just learned the entire thing from textbook instead of lecture. I think the lecture doesn't have enough time to cover the material as in depth as the book, so it gets confusing with just lecture sometimes. You must read the textbook.",
                "I did not feel that the exams were reflective of my understanding of the material.",
                "This course could have just been called \"Tables from the Inorganic Chemistry Textbook\". Lecture slides were nothing more than screenshots taken directly from the textbook that were too loosely explained to be applied to context in problem sets and on exams. Little to no useful resources for exam preparation were provided and communication from the instructor was extremely lacking. There seemed to be no obvious structure to the course and no logical progression of topics addressed. Examples introduced in class were usually not explained, covered in loose detail, never referenced by name, and were always accompanied with a rationalization that due to the presence of the explanation of the concept in the textbook, no further detail or explanation of the topic in question was needed for further understanding. When concepts were not chocked up to their presence in the textbook, the explanation that accompanied them was plain wrong and later cleared up when questions probing the validity of the professor's statements arose. No feedback was written on exam questions guiding to the reasoning behind losing points nor the correct approach and answer to the problems. Long problem sets were given on the same weeks as exams which caused frantic behavior and unnecessary anxiety in students who were all left with little time to study appropriately for the exam.\r\n\r\nBelow I have included an excerpt of a transcripted lecture of an attempted explanation for using a Tanabe Sugano diagram to determine quantitative measures of spectroscopic d electron transitions in transition metal complexes for your reference:\r\nSo so what is this about, oh this is about a vanadium complex transition \r\n\r\nSo what do you do in the first step pull up TS diagram \r\n\r\nD2 so then you see the ground state and excited state so you have three options but you only see two peaks so what is going on? *blank stare* the peak is not shown bc its high energy one that is not captured \r\n\r\nIf you know the energy of that and you know the energy of that then how to determine the that? Then you see that the energy transitions is higher and from this one to this one so so you think about that \r\n\r\nAnd then this one does not qualify to give you this transition so the only option is the second one, the first transition energy and the second transition energy are not exactly the same so then if you use that to find the position where your complex is at\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from the diagram, when this field is low 1st low second high then ration will decrease decrease decrease decrease and then its bout 30 but then when you know the position about 30 then you can measure the next level which is about 40 and then you can find B \r\n\r\nThis example is from the textbook so you can read more about it. \r\n\r\nAnd this is it for today so see you next week.",
                "You will need to read the textbook to do well in the class. Lectures do not always cover all the necessary information (or its just not explained well). The exams were often nothing like the problem sets, and there was very little support offered to prepare for them. The practice tests we received were the tests the previous instructor used, but these tests were not the same format as the tests in this course nor did they always focus the same exact concepts. The TF and peer tutor for this course were amazing and very helpful.",
                "The biggest strength of this class was its rigor. It was quite demanding and really forced me to know the material inside and out.",
                "Strengths: I think the two main strengths of this course were the peer tutor, Madison, and the TA, Elisabeth. The two of them were pretty much everyone's saving grace throughout the course. They were very compassionate with struggling students, and tried to make them interested in inorganic chemistry.\r\nWeaknesses: I think Prof. Wang's teaching style was the main weakness of this class. Any class that can essentially be survived by just reading the textbook and not coming to class has some major weaknesses, and this was one of them. Often times, the professor would skip over challenging examples to \"let us figure it out in the textbook,\" which made homework very challenging. I also didn't love that there was three exams with no drops, and that the final was worth a heavy portion of our grade. Essentially, that meant that most of your grade was from four exams.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, fair exams, comprehensive textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the content can be pretty confusing at times and I think the teaching was only sometimes good at alleviating this confusion, the professor and TF did not always seem the most invested",
                "I liked this course.",
                "Strengths of this course included the interesting material, relevant problem sets, and abundance of support from the professor, TF, and peer tutor. A weakness of this course was the lack of off-textbook teaching; I would have liked to have seen alternative explanations, figures, and examples in lectures that could not be found in the textbook.",
                "I think the course covered a lot of ground. This is good because it was a useful introduction to inorganic chemistry, building from atomic trends to more complicated reactions and organometallics. A weakness, however, was that a lot of the important things were minimally addressed in lecture and a lot of weight was left on students to read the entire book and answer their own questions. When we're moving at roughly a chapter a week, this becomes difficult and nearly impossible if you're not giving the class a lot of attention. The lectures were essentially copied from the book and, while as an effort to cover less every week than was in the book (though the things not in lecture were still tested on), many important things were discussed quickly and things spiraled into a lot of confusion. Perhaps this could be improved if the course material was a little more diluted and things had the time they needed when taught. This could be accomplished by limited some of the discussions at the beginning of the course (orbital structures, atomic trends, etc.) that, with the prerequisites in mind, should be well understood."

It definitely requires a lot of self-study via the textbook.",

                "To be very honest, only take this course with Prof. Holland  the reviews of it seem to be much better than my experience with this professor. His teaching style made the course VERY challenging to learn, and the problem sets were basically all un-original problems that were still impossible to solve without going to peer tutor office hours. In addition to it being challenging, only a handful of students received As, though the rest of the grading wasn't too harsh on the lower end. The exams were pretty challenging with low averages, which made for a stressful environment.",
                "Yes if they are interested in being a chemistry major or just understanding how the field is oriented. It is a decent option for an MB&B major taking another chem course, but O Chem II is probably more related. Otherwise, probably not.",
