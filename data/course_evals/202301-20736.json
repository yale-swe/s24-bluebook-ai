                "I learned to develop an eye for photography, the technical components of using a DSLR camera, the basics of photoshop, and how to critically analyze the work of my classmates.",

I learned a lot of the nitty gritty details of the process and language -- everything from basic understanding of ISO and aperture to the difference between shooting JPEGs and RAW files to the names of different photographers that I like. We printed on 11x8.5s and 17x22s and learned how to use printers and both criticize and be criticized in a constructive way during class \"crits.\"",

                "I learned how to operate a digital camera, how to take photographs  I learned about various artists and their careers, as well as how they take their own photographs! But most of all, I learned a lot about myself as a person and artist."

                "The weekly assignments to take photos helped us practice the artform. I also enjoyed getting to look at the work of established photographers because it gave me inspiration for my own work. Collaborating with my classmates and viewing their work was productive because we could offer each other advice and work alongside one another.",
                "Strengths: beginner-friendly\r\nWeaknesses: the course materials can begin to add up quickly",
                "Strengths: 1) The syllabus is well-organized and thought out 2) Great pacing, definitely beginner friendly 3) A trip to MoMa on Yale's dime!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) So fun that you'll find yourself spending too many hours in the photo lab working on prints",
                "Brian is one of the best professors I've hadso encouraging and considerate. I loved that we had the opportunity to look at the work of famous photographers, the TFs, and our classmates. We all inspired each other. The weekly assignments are very manageable, and they force you to go out into the city (or to try new things with staging). I wish we had learned a bit more about techniques (different flashes and lighting, composition) and history, but overall, I have almost no complaints.",
                "The course was well organized and the assignments are relevant for developing the skills described in the syllabus. However, the assignments are very close together and I think the course could benefit from longer assignments that have more time in between them.",
                "The course is very strong overall -- Brian is an excellent professor, who really wants his students to both thrive and enjoy their time in the course. The main strength really is the amount of engagement we have with each other, the professor, and our work. The only improvement would be for the cost of papers to be covered -- it can get expensive and inhibiting to have to cover the cost of paper, a hard drive, and an SD card for the course.",
                "Only strengths! The best part was being able to see other people's work throughout the semesternot only did I enjoy it, but it also helped inspire me to try new things in my photography.",
                "The strength of this course was Brian! And the attention and care he showed students, the way he guided us through an introduction to a form of artmaking that, for the most part, we were completely unaware of prior."

                "ABSOLUTELY! Our class had a really fun time learning together, and Brian was a phenomenal professor. Photography is such a useful skill that can be taken into just about every field of work, so I am sooooo grateful that I took the course. It was academically and artistically challenging in the best ways and provided me with an outlet to express myself through art,",
                "I would! This class fosters an appreciation of photography and the skills to make art in this form in the future.",
                "Absolutely but only if you have a lighter course schedule. Every week, I looked forward to photography class. I loved to see the work of professional photographers and my peers and discuss them. I found myself becoming excited about photos I took outside of class and showing them to my peers. However, if my courseload were any bigger, I don't think I could have put in the energy necessary to do well. The fact that this course meets on Tuesday and Thursday for an hour and 50 minutes both days was a lot at times.",
                "Yes! It was the perfect place to stretch myself creatively, and I often found myself doing extra work not because I had to but because it was so exciting. It's not too much work, and I also made friends with my classmates (bonding over late-night printing sessions, which were the only time when the class made me feel stressed).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if that student is committed to putting in the time to develop their photography skills. This not a blow off class and you must constantly come up with new ideas for things to take pictures of to meet assignment requirements. After taking this class I can attest that completing the work was well worth it.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in photography or art-making I recommend this course. You will get to know more about yourself and your peers through the work you produce. You get out what you put in, truly, and I found that everyone was willing to put a lot in once they got to the classroom and got to work with Brian and other students. This has been one of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale and one that has challenged me to view the world and myself differently. The course also allowed me a space to be different than my background or career aspirations; in fact, Brian encouraged us to view the course and classroom as a space where we could experiment and try new things.",
                "Yes!!! I was afraid that this class would be intimidating since I'm a STEM major, but everyone in the class is super supportive and very few people had art backgrounds. Be aware that this class requires as much work as you want to put into itif a good photo idea really grabs you, you can spend hours and hours on this class per week sometimes. The \"required\" level of work isn't much, but the class is so fun that you'll probably want to spend a lot of time on your photography.",
                "Absolutely, this is an accessible class for anyone who has never done photography before."
