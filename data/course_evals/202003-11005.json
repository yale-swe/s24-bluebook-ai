                "The instructors were highly engaging and clearly care about the students. They really helped those of us without much background in speaking Viet to understand the tones and general rules of the language to continue learning in the future. The most challenging part of this course was definitely the sheer amount of homework. It was definitely helpful, but some of the packets were just much longer than they needed to be and could be very stressful to complete if you don't manage your time well. However, Thy Quang and C Th were very kind about extensions and accepting late work, so it all worked out in the end.",
                "Strengths - active engagement and encouragement as well as understanding \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes assignments were confusing and a few grammatical structures (though simple) were not explained",
                "Strengths: Effective teaching style, Professor Quang, small class with supportive classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Large workload, untimely feedback",
                "The course was great overall. The one area for potential improvement is organization of the canvas site. I found that during the end of the course when I had to turn in the semester's work, knowing what I was still missing was difficult because of lack of a standard naming convention for weekly schedules on canvas. It would be useful going forward to label each one with the date of the start of the week.",
                "Strengths: small class, lots of opportunity to practice speaking in class, all the benefits you could possibly imagine with smaller class. Great if you need a break from large and impersonal lecture courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the online format did make the transition difficult for the instructors. I would just recommend organizing the canvas website to submitting assignments more neat and consistent. Instead of putting everything in \"Assignments\" I think that the handouts\/powerpoints should be organized in the \"Files\" section in canvas by folders labeled by the week (ex \"Week 1: Introductions and Greetings\"). Assignments maybe should be labeled by the week as well, and then we can submit all the week's work together except for quizzes."

                "Absolutely!! Whether you're Vietnamese or not, it's a really cool language to learn and Thy Quang and C Th are super fun and helpful in learning such an intimidating language from an introductory level. If you're Vietnamese and don't really speak Viet, I would highly recommend, as it helped me not only with practical language skills, but knowing some of the language has also helped me feel more comfortable in my cultural identity and actually encouraged me to get more involved with ViSA. This was definitely one of the best course decisions, if not THE best course decision, I've made at my time at Yale. It's well worth waking up early every day for.",

                "Yes, absolutely. The course is small and you get to know the professor and TA well. The guests thy Quang invites are always engaging and fun to talk to. I of course wish I could have taken the course in person, but that's just the way it is.",
                "yes!! definitely take it if you are interested in learning a language but would benefit from small class sizes and a more personal learning experience."
