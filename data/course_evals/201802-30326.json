   "comments": [
    "Basic knowledge of programming by C and Python",
    "I have learnt different new programming languages that can be applied in various aspects, including C, Python, SQL, and Jinja. Despite that I had some prior knowledge in Java, HTML, and CSS, this course really broadened my insights in these areas as well. Most of the problem sets and some of the quiz questions are challenging and inspring as well. I really appretiate how the problem sets are constructed from real-life cases and offered me the experience of dealing with real-world issues.",
    "Basic knowledge of computer science, especially in C language and python and website developing.",
    "Basic knowledge about computing and programming. \r\nWeb crawler and creating simple websites",
    "I learned all the basics of C, HTML and Python, as well as their assistive languages. The course also helps a lot to solve algoriths; I believe I acquired that competence.",
    "Python and c language",
    "Chtmlpythonscratch  and skill of searching Google for answers. Help me help myself",
    "Thinking computationally and  algorithmically, as well as programming skills in several languages.",
    "Programming skills like C++, Python, and SQL",
    "I learned how to think in the manner of a computer scientist. This means thinking logically and systematically. I also learned computer languages (c, python).",
    "I built a solid foundation in computer science, from algorism concepts to practical problem-solving skills. I learnt C, Python, HTML and SQL. I am able to use them to solve complex tasks like building websites and user databases, encrypting texts, synthesizing songs etc. Furthermore, I learnt to study with online libraries, learn possible solutions of debugging and new relevant functions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: active and energetic instruction\r\nWeakness: Perhaps there could be more content by the instructor herself",
    "I don't think there are fundamental weaknesses in this course per se, but it will be better if we could have more than one month and gone deeper. This course might be a little bit too difficult for beginners in CS.",
    "The course really taught me a lot. And the instructor and TAs provided me with a lot of help. The office hours are really long and Miss Melo will print lecture notes for us. Maybe the schedule can be designed carefully because SQL and HTML are really taught in a rush.",
    "The strengths are the practice and explanation in the class.\r\nProbably the pace of the class was too fast in the fourth week, when we were learning HTML and python.",
    "I believe that the course is too fast. There was another student that had already taken computer science. He told me that the topic we saw in a day, in his other school was seen in a month. The challenge to keep up with the course is really great; but overall, I believe it is worthy.",
    "We have many sources to get information about the topics seen in class but it is so much material for only 5 weeks",
    "Strength Nice and kind instructor and TAInteresting lectures and activities.\r\nWeaknessA little bit fast and lots of assignments.",
    "The very wide range of students skill level, makes a lot of repetition necessary with regards to some subjects. This can make having his lectures online, and on the classroom, repetitive. If the lectures were just outside of the classroom, then more practice could be employed doing the classes, particularly for the summer session. I do think this is a great course nevertheless. It provides a lot of great skills regardless of your major.",
    "The course is really great. It taught us a lot. But the pace is too fast, and we learn a lot of different programming language, but not with depth.",
    "This is a perfect course. Although some may think this course emphasize too much on C, I think that C is really fundamental and essential to computer science. The problem sets are challenging and require much effort. But they push me to study more. They are rewarding. The only possible weakness may be support for the contents other than C."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. CS50 is an execellent introductory course in computer science, and I believe despite its difficulty, it is rewarding for almost any student to take this course.",
    "Yes, it's a course held by both Yale and Harvard, and it's a traditional course for new programmers.",
    "Yes, I will. This course teaches the students the basics of programming. The workload for this course might be greater than the other courses, but the knowledge gained from taking this course is much greater as well.",
    "To another student of my level, I would recomend it. Otherwise, I wouldn't, mainly because I struggled quite a bit and I believe that it is few people who could keep up with the course. On the other hand, it includes a lot of learning and it really helps to introduce to programming.",
    "Yes, once you think like a programmer, thinking about other things is much easier.",
    "YesNatalie is amazingShe is kind and patient and is students friend",
    "Even though the course has a great course load, the breath of the curriculum requires it. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone go wishes to get started in programming in any shape or form.",
    "Yes, I will recommend. After taking this course, I really learned a lot, and it raised my interest of programming.",
    "Yes. I feel that computer science, and technology as a whole, are becoming more relevant than ever in the world. It is important to have an understanding of the material. Also, the course was very interesting and  fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if the student is seeking challenges or simply interested in coding. This is a good intro course for CS especially for students without prior knowledge of CS. This course walks through all the main parts of languages. Lectures are very interesting, well structured and motivate students to learn CS."
