                "Learned how to analyze maps and cartography-related text and theory critically. Focused on analysis of primary sources, which encompassed a broad historical time frame. Rather than critiquing maps, the course focused more on examining the arguments that cartographers put forth by breaking down maps into their components.",
                "I learned about the history of mapping\/cartography in many different cultural and historical settings. I had a lot of perspectives Id taken for granted more or less upended, and gained more analytical abilities.",
                "I've learnt how to read large volumes of material effectively and how to ask questions about it. I also developed a refined understanding for academic papers: how they should be structured and how one can go about the research process. Lastly, I feel like I have learnt a lot about how to read and analyze maps."

                "Strengths of this class mostly center around Professor Rankin himself. He was always so happy to be in class and he is a phenomenal teacher. He fostered a really wonderful learning environment in the class, and I left class every day feeling satisfied.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, engaging professor, well-organized course, professor's lectures were interesting, enjoyed participating in discussions and hearing the insightful comments from classmates. The assignments were challenging but rewarding, and I felt as though I learned a lot in general throughout this class.  \r\nWeakness: readings were sometimes difficult to fully enjoy since they were very dense and a bit too difficult to comprehend; for instance, I would prefer to dedicate six hours to fully comprehending a shorter reading than six hours skimming a very long text.",
                "Strengths: incredibly interesting material, class periods structured well, assignments laid out clearly. \r\nWeakness: readings were anxiety-inducingly long most weeks. We did discuss this in class and discussed methods for getting through them, but it was frustrating (at times) because it felt like there couldve been fewer pages assigned while still having meaningful discussions. Covid likely made this situation more challenging than it wouldve been in person.",
                "It was an incredible class overall. The only thing I would have loved to do but couldn't, mostly because of COVID, was to go to more office hours."

                "I would definitely recommend this class, if for no other reason than challenging the way you view maps. I have a more skeptical eye for maps, and I know that this is a class I learned much about in more than just the subject itself.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to put in a lot of work! This class will allow you to grow a lot academically.",
                "A really rewarding class. Definitely a challenge to take on, but worth it if you find the material interesting and are willing to put in the time and effort. Would definitely recommend to those interested!",
                "This is probably one of the few courses you can take if you're at all interested in a critical study of spatial knowledge, the others being perhaps Laura Barraclough and Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen's courses. Professor Rankin is a very kind and thoughtful instructor to learn from\/with. It definitely is a fair amount of work and the readings are sometimes difficult, but in a way that is rewarding and meaningful.",
                "Yes!!! Incredible class. You will not only be learning about maps and the evolution of territoriality, but also how to read and write academic papers. The readings are a lot, but they are very interesting. Almost all the readings cite, quote or refer to the other readings, which turns the entire course into a nuanced discussion of these academics arguing for or against something with different examples. Just take this class, and I assure you that you won't regret it."
