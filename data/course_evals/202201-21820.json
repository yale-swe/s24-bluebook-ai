                "I gained a better knowledge of interacting with space as a whole and how space influences experience.",
                "I learned how to approach architecture through a playful lens. The course made me think about architecture in the context of real people and programs, rather than just space as a concept. I expanded my abilities in softwares like rhino and became much better at presenting my work.",
                "Became more proficient with rhino, illustrator, photoshop, indesign, and various model making techniques. Got more practice with architectural drawing conventions and the general process of formulating architectural spaces. Was exposed to a wide range of architectural, artistic, and idealogical precedents that guided and inspired our our ways of thinking about the assigned theme for the semester (play).",
                "The biggest thing I was thinking about in this course is how the aesthetic sensibility of one person can mesh with a larger canon of aesthetic references, and what it means to have an individual aesthetic/methodology within a discipline that can be quite prescriptive. For me, that meant wondering how to balance the opinion of my peers, my instructors, and the anticipated jury as I was making projects. \r\n\r\nKnowledge: familiarity/exposure to literature about \"play\" in both a broader-cultural setting and in architecture (Homo Ludens, Architecture in Play), familiarity/exposure to theory about the formation of allegory (Craig Owens, Robert Smith)\r\n\r\nSkills: competency with casting rockite, competency with using the manual feed plotters, improved pin-up strategies, how to use resin, mesh/cap/extrude and basic modeling in Rhino"

            "comments": [
                "All of the strengths that come with being in a studio environment, great friends, lovely TAs. I always wished that the more informal pin ups were more open floor, not just TAs and surry commenting but having everyone involved, rather than 1 on 1s.",
                "The strength of the course is the inventiveness and rigor of the assignments.  The slide lectures were excellent and inspiring.  I wish more class time could be devoted to looking at drawings of architecture and discussing why the strategies therein are good/bad/revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is the lack of formal instruction on how to use visualization tools.  A simple solution would be to ask TAs to generate 45 second screen recordings on how to do essential tasks in Rhino, Illustrator, and InDesign.  A compendium could grow over the years according to students' needs and TAs' inspiration.  Examples could be:\r\n\r\nHow to use the command \"ClippingPlane\" to generate plan and section cuts in your model.\r\n\r\nHow to use the command \"Make2D\" to generate views of your Rhino model.\r\n\r\nHow to export \"Make2D\" images to Adobe Illustrator at the appropriate scale.\r\n\r\nHow to adjust line weight in Adobe Illustrator to adhere to architectural convention.\r\n\r\nHow to use \"Live Paint\" in Adobe Illustrator to pochet areas according to architectural convention. \r\n\r\nWhere to find tree and figure files online and how to insert them in your Illustrator drawings.\r\n\r\nIf such tutorials were available for reference, all students would be assured basic fluency in these tools.  As it stands, some students discover these work flows independently or seek help from TAs during office hours, but the knowledge capital doesn't extend to the full group.",
                "The syllabus and prompts were extremely well organized in the way that each project seamlessly flowed into the other. The one thing I would change about the course is that the expectations for each project were very unclear, which didn't always match the rigidity with which they were enforced. \r\n\r\nI also wish that the studios would incorporate more architecture theory. The major in general has the two history requirements, but there aren't really many classes that incorporate the conceptual part of architecture. Having this content in our academic career would greatly improve the quality of our studio work.",
                "The course is incredibly satisfying but it is very time consuming. Maybe some more classes about how things are done, like using rhino, could be helpful as well.",
                "Strengths: The format of the class (essentially composed of regular desk crits, working/tutorial days, and reviews) is very conducive to continued helpful and constructive feedback and the general pacing of course feels perfect. There were 4 main projects, composed of maybe 5 or 6 reviews, which gave us a good amount of time to work on each. I genuinely feel like I became more skilled and knowledgeable about the architectural design process. I generally found the projects to be interesting and I enjoyed doing the work. Also Surry is a great professor and the TAs were extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a ton of work. Expect to sacrifice things for this class. Mental health included. I was stretched SOOOO thin. The amount of time I spent on this class was far, far greater than any of my other classes, by necessity. I ended up not being able to do a ton of the work in my other classes because of this class. If you take this class, try to manage your time well. It's very difficult.  Also, for a lot of the softwares we were required to use, we were pretty much expected to learn how to use on our own, which is daunting. We received an in-person rhino tutorial or two but they were not extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nI would recommend providing video software tutorials so that students can follow along on their own time and figure out things. I would also highly recommend decreasing the workload / required work. I was stretched so thin with creating so many deliverables I often felt like I couldn't do my best work.",
                "Strength:  1) the literature: I loved the readings that were assigned -- I wish there were more!; 2) the studio environment: it is really special to work alongside my peers, and I am so grateful for this course that continues to give me the opportunity to do so; 3) Josh and Lindsay and TFs: a balance of \"go for it!\" \"its beautiful//amazing//incredible\" and \"i wonder if you could consider how your drawing could help amplify ___\"; 4) the allegory as the initial assignment for the final project: I found this was a really reassuring exercise, if only to have something to \"fall back on\" when I was stuck while thinking about the next phase\r\n\r\nWeakness: 1) how to frame sequential assignments: Sometimes I felt like Surry had a specific vision for how we should approach a project (Do this part first, and don't think of the next part until you are there). But, because we were enterprising students who were trying to be efficient, we would invariably have projections of part 2 influence what we conceive for part 1. So, we prevented perhaps the most important part of the specific creative practice Surry was trying to impose, because we \"jumped ahead.\" In the future, if you(Surry) frame projects are \"stepping stones\" or \"interim creations,\" then it might be helpful to not show the students your hand -- ie. only give information piece by piece. \r\n2) how to provide feedback that retains the student's sense of authorship/agency: I was frustrated when I received the same feedback as my peers, largely because it felt undifferentiated, and then \"external\" (ie. not using / operating in the framework/conception of the project that I or they were discussing) to our ideas. this made me feel like you(Surry) had a very specific idea of what each project should be or should provoke in us: I would have liked to been encouraged to just do more more more -- because then I would have understood that you(Surry) at least saw some value in the way I approached the project. \r\n3) I wish we had fewer desk crits, and more informal pinups with our friends! I loved when we broke out into groups of 2-3 in the mini-u's in the studio space for the final project. It allowed me to have both a working period and also the ability to pop in on other projects and see what everyone else was up to!"

Taking it as a history, theory, criticism arch major, this class was not required for me (it replaced the urban lab requirement).
