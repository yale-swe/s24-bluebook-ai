                "Run, do not walk, away from Professor Gilbert. She shows up to class completely unprepared to lecture, bumbling to copy down proofs that any decent professor would have reviewed beforehand. Additionally, she copies *all* the course material, both homework assignments and exams, from Professor Spielman's previous teaching of the course. To make matters worse, the midterm exam consisted of some obscure problem that she copied from Professor Spielman's notes. Despite allowing us to bring a \"cheat sheet\" with notes that *could have* (in theory) helped us, the exam was completely orthogonal to anything were covered in class. Literally any one my math friends not enrolled in the course could have showed up and been just as prepared for the exam as I was (that's how unrelated to the course material the exam was). It also generally appeared that Professor Gilbert did not want to be teaching. She did not post solutions to any homework assignments, held no office hours, and always seemed to sprint out of the lecture hall as soon as lecture ended (seriously, she hated answering any and all questions). By the end of the course, it seemed like almost everyone in the class actively disliked her.",
                "Strengths: the homeworks had us implement the theoretical stuff we were learning which I found useful\r\nWeaknesses: literally everything else about the course.",
                "Weaknesses: Professor could be a lot more prepared for class. Lectures almost always felt meandering, unfocused, confused even on her end. About half way through I realized she was almost exclusively working off of Dan Spielman's previous course notes (seemingly without having really reviewed them recently?) and so I just started reading those instead. It felt like she was annoyed about questions asked in the class (unless they came from a favorite student) and would often shut them down with one word answers that didn't address the root of the question unless she was pressed further. It would be great if she would be more engaged with all questions rather than trying to brush off the ones she didn't like. Problem sets were few and far between and frequently seemed disconnected from the material that we were learning in class. It would be helpful if there were more frequent and more focused problem sets. The professor refused to provide practice exam for the midterm or to even make past midterms available - this would have been very helpful in preparing for the midterm. Although she would write the \"agenda\" on the board at the beginning of each class I found it very hard to follow the thread of where we were at and why we were doing what we were doing. It would be great if she could give a quick recap (on the board and not just in a verbal ramble) of important results from the previous course instead of being like \"we proved that thing, right? Go look in your notes.\" This class was VERY disappointing. The professor seemed completely checked out. I think that to some extent a course should be designed for exposure and a good resource, and that students should be able to fill in gaps on their own, but the exposure part wasn't even there!! And we are here to learn from professors for a reason, otherwise I'm sure people would rather avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars for this low quality of a course. We spent so much time going through high school level linear algebra proofs that could have been left as exercises, and it felt like we barely had time to get through linear programming and convex programming in a meaningful way. We didn't even touch advanced topics. I learned a few things but mostly it was a big waste of time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gilbert is pretty knowledgeable and gives highly detailed proofs in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the homework assignments aren't always that relevant to the class, and the pace of lectures sometimes felt stuck on the details.",

                "No, not if Professor Gilbert is teaching. Despite the enriching material, the course is so poorly organized and Professor Gilbert is so lazy that it's not worth the headache.",
                "Absolutely not. I knew people who took it last year, and they said the problem sets can be a bit tedious, but the material is important and it's not too much work (in addition there were no exams last year). The class is awful. The problems on the homeworks seemingly come out of nowhere and are only vaguely related to the course material. There were also only 5 throughout the entire semester and at entirely random times. For instance, we had one assigned the first day of October break due a week and a half later (THE CLASS AFTER THE MIDTERM) and then one problem set during the rest of the semester. The midterm itself was horrible. It was entirely unrelated to the material we had covered, so preparation turned out to be useless and your performance was dictated on how recently you took linear algebra and how advanced your linear algebra class was. AG also seemed to arbitrarily take off points and told us she would let us know the grade distribution for a curve but never did. The final was a take-home for which we were allowed 12 days. Three of the five problems were proofs taken directly from the class notes, so I guess we were just supposed to copy them down? And for the remaining two problems, AG told us that she knew we were just going to look up the answers on the internet anyways, so we should just do that and cite our sources in the write-up.\r\nI have had professors who are lazy, professors who were not that good at explaining things, and professors who were absent-minded. I have never had a professor as bad as AG. Professor Gilbert is clearly brilliant and does groundbreaking research; however, she seemed to hate teaching the class. The previous iteration of the course was taught by Dan Spielman, and she just copied his lecture notes and syllabus (like literally sometimes her posted lecture notes where just screenshots of his with scribbling in the margins). There were classes where she proved things incorrectly because she hadn't looked at her notes beforehand and in many classes she seemed to be figuring out what she was supposed to be doing as she went along, so there was a lot of stumbling around and awkward silences as she stared at her notes. It didn't even seem to be an area she had any interest in and it appeared she wanted to teach Linear Algebra much more.",
