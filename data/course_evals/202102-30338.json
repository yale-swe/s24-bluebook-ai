One weakness was that I think I could have used a little more practice and help with creating perspective and with just simple painting techniques like brush strokes, etc. I didn't really know how to paint, and we sort of got thrown into the deep end and were asked to paint a bunch before learning how.",
                "I think this course is a great introduction to painting. It was a bit tough over Zoom, but Professor Hysen accommodated everyone as much as possible. I felt that a large strength of the course was Professor Hysen's knowledge and feedback, which greatly helped everyone improve their paintings in the latter half of the class.",

I felt that I grew tremendously as an artist and learned a lot from Professor Hysen and my peers. The assignments don't feel like homework, and it's a really fun class. My major isn't adjacent to art in any way, but I still recommend that you take an art class at Yale at some point -- Painting Basics is a great place to start.",
