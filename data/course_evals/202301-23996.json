                "Homework was very reflective of the material, the lectures were useful and informative, and the exams were reasonable given the content learned.",
                "Strengths: Exams are very fair, and lectures are very straightforward. The ULAs provide a lot of support when working on the homework. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes a bit boring.",
                "Strengths: The professor is kind and generous with grading and scheduling. The flow of the curriculum is very logical and coherent. Weaknesses: The professor's lectures were interrupted by frequent arithmetic errors and long pauses where both students and professor were confused about questions fairly central to the course. However, this was the professor's first time teaching here, and I am optimistic that these weaknesses will be less prominent if he teaches this course in the future. Plus, in a way, these hiccups were a consequence of the professor being very open to fielding questions from students throughout the class, which was a huge strength.",
                "The course had an awesome professor, Dr. Orelup. He made it so that the lectures were both interesting and understandable. I loved the focus place on practice problems during class. I have never had another class which did this, but it prepares you well for the problem sets and exams. There was also ample extra credit to help you achieve the best grade possible. The grading was also nice at the end, allowing you to really do the best you possibly can.",
                "The class was hard to follow and the psets were often on material not covered or way harder than what was taught in lecture. Exams were fairly easy which was nice. I also appreciated the final being optional. Would be nice to have lectures recorded",
                "The ULAs were very helpful. Lecture was difficult to follow for me. I think it would be helpful if after every problem, we did a recap of the steps in the problem. Sometimes we did this, and I found that helpful.",
                "The lectures could have been more engaging. The material covered was good and was taught in a good manor. The notes were always posted and the office hours held were helpful at developing core course concepts.",
                "The vast majority of class time was spent on example problems. This could be appropriate for a dynamics class, but Professor Orelup would often try to do these example problems without any notes/preparation and then make errors along the way. This class would be better if a bit more time were spent on theory, and the example problems covered were well-prepared and improved student understanding.",
                "This class does a good job of providing the students with time to learn the material as each class isn't packed to the brim (until the end).",
                "This was my favorite MENG lecture course ever. The class was so much more organized than other lecture classes, and the slides were so helpful! \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n- slides were easy to read, concise but explain everything (newtdog & wormy also make the material so much easier to process)\r\n- most of class was spent on examples, and we actually went through all the steps to solve them rather than waving our hands and saying \"you can solve for this\" but not actually showing how to solve it (I think examples are super helpful and all lecture classes should spend more time on them rather than telling us to do problems on our own time. This way you learn how to get past the things that you get stuck on, and you can also learn to avoid mistakes that other people make.)\r\n- Professor was also very organized and easy to talk to, he explained things well without skipping any steps\r\n- solutions to class examples were posted online\r\n- solutions to homeworks were posted regularly\r\n- practice problems and solutions for exams were usually uploaded with enough time for students to prepare\r\n- extra credit provide incentive to learn even when you are struggling or falling behind (having hope that you can actually improve your grade by putting in more work is huge and this helps a lot)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- it was really hard to get help for the final because most of the class didn't take it and the TAs were not very easy to reach \r\n- office hours were often too crowded to get help, so it would have been very difficult to get help on homework if I didn't have friends I could ask for help\r\n- TAs sometimes didn't explain things clearly and assumed I understood things when sometimes I didn't\r\n- The slides for vibrations felt like too much material crammed into a few days. They were also messier and harder to follow\r\n- solutions and practice problems for vibrations were uploaded late or not at all",
                "This course is taught well in that during class, we go through a lot of example problems so we see how different types of problems are solved. One weakness of the course is that it has no hands-on component. While the course is inherently a theoretical matter, I think it would be beneficial to apply the concepts to some sort of project."

                "prof orelup is pretty great and very understanding",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course offers a great chance to really understand motion in a way that introductory physics courses do not allow. The material is not all that confusing, and you can really grasp everything if you work hard at it and practice. Also, Dr. Orelup is an outstanding professor and great guy overall. This course was awesome as a MENG class and just as a course at Yale.",
                "Only take this if you need it for your major. I would recommend it to meche students though. It wasnt too bad.",
                "I would recommend this course, it was taught at 6 pm which sucked but the professor cares that the students develop the messed art concepts.",
                "Yes I would definitely. I know it is an ABET requirement so most taking it don't have a choice but I think it is a great course for teaching students to engage with the material. I would warn students to not get behind in studying for this class. Go to office hours and ask questions and get a clear conceptual understanding of the physical systems. This is not a class where you can memorize things and it will go well.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course because the lecture slides were so good, the class was so organized, and the professor actually took the time to explain all the steps when we did examples in class.",
                "Yes I would! Dynamics is a fun subject to learn and taking this course gave me a greater appreciation for many real world engineering phenomena."
