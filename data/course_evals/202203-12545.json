I think that this would make an excellent full-term course",

                "Additional handout resources (e.g., scans of textbook pages relevant to the topics for students interested in going deeper in the content) would be helpful\r\n\r\nStrengths -- Pat makes the course really engaging, worked problems on the board are super helpful and help students in the class get used to working together\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Information about each topic isn't really linear, each individual day of class covered enough different topics that keeping things straight got confusing",
                "Working at the board in small groups was helpful, but sometimes I did not feel prepared to tackle the examples based on what was said in the lecture to that point. Having an example before we do it ourselves would make it less intimidating. Also, the additional video lectures had valuable information that maybe should've had more attention in class. The ligand project was kind of difficult, especially when it had to be planned before we really learned much about ligand classes and design, and then felt rushed by the time we had enough information to work on it.",
                "I thought the course was super well-organized to make sure everyone was on the same page! I liked the grading breakdown, it didn't make any one assignment too stressful/important. I also thought that it was well-instructed! The only weakness was if slides weren't uploaded in advance, it made it difficult to follow in lecture because the slides are so heavy on complicated diagrams and structures, but this happened only a few times!",
                "This course emphasizes collaborative learning and rewards engagement. I believe that there could be slightly more emphasis on recent literature in transition metal chemistry.",
                "Strengths: the course overall was very fair. The ligand project was absolutely great; I enjoyed it so much and loved getting to learn more about a topic of my choosing. Workload is pretty fair as well.\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have benefitted from a peer tutor or TA. It was difficult having Prof. Holland as our only resource.",
                "There aren't any weaknesses. The class had a group working segment in every lecture, which is great for improving one's skills before homework."

                "Yes, it's really fantastic for getting a firmer grasp of the fundamentals of inorganic chemistry and coordination chemistry and the topics in this class aren't covered at the same level in other courses",
                "Yes! It was a great overview of ligand/transition metal complexes, covering a lot of different topics in the field. It solidifies your understanding of things you think you already know about ligands, and introduces some new concepts and considerations as well. Pat is also one of the better instructors in the department - he keeps your attention and makes the class enjoyable and accessible.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn about coordination complexes/go into more detail than an introductory inorganic class, this is a great choice! Prof Holland is really nice and really wants you to succeed, and the final project was actually pretty fun.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for students looking to learn more about chemistry and interact with graduate students on a daily basis.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course; even though it was a 400-level course, I think someone with a basic idea of the concepts before hand could do well in the class."
