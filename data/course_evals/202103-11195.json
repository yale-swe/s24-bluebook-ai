                "A basic introduction into brainstorming, designing, fabricating, assembling, and presenting a prototype geared toward a specific problem in a team setting. It also exposed me to techniques and machinery/equipment commonly seen in the engineering industry.",
                "The lectures provide a comprehensive instruction on the mechanical design process. You use the lessons learned in weekly deliverables. \r\nAlso, whatever your team project is will drive other learning aspects. Personally, I learned how to do some basic CAD and adobe illustrator. You also have to make a candle holder in the lab in the machine shop. That was pretty cool working the lathe.",

This course gave me insight into how poorly a course can be managed, while still being a requirement for a major. This course was great for facilitating teamwork until the final project where everyone in your group was supposed to disregard that and fight over the best prototype.",

            "comments": [
                "strengths: really fun and engaging, lovely to learn about the design process, you get to go through the entire process of building your project, brainstorming all the concepts, learning how to use certain tools, etc\r\nweaknesses: a large portion of your grade is based on how well your mechanical device (semester-long project) works at the end of the course, you brainstorm and decide on an idea fairly quickly, and some people don't scope the projects well so they have too much to develop and get stressed",
                "This course is very hands-on and tasks its students (who have often not yet taken an engineering class) with large amounts of responsibility and creative freedom. It's a great course for a first-year engineering student because it will quickly allow them to decide whether or not they will want to continue with the major. I found the greatest weakness of this course to be that we were not given enough time to generate ideas for our project. We were presented a very lofty and broad problem statement about creating a device that helps with climate change, and then had under a week to determine what we would want our device to be. Considering that we had to stick with our original concept for the rest of the semester, it would have been helpful to have a bit more time to think of what we wanted to create.",
                "This class made me realize that mechanical engineering is for me! The workload, however, was extremely intense and left many of the groups pulling all-nighters. Although I understand the thought process behind it, one prototype per group member was way too much, making it feel rushed and leaving us unable to produce our best work. It expects a thorough understanding of CAD, craftsmanship, and electronics, so teaching ourselves and completing these deadlines was extremely unreasonable. We should have done more CAD than one lab, as I feel all of the CAD ended up getting put on the one person that had any previous experience.",
                "Strengths: very realistic and solid introduction to the world of engineering prototypes in a team setting. \r\nWeaknesses: feedback was sometimes not on time, would have been really nice to have our second design review feedback prior to the final presentation. It would have been helpful to learn a bit of hardware like a simple introduction to mechatronics",
                "One strength of the course is its focus on one semester long project, which allows you to become invested in the mechanical design process.\r\n\r\nIt would be smoother if there was more time and focus on certain parts such as testing and creating prototypes",
                "Like all project based engineering classes, the workload of this course ramps up extremely towards the end of the semester, but this is pretty typical. The lectures were effective in teaching the methods to come up with and evaluate ideas for engineering projects. The professor and TAs were all very helpful and approachable. \r\n\r\nThe one change I would make to the class is the requirement for each person to make their own prototype. I felt it limited our teams ability to make design changes between the second design review and the final prototype because we knew we needed to set aside enough time to make one prototype each instead of focusing on just making one that was the highest quality",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Allowed for creative use of \"safe\" tools\r\n-Provided a wide range of things to learn\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-We were not able to work on our physical project alone until halfway through the semester\r\n-We were not allowed to use power/\"unsafe\" tools unless a TF was present\r\n-TFs are also people so there were many times where our schedules would not allow us use of power tools\r\n-Majority of lecture material had nothing to do with actual design, more to do with developing a product to sell\r\n-Trouble learning things necessary as only one TF would really know how to do each thing and would have to wait for them to teach us\r\n-Workload is massively backloaded as the beginning of the semester basically has nothing to do with the actual project, or is changed drastically once you begin designing\r\nImprovements:\r\n-Find some way of letting students use tools without there being a TF. We are college students and they did not trust us with drills or screw drivers or circular saws or anything that would be useful in a design class. I would suggest switching one of the early labs to be tool safety and then allow the students to use at least some of the tools\r\n-Don't require one prototype per person, and grade individually. This is completely ridiculous. As every design group did, we specialized and had one person do electronics, one do cad, one do general assembly... There is no reason why we would need to build more than 2 prototypes if the goal is to display reproducibility. \r\n-Increase the budget per prototype. Similar to previous point, but just use the additional budget for the whole project, not per person.\r\n-Spread out workload. Find a quicker way to get to actual design phase to allow for more time working on the main project of the class.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the hands-on teaching by the professor and TAs; their feedback was invaluable, and not the bit condescending even for a student going in blind to this engineering course.\r\n\r\nI do think the course workload could be rated a bit higher. Prototyping was particularly time consuming even outside of class and lab time. Sometimes the material in lecture didn't always bear on the design or prototyping process, though I'm should it would in a higher-level class.",
                "I loved that this course is hands-on. I liked the machine shop training. More access to the lab would've been appreciated. I didn't like the new policy of one prototype per person. There were some design changes that my team considered making but we felt like we didn't have enough time, since we had to build multiple prototypes.",
                "Strength: Learned a lot by doing the project, the prompt was relevant, the feedback was clear\r\nWeakness: the class was very demanding b/c of how fast the timeline was. Training in CAD was more surface-level than hoped",
                "Strengths: No tests, learn how to build things\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: An incredible amount of time spent on things which did not add value. Such as, creating 4 different replicas of the same thing. Since CEID closes early, we had to hand screw tens of screws in awkward positions throughout the night, multiple nights. I'd also recommend starting CAD earlier. The first material is interesting, but starting with the fundamentals imo would be beneficial and allow for more efficient team efforts on product design"

                "Yes, it was a fantastic course. The lectures were engaging and the project is overall a lot of fun. However, be prepared for the workload to ramp up rapidly during reading week. This is an inevitable feature of all project based classes as you WILL be rushing to put everything together at the end. The deliverables (weekly homework about progress) can also be pretty intense, but overall the class and project are very fun if you like building and ideation.",
