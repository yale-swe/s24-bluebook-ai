   "comments": [
    "Basic chemistry concepts to more involved phase diagrams, properties of different materials, failure modes, manufacturing techniques.",
    "Learned the basics of materials science",
    "I learned the basic structure of various materials, the basics of testing for materials, various parameters often used while studying materials, how materials fail, and general information about the different types of materials used in engineering.",
    "You learn the basics of material structure, certain characterization techniques, phase diagrams, and material deformation\/failure.",
    "Properties of materials and how to calculate them.",
    "It is a really broad introduction to materials science. You get a pretty superficial introduction to many topics so it isn't a super satisfying course but it is interesting. Topics include how to strengthen materials, how they fails, different types of materials",
    "Some basic information on materials and their composition, traits.",
    "As a chemical engineering major, we typically are taught about the properties of liquids and gases and how to use them in an industrial environment, so I figured Id take this course as an elective for my major and learn about solids. It taught us how solids behave and how their properties determine how they should be used.",
    "Learnt about materials and their properties",
    "Overview of material properties, tests, and failure.",
    "I learned about different materials and how they behave.",
    "This class was deficient in teaching me what I needed to know about material science.  The class was not well structured to reinforce learning or connect topics together.",
    "I got a good foundational understanding of the different kinds of materials, their properties and how to measure them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting material that is quite useful in the real world.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were disorganized and the problem set assignments did not always seems to correlate with the material taught in lecture.",
    "The lectures were rather repetitive. Although the material was overall fairly interesting we often reviewed the lecture from last class before learning new material every class. This happened less and less as the semester went on but we could have covered more material.",
    "The degree of relevance between the notes and homework, and then the homework and midterm were abysmal. I had to learn several concepts myself from youtube videos because the lecture notes provided were not conducive to understanding what to do in our assignments. It's a shame because this field is very interesting and cool to learn about, but my experience was completely ruined by the terrible class organization.",
    "I thought the course covered a lot of information, but wasn't able to give us a deeper understanding of each topic.",
    "This class tries to teach too much in not much detail. The textbook is not really good. If the course chose to focus more on specific topics and leave some of the deformation aspects to strength and deformation I think it could be better",
    "Bose is a very nice man, but an absolutely clueless professor. I wholeheartedly recommend NOT taking this course with him, as you literally will learn only the most trivial and basic material. If you have to take it with him, find a nice online course instead and do that during classtime.",
    "All the material is very disconnected and the various chapters do not seem to connect to each other at all. It is structured to just be a vast outpouring of information with not very much fundamental structure or order to what you're learning. Testing was also very strange, midterm was entirely plug and chug questions. If you had the equation on your cheat sheet you were basically guaranteed a good grade. Studying for the exams was hard because we had no idea what to expect or what could be tested.\r\nThere was also a lot of repetition in the lectures where almost the first 20-30 minutes of every class were spent reviewing what was done in the previous class.",
    "I believe Prof. Bose's slides could be very confusing at times which threw off his overall lectures.",
    "Homework assignments are never overbearing. Reading the book will probably teach you more than lecture, but they compliment each other well.",
    "Lectures werent interesting despite sudah Bose being a very interesting professor. You learned the most from doing the homework and the homework was rarely more than 4 questions",
    "Exam content was not covered in class lectures. Similar to homework problems only",
    "Strengths: provides a broad overview\r\nWeaknesses: Material taught in lecture is presented in a very confusing way that often doesnt correspond clearly to the textbook or homework",
    "The lectures were well-organized; I liked how Professor Bose kept the Powerpoints updated on Canvas. However, the lectures were a bit dry and repetitive. No one seemed particularly engaged with the course. Could be improved by having sections so we can digest what was covered in class. Also sometimes it seemed like the professor and the TAs were not on the same page.",
    "This course was poorly organized and failed to give me the understanding I needed of the material.",
    "This is a good overview course, and the workload is quite manageable. However, something must be done to make the lectures more interesting. I know the material is often dry, but maybe there could be design projects where we would have to choose materials and processing methods for different applications. This would be a) applicable to the real world and b) allow us to learn the material from a more 'interactive' approach. In such a broad field with many specializations, bringing in guest lecturers would also be a good idea."

   "comments": [
    "Could be a useful and interesting class if youre looking to learn more about materials and their properties.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you are not a Mech E major. It is not worth the suffering if you are not getting accredited for your degree.",
    "The course is needed for the ABET mechanical engineering degree but it teaches some insightful knowledge that will be useful in the future.",
    "Yes, I think that this course was a very nice introduction to the subject, but I feel that a second course is necessary to understand each of the topics better.",
    "Course material can be very interesting or very boring, depending on the student.",
    "This course is interesting to more than just mechanical engineers. You learn a lot and don't need to be particularly good at chemistry or math at all to do well. I would recommend it for a pretty easy credit but understand that the material to be quizzed on is really broad.",
    "Not with Bose. He forgot to make psets, he forgot when we had class, he forgot when the school had breaks, he had no idea what reading period was.",
    "If it's not required, it's probably not worth your time. Unfortunately it seems to be the only undergrad introductory materials science class, which is a shame because materials is a vast and extremely interesting field. If it is taught by Prof Bose, it may not be the best use of an optional class as you won't be as engaged with the content",
    "No. Very poorly taught.",
    "Yes. Youre probably taking this because its a part of your degree path. If Sudangshu Bose is teaching it, DEFINITELY take it.",
    "Yes. It is the easiest class in the mechanical engineering major",
    "The professor doesnt know how to lead the class. It requires a lot of independent studying outside of class to grasp the information.",
    "Only if you really, really want to learn about materials science. I can't say I found any of the material itself that riveting.",
    "No.  Not under Professor Bose, he was not prepared to teach this curriculum and did not construct the class in such a way that it would aid it's students with understanding these topics well enough to prepare them for future challenges.",
    "I came into the course with an interest in materials science but unfortunately, the way this class was taught, it did not do much to further that interest. Some days lecture was interesting, like when the professor explained how a jet engine works or how they make carbon fiber, but that could not be sustained for the entire course."
