                "I was very impressed with the course given that this was the first time it's been taught.  I liked that we reviewed technical concepts from the readings in class, starting with the basics of topic and focus and then moving to a wide array of topics that might come up during elicitation.  I also liked that we started having brief student presentations of data and that we tasked people with recording data that any of us could then refer to later.  I think that fostered a more collaborative dynamic even though our projects all focus on different topics.  I wish we had started doing that earlier, but I understand that we didn't think of it until a few of weeks in.  I enjoyed the reading responses because they made sure I was understanding the readings enough to have an informed view or critique them, but they also were short and not stressful or overbearing.  With the small class size I thought the low density of assignments was fine because it was easy for me and Professor Dayal to get a sense of my confidence and understanding, but if the class were much bigger I might suggest a reintroduction of the fieldwork report assignment that we got rid of.  I liked that towards the end of the semester once we had developed our own research interests, Professor Dayal was able to make lecture components that addressed the things that we were especially interested in.  In the future, I think the class should set elicitation logistics from the beginning, now that we've learned what works generally."

                "I would.  I'll speak specifically to undergrads because I am one and the situation is probably different for linguistics grad students.  If you have a good understanding of syntax (ie you felt very solid in Syntax one of know that material), you should be alright.  Some semantics might help you get through the readings more easily, and I would certainly recommend it if you're not used a lot fo formal abstraction and set theory sort of stuff.  With that background, this course is a great and accessible way to do some original research: you have the freedom to pick a specific topic, and at the same time you can see what other people do or talk to Veneeta in order to make sure you're on the right track.  The atmosphere of the class is very collaborative, and everybody works together to some extent to try to figure out what's going on in the language of study.  I'd also imagine fieldwork is a new experience for most undergrads - it's a fun exercise and has a way of bringing up interesting linguistic questions you may not have thought to ask.  Keep in mind also that this class doesn't have an ordered curriculum with units of material following each other in succession but is rather a smattering of interconnected topics related to the area of elicitation."
