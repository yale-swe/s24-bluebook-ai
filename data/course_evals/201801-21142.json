    "If you want to learn German, I think that Yale is one of the best places to do it. There were a ton of extracurricular opportunities, and the class is definitely geared towards gaining an ability to speak the language as quickly as possible so it is great for people looking to go to Germany.",
    "Yes, great professor and also very clear lesson plan.",
    "Yes because I think German is a very important language to have an understanding of, especially for musicians like myself.",
    "Yes! It's the best course to learn the language from the scratch"
