Overall, we built up a foundation for consuming and creating television.",

Class conversations, close readings, and more allow for learning what skills to take away and apply to one's own writing.",
                "I learned how to approach writing for Television. I believe I've improved my ability to build structure, style, narrative, character in my work as well as appreciate it in the content I consume. \r\nBeyond that, Prof. Tracy also has amazing insight into the industry (including a great lineup of guest speakers) to give practical advice to those potentially pursuing a career in the entertainment industry.",
                "I learned about the process of brainstorming and crafting a television show step by step. I was able to construct a pitch\/treatment, a story area, an outline, and beginnings of a pilot script. The class was even given a chance to act as if we were a part of a writers room for a class. We also had many amazing visitors that were super helpful in providing insight to the television writing and creating process.",

                "Strengths: Professor Tracy is an engaging instructor and a great resource to students. The course is well-organized in terms of class content, readings, and assignments. The guest speakers provide an insight into the industry that students might not get the opportunity to see otherwise. Weaknesses: Not a weakness, but more of a suggestion. The class is currently very focused on reading and writing the television pilot. I would have loved to learn more about how to craft a season or an entire series.",
                "This class was really well done and allowed for engagement to remain high especially on Zoom! Activities and exercises allowed for skills to be put into practice, and the conversations always connected to meaningful lessons.",
                "Class discussions could sometime drag over Zoom.\r\nProfessor Tracy is passionate about the class and brings so much energy to every meeting. He's a true expert and a great person to learn from. The materials are always exciting. Reading pilots never felt like an assignment so much as a fun activity. Our writing assignments were a great way to slowly build up a pilot throughout the semester.",
                "This course had no weaknesses. It just wouldve been better if it couldve been in person.",
                "The course was lovely as it was. My only suggestion is that we read diverse scripts in terms of the type of content they coverepic or otherwise.",
                "This course was very engaging. Prof. Tracy is fully interested in helping his students learn. He was always open to answering questions and the class was very tailored to the students' interests and needs."

                "This course offered many more opportunities because of its virtual format; we were able to hear from many guest speakers who offered incredible advice and insight into their processes. The conversations of class worked well via Zoom and let us learn more about things like writers rooms, pitching, and more.",
                "I think this class would have been even better if it took place in-person rather than over Zoom. When we did a mock writers room, for example, I think we would have benefitted from being in the same space where people are comfortable talking without fear that someone else might start at the same time. All that being said, I thought Professor Tracy handled Zoom class as well as anyone could hope.",

                "Yes! It's a really informative class for anyone who's interested in writing television, but also anyone who wants to learn how to think more critically about watching television. If you're lucky enough to get into the course, take it - it's a rare opportunity!",
                "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in writing, and especially to those who are interested in going into this field (or a related one). The lessons learned about storytelling, art-making, and the role of television in our lives are ones that I will take with me moving forward into my life and career.",
                "100% This was an amazing class. If you are seriously interested in a career in entertainment\/writing, this class is a must. If you are not, you will still have a great time and learn a lot. Professor Tracy is amazing. His experience in the industry makes him such a knowledgeable resource, and he brings incredible energy and passion to every class. The readings are so fun, and the writing assignments (which span from pitching to outlining to writing a pilot) were great, completely manageable exercises to stretch my writing muscles. Without a doubt, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, I think its a great class to take to discuss and learn about television.",

                "yes!! if you are interested in the Entertainment industry this is an excellent course to take not only to learn about tv writing but also about the industry. Prof. Tracy is one of the few Yale teachers with active Hollywood experience."
