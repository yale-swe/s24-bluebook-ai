Going into the course, writing was not my strong suit, but with the help and encouragement of Madame Koizim, I greatly improved my writing abilities. I was also able to work on speaking and presenting in the course. I read more than I ever had, and learned without realizing it.",
                "This course helps you reach an advanced level of French. I learned a wide variety of vocabulary and grammar concepts, and I also immensely improved my speaking, listening, writing and reading skills.",

                "I really like that the class meets every day, I think that really helps with my language comprehension and speaking abilities. Overall, I really enjoyed most of the readings. The reading load was really heavy at times but that's pretty expected.",
                "Testing format was fairly frustrating for me, likely mostly due to having to do it online etc. Mostly I think it's a really well done course.",
                "Strengths - madame is a light! she's so much fun, very knowledgeable as well. the textbook is also one of the best I've had \r\nWeaknesses: perhaps it wasn't always clear when and what had to be submitted when and where.... but it doesn't really impact the experience. the texts we read were also just really sad for the most part.",
                "The biggest strength in the course was the availability of Madame Koizim. It felt okay to be unsuccessful with conjugations and to get something wrong. She is a very, very encouraging professor. I also think the amount of reading is a big strength. I enjoyed how much I could successfully read at the end of the day. I was amazed by the speed of our progress and the discussions that Madame brought to the class. It was a conversation about the topics and not a guess what I'm thinking kind of course. I also loved the small presentations we got to do where we could learn about something we really care about in the language.",
                "This course is very well structured, it gives you a clear idea of what you are going to learn and how practicing those concepts everyday in and outside of class will get you there. This course does an excellent job of getting your French to an advanced level, and all of the texts and discussions we had were really engaging. Just one suggestion, for the Un Sac de Billes reading, personally I had a hard time keeping up with the reading assignments, and my classmates also expressed the same concerns. I don't know if it's possible but if there was some way for the reading assignments to be a bit shorter, I think that could help students a lot.",
                "There is a lot of work required for this class. Like a lot. But once you get into the rhythm of it it's fine. The professors make it all worth it, especially Mme. Koizim.",
                "I would say that the support this course offered was a major strength. Because this class meets every weekday, students find themselves in a tight-knit community that encourages mistakes to ultimately master the vocabulary and grammar points covered in the class. I found myself mainly learning the grammar outside of class, however, and would have liked a bit more structure in that aspect during our live virtual meetings such as implementation of short mini-presentations."

I also greatly appreciated the time we took to go over and analyze the grammar problems on the homework as those conversations and the points other students contributed during those conversations expanded my interpretations of the practice problems that ultimately allowed me to master the material."

It's pretty work intensive, so even though the teacher(s) are really engaging and supportive, it's only really worth it if you're eager to learn more! But if you are into French, I think it's a really good class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although I took this course to complete my language requirement, this was the course that made me enjoy learning French. One thing I would point out for consideration is the courseload. This course meets everyday and attendance is required. There is pretty much homework on a daily basis, and there will be tests at a higher frequency than other classes. However, I found my French skills improving drastically after this class as it built on many foundational skills.",
                "absolutely, you get to read some cool things and learn from a great prof.",
                "Yes, definitely. I would recommend it to someone if they are willing to put in the effort to master French concepts.",
                "Yes I would! Generally speaking, I think you should learn a language that you are passionate about. So, if you're passionate about French, definitely take this course and French at Yale, you will be so proud of yourself and your improvements in the language.",
                "If you really want to learn french, yes. It's going to be a lot of work, don't get me wrong, and you will read a lot of sad french stories, but it's worth it. Especially if you have Mme. Koizim!",
                "Yes, of course! This was the first course that I have taken at Yale that truly made me feel close to my peers. We all made mistakes throughout the semester, but we all learned from them and from each other. While you may have reviewed much of the grammar material in the past, you have the opportunity to improve upon your speaking abilities in this course."
