I also learned how to operate safely by producing chemical lab tables sourced from SDS sheets to ensure proper safety. A step above general chemistry, I learned how to act independently and solve problems in chemistry.",

            "comments": [
                "The weakness of the course is that if you have not taken a lab class here before then it can be offputting as an fgli student to have to spend additional money to buy a lab coat and the student lab notebook for the course. Additionally, how can the department justify the course being half a credit? The workload was definitely higher than for most of my 1 credit classes.",
                "Strengths: fun, engaging labs that almost never took the whole class period; collaborative, relaxed environment; doable quizzes that students had an opportunity to retake to show mastery of the material; efficient lab write-ups; and Professor DiMeglio's pre-lab videos, which were really helpful in terms of knowing what to do in the lab. Weaknesses: huge variation in grading based on TAs and unclear expectations for post lab assignment A especially, which led to point deductions on formatting issues that hadn't been explicitly covered in any lab documents. Also, EPs took awhile and felt like busy work.",
                "The course was very helpful in learning various lab techniques. I learnt a lot and got to take command of my own lab practices. Sometimes, though, it felt a little disorganized and I was not exactly sure what was happening in the course.",
                "I think this is an excellent course; it is formatted well to allow students to learn without stress. Between the EPs, the post-lab quizzes, and the post-lab reports, students have ample opportunity to get familiar with the experiments that they perform, as well as the concepts that underlie these experiments. I particularly liked that students have two opportunities to take the quizzes, so that they have a chance to improve. My only suggestion would be to have the quizzes open for between 10 minutes and 30 minutes, to allow people to actually think about the questions and answer carefully, rather than being stressed by a five minute timer.",
                "This course is very well designed and prepares students for success.\r\nWeaknesses arise when the course does not align with the lecture course, so materials must be learned either ahead or behind. However, overall this course has few weaknesses. However, lack of reading the prelab materials etc resulted in some mismatches in directions regarding both lab procedure and graded assignments (rubric on canvas vs TA preference)",
                "The strengths are the quiz second chances.",
                "Strengths: no pre-lab quizzes, the ability to retake all the quizzes on Fridays, the (optional) pre-lab lectures made it much easier to do the lab and were super helpful. the course was well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the staff made it not the most comfortable environment. I could hear them talking about students in the room next door. There was also some inconsistency among the instructors about what was appropriate to do in the lab -- there were several times when I would do something after getting advice from one instructor on how to do it and then another instructor would come around and lecture me on why I was doing it wrong. Teresa was sometimes rude. \r\n\r\nWhy are Yale lab courses still half a credit? \r\n\r\nI honestly think this course would not have been bad at all if I didn't have negative experiences with a few of the instructors. I think that a lot of people probably had a good experience in the lab and would guess that most people's assessment of this course will be good.",
                "It was a very strong course, i learned more than in most of my courses at yale and was great practice for organic chemistry lecture, only thing i would improve is covid accommodations",
                "It was well organized",
                "Strengths: The readings were clear and not too long. As an off-sequence course, there were many opportunities to direct questions directly to instructors. Both Aaron and Christine were around during lab and gave instructive feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Course material can be more organized. It is evident that much material is reused from previous semesters, and sometimes the lab numbers don't match (e.g., it would read \"Lab 7\" in an assignment, but it's actually referring to Lab 4). Many assignments were posted on Canvas but not dated, so students have to pay special attention to the deadlines.",
                "There is amazing support from TAs, Aaron Clark, and the entire Organic Chemistry lab community. There are also clear expectations and plenty of opportunities to get clarification. I felt that the course syllabus could be improved so that there is more transparency regarding deadlines, as there were moments of uncertainty regarding exactly what was due during the semester. More communication between the TAs and the course coordinators could help relieve some stress regarding deadlines and expectations.",
                "Not super heavy on grades, and it was fun to do.",
                "The type of assignments and the assignment frequencies were excellent. We had to write a pre-lab summary called an EP (experimental plan). These were very helpful and it was great only to have two post-lab assignments the whole semester. Also had bi-weekly quizzes which we had two tries on -- the two tries were vital towards me actually being able to understand and work through the material. This course truly felt like a half-credit course, unlike many lab courses which are so frustrating because of the huge workload. Good course overall, plus I learned a lot about lab techniques and working in the chemistry lab.",
                "strengths: well organized, straight forward, and support when asked. I did feel like the sections differed vary differently based on the TA. I wish there was more of a consensus on grading.",
                "This course is very good at teaching students organic chemistry without stressing them out.",
                "This course was very disorganized. Due dates were not posted on Canvas, things were not communicated in a timely manner, and expectations were confusing.",
                "I think the strengths of the course were how each lab was introduced and conducted. It seemed like each lab had a specific focus that built upon the last one. One weakness of the course was that one of the labs seemed out of order. It utilized a technique taught later in the course, perhaps it could be re-ordered to fit better.",
                "This lab is much better than gen chem labs. You only have to do two lab reports and you get to retake each quiz. You also do not need to watch every single lab video (they can be more than an hour long). Just read through the manual and find parts you don't understand in the video. A weakness is that they are very strict when grading EPs. They will take off points for formatting and other things that don't have anything to do with your understanding of the content.",
                "Strengths: the overall structure of the class and the way that the lab readings aided in doing the work \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we were kinda guinea pigs at some points during the class so that was an interesting experience which was not the most fun thing in the world.",
                "The first lab was super hard! We were not ready for that and it should have stayed as the fifth lab like in the previous semester. Also, the questions at the end were unnecessary since we couldn't answer them due to not learning the material yet."

                "Yes! It is a great way to fulfill a lab requirement and taught me a lot about how organic synthesis operates. It is a warm environment that fosters learning, rather than perfectionism which was great for me as this was my first lab course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students  it's a great way to get familiar with chemical experiments in a supportive and encouraging environment! If you're taking it for a major or a pre-professional track, then you can rest assured that this required course will be worth your while, too. You'll learn a lot, and it's easy to succeed as long as you do the work and incorporate professor\/TA feedback.",

                "I would! This has been the best lab course I have taken at Yale thus far, in large part because it actually feels like a half-credit course -- and you learn a lot in an engaging way too. My TA was great. Aaron and Prof. DiMeglio are friendly and willing to help.",
                "Unless if you have to, I wouldn't take this class for credit since it is 0.5 credits but the work of 1 credit, but for any STEM major\/student taking Orgo 1, this is a solid class\/lab.",
                "Yes! It was a fun lab and more chill than general chemistry.",

                "If you have to take it.",
