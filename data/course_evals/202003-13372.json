                "I gained a deep understanding of the functionality of Congress, political legislation, and its history. I learned a lot on how to defend my ideas in a seminar discussion format, write short response papers, and analyze Congress today by taking into context its history.",
                "I learned a lot about specific, significant events in Congressional history (like Watergate and FDR's attempt to pack the court) that I knew a bit about before the course, but not a lot. My favorite part about the course was that it helped me gain a strong historical perspective through which I could view current times (e.g. the country is not actually the most politically polarized that it's ever been).",
                "I learned a lot about the mechanism of how Congress functions and really learned a lot about lots of the policy history that has been passed since the start of the nation. It was really interesting to look at these different policies and try to evaluate the mechanism in which Congress operated to did not operate during these specific time periods. I do have a greater understanding of Congress after this class.",
                "I learned about many facets of what Congress does and how it functions. What particularly interested me was the highly individual aspects of the Congresspeople - from the case of Supreme Court packing and of Watergate, the individual motivations of Congressmen shined through as an interesting aspect of the Congress that ought to be considered more.",
                "Professor Mayhew chose particularly relevant and interesting readings, which provided depth of detail to events with which I was not very familiar. This included FDR's attempted court-packing in the late 1930s and the decades-long process of passing civil rights legislation through the Senate.",
                "As the name suggests, this course offers an extensive overview about Congress more theoretically at the start, and in a more specific historical context as it progresses.",
                "I improved my ability to read, process, and synthesize large and diverse amounts of information and history.",
                "In this course I gained an understanding of Congress as an institution, as well as significant moments in its history. The course was split into themes, ranging from party control, to elections, to procedural matters. Overall, I gained more insight into how to understand the Congress that I have seen in my lifetime, and how it is similar and different to past Congresses.",
                "I learned about the institutional development of Congress, as well as its long and storied history of passing legislation in a very diverse array of different policy areas. As a political science major, this course gave me a historian's take on the policies whose effects I've been studying throughout my time at Yale, and this perspective was extremely helpful in contextualizing why and how certain things occurred. I learned how to gather essential information from very different types of historical texts. The focus on secondary source scholarship also provided me with a birds-eye view of everything that Professor Mayhew researched in his book The Imprint of Congress.",
                "A deep, thorough understanding of the U.S. Congress and its history. I learned so much from this course!"

                "The professor is absolutely the highlight of the course. The readings are lovely and usually manageable, and class discussion is interesting. I love how we have wide freedom on choosing what to write about and when. No improvements, this class is perfect.",
                "Strength: All the topics we touched upon were extremely interesting and all the discussions were very insightful. It is also great to hear Professor Mayhew's perspectives on Congress since he just knows so much on the subject matter. Professor Mayhew also provides very clear feedback on essays and grades really quickly which was very helpful.\r\nThe course could have been improved by a little more structure in the discussions with potential questions Professor Mayhew wanted to get us to think about, but overall it was a very strong class",
                "Oftentimes the discussions were lively and thorough. It was a challenge when a class was focused primarily on issued raised in the papers submitted that particular week. I felt those class meetings were less engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mayhew is an excellent Professor, and his lectures at the start helped frame the discussion. The course mixed well seminar-style participation and lecture. Weaknesses: Zoom inhibited our discussion a bit, but hopefully people who take this class in the future will be able to do so in person. There are five five-page papers throughout the term, which I thought also helped people organize their thoughts for discussions and was preferable to a long research essay; but be warned - I did well in the end, but the Professor doesnt put grades on these individual papers so it can be a bit stressful. This isnt a weakness, but also a warning - the reading is a lot, and if you cant handle more than 100 pages of substantive reading per week you wont get as much from the class.",
                "This course is incredibly engaging in content, and Professor Mayhew is so knowledgeable. I think the only real downside was the virtual format, because it made it harder to interact with Professor Mayhew and my fellow students to get the most out of the material.",
                "The strength of this course is Prof. Mayhew's experience that he brings to the class. He tells us so much about what he has seen over his time studying Congress, and it offers a great perspective to the readings and discussion topics. Another strength of the course is its structure and the readings. I liked how we went from studying Congress through its institutional structure, then focusing more and more on various significant historical moments of Congress. \r\nIn terms of assignments, I also thought that the required writing for the course had a good distribution, with 5 papers written throughout the semester, whenever you felt like writing one. It allowed me to budget time well with my workload for other courses.",
                "Professor Mayhew is an absolute giant in his field. I don't think any Yale political science major, or history major for that matter, can truly say he\/she\/they have maximized the value of their time at Yale without taking a course with Professor Mayhew. He is so knowledgeable about literally everything, and his warmth radiates from his comments in class, on our papers, and over emailand online classes have hardly changed that. Despite covering nearly two and a half centuries of history, every seminar discussion had a clear general theme and takeaways.",

                "Yes! I would defiantly recommend this class to everyone who is interested in Congress. If you're the type of person who likes talking about politics and how Congress works all day, this is the perfect class for you. It's really interesting and a great way to discuss many of the different and distinct dynamics about Congress that makes Congress what it is today. Professor Mayhew is also really great to hear from and has so much knowledge on the subject matter.",
                "We're incredibly fortunate to have Professor Mayhew still interested and engaged in teaching. His latest book is useful, relevant, and a great read. The assignments are flexible and allowed students who were interested in stats or polling or other specifics to explore those without pulling the whole the entire class in that direction. Interesting discussions and topics covered.",
                "Yes, very much so. Professor Mayhew is retired and I dont think this course is offered every year, so I would take it as soon as possible if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. I found generally everyone in the class was interested in Congress, so it made the discussions stronger. I think this class is especially great for people who like legal\/political history, constitutionalism, want to go to law school, want to work on Capitol Hill, or are interested in the political history of the last 100 years.",
                "Yes! Professor Mayhew is incredibly caring as a professor and has a photographic memory for the history of Congress and the United States at large. You should be aware, though, that it really helps on papers to have a high interest in the material; papers are usually written on a week's broad set of readings, and it's helpful to have a lot of interest to find something to write about. This is not a requirement, however--you can learn so much from the readings even without much experience in the topic.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It has a balanced workload, and you get to pick which topics to write about. The overall topic for the course is fascinating, and Prof. Mayhew is so knowledgable about it all. However, it would be incredibly, incredibly helpful to have a strong understanding of US History to help contextualize topics that are being discussed, as well as to mention similar events in the discussion.",
                "100% yes. It should be a graduation requirement for every Yalie to take a course with Professor Mayhew because he is one of those professors, and people in general, that it is an absolute pleasure to learn from. His insights and general warmth are unmatched, and I have absolutely loved learning from him. My only regret is that I can't take a course from Professor Mayhew every single term.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student seeking to learn about Congress. The course contains a plethora of insight and Professor Mayhew is truly a gift to the area of study and any student who has the pleasure to learn from his wealth of experience.",
                "Absolutely. Mayhew's perspective is rare and very valuable. His readings make you really think about Congress and allow you to critically evaluate common criticisms of the institution. I learned so much about Congress's historical impulses over American history. Take this course!"
