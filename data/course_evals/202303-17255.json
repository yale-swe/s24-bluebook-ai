                "Prof Coughlan is a great lecturer, inspiring scientist, and warm person. The class was very well structured and I was able to get excited about new topics.",
                "This course was fantastic. I left with concrete skills and concepts that I can apply to my research. The material was taught to a high level and so much effort was taken so every student would leave the course at that high level, which happened which is very rare. I appreciated the variety of work, including a mock grant and discussions about how the context relates to societal problems. This is not a standard for STEM classes, but should be. The strength of this course really is Professor Coughlan, who is one of the best professors I have had.",
                "I think this course had to cover a lot of information, and sometimes it became too fast for me to understand what was happening. I know that my peers were also struggling at some points during the semester just because of the pace.",
                "the lecture content was suuuper interesting but not always explained in the clearest way",
                "The course was very engaging and I learned a lot of both theory and practical skills in the lecture. The few required readings were very applicable to the lecture material and it didnt feel like it was redundant.",
                "Professor Coughlan and Hagar were both strengths for this course. I took the class because I thought the material would be useful for me, not because I had a particularly strong personal interest in the material ahead of time. Professor Coughlan's lectures were interesting and engaging, and they made me genuinely enjoy and invest in the material much more than I thought I would. I really appreciated the balance between lectures as well as occasional readings, discussions, and projects, all of which helped increase my engagement with the material. I also really liked the way our assignments were structured -- the weekly problem sets were not too time consuming, but they were well designed to make me actually review and learn the material better each week (a rare example of me actually liking and appreciating problem sets), and the combination of two exams as well as a grant proposal project made the class less stressful than if it had had more exams. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest suggestion I had would be to change the lecture slides a bit. I often had a hard time finding the lectures on canvas when I wanted to review, because the way they were labeled didn't always make it clear what material would be covered in each slideshow. Also, while I found the lectures engaging during class, they often moved very quickly, and especially in the second half of the semester I had a hard time keeping up with the material during class. I wish the lectures posted to canvas afterwards included answers to the practice problems posed in class as well as explanations of the figures, as I sometimes struggled to keep up with note-taking enough to remember what had been said about the practice problems and figures during class."
