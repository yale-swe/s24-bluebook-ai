                "This course especially helped develop my speaking skills. While also helping with reading comprehension and writing, I think this course was especially effective in developing speaking as much of the class is spent in small group and class-wide discussions.",
                "My Spanish improved so much from taking this course. A big change was my confidence with speaking and writing. Profesora Glenski really encouraged us to speak around words that we didn't know, and I feel so much more comfortable engaging in Spanish conversation than I did before. It was a great environment to develop Spanish speaking and comprehension, and grammar and vocabulary were woven into the curriculum pretty seamlessly.",
                "I practiced my Spanish, and I improved my fluency.",
                "I gained knowledge of not only Spanish vocabulary and grammar, but Latin-American culture and literature as well. This course was a great langauge course and my speaking, reading, and writing abilities definitely improved. I learned how to more strongly analyze literature and engaged in constant Spanish conversations.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: emphasis on speaking/discussions. Grammar was addressed in a way that felt intentional, but also not too much of the emphasis. Some of the units and unit projects were especially engaging and enjoyable to complete as well. Feedback on project drafts was also clear and helpful. Different types of media for discussions kept things fresh as well. Asynchronous day was nice to break up the week. Weaknesses: some of the units felt dragged out and discussions began to feel a bit repetitive towards the end of these units. Some class preparations felt like busy work and were far less engaging than others.",
                "So much great conversation and many opportunities to speak and listen. It could be great if there was more chances to practice and apply new grammar in a more structured way.",
                "I think that the class structure was set up very well in that the workload was evenly distributed and discussions were worthwhile. However, clearer instructions and rubrics on assignments would greatly improve some of the communication gaps between the instructor and the student.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging, I really enjoyed the curriculum because it taught students about Latin-American culture while teaching them Spanish too. The workload was a lot, but reasonable. Having asynchronous Wednesdays was great too, as it allowed students to get more sleep and do their work independently or in small groups in their own time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of work.",
                "A strength of this course is all of the collaborative work and unique assignments because it made the course more engaging. Sometimes the assignments felt a little bit like busy work, so I think just ensuring that each assignment is productive and meaningful would be helpful in maintaining students' interests."

It really did help a great deal with my speaking skills and overall confidence in speaking the language, and the class environment is low-pressure and constructive rather than intimidating, which some language classes can definitely be.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fun, very interesting, and my Spanish improved so much. I feel much more confident speaking and reading Spanish than I did before taking this class.",
