                "This class is organized in such a fun way! Its so engaging and exciting compared to other language classes at Yale!",

                "I felt like the topics that we covered helped facilitate each unit very well but sometimes the homework felt like busy work.",
                "The strengths are the all the different way the language is taught either through movies, books, and more. The weaknesses is that the class similar to other languages involves a lot of discussion and meets 4 days a week, so it can be taxing.",
                "Strengths - Teacher was kind, showed genuine care for her students. Class atmosphere was conducive to learning in a fun environment.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Teacher should talk more in English so class is easier to understand, more formal grammar and vocabulary lectures would be helpful",
                "This course is awesome. The original curriculum really helps you learn how to speak and write and portuguese and helps you learn more about Brazilian culture.",
                "Strengths: The Professor is fantastic. The entire course was created using original and gathered material. The class isn't constrained by a textbook so a large portion of the course involves interacting with Portuguese through different cultural lenses.\r\nWeaknesses: Especially towards the beginning of the semester, I felt there was a lack of grammar exercises that prevented me from having a scaffolding to build off of.  The syllabus was often incorrect which made planning around other courses complicated.",
                "sometimes the assignments feel like busy work but the overall design of the course is unique and engaging",
                "This course was so fun! The professor was great, homework was engaging, and the projects were always so enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Very chilled and flexible in assignments. Weaknesses: Not a lot of rigor and did not really teach us Portuguese."
