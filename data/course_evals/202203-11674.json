You go through a lot of theory-based stuff that builds to different models of how people, businesses, and groups interact in the world when there isn't full information (most of the time). Fairly micro-based class with the expected algebraic type models and lots of analytical work.",
                "A strong understanding of the interplay of probability with important economic concepts.",
                "The class felt like an advanced microeconomics course with a focus on uncertainty (expected utility theory, risk attitudes) and information (moral hazard, asymmetric information, signaling). Learned a lot about the mathematical economic theory behind these concepts and learned to solve hypothetical problems based off them. We also occasionally discussed empirical studies and actual economics papers related to concepts like risk aversion and incentive-based pay (moral hazard)  but the courses focus is really on theory. Refreshed/strengthened math ability and micro skills like constrained optimization. In general, I think this class really helped improve my general problem-solving skills: how to approach a long, difficult problem and systematically work through it."

                "Strengths: The concepts often built on each other and were presented in a logical way that allowed for constant reinforcement of earlier concepts in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Soenje would often go a bit fast through content, which made the course feel overwhelming at times with the amount of new information being presented",
                "The workload of this course is really in the sweet spot for a higher level economics seminar -- just enough to facilitate learning without being overbearing. Prof. Reiche is really a great lecturer and obviously cares about her students. The course content was interesting and engaging.\r\nThe balancing of the classwork is a little uneven. I honestly would have preferred more problem sets (there were only 4) that were due at a more frequent cadence. I do wish there were a bit more guidelines for the expectations for presentations as well -- I think there was quite a bit of disparity between them in terms of length, information, etc. and perhaps a bit of this was the amount of uncertainty in what the expectations were.",
                "Great professor, engaging, informative, well-organized",
                "sometimes there is too much information on the slides and its hard to see what is relevant. but the content is very interesting",
                "intellectually challenging but usually interesting- can be a bit information dense... breaking up theorems and defn with more examples would help in lecture",
                "The course had interesting material, but I think it was a bit too \"in the weeds\" so to speak. The math was incredibly complex, and I think I would have been more engaged if we had spent more time on the high level concepts and done slightly less math. It was hard to understand the usefulness of what we learned when most of the class was spent trying to understand the complicated mathematical models. It felt more like a math than econ class at times.",
                "Professor Reiche is great! You do a lot of microeconomic work and there are some ties to real-world applications of the theory you develop. I think a little more of this application could be useful (empirical studies of why this theory is important, and how it is applied in real life), but sometimes you do just have to learn the theoretical background and you can get lost along the way. Reiche has great slides and is always supportive of her students though so I wouldn't be too worried.",
                "Great professor",
                "Extremely well organized with a brilliant, motivated professor. Perhaps shorter psets in higher volume would make it so that there are less spikes in business throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Reiche. She is warm, fun (individually packaged and gifted us M&Ms after an in-class lottery activity), supportive, and incredibly generous with her time. Good lecturer and very organized as well; lots of opportunities to get extra help; fair timelines for problem sets (though theyre long) and two fair midterms and finals (felt true to practice materials and our work all semester, no crazy curveballs); challenging but rewarding; interesting economic theory, though a bit abstract. Weaknesses: I personally thought we spent too much time discussing mathematical derivations and background knowledge during some lectures. I would frantically write down the steps leading to some theorem or result only to realize that I had lost the main takeaway point along the way; lectures also moved a little fast for me, I always felt like I was rushing to keep up during class; lectures were also very theory heavy. As mentioned, there are good opportunities to get help with problem solving in office hours but I think spending more time in class connecting theory to example problems might help students feel more prepared to independently tackle problem sets. The jump from lecture absorption to problem set application often felt daunting."

This course drew on a lot of the same methods that were used in intermediate micro, so be sure to be comfortable with that foundation before you start. At the end of the day, the course is structured in a way that can either help or hurt you, depending on if you're on top of your work or not (the psets being due every 3 weeks can give a false sense of security that can really come back in a gnarly way the week before they're due).",

                "Great senior seminar. Professor Reiche is a gem and clearly very intelligent and cares a lot about her students and having people actually understand what is going on in the course. If you like micro and mathy-things definitely take the course; the applications of it are everywhere if you look.",
                "It is a fast paced lecture, she covers a lot of material each lecture, but the tests are really fair and there is a lot of time with the TA",
                "Yes, it was extremely interesting with a brilliant professor.",
                "Yes I would recommend, but make sure youre ready for a math and theory-heavy econ course. I dont think I knew to expect all that lol, but it still worked out. I took this course because I had a vague interest in these topics from intermediate microeconomics, but mostly because I had a great experience with Professor Reiche in intermediate microeconomics. This class is almost all about math and econ theory, which isn't usually my strong suit, but Im very happy I took it. The workload is significant but fair (though the four problem sets are long and you definitely benefit from working on them consistently and seeking help rather than rushing them off in the 48 hours before the due date), but the class stretched my brain and really forced me to think. Personally, I thought this was one of the hardest courses Ive taken at Yale when it comes to intellectual difficulty. A hard class but youll feel like you learned a lot and pushed yourself in a good way."
