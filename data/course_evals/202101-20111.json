Towards the second half of the course we applied what we had learned to medicine and modern humans, emphasizing how evolutionary trends shape our way of life profoundly.",
                "I gained a much better understanding of the complexities of evolution, and while there was a large range of topics covered, from phylogenetics to behavioral evolution, the emphasis was mostly on understanding broad concepts and understanding the core principles of evolution. There was also a major focus on disease and evolutionary medicine."

                "Compared to other online teaching methods I experienced with my other classes, the prerecorded lectures were the hardest to follow. The lectures were always posted late which I was not expecting and made it difficult to catch up on the lectures as I was expecting to watch them during the assigned class time. There was very little opportunities to interact with the professor and it was difficult to ask questions about the lectures as there were only office hours every other week, by which point we have covered an extra three lectures.",
                "Prof. Turner is very kind. The recorded lectures weren't as engaging as I hoped.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the flexibility and kindness of the instructor and TA. When he realized how burnt out students were this semester, Professor Turner lessened the amount of work for the second half of the semester. Another strength is that Professor Turner is very passionate about evolutionary biology, and it is super interesting to talk to him about it. To me the weakness of this course was the format. I know this was just a covid thing but I really struggle to pay attention to recorded lectures, so because that was the main form of learning I had a lot of difficulty with staying on track.",
                "One strength was it was the perfect level 200 course, deeper than an introductory course but still not too advanced. Everyone coming in had the appropriate background to be in the course. One weakness was the lectures were not super engaging, especially because we couldn't see the professor's face or interact with him.",
                "Strengths: The course is well-organized and the workload is incredibly manageable. Just 3 \"quizzes\" which consisted of 3-4 straightforward questions from the notes, a midterm, and a final. Everything was from the slides and all knowledge we are expected to know. I enjoyed the virtual \"tour\" we had of Peabody and wished it was in person!\r\nWeakness: Because of the recorded lecture format, I sometimes found myself dozing off a bit and not engaging with the material as much. Also, I felt that my discussion section was very reluctant to share\/talk sometime which overall made the experience not as enjoyable.",
                "I enjoyed the recorded lectures and thought they were well-presented, interesting, and found the recorded format with the slides to take notes on very helpful. I thought the fact that lecture materials adhered closely to the textbook was helpful during a stressful semester, but also wish we could have explored a bit more beyond the content covered in the book.",
                "I thought the course material was interesting and mirrored the book for easy reference. However, I would have preferred to deviate a little more from the book in terms of topics or even more examples, as having essentially all the same information sometime made it difficult to understand concepts. Presenting other ways of thinking about the material would have been really useful.",
                "I really enjoyed the textbook reading, although it was a lot of reading. I think Prof Turner is a fantastic instructor, and is very kind, helpful, and accessible! I probably wouldn't recommend this class taught virtually, though - I would only suggest taking it in person. I often felt like I was teaching myself the material because of the recorded lectures.",
                "The course content was very rich and interesting and was presented in a logical sequence. Lectures were usually read verbatim from the textbook so they could get a bit confusing since we tended to skip throughout the chapter. On the other hand this allowed us to read through the sections of the chapter we found unclear and obtain some additional context. The course would definitely benefit from skipping over some of the content in the textbook and spending more time on the more confusing topics.",
                "Something that is both a strength and a weakness was the fact that, for the most part, the content was completely out of the textbook, with only a couple lectures not using the textbook concepts and examples. This was helpful in understanding the key concepts, as the textbook was well written and Prof. Turner was a good lecturer, but also made lectures at times a little repetitive, as they sometimes just paraphrased the textbook."

                "I personally found that recorded lectures just do not work well for me. First, not having a set time makes it a lot easier to procrastinate them, and then also not having the ability to engage at all, even just through actively watching and listening, makes it hard for me to focus. I think that one thing that could improve this would be to make sure that the videos have the instructors face in them so it feels more like an interaction than just seeing lecture slides. \r\n\r\nI think the live Q&A sessions really succeeded, it was really nice to be able to interact with Professor Turner and everyone in the class, and to have the opportunity to ask questions or explore certain topics more deeply.",
                "The class slack discussion board could have been used more often for discussion among classmates. The quick access to the TA through the slack channel was extremely helpful, though. Having the recorded lectures to refer back to when doing problem sets or studying was extremely helpful.",
                "The recorded format with the slides to take notes on was very helpful. The virtual discussion section was less engaged than an in-person discussion section may have been, because it is harder to have discussions over Zoom, but I think splitting up into breakout rooms during those sessions was helpful. I really enjoyed the virtual tour of the Peabody collections.",
                "My preference would have been for a live zoom lecture, rather than recorded so that we could ask questions in real time as some concepts were difficult to understand and Q&A sessions were only once per week so it was sometimes difficult to remember what questions you wanted to ask",
                "I think having recorded lectures was helpful because I could pace myself and learn at my own speed. I also think the live Q&A sessions were great and instructive, and gave us opportunities to actually interact with the professor. I think the discussion sections sometimes felt a bit pointless. The quizzes and exam formats, though open-note, were still challenging (in a good way), so I think Prof Turner and Ketty did a good job of adapting assessments to fit a virtual learning environment.",
                "I did appreciate the live q & a sessions every week. Without them the course would have been quite unengaging, since the only instruction we were granted was through audio over powerpoint slides. Discussion sections employed the use of breakout rooms efficiently and ran quite smoothly."

                "ABSOLUTELY yes, take it! If you have any interest in the material, or if you need a Sc credit, or if you want to diversify your schedule with an interesting lower-workload class, or if you just love to listen to professors with calming deep voices (shoutout to prof Turner), this class is for you. I mean this in the nicest way possible: this was the perfect fifth class. I learned a lot in a very low-stress environment and definitely came out of it wanting to learn more in the future. I've caught myself thinking differently about the world around me when I take walks (which is every day, three cheers for pandemic living). Hopefully, this will never be relevant to anyone ever again, but I liked the Zoom-era set up of this class, too -- prerecorded lectures with two Zoom meetings per week in real time, a Q&A session (voluntary) and a discussion section (mandatory). This felt honestly really respectful of Zoom fatigue, not considering the fact that both the prof and the TA have been RIDICULOUSLY encouraging and accommodating the entire semester (on top of being very knowledgeable), too. (This is not similar to most of my other STEM experiences.) When I say this class is low work-load, I mean it: three problem sets, two exams, weekly section participation and readings. So yeah! Take it! You won't regret it!",
                "yes if in person",
                "Yes; E&EB 225 is a great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. The professor is straightforward and teaches clearly and the class is organized, so it is easy to stay on track and study for quizzes and tests. Overall, it was very interesting and I got a good background on evolutionary bio.",

                "Yes! I found it to be a very straightforward classes with clear expectation and easy assignments. I like learning about animals, plant, viruses and found it super approachable to understand since I had previously taken Bio 104.",
                "Yes, this is a well-organized and informative course for those looking to learn about evolutionary biology.",
                "Yes I would! You're probably taking this course for your major, which means you're already interested in Evolutionary Bio. So you will like this course.",
                "Yes, if you are on track 2 of EEB its a good way to get an idea of track 1 material without going too deep into any one topic. Its also an interesting science credit that doesnt seem to require much prior knowledge",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as long as it was taught in person! Prof Turner is fantastic, and the material is super interesting! It was really engaging to me as an E&EB major, but I know other students that took the class from different majors that found the material just as fascinating, despite not being E&EB. Definitely no regrets, one of my favorite classes of this year.",
                "I would recommend this course if 1) you've had some experience with evolution in coursework 2) you don't mind reading textbooks. I know this course is undergoing many changes in teaching staff and structure due to covid so this course might look very different in future semesters. From the experience I received, we tried to cover so much information that some of the more technical ideas became quite confusing since we moved past them so quickly. There were not many assignments, but since I spent a decent amount of time trying to make sense of everything, the two balanced each other out.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in evolution and looking for a low- stress and workload class! The material covered was very interesting I felt I gained a lot of knowledge about various topics in evolution, despite there not being a heavy workload."
