    "I learnt quite a lot from this inspring course and insightful professor John. I got to learn about the situations of food safety and measures that evaluate the environmental impacts. A lot of information I gained from the course are truly helpful and it solved a lot of mysteries that I have been wondering about for a long time. I learnt to write the first research paper in my life, and it was an amazing experience with the great help of professor. Food is something everyone cares about, but we are here to know more about it, to dig into it so that a better and safer world can be built. I am grateful for this course.",
    "I learned how to think critically about food and environmental practices that are pervasive in our everyday lives. I learned valuable research skills, including how to access publicly available data to analyze government & corporate practices. For the final paper, we investigated a food or food practice and presented it to the class; we ended up learning a lot from each other too. The seminar was really interesting and I'm glad that I was able to take it."

    "One strength of the course is that Professor Wargo guided us through our group presentations and the final project. The seminar was always really interesting. As a lecturer, Prof Wargo encouraged questions and discussion."

    "Of course I would. Humans should be aware of what we have done that harm the environment and thus try our best to come up with possible solutions.",
    "Definitely. Food practices are essential, and yet we take them for granted. Not only was this class interesting, it was helpful to learn information that to help us think critically about our food and environmental practices."
