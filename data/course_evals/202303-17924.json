                "The final exam focused on specific topics that were not necessarily on the study guide",
                "The strengths of the course were the wide breadth of information in psychological and brain research as well as the assignments given regarding readings and articles, experiment studies, and more. I cannot. think of any weakness of this course. I enjoyed the required participation in experiments and labs for credit at the end of the semester as I got to meet researchers and learn about the studies they create, gather data, and learn about. One way this course could be improved might be more class days as sometime I found the amount of information in lecture to be a little overwhelming. However, at the same time, I enjoyed the study guide review list given at the end of the lecture as this was helpful in my studying.",
                "There are no weaknesses, only strengths. Sam is an amazing professor and as long as you put in the effort, you will do well.",
                "Make it really easy to do well, helpful in posting slides and review materials, and I liked all the supplementary readings. Be aware you do have to participate in 5 hours of studies as a subject, and there was somewhat poor communication about how to go about that, though it was resolved by the end!",
                "I thought the lectures were engaging and the readings were helpful. I also enjoyed learning about experiments. It could be improved by having clearer guidelines and expectations for the reading responses and popular press article report, because I felt that the grades I received on those were more or less arbitrary.",
                "This class was super interesting and made me excited to get to take courses exploring the lectures that I found most engaging more deeply. It's just the nature of a survey course of such a wide ranging topic, but we covered a ton of information at a pretty surface level, which was sometimes slightly disappointing.",
                "The format of the class was definitely a strength and I liked how we had reading responses that touched on the lesson that we would learn during the week. The Professor was also extremely engaging, and funny, and made the class so much more fun.",
                "I liked the course a lot and how it is structured. I think the sequence of the classes makes sense. I liked the fact that we studied a different topic in every class, as it allowed me to have a basic understanding of many different topics. The only thing I would improve is that I would always make sure that the slides are understandable even for someone who (for any reason) was absent during the lecture. It happened to me to be absent and I had a hard time understanding some experiments from the slides as sometimes there were just graphs and key words but not a real written explanation (in a way that the experiment is understandable for someone who listened to the lecture but not for others). \r\nAnother improvement might be to modify the SONA experiments requirement. 5 credits is a lot, taking into account the fact that some experiments grant you only 0.5 (and the time spent is not much lower than the 1 credit experiment as: 40 min walking back and forth + 30 min of experiments that sometimes become 35 or 40 is not much different than 40 min walking + 55 min experiment). The real problem is also that it was very hard to find new available studies. There was a period in which I was checking 3 \/ 4 times a day. if the frequency of the studies available stays the same, I would lower the requirement to maybe 2.5\/3 credits.",
                "It would be nice if sections were offered! I do not feel like it was as interactive as other large lectures, like Econ 115.",
                "Strengths: Straightforward work\/overall course structure. Lectures were engaging and interesting. Summary slides at the end of each lecture made focused studying much more manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: Getting experimental participation credit was a nightmare - not many studies available, and they were far from campus.",
                "I really liked the course! I think it was structured in a very easy-to-follow way given the material. I wish the lectures were recorded but understand that would decrease attendance so having the slides posted was a good alternative.",
                "I think it provided covered a lot of the basics of psychology and did a good job of showing how the principals that we learned in class appeared\/could be applied to everyday class. The only weakness I could think of is sometimes the questions on the midterm or finals were a bit more complicated than the content that we covered in class.",
                "strengths: such a good, extremely organized intro to psychology (and the social sciences in general) - McDougle made sure to always be crystal-clear about where we were in the course, or the lecture, which lended a really helpful structure. you learn about a lot of fascinating experiments, and though I'm sad we only touched on each topic for 1-2 lectures, I'm also grateful we were able to have the breadth of subjects that we did. \r\nweaknesses: There's a psych study pool requirement which is a little tricky, especially for those w\/ packed schedules - I personally had research lab or a student job nearly every afternoon to evening, so I really struggled to find experiments that I could join.",
                "strengths - an interesting class taught by a really great professor. on the last day of class, he stood outside the door and gave (all 200 of) us each a high five and said goodbye as we walked out of the exam which seems so small but also aw. such a sweet dude. really wants everyone to do well. the exams are very easy if you memorize what's taught in lecture and the material is fun to learn. do your research study credits early because there might not be openings later in the semester. overall a great intro experience, would absolutely recommend, esp if with the same professor.",
                "Strengths: Easy, low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Credits for studies were difficult to obtain, made the class more stressful than necessary",
                "Strengths: professor McDougle was a great lecturer and very funny. He made sure that his students stayed engaged and looked out for the interests of his students when something went wrong (like the lack of psychology studies posted in SONA)",
                "I think that this course was really engaging. I showed up to class every day wanting to learn, and excite to hear more about the material.\r\nI think one weakness of the course was the variation in exam difficulty. It was difficult to prepare for exams because I thought some were far more difficult than others.",
                "I always enjoyed coming to lectures as Dr. McDougle had engaging slides and was a really fun lecturer. He also provided study guides that helped guide my studying for the exams.",
                "Strengths: This course gives a very good overview to introductory topics in psychology. Professor McDougle was also great! He was very knowledgeable, engaging, and fun. The exams were very fair and the workload was manageable. Weaknesses: None.",
                "The professor was very engaging and used a lot of applicable examples, I genuinely don't think the course could have been improved.",
                "Engaging lectures and interesting reading assignments.",
                "I think this course moved very fast. I scored a 5 on the AP exam, however, that was from 2 years ago, and I wanted to brush up on the knowledge. With that said, I already was familiar with the material, but others who may not have taken a psychology course from before may have felt too overwhelmed.",
                "I didn't feel prepared for the first midterm, but I thought the professor was very engaging.",
                "A strength of this course was how the tests reflected the fact it was a beginner course (emphasis on understanding of concepts and not on smaller details). I also enjoyed most lectures but some of guest lecturers were hard to follow. I like how the course was designed so that students were encouraged to attend class, and the exams references specific slides\/examples in lecture. The mandatory research credits were a hassle to complete, given the limited experiment slots and the inconvenient location for undergrads.",
                "Less vague and watered down. I felt some things were oversimplified, which is more harmful sometimes than being over complicated.",
                "This course was taught very well with good course work. However, it would help if the course was recorded.",
                "Perhaps giving more material, such as past exam papers, to prepare for the exams.",
                "Stregnths are that this course is super fun and easy to jump into no pre information required. weaknesses are that its pretty surface level and also I don't really like exams based on memorization",
                "I loved everything.",
                "The syllabus was really good",
                "Big lecture course, very surface level (which makes sense, given that it's just an intro class), each lecture is on an entirely different topic.",
                "The strengths of this course were that there were many office hour opportunities and methods to learn more and\/or expand on topics gone over in lectures.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of weaknesses that could, however, be improved. One thing is that it would be very helpful if the lectures could be recorded and uploaded online. For those who write notes throughout the lecture, it would be very helpful to be able to look back at the recording and see what was said about it, as they might not be able to attend office hours, etc. In addition, I believe it would be helpful if there were more practice questions and quizzes to help students prepare for the first midterm. If there is a good amount of preparation, there shouldn't be a need to add a really high curve. The study guides for each lecture were helpful, and it would also be nice if there are mentions of what specific areas we should focus on when reading the textbook. This way, there will be no surprise if a small topic that wasn't mentioned in class is put onto the midterm.\r\nAlso, there seemed to be a lack of communication between Professor McDougle and the researchers for research credit. It would be nice if there was an option to get extra credit on the final by writing more papers and\/or participating in more experiments, as I thought those aspects helped me engage in more real life aspects of psychology.",
                "Strengths: I liked the material in the class, as the professor also made the class more enjoyable with his jokes and obvious interest in psychology.\r\nWeakness: The exams were sometimes a little harder than advertised in lecture. Definitely dedicate at least a week worth of studying for the exams.",
                "The research participation aspect of the class either need to be solidified at the beginning of the semester or removed from the course. And  if neither of these are an option, maybe decrease the amount of required credits or make participation a way to get extra credit in the class. This entire research participation was the most stressful part of the entire class. Otherwise, everything else was interesting. I liked each unit we explored, and it wasnt repetitive if youve already taken AP psych.",
                "Strengths: Well organized, good professor, well prepared lectures\r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Strengths: AWEEESOMMEE lecturer, interactive and funny slideshows\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The pace was really good. Each lecture covered a reasonable amount of knowledge. Weakness is that sometimes the textbook stuff isnt covered.",

                "Lecture slides study guides good for review\r\nTest difficulty is reasonable",

                "Strengths: the class very interesting, thought-provoking, well-organized, clear study guides for midterms, great professor\r\nWeaknesses: topics are highly interesting, but lecture style of class can be boring, lots of memorization for tests, overall great course though",
                "It is a seminar so if you're not engaging a lot by yourself it's easy to fall off.",
                "Strength of this course is that it is very interesting and engaging. A weakness was that the lab credits were somewhat difficult to get due to the lack of opportunities on SONA which made the course stressful at times.",
                "The course did a good job of making lecture interesting and the material not being overwhelmingly dense or demanding. I did every reading and went to probably 75% of lectures. Just a really good survey course (I would know, I was probably one of like 3 seniors in the class).",
                "I think overall this course was a great introduction to the field of psychology. The materials were well spaced-out, and lots of interesting topics were covered. There were good sources given out in preparation of exams as well.",
                "maybe having problem sets or practice exams to help better understand what content you know and what content you don't to make studying easier."

                "Definitely! Especially if it's with Sam. He's a super fun lecturer and I think this class is helpful for life in general regardless of what major you are.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to get a sense of what aspect of Psychology they are interested in. If you took AP Psych, I probably would not recommend this course, because there were a lot of similarities, and I think it would be more interesting to delve into a specific topic.",
                "Yes, I would. It helped me learn more about myself and the stages of development on a psychological level. If Professor McDougle is the instructor, I would recommend it even more.",
                "Yes. The teacher is good (and very nice and fun), the topics are interesting and the course is not too hard. The workload is ok.",
                "Yes! The class is really interesting and Professor McDougle is an amazing lecturer!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in this topic and are willing to put in the effort!",
                "Yes. It was a very easy 5th credit and an interesting dive into a field I hadn't taken a course in yet.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in psych this is a great gateway :)",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in psychology because it provides a great overview of how psychology can be applied to various fields of study. The workload is also really manageable and I learned a lot of fun concepts!",
                "yes! I took this class as a social science credit and it turned out to be both accessible and interesting - really enjoyed the lectures on groups and social psychology in particular, as a more scientific way to frame current discourses about social identity. also prof mcdougle is such a funny, concise, and compassionate lecturer",
                "i would!! absolutely yes 12\/10",
                "It's one of those classes you either take when you want an easy class\/distributionals, or you need this as a prereq for other cooler classes. Nothing wrong with that though, just don't expect anything lifechanging form this class",
                "Yes, it is a very good introduction to a bunch of different concepts in psychology.",
                "Yes. I think that it's a really engaging course that teaches you a lot about psychology. I showed up to class every day excited to learn more.",
                "Yes! I think this is a good introductory class to psychology.",
                "Yes! Although I am not a psychology major, I found all of the course topics very interesting and relevant to my life. Professor McDougle is one of the best professors I've had at Yale and kept the lectures very interesting while teaching me a lot at the same time. It exams were fair and the course load is not heavy.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student, as the content learned is very applicable to real life, and the professor was was amazing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to any student, major or non-major. It is an excellent way to learn about basic human psychology and the topics covered in this course are personally beneficial to anyone who takes it.",
                "Yes. I think that an introductory psychology course is important for anyone because it teaches you important things about how the mind works that will change how you approach situations forever.",
                "I would recommend this course because Professor McDougle was a great lecturer.",
                "Yes! Lectures are fun and engaging, exams pretty straightforward. Good course if you are just curious about psychology. Completing the research credits was the biggest hassle.",
                "No. Didnt need an entire semester to learn this material. Felt like I wasted credits on this class.",
                "Yes, this course is a good introduction to the field of psychology.",
                "Yes, even though I did not do the best grade-wise, this class was engaging and useful.",
                "Yes especially a freshman, super fun intro class and you don't need to engage that much, start studying for tests early tho",
                "Yes! It is interesting course and it's not that hard.",
                "Yes. Its a great intro to psych and covers a lot of various topics that could be interesting.",
                "If you're looking for an overview into psychology, definitely. If you're considering psychology as a major\/further field of story, this could definitely help. However, if you're looking for any sort of in-depth exploration of psychology, or an examination of the more scientific side of it (neuroscience, etc.), this is not the class. But it's a really fun class, with not much work.",
                "Yes: I think everyone should have an intro to psych course under their belt (though Ive heard from those who took AP psych and this course that it covers much of the same ground, so wouldnt recommend for those people)",
                "If it is taught by McDougle, absolutely yes. The course was incredibly captivating even as a non-major, and the workload was always very manageable. The lecture slides were always quite fascinating and interactive (especially those that involved visual\/auditory illusions), and McDougle went out of his way to make sure we were having a bit of fun.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. IF some of the areas of the course are improved, then I would absolutely recommend all students take this class as it does go over some very important ideas about psychology and the brain. It is relatively a great introduction course, but there are also a lot of improvements that could be made.",
                "Sam mcdougal is a dawg and great lectures but I wouldnt do it purely because of the amount of memorisation and harsh grading",
                "I would definitely recommend taking a psychology class during your time at Yale. I found this one enjoyable and would\r\nrecommend this one as it wasn't too difficult to understand. Plus, the material is very engaging.",
                "Yes. It is an amazing course to get to know a little more about psychology and have a basic understanding. The professor is really good and the lectures were well put together.",
                "Yes!!",
                "yes super interesting and worth taking especially for a credit D fail class.",
                "Yes, it is a good introductory psychology class.",
                "Yea this is such a fun course and introduces students to psychology in all fields.",
                "Yes for the content, but sometimes the content did not align with assessment material.",
                "Yes, taking a intro psych class is cool and essential life thinking.",
                "Yes. 100%. I had never taken any class at all related to Psychology before, so I took this class to see if I enjoyed it, and this became my favorite class by far. McDougle is an amazing lecturer and really just a cool guy in general. He did a fantastic job of teaching some pretty complex and sometimes tedious topics. I was always engaged, and my attention was always present, and I credit that completely to Dr. McDougle. I plan to take more of his classes if I can. Oh, and the course material itself was also very interesting. The number of different topics that we got to learn about was very interesting and fun, but also very practical, which I thought was very cool. The lectures on memory and sleep, as well as some on morality, were very applicable to daily life, and I found myself using things I learned. This is a really cool class, and I think everyone should try and take it at some point.",
                "Yes, helps you learn the basics of psychology",
                "Yes, foundational to understanding the mind and all human behavior.",
                "Yes, this was a great way for me to gain a social sciences credit as a stem major and it was highly interesting. Easily my favorite class I took this semester. The workload is perfect if you are adding it as a 5th course to your semester. Psychology is a very interesting topic and a great thing to learn about with this professor",
                "I would recommend this course if you are slightly interested in the subject, but if you're neutral it can get a bit heavy",
                "Yes, this course is very manageable. The exams were not terribly hard and the lectures were very fun.",
                "Yes. Interesting class with managable workload. Good for underclassman or upperclassman that needs a credit and has an interest in psychology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about the field of psychology. I would recommend it especially to someone who does not want to dive too deep into one aspect of the subject but wants a appetizer platter-style course of psychology.",
                "yes. i found this course very interesting and would highly recommend to anyone interested in psychology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The lectures are engaging and the research experiments you need to engage in for the five credits are not too difficult and can even be fun at times, depending on the experiment. If you're interested even a bit in psychology or something close to psychology then you will not regret taking this course"
