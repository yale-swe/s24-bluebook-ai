                "We learned about imperialism's totalizing influence over Western education and the necessity to break from this colonial mainframe in order to see beyond. Though you may not arrive at concrete and palatable answers by the course's end, Ed and Empire will set you on a path that few courses can (in my opinion).",
                "This course taught me a lot about myself, schooling systems, colonialism and the place of education in liberatory struggle. I left each interaction that resulted from this course with more questions than answers and felt challenged to be critical and introspective (even when that is uncomfortable).",
                "what didn't I learn in this course! over the semester, we gained background historical knowledge on American and British imperialism, and the different thought processes of each country's imperialism approach when colonizing other countries and nations. We learned about the ways imperialism has driven so many different education exploits, like the structure of Indian boarding schools and all-Black schools, to study-abroad and volunteer work abroad.",
                "Education and Empire endows each student with a robust understanding of schooling as a mechanism by which empires shores up power. It allows students to be self-critical not for the sake of articulating critique but to use critique to pave a path toward the important work of revolutionary praxis. Not only do you learn about the ways that the present and past are intertwined, and how to intimately understand these continuities, but you learn about how power is made fragile by acts of refusal and resistance. Through taking this course, you'll learn how to become a more deeply engaged listener. You'll find yourself feeling discombobulated when you (re)\/(un)learn these histories of the present, but by the end of the course you arrive with a greater understanding of how education and pedagogy can be employed for liberatory ends.",
                "Literally everything, my entire worldview has changed. I was able to break down so many of the romanticized ideas I've had about the systems that exist while interrogating my complacent position in the colonial state. The question is what insights didn't I develop.",
                "I learned about some of the history of how various forms of schooling served the US imperial\/colonial mission and developed critical thinking and collaborative working, thinking, and writing skills about ways to maybe imagine a better future",
                "My outlook on education has been forever changed. I learned how the education system was built to uphold empire and white supremacy and how that legacy continues today. I was able to relate historical facts to my own personal student life, and I was able to reflect on this in all of my papers.",
                "History of settler colonial project and American Empire founded on and tied to education. We learned how this history continues. We learned to implicate ourselves in this history, about resistance to these projects, ways of thinking about power and education.",
                "I learned about the historical development and social ramifications of the schooling system. I also learned about what it means to have a compassionate intellectual space.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about how education has been used as a tool of colonialism to maintain social order as well as the possibilities for a decolonized version of education. The class was incredibly interesting.",
                "learning how to write not just for the sake of completing assignments, but to truly articulate, challenge, interrogate, reflect. learning how to think not just for the sake of gaining participation points or trying to \"sound smart\" but to truly wrestle with the contradictions we all hold as students in an institution with a complicated history and to imagine a radically different future. \r\n\r\ni learned so, so much from this class, not just technical skills like how to write and articulate better my thoughts in a higher-level seminar, but also interpersonal skills like what it might mean to have a classroom built on care and compassion between students and with the professor!",
                "I learned so much about the values and philosophies that motivate the makeup of schooling today and throughout much of U.S. history. This class gave me a new lens with which to understand why we school and educate in the way we do, but perhaps should not.",
                "This course has undoubtedly shaped the way I have come to understand myself, my schooling experiences, and the empirical forces that have shaped education in the West, and ultimately how these three components of self, school, and empire, are interconnected and constantly are under direction and stress of colonial projects. I've understood how these projects have tainted the staples of Native American communities and Black communities in their attempts to be fully integrated and accepted into the fabrics of our society. I've also understood why: why these communities are under constant surveillance and prejudice; why Empire seeks to promote order and homogeneity in race, class, gender, and thought; why, in turn, our communities have such traumatic and inequitable schooling experiences. Yet, while learning about these terrorizing projects, our class developed insights into what resistance had been present in colonial schooling projects and the resistance present in communities that are currently surviving against them. I have developed critical analytical skills that I can never and will never stop using. These skills have helped me understand my place in Empire, where my strengths lie in being imbricated within these projects, and how I can detest these forces.",
                "What knowledge, skills, and insights DIDNT I develop!!! This course was more than a course. It went beyond academics and straight into my daily life. I unlearned, relearned, and learned education. I learned about the relationship between education, learning, knowledge to empire. I learned to question what we consider knowledge, schools, and learning. I've rethought my life experiences and schooling and way of thinking about knowing and being in the world, and I think I've grown a lot because of this class. With the assignments which prof tzb encouraged to be outside the traditional essay, I was able to think more creatively, something that doesn't usually happen in other courses. I had to push myself not only in my thinking and questioning myself but also in my creativity.",

                "1) Some of the material may leave you unconvinced. Still, I'd argue that this renders a unique self-exploration\/ interrogation of why you feel that way. 2) Though revolutionary, insightful and thought-provoking, some of the readings are little academic\/ jargon-y. 3) Despite these observations, this was the best class I've ever taken ever.",
                "Prof. tzb's priorities and intentions of creating community in a supporting and nurturing environment is easily the greatest strength of the course. Additionally, the discussions and readings in this course are very thought provoking and extremely challenging (in the best way possible).",
                "strengths: great readings, very thought provoking and always super relevant to in-class discussions and content\r\nweaknesses: please include a break halfway through! the content is very interesting but a short five minute break in the middle of the two hours, just to get up and stretch, would do wonders for zoom fatigue and student learning",
                "Strengths: TZB! TZB! TZB! one few instructors at Yale that is a teacher first than she is a professor. The opportunity to be heard in a seminar space, especially online, is hard to come by in a Yale setting; TZB structures the classroom in a way that makes you feel inclined to contribute not for the sake of 'participation points' or to 'sound smart' but to actually parse through challenging material and conversation with your peers. The readings are brilliant, the briefing on the histories TZB provides are extremely powerful, and the assignments encourage collaboration, creativity, and purpose in a way that is unique to Education and Empire. Weaknesses: n\/a",
                "While the readings were sometimes dense and long, they were worth it. Tzb does a phenomenal job in making such dense and seemingly totalizing topics directly link to your personal experiences in a way that makes not deeply engaging in this class impossible. This class was so much more than an academic journey, it was a personal transformation.",
                "Strengths: This course was really well organized for student learning, and the professor was incredibly understanding and considerate during the pandemic, reducing reading loads when needed and really putting student health and wellbeing of all kinds first. This level of care helped us talk about difficult material while building one of the most genuine class communities I've experienced at Yale -- especially notable for a course during virtual learning.",
                "No weaknesses, except I wish I could've met everyone in person. This course is life-changing and I was so sad when it ended. I really felt like even over Zoom, we built a community of learners and had revelations together. Our discussions were amazing (prompted by the amazing readings). Everything about this course will blow your mind. We did a class zine as our final project and everyone's vulnerability and honesty was so emotional.",
                "Strengths: TZB is amazing. The classroom community was very caring. The course modules were really good, covering History, present, in and outside the classroom, and epistemologies - all classes that teach about marginalisation should teach equally about resistance, like this course did. It was a very personal experience to take this class.",
                "The strengths are the readings and strength of classroom discussions. The weaknesses are all, sadly, intrinsic to Zoom. The class does best when it is composed of students that know each other, but it was hard to develop connections online.",
                "The discussions and readings were very interesting. I like how we often went into breakout rooms and filled in powerpoints as a class to go over the material from the readings. I liked the very student-driven nature of the course.",
                "strengths - the professor does an amazing job making sure everyone is involved and engaged while leaving enough creative space to allow students to do so in their own unique ways (because everyone learns differently). the workload was manageable, with some course readings and assignments slightly changing in the direction of how the class was growing\/wanted to further grow. i personally loved that the syllabus changed along with how we as a class grew, but i guess this might be a weakness (?) for some people who want more certainty from their courses. \r\n\r\nweaknesses - i wish this class was yearlong.",
                "Strengths: I loved everything about this course. The reading was a manageable load, and they were intriguing every week; you truly get to know the people in your seminar and form community; I never felt like I was struggling to retain information just to get a grade. I felt motivated to learn in this course unlike any other I've taken so far at Yale, and much of that was thanks to Professor TZB!\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus could have focused a little more on current educational systems (magnet schooling, alternative education, etc.)  but this is so minor a weakness, it had no effect on the enjoyable class overall!",
                "Strengths: So many of us students found this course despaired, lost, hopeless, and Tzb was able to create a space where, no matter what, we would leave feeling lighter, feeling heard, feeling honest, feeling scared, feeling beautifully uncertain. I've never been in a space like this, nonetheless a virtual one. The biggest strength I can pinpoint is how this course rips you from any comfort you may reside in, be that personal or situational, and puts you face to face with your oppressor. This course demands that you respond to it, in any way you can, understand it, hate it, and nonetheless live in it. But then, suddenly, this course embraces you. Your classmates, without saying a word, understand and support one-another, and together, you make strides to seek elsewheres of lighter, less-demanding futures. This course allows you to transcend from your unique positionalities within society and be involved in a much greater mission paved by years of resistance, hurt, and love. It is something magical to be apart of this course. You won't find this anywhere else. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: That it was only one semester, though, what I have left with from this course will be with me forever.",
                "STRENGTHS: Prof tzb is amazing, and so are all the people who join this class. There is really a community, even if this is a virtual seminar I felt some connection with the other people in the class, especially since collaboration is really encouraged for the assignments. The assignments are really free for you to push yourself and be creative. The classtime is really well used virtually, with time for smaller discussions in breakout rooms, presentations, large group discussions, even a bit of individual work. It is a good balance of everything for a virtual setting. The readings are AMAZING. I came out of every discussion with something to think about for the rest of the day, and something to talk to other people with. Amazing course."

                "Having a flexible schedule and reading load really helped and went along with TZB's general level of genuine care for their students. The reading posts did usually help lead into and reflect on discussion, the papers tended to be fairly reflective which I liked, and discussions were thoughtfully led and put together.\r\n\r\nPersonally I wish we could have done fewer google slides recapping the readings.",
                "I liked that all of the readings were made available online and that the professor was flexible about being late to class or outside circumstances. She was also very understanding of our emotional\/energy levels and that helped me engage more with the material. I liked our breakout room sessions and I think the professor did a great job of gauging the energy levels in the zoom room and changing course if needed.",
                "This was one of my most enjoyable classes because of the way we were able to create a sense of community despite being virtual. The genuine discussions and time spent in breakout rooms made it so that the virtual nature of the class never seemed too taxing.",
                "i thought something this class did really well with the transition to zoom that i have yet to see in my other courses is the ways in which participation wasn't so wholly contingent on unmuting oneself and speaking up. for example, we would do a shared google slide presentation and be split into breakout rooms where we jot down our thoughts about the week's readings with a smaller group of people on the slide and present to the entire class after, or just split off into smaller groups to reflect on readings\/what the professor just said\/etc.",
                "Professor TZB is incredibly accomodating to the personal experiences of each of her students, so I knew if I was struggling with the workload of the course (because of the pandemic or otherwise), I would be heard and treated with understanding.",
                "Tzb centered our physical and mental health every single week during the semester, and it allowed for a remote learning experience that was less demanding, less stressful, and totally sympathetic. The assignments, whether weekly or monthly, never felt like assignments. They felt like exercises created with the intention to promote community, deep learning, and critical thinking. Every reading response and essay required your personal reflection and thoughts, and they always encouraged messy thoughts, heavy emotions, and honest reactions. Again, this course was unlike any course I took during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stripping the formalities and unnecessary demands of a typical year made this organic and so special, there wasn't a moment which I felt I needed more from this course to truly supplement my learning.",
                "This was a once per week ~2 hour seminar, and because of the different ways prof tzb prepared (breakout rooms, individual time, large group discussion, mini lectures, group presentations, etc) it wasn't exhausting even if it was virtual. There were many different ways in which we used classtime, and we rarely just sat there to talk as a large group for the full 2 hours because there were different ways in which we learned."

The class itself is also just really cool and a very important one to take, as it opens your eyes to so many different patterns of empire that exist in literally every aspect of academia you can think of.

Also the growth you experience is immense, from strong disillusionment with the education system to self-actualised belief in resisting the system on your own terms.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, but know that you'll only get out what you put in.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was incredibly interesting, and it completely changed my perspective about education and the possibilities for decolonial futures.",
                "if i have to choose one course at yale that i will remember and carry with me for the rest of my life, it's this class. not an exaggeration. if given the opportunity, everyone needs to take this class and they will see why i said what i said.",
                "YES, YES, YES. I definitely have not loved a class at Yale more than I loved this one. I felt motivated to learn, able to speak up, and like a valuable part of a learning community. I grew so much in my understanding of education generally, more than I have in any of my EDST classes. If you are not interested in education, this may not be the ideal class for you, but TZB will probably make you fall in love with education studies anyway.",
                "Yes",
                "A million times yes. No matter your year, major, or interests, we are all in need of understanding ourselves and our place at this institution. If anything, every student should be required to take courses like these. There's knowledge that you just can't escape in this life, and this course, if your communities haven't been the center of years of systematic oppression through colonization and imperialism, will open your eyes to the histories of injustices our educational projects have created. Taking this course will make you uncomfortable, but if you have been feeling too comfortable at Yale, that uncomfortableness is necessary.",
                "YES! YES! YES! This course literally changed my life and the way I think about the world, others, my future, and myself. If you're thinking of going into education in any way, specially teaching, this course is a MUST. I wish everyone, especially educators, took this course. You'll learn about learning so much and about the ways in which the world we live in are constructed, and you'll think about power and empire building. If any of this seems even slightly interesting and important, apply to this course.",
                "Highly highly highly suggest. If you are even considering this course, take it. TZB is an amazing teacher that I would recommend to every student at Yale. Furthermore, this is one of those courses that will change the way you see education and yourself. 10\/10 recommend!"
