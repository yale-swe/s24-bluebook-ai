I learned how to characterize the political economies of different European countries and how to compare them. This was a good introduction into comparative government.",
                "I learned about capitalism in major developed countries across the world (though primarily in Europe). This was actually incredibly eye-opening and caused me to realize that our standard understandings of \"capitalism\" are mostly limited to what we see in the United States, which is NOT reflective of capitalist economies in most European countries.",

                "Strength: the course format and structure and TAs were great. Weakness: Sometimes lectures were a bit disorganized or hard to follow.",
                "Material in lecture was often covered quite quickly, but I found it easy to go back to lecture slides and catch up on things I missed because lecture materials were easily accessible. A huge strength of the course was the TAs, who were always willing to help out and answer questions.",
                "Strengths: great TAs and helpful sections, interesting subject material, weaknesses: SO much material for each class that we would struggle to get through it all",
                "Great lecturer, superb teaching assistants. This is a great course!",
                "The course manages to cover information in depth while also covering a wide range of information. No weaknesses!",
                "Pretty low impact work-load wise. I felt that the lectures weren't the most useful, but I really enjoyed the sections.",
                "Lectures were very comprehensive and sections were very helpful in tying together the readings with the lectures.",
                "The lectures moved very quickly and gave a lot of information, which was interesting. I did not mind the extra information, but I would have liked for the lectures to be more streamlined. The lectures often ran over time as well. The discussion sections were a highlight because the TAs explain everything well, but most students did not talk. And I really liked that I learned something new in every class and discussion section.",
                "I thought lecture were interesting but had way too much information in the slides, so the professor would frequently go over time or have to skip slides. However, Professor Mares' passion and expertise shines through it all and I was glad that she taught this course. Overall, though, I think the TFs were the best part of this class. They were incredibly helpful in summarizing the readings and helping us engage with their arguments, which I found incredibly fascinating!",
                "Great readings and section! Lot of material.",
                "The first half of the course is very interesting, but the second half is a little scattered. I think the first half of the course could be dragged out across the entire semester, as there is too much content in it right now.",
                "Well organized. Biggest strength was Alexander Trubowitz. If you have the choice, please take the class with him as the TAone of the best TAs Ive had at Yale.",
                "Strengths: The discussion section was useful and added much to the experience. The material is really useful, and the readings are selected carefully. Weakness: only big weakness I can think of is the syllabus - the expectations were not set clearly ahead of time, and the syllabus is incomplete and lacks details about the technical side of the class.",
                "I really enjoyed the content that this course offered, and there was a ton of interesting information in the lectures. That said, at times the pace of the lectures felt a little rushed to the point where we would sometimes skip over slides or only stay on them for a few seconds, which made them harder to follow. I also learned a lot from the readings, but some were a little overly technical given that the course didn't focus much on methodologies or statistical techniques.",
                "The class was early in the morning, so recorded lectures would have been helpful.",
                "The strengths are the content and the TFs. Although I had my doubts at first, once I finally got to learning the material I found it was pretty applicable and sensible, fun to learn. TFs were incredible. Weaknesses are lectures. Very dull.",
                "Amazing sections",
                "the presentation of information was disorganized. it was a shame because the content was very interesting",
                "Strengths: very clear guidance for exams, interesting lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Mares' presenting style was occasionally difficult to follow during the lectures",
                "Very well organized",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely the discussion sections and the teaching fellows. They were super approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful to make sense of content that was sometimes confusing the first go around in lecture. A weakness was that the lectures were super dense and Professor Mares went through the many text-rich slides very rapidly with few asides. This made it difficult to stay fully engaged and understand what was the most important information from each lecture.",
                "Readings are too long- unmanageable so no one ends up doing them at all",
                "Strengths: appropriate workload of weekly readings, Isabela is so kind and really knowledgeable. Great TAs. Lots of help for exams.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures could have the key points bolded and takeaways repeated a few times, I think there was a lot of good detail in them but I would easily lose track of the main threads / theses of the presentations. This is a small thing but it could help a bit !",
                "Strengths: The course was structured brilliantly to facilitate the goals of the course. If you were able to go to all the lectures, you would first cover general principles, then look at the applications of those principles to case studies, then compare the case studies and look at outlier examples. It was amazing how everything in a very diverse set of course material tied together so well. Huge credit was down to the TAs (more below), who was arguably the best teaching fellow I have had the pleasure of learning under during my time at Yale.\r\nImprovements: I do think at times there was a lot of following with the course slides, which while useful for studying, meant that we never had enough time to cover all the material in the slides and would have to skip over the last few slides or go over lesson time. Additionally, I do think there was a lot of unnecessary detail  not a problem in terms of enrichment, but it wouldve been great to have a clearer idea of what the core topics were (rather than finding out in preparation for an exam).",
                "Very fast paced lectures and to me the content wasnt the most exciting thing.",
                "Strengths: good prof, TAs were fantastic, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lecture slides felt a bit disorganized"

                "Yes! This class was exactly what I'd hoped it be as a second-semester senior looking to focus mostly on writing my thesis. Prof Mares and the TAs were excellent. I have a much stronger grasp of the development of European political economy over the course of the 20th century.",
                "Yes!! Great professor and I learned a lot. Great elective for global/polisci/ep&e",
                "Yes!",
                "I would highly recommend this course! I think it would be helpful to have a strong foundation in macroeconomics and comparative politics in advance, but either way students will learn a lot about policy.",
                "Yes, it is a fantastic course. I left the course feeling much more knowledgable especially about the history of European countries I was not previously familiar with.",
                "Strongly! It is an amazing class that taught me so much about Europe in the postwar period",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted a foundation in looking at capitalist economies comparatively.",
                "Depends. If you're interested in the subject matter then yes. But there's probably more interesting comparative politics classes out there.",
                "Absolutely, one of the best classes I have take here. I learned so many new concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to a social science major",
                "If you are interested in understanding how capitalism works across countries and how it developed over the last 50-60 years, then yes! I also think most Yale students who study economics are mostly focused on the American system and would benefit from understanding how it works in other countries as well. Also, the exams are not too bad, as Professor Mares runs through a bunch of potential essay questions and topics that you should know the lecture before the exam. The TFs also put in a lot of extra effort to make sure that there were plenty of opportunities for review sessions and for us to ask them questions.",
                "Yes! It's a great introduction to recent European political history.",
                "I would recommend it if youre looking for an chill survey poli Sci course.",
                "Yes. Everything in the global economy makes sense now.",
                "Yes! Please take it. This class is unique for Yale, and you will learn much more about economic policy than in any existing econ class. Material is quintessential for anyone willing to go into policymaking. It is also one of the few good classes at Yale which focuses on European politics (even tho we study Japan and a little bit US as well and the material is applicable to many countries). On top of that, the professor is sweet and knowledgeable, and the TFs are great.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in political economy and would like to study countries that aren't named the United States of America for once. Our political discourse often invokes countries like Sweden and Denmark, but I didn't understand the specifics of what makes the social democratic model unique until taking this course (and how there is variation even among the Nordic countries). This course would also be a good fit for anyone who is interested in economic history and wants to understand how the economic miracle in countries like West Germany ground to a halt and how these countries have responded differently to globalization and deindustrialization.",
                "Yes! Definitely, especially if you're interested in learning about how different countries respond to crises, and how their responses vary across social welfare states, fiscal discipline, and Keynesian economics.",
                "Yes! Interesting content once you learn it but also very light.",
                "Absolutely, great content to learn",
                "Yes, but only if you have a good TA. The content is interesting but the professor could be more organized.",
                "Yes! A well-taught, interesting survey of capitalist systems and information that informs other EP&E coursework. A real class where I learned things I'll continue to use without an overbearing workload.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my first political science course at Yale, and while I wasn't immediately sure if I was interested in the material, the way it was taught allowed me to tangibly see my intellectual growth in the area. The workload was manageable and the essay exams were straight-shooting.",
                "yes! Isabela is a wonderful person and so, so knowledgeable.\r\nShe is so passionate about these topics and is so excited about sharing her passion, which is all you can ask for in a professor. \r\n\r\nMany people in this class took it in conjunction with Jacob Hackers Politics of US Public Policy, and I would really recommend this. The classes spoke to each other more than any other 2 classes I have taken at the same time at yale. Lots of lectures referenced similar concepts like policy feedback and path dependency, but this class is focused on Europe from 1920-2000, while Hackers class is focused on the US. Super interesting.",
                "Yes. 100%. I did not think I would enjoy this course, indeed was planning to drop it as I was on a heavy courseload semester, but it has become my most enriching course this semester. Additionally, it is one of the courses where I genuinely believe a lot of the concepts will stick with me beyond this semester due to how relevant and well-tied together the course was.",
                "If you are really interested in this subject then yes. If not you likely wont be heavily invested.",
                "Interesting survey of European welfare states. Pretty localized and narrow to instructor's subject area, but she is very knowledgeable and passionate.",
                "I would. You learn a lot about capitalism and how it varies between countriesthere's a lot more to be learned than you might expect! The readings were dense, but the TAs did a fantastic job explaining everything in section. And grading was very fair.",
