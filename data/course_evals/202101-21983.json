Professor Goren is very upfront about what she expects from students and gives ample opportunity to improve your grade. The enrichment events were fun and deepened my understanding of topics we discussed in class without being repetitive or boring. The integration of new Israeli films and guest speakers made the class lively and entertaining. Being allowed to pick which events we went to meant that we could focus on subjects that interested us specifically, which made the course feel catered to my own preferences.\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any real weaknesses to the course, only that I wish we had more time to talk about some of the topics that we discussed in class.",

                "Absolutely. Israel will never cease to be a hot topic, and is almost always put in some sort of us-versus-them, good-versus-evil dynamic. Shiri's approach, in contrast, is much more nuanced, depicting Israeli Jews and Arabs as real people with perspectives worth listening to. I feel like I have a much richer understanding of the Conflict and Israeli society after taking the course, even though I had spent a considerable amount of time in Israel beforehand.",
