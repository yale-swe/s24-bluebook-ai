    "I learned how to write better. English 120 was one of my favorite classes this semester. I truly enjoyed reading the course packet essays and writing each essay, and Professor Ehrgood gave such clear and helpful feedback on how to write in a way that \"surprised and delighted\" myself and my readers. I also think I un-learned a lot that I have learned all my life...really made me think more about what good writing is.",
    "I improved my ability to read and write prose in ways that surprise and delight myself (and, hopefully, anyone who reads my writing). I feel more equipped to attack issues of style, register, flow, diction, and other techniques used in crafting delicious sentences. I also developed a better sense for how to best communicate my ideas to an audience.",
    "Throughout the course, I saw my essay writing skills improve dramatically. I learned how to convey my thoughts elegantly and write with delight. The most important skill I learned was how I could further improve writing on my own.",
    "I learned how to write effectively, and artfully and how to better communicate ideas that I had.",
    "I learned how to write delightful sentences that often surprised me!",
    "This course taught me what good writing really looks like. It helped me fine tune my expression and think about elements of style and structure that I didn't really pay attention to before I had taken this course. English 120 made me more appreciative of both the local and global moves that make a good text, and sharpened my perspective as both a writer and a reader.",
    "We learned how to write short, concise, creative non-fiction pieces, with close attention paid to style and language.",
    "We learned how to understand what makes a piece of writing pleasurable, and how to use different strategies to create pleasure with our own writing.",
    "became better at writing essays, and coming up with interesting thoughts in response to vague prompts",
    "This course gave me a new way to read and understand essays as pursuits of a thought. I have become a more thoughtful reader and a much more thoughtful writer of essays, and writer in general, as it got me to think about the implications of every small choice I make, whether that be word choice, punctuation, or structure.",
    "I learned a lot about how to write about myself and other people I know, and about things that concern me. I learned to be more vocal of my opinions in class. More importantly, I learned to read and observe what good writers do in their writing that I can emulate, whether these writers are our course-packet writers or other students in the class, I have enjoyed reading so many incredible essays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are great professor, great content, life-long lessons that no matter what grade you get is worth it. Every class period is so engaging. There are no weaknesses that I can think of but if you are not willing to put in the dedication and time this course requires, then you won't get much out of it, so don't take it if you are not committed.",
    "Strengths: Extensive feedback (from both peers and professors, and the chance to give feedback to classmates), productive classroom discussions, open-ended but constrained writing assignments (with revision!), close reading of excellent writing. \r\nWeaknesses: College writing tutors are often overbooked, deadlines in afternoon vs early the next morning should perhaps be debated early on in the semester. Class only lasts one semester (I wish it was not over yet).",
    "This course was excellently organized, ENGL 120 is an extremely well structured course that has been honed over the years.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Really great reading material;\r\n- Professor Ehrgood is an amazing teacher;\r\n- Themes for the essays were often challenging, but diverse enough to force us to expand our horizons as writers;\r\n- Seminar discussions were very engaging;\r\n- Workshops were super helpful and fun.\r\n\r\nHow this course could be improved:\r\n- At some points, I felt like I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to have had to work on some revisions of essays earlier on in the term, but as we reached Essays 4 and 5, I felt like I could definitely have been done with them in less time. Maybe in the future some of this extra time that was given for us to work on the last two essays could be reallocated to the first couple of essays.",
    "Prof. Ehrgood was the highlight of the course. He so obviously knew what he was doing and how to talk about writing, and I've never seen a professor dedicate so much of his time to student feedback. Our workshops were also wonderfully structured to facilitate student discussion and encourage honest feedback from the class. Class readings were well paced and assigned, and Ehrgood was kind and flexible with deadlines when needed. Really, the class had no real weaknesses that I can think back to.",
    "very good. a lot of work, pretty worth it though",
    "I thought that the layout fo the course was unique and extremely effective. Having us read essays that correspond to the prompts we would be responding to, digesting them and identifying moves we admire as a class was so helpful while writing the essays, and the workshops, besides being very helpful, were great for class bonding. I genuinely can't think of weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Incredible focus on observing features of a good piece of writing. Well-structured in-class discussions to facilitate learning and observation."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course, especially with Professor Ehrgood. Ehrgood is such a passionate teacher, and his energy really inspires you to do your best. I learned so much from him on how to write more effectively with less fluff and more simplicity.",
    "Before I took this course, everyone I had heard from who had taken this course had told me that it was amazing and was one of the best classes they've taken at Yale. This class is amazing and is the best class I've taken at Yale. Everyone said that their professor was the best. Professor Ehrgood is the best; he's superbly quirky, spends an unbelievable amount of time and energy on each student, and takes the time, on the spot, to show his thought process in progress. I've felt somewhat lukewarm about writing for most of my life, but this class made me experience writing as a creative process, as a path to developing ideas (rather than just writing them down), as an exciting challenge to nurture an idea into something shareable. It was a serious reflection on my life, my values, and my place in the world. Take this class.",
    "If you are a STEM student that probably will consider this class for your two dist. requirements, this class is great for you only if you really care about improving your writing skills. This is not a gut but it is not a terribly difficult class. Looking back as a junior, I think this class is one of those classes that taught me skills I will use throughout my life.",
    "Yes, absolutely, take this class! I learned so much about writing clearly, and more importantly, I enjoyed the class so much! Absolutely take it with Ehrgood if you get the chance.",
    "Yes if they want to improve their writing style .",
    "Without a doubt! English 120 will revolutionize the way you write in ways that you might not have even imagined possible. It opened my eyes to possibilities of style, diction and structure that I had not even considered before, and made me realize precise areas where I could fine-tune my writing to really take it to another level. It is so much fun, too!",
    "Absolutely. To anyone who wants to get back into writing, fall in love with writing for the first time, truly just improve as a writer, or even just to get a WR credit. ENGL 120 has a reputation of being a fantastic course, and this absolutely lived up to my expectations. It goes without saying, you have to take the course with Ehrgood, of all professors as well.",
    "This class was amazing! It focuses less on what we say in favor of how we say it. It's essentially a class devoted to learning about different ways of communicating and developing yiur own unique voice.",
    "one hundred percent. no matter what year you are. our class had a mix of first, second, third, and fourth year students, and everyone contributed (and i hope gained) a lot",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student who enjoys writing. I thought the class was engaging, the essays we read were beautiful and thought-provoking, and Professor Ehrgood is amazing.",
    "Yes! If you enjoy writing about yourself (or would like to learn to write non-fiction), I would highly recommend this class. I, personally, learned a lot about writing non-fiction through close reading and analysis of other great non-fiction writers. More importantly, however, I think this class teaches and encourages you to write about things that you might have only thought about writing before, things that you may hold close to your heart but never dared write down on paper. Take this class :))"
