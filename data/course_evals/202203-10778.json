You need the time to conduct your analysis and your experiments in whatever lab you're working in. This ensures that you can also use this work towards your depth. I wish I had known about this earlier on during Yale, but it worked out well",
                "Yes! Its a perfect fifth credit if youre going to be working in a lab anyways. Prof Knobe is so flexible and chill with approving your proposal, which makes spending time on research really accessible. Your experience will obviously be defined by the lab youre in, but its still great to get credit for it.",
