                "This was an interesting course that allowed me to think differently about politics in America!",
                "I learned a ton about voting behavior in the United States and academic political science. We read studies from the 1950's until now that touched on everything from political participation to persuasion, campaign effects, media effects, political knowledge, etc. Basically a tour de force of all the things that affect why people in America vote, or decide to vote. We also read a ton of academic papers and learned a lot about research design through this. Questions like \"Does canvassing convince people?\" or \"Does Fox News make america more conservative?\" were questions I thought I knew the answer to but the course allowed me to think much deeper about and either be more convinced of what I believed or re-evaluate these beliefs. Just a great class if you like to opine about or want to know more about American elections and why people vote.",
                "Excellent understanding of the American Electorate and what we know about how people vote, why they vote, and what goes into their decisions.",
                "This course increased my fluency in reading and analyzing political science scholarship. I strengthened my skills in critical analysis and questioning the experimental methods and theory of political science journal articles."

                "I think this course's strength is that the material is interesting -- and doesn't really have any major weakness!",
                "Strengths: Very interesting readings that, if you were willing to really engage with them, could teach you a lot. Also, professor Kalla is a very smart and accomplished guy and he guides discussion super well. Kalla also does a great job distilling super weird and hard readings that don't make sense in terms that students can understand. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings are long and inaccessible because they're super academic. Additionally, some topics are really hard to understand and vague in part because they were written in the 1950's. Also, professor Kalla doesn't give a lot of feedback on paper, so if you're looking for someone to really improve your writing or PLSC arguing this class may not be for you. The class is about learning ideas.",
                "Overall this is an excellent course. The one area that would have been interesting to hear about would have been the LGBTQ+ community. The course did a decent job of trying to cover diverse bases of folks in the US both in authorship of research and subjects of research. The one main area missing as far as coverage as subjects of research was the LGBTQ+ community. This may be a reflection of the lack of research in the area overall, but might still be an area to consider adding to the course.",
                "I think that the variety of political science research topics we were exposed to in the assigned readings was good and very interesting. I also appreciated the prompt for the final paper, which was to choose a research question and explore it over time by selecting related articles from each decade since the 1950s. I found this structure insightful and meaningful for a fuller understanding of my research topic. Also, over the course of the semester, the open discussions also made me become more secure and confident in sharing my thoughts and questions.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that the course could benefit from more variety in its class structure. Every class session had the same routine of going through each of the assigned readings and discussing our thoughts on each. I liked when classes seemed to have a central question that the articles and discussion led to (for example, \"What is the point of studying political knowledge?\") which felt like it gave the discussion more purpose and significance."

                "I think this course felt like a normal seminar!",
                "It worked pretty well, Kalla basically just conducts a seminar through zoom.",
                "Excellent use of the features of zoom and a very orderly system used to organize discussions by asking students to raise their hand with the Professor then calling on students in the order they raised their hands. Most importantly to this system was the ability to raise two fingers to the camera in order to respond directly to a point that was recently raised. This helped discussion flow organically, while still keeping things organized and avoiding the awkwardness of talking over each other on zoom.",
                "Again, I think that having a more varied class structure could make the course more engaging, especially in the age of Zoom. I also had a rough relationship with the \"raise hand\" function on Zoom, which was what facilitated most of our class discussions. I know that the raise hand function is an easy way to organize and manage people's sharing, but it sometimes made discussions feel more artificial than when were had a more visual and body language-oriented way of knowing if someone had something they wanted to say next."

If you hate reading academic papers or aren't interested in voting, then no. I will say, the academic paper focus is hard, but very rewarding because you actually know why we believe something is true, as opposed to just being told that people think it is true.",
