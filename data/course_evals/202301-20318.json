                "I thought the course was very well laid out and structured to encourage my learning.",
                "The course could be improved through usage of a different room with different tables. At numerous times we collaborated with neighboring students, but since everyone had their own individual desk it was hard to push tables together and talk. I think teaching in a room with larger tables that students sit around would go a long way in helping the course.",
                "The teaching could be improved and there should be more readily available resources for everyone.",
                "Strengths- Explorations and concept checks \r\nWeakness- lack of accessibility to resources.",
                "psets were only ten percent of the grade which was ridiculous considering how much time i spent on them every week even weeks we had exams. also the teaching was really variable section to section and it was super frustrating to see my friends in other sections having a better time",
                "Strengths were the usefulness of the content it covers. Weaknesses were that it was difficult to understand the first time around.",
                "Strengths: super well organized, the math peer tutor hours are very helpfully placed, lots of resources for midterm and exam preparation, great exam review sessions, transparent resources, transparent grading\/feedback, problem sets are consistent, \"exploration\" assignments which are basically previews of lecture content due the day before are lowkey helpful, office hours are helpful! Weaknesses: teaching varies greatly across sections!! this became very apparent during the review sessions which were hosted by different professors. the content felt rushed during the last few chapters.",
                "Strengths: exams are not too difficult if you attend class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the homework problems were not representative of test questions. They did challenge me to think above and beyond, though."

Despite this, I felt like the class was well-resourced enough that anyone could catch up to speed no matter how rusty their math skills are. The professors (like Meghan and Rachel) are genuinely invested in supporting students, and this interest really shone through!",
