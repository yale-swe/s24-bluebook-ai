Time spent in class felt much less useful, and the amount of English spoken by all individuals was significantly higher than in the first semester. That said, I do have a relative understanding of the grammatical structures covered this semester. The final test felt extremely disconnected from the course content though, and I have a hard time recalling what was covered in the chapter we were supposed to be covering during that period of time."

I felt that the semester could have been significantly improved had she insisted that we use German at all times and followed through in explaining new concepts in German. We used the boards in the room significantly less than in prior semesters and, with the primary medium of presenting content being Google Slides, the wait time was consistently insufficient for students to internalize new content and grammatical structures."
