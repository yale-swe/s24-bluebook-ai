    "How to read short stories critically, how to edit and write short fiction",
    "I learned how to more closely look at what I read for techniques to use in my own writing; I was given the opportunity to freely write what I wanted and not for a specific audience.",
    "I became a better reader. I honed my critical and creative thinking skills while closely examining classic works of short fiction. I became a better writer. Prof Choi gives wonderfully detailed, personalized feedback that I was able to implement over the course of the semester.",
    "I learned so much about different types of fiction writing and different styles, and I think gained a lot of tools I can use in the future.",
    "Through the many exercises we wrote in the course, I felt that I became more acquainted with the practice of creative writing. I felt more confident in my ability to generate new material and revise it. I also was able to garner insight into the art of writing short stories by reading many excellent works that Prof. Choi selected.",
    "My writing skills grew tremendously.",
    "I learned about how to write fiction. I think it made me a more creative writer."

   "comments": [
    "Not a lot of feedback from peers, but readings\/assignments super interesting. Could be more in-class writing",
    "strengths-\r\nweekly writing assignments; customized feedback; small class size; seminar style class structure\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-\r\ni really liked when we did in class workshops on pieces and wouldve liked to see that more and less weekly readings. I found the weekly reading discussions valuable only when we talked about the techniques or style that a writer used, but oftentimes, we weren't necessarily discussing those things.",
    "No weaknesses! Prof Choi is wonderful. Perfect amount of reading, discussion, workshopping, in-class writing. Wonderfully balanced and enriching.",
    "The strengths were definitely the instructor. Susan Choi is absolutely amazing. The weakness would probably be that I think we could have done more whole class workshops. I think that would be particularly educational to hear what other people have to say about certain pieces of work that a student wrote.",
    "Strengths: Reading assignments, writing exercises, Prof. Choi and her feedback\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more assignments or we met more regularly.",
    "I loved this course! It was fun, engaging, and also a great learning experience."

    "Yes! It's so good",
    "This course is amazing for someone who is interested in writing but not quite sure about how form or technique fits into your writing; this class has weekly assignments that are manageable and conducive to practicing different strategies and trying out new writing styles, which is perfect for a budding writer coming into his or her style.",
    "Yes! It's a great and low-stakes way to have some structure for trying out, or continuing to write, fiction.",
    "100%! Especially with Prof Choi. Really special to have this kind of detailed, personalized feedback.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class was so engaging, but also wasn't stressful which was perfect. I feel like I learned so much without being stressed.",
    "Yes! Susan Choi is an amazing instructor and our readings for class are really varied and compelling.",
    "Yes! Prof. Choi is a great teacher to guide students through the beginning hurdles to writing fiction, and she also does a great job of encouraging students to write more material that they thought previously possible.",
    "This class was amazing. Susan Choi was a wonderful professor, and the writing assignments really helped strengthen my writing skills.",
    "Yes! I think anyone would benefit from taking a fiction class. It makes you think differently about all your writing and it was also a really fun experience."
