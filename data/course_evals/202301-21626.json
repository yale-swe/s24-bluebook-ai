                "the readings were well chosen and the class was graded to encourage learning through participation and self-reflection",
                "Strengths: retreat for students early on in the semester, relevance to personal life, seminar format, weekly lectures with interesting guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: TFs are very different and which one you get determines the trajectory of your entire experience; a week is spent on each tradition/ religion, and it's hard to talk about them without reductionist approaches",
                "Strengths: retreat, plenary section offered interesting guest speakers and getting to connect the course beyond Yale, papers were geared towards our lives and felt like a class that was really connected to who we are as people\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because the readings generally only covered the traditions' creation stories and then one other ritual, did not leave with the general knowledge on the different groups that I would have liked. Quickly became a compare and contrast between traditions and we lacked the background knowledge to constructively discuss areas in which people felt inclined to disagree with a tradition's practice. Students were placed in a position where they were either being the spokesperson of their faith or talking generally about religions that they do not have a good grasp on. Who your TF is really matters.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be a lot stronger if, instead of comparing and contrasting different traditions we looked at areas of disagreement within the traditions themselves to see how they are thinking about themselves. Only with one tradition was there any recognition that there is quite the range within faiths in how they are practiced and that they change over time. I think it would be more productive to consider this side of growth and variety rather than placing the faiths against each other / raising issues with traditions without enough background information to understand it fully. Maybe this means moving plenary to the start of the week so every section has the same background information.",
                "the seminar had a very open, judgement free environment that made it really easy to discuss difficult topics. the course in general was strong in almost all regards. i love the retreat\r\n\r\nthe only thing i would add is that it would be more helpful to have sometimes more direction in our seminar discussions to keep on track",
                "Strengths: Discussion-forward structure is fantastic, plenarys are great\r\nWeaknesses: It feels like half of the content is big picture life worth living content that I'm here for, but certain readings (oscar wilde, the thing about eating meat, prayer mechanics) seemed more circumstantial than actually important.\r\n\r\nI feel like I learned a lot yet still somehwat unsatiesfied",
                "Strength is the care the teachers have for the students. Also the class is extremely organized I have never had course coordinators know their way around Canvas like these professors. It made life so much easier.",
                "Amazing instructor and interesting content",
                "Strengths: Really amazing readings, Connie was a great instructor, guest lectures were fascinating!\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there were more guest lectures, wish there was some sort of final \"book\" that contains the writings of the entire class! Would have loved to read the essays of students in the course but not in my section."

                "I would recommend this if you want a class that will make you reflect on what makes a life worth living according to Yale, your peers, and yourself. The rubrics are pretty rigid and make you elaborate on those visions within their framework that has three parts of a good life: going well, feeling good, and led well. \r\nHowever, if you are taking this course to learn more about different world religions, then I would say take a different one instead. The syllabus is very ambitious with what topics are covered, and I ended up with a very superficial knowledge of many religions.",
                "No: I was really disappointed by this course. I had gone in really excited to learn about different traditions and new ways to think about living but I feel like I've left with very little new knowledge and just about the same vision I entered the course with. I do think it really matters who your TF is. I know people who took the first year seminar version and enjoyed it. The readings were also unnecessarily long.",
