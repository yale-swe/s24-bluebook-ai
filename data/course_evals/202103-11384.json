                "This was my first film class so most of the approaches and theories behind film were new to me. It was great to be introduced to the field of film through black studies! There is really some amazing, interesting work out there that this class exposed me to and showed me how I can engage with it in the future.",
                "Learned about different historical eras of Black filmmaking in the US (ex. Blaxploitation, LA Rebellion, etc.) alongside selected and exemplifying films from each. In addition to developing my skill at making cinematography-based analysis of film, also developed the ability to engage in film criticism through a wide variety of lenses and perspectives, and am able to name how each mode of analysis manifested in the critical and audience reception to each of the films viewed for class. Engaged with so many different theories of Blackness, Black cultural production and Black artmaking and applied them to the films we viewed for class and to other forms of art. Developed the \"observation into argument\" style of essay writing when writing about films for the class, and as a result I'm now better able to pinpoint and articulate what makes me love my favorite Black films and other Black art!",
                "I look at film in a completely different way now, it's crazy. You learn shot technique, timing, spacial awareness, close-ups, color, tone, mood, score, writing, pauses -- everything. You also get brilliant writers writing brilliant articles about brilliant movies -- what's not to love?"

                "I loved the syllabus. I think class discussions sometimes were taken over by a few people but generally flowed better as the class went on.",
                "Assignment format and distribution were absolutely immaculate, blog posts are a wonderful way to engage with and develop the ideas kicking around in my head after watching the films, doing the readings, and engaging in class discussions. The course gives you a lot to think about, so having this writing outlet, without the pressure of making each blog post into a perfect essay (Professor Forster encourages the blog posts to more experimental and freeform in nature than an essay, for example) is essential in my opinion. Also a great way to brainstorm ideas for the short essays and final paper if you're someone who gets stressed about having to do all the work for those at once!\r\n\r\nThe 3 short essays are a great way to let students bring in the Black films they're most interested in into discussion with all the interesting criticism and theory we read throughout the semester. Even if the films on the syllabus are ones they wouldn't engage with otherwise, having to write about 3 Black films of our own choosing really shows how relevant course content is regardless. And it was pretty fun to write about how some of the Black films I'm most interested in related to the ideas of the course. Professor Forster also said it was okay if one or more of the short essays formed a basis for the final paper, so I ended up expanding one of mine for the final paper which made my finals period that much less stressful!\r\n\r\nUngraded short worksheets at the start of each class were a great way to prepare for discussions and start thinking before class started. Sometimes he collected the worksheets right when class started, but I would've liked to be able to keep mine so I could see and remember what I wrote.\r\n\r\nStudent presentations were a lovely way to let us lead the discussion in each class meeting, though as the class went on the \"pre-presentation\" discussion agenda tended to get larger and larger, pushing many of the presentations into the latter half of the class, so it sometimes felt like the class didn't have as much time to discuss the ideas in each presentation as much as we would've liked. However, I think Forster noticed this too, and toward the end of the course got into the habit of taking at least one discussion from each presentation and including it on the worksheet for the following class!\r\n\r\nProfessor Forster also gives wonderful midterm feedback on the papers, blog posts, and discussion contributions made so far, so you do have an idea of how you're doing throughout the course.",
                "strengths: the movies we watched have changed my life, and some of them are completely inaccessible outside of yale/this class. I learned how to screenwrite a little -- not that we spent any time on that particularly, just that I think everyone learns what they like to see on screen over the course of this class and I chose to try my hand at it for my final. I think this class also teaches you how to talk about movies beyond the simple words \"bad\" and \"good.\" transcending the moral judgement of it all and focusing on the message, the absences, the politics, the religion, the attitudes -- that matters WAY more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like I couldn't get a grip on what Prof Forster was looking for in a paper until our final paper, so my grade for this class might be shit lol. He's nice and smart, but I wondered sometimes if he was struggling and didn't want to talk about it? The curriculum was great, the people in the class were great, the homework was great -- I just wish I knew more exactly what he wanted from me as a student other than what I was doing. But he's incredibly intelligent and self-aware on the topic of black film, and I really admire the way he positions himself as a white instructor in that kind of setting.",
                "I think while his selection of movies was interesting, Professor Forster's opinions and stubborness were detrimental to the course. I also do not understand why an African-American studies class would be taught by a White man, he was very out of touch with the impact of his words and was generally disrespectful at times."

                "I would definitely recommend this course as an intro to film in general and cinematic thinking. Forster is a deeply passionate teacher who works hard in the classroom and outside of it to make sure that his students get all that they want to out of the course.",
                "Yes! Yes! Yes! Despite being a STEM major, AFAM 246 was one of the highlights of my educational experience at Yale. A great class with some great films and a great professor.",
                "Absolutely yes! If you have any interest in Black artmaking, even if you aren't particularly intrested in film, please take this course! You'll learn so much that you can take with you into your studies elsewhere. If Professor Forster is teaching his Black Film and Theatre course at the same time, I also highly recommend taking both of those courses at once! They might be the most iconic and insightful double-bill at Yale, and the connections between the two courses are so exciting!",
                "Not really  theres a lot (a LOT) of busy work in the assignments that makes the class far more tedious than it needs to be. Many of the smaller writing assignments could be collapsed into bigger, less frequent projects or papers, like with most Yale courses. If anything this made the course feel more toilsome than it did helpful. Cant say Id take the class again if I could turn back time. There are writing assignments that feel like theyre made to help you engage with the material, and then there are writing assignments that feel like theyre just there for the sake of the grade  this course felt like a lot of the latter.",
                "I absolutely would. Great Professor and rich subject matter.",
