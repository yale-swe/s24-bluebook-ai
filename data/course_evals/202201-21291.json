            "comments": [
                "Strengths: fantastic and well-thought-out lectures. psets were very helpful for understanding the materials. lots of OH opportunities. clear efforts to make an inclusive learning environment. The grading scheme allowed for focus on learning the content and key themes in a collaborative fashion rather than building a competitive and toxic environment. This is the perfect Yale course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This could be a weakness, depending on the type of student (read: premed) you are: it's pretty challenging conceptually. That said, I never felt stressed about this class due to the generous grading scheme.",
                "The lectures were very well taught and encouraged student engagement. Materials were easily available on canvas site too, lots of good lecture slides and practice material for every exam. Lectures can be very dense though and information is moved through quickly.",
                "A strength of this course is the peer tutor office hours on Wednesday. This course however contains way too much information to learn and memorize in the time provided. I would recommend cutting back on the material and focusing on the applications of the material during class to better reflect the skills tested on the exam. I appreciate the professors willingness to listen to students, however there is a long way to go to make this class equitable for students who are not white, male, straight, high income, and with a previous strong background in science and biochemistry.",
                "Great class but a lot of work.",
                "Strengths:\r\nIncredible learning environment, especially for a premed class. A LOT of resources to help you succeed, great peer tutors and TAs and extremely kind professors who wanted you to feel supported.\r\nVery interesting course materials - loved the lectures of bacteriophage lambda, oncogenes and DNA damage repair especially\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes we completely rushed over material in slides for certain lectures on eukaryotic genome, ribosome as ribozyme etc \r\nQuizzes were great but we often spent way too long on them and had to rush over them. I'd often prefer the professors give us less time to aimlessly discuss and spend more time guiding us through them as a class.",
                "Strengths: It was clear that the professors put a lot of effort into this class. They led review sessions and they prepared presentations for every class. They were organized and they tried. \r\nWeaknesses: Although the professors clearly put effort into the class, I unfortunately found the teaching in this course to be the worst I have ever experienced at Yale. I think the professors had to speak up, to speak more clearly, and to use slideshows that were less dense. The material on their presentations was incredibly dense, with tons of random questions everywhere, and a lot of the \"introductory\" slides (introducing a new topic) were based on long complex experiments that were nearly impossible for anyone to understand. I think the material covered could've easily been presented in a much more understandable way if the professors were just more direct and more clear. The exams required a ton of memorization, as is unfortunately the case in too many biology courses. I found myself sitting down before the exam and just cramming information into my brain, forcing myself to remember the names of certain oncogenes and antibiotics. The exams were very specific, to the point where I felt like our memorization capacities were being tested rather than our understanding of the material. Frankly, there was no sense of excitement or passion in this course. It was just about getting through material, getting through slides, memorizing facts, taking an exam, then repeat.",
                "The strengths of this course are the emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments related to the lecture content, both on problem sets and exams. The weaknesses are the enormous amount of lecture content, which was often covered faster than students could write it down or process it, resulting in myself and others I spoke with having to review the recordings/slides for parts of many lectures to teach ourselves the material. There was also a huge amount of memorization required for the course: while I realize that some of this is necessary for the discipline, it felt that much of the lecture content consisted of minor details which didn't end up being covered on exams but which students had to memorize just in case. Because of this, perhaps cutting out some of the less important details would allow for students to learn at a better pace in class and to focus their studying on the scientific reasoning which is ultimately the most relevant takeaway from the course.",
                "The tests were very hard and didnt seem to cover what was highlighted during lecture, maybe because there was so much content and so many details to be memorized. Strength: class lectures and review sessions were recorded and available online.",
                "Strength was the lack of a curve and increased collaboration, also lenient cutoffs.",
                "Lectures were very difficult to understand and disorganized. Often unclear what major takeaways were.",
                "strengths: good class engagement, teaching\r\n\r\nweakness: longer office hours!! please make one or two long sessions rather than 4. secondly, way too much memorization.",
                "I think the course is very well taught. There's a lot of interesting information from a wide range of topics. But I do think you are kind of at a disadvantage if you are not in a lab or do not have lab experience. I think it would be helpful to have some sort of supplemental class or section for people who need extra help because they just don't have the exposure that their peers have had. I really think I understood the material but just did not have the time to cultivate the application skills many of my peers had. I also think more continuity in format between MB&B 300 and 301 would be helpful in helping students adjust to the difference in material/teaching style. More resources earlier in the course are always good.",
                "Many of the concepts in this course are presented through the lens of experimental data and results. I find this approach particularly effective as it anchors potentially ambiguous/nebulous concepts in data that we can see and interpret for ourselves. By learning why certain experimental results appear, we gain a better understanding of the concept in question. This is why the quizzes built into each lecture were so helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PSETs and exams were very well written, and the study guides/term lists provided before each exam were invaluable (please keep doing this for your future students!). Overall, the course was well-organized, and our professors were excellent lecturers. The teaching team was accessible, and I felt highly supported as a student. \r\n\r\nThis was one of the best courses I have taken in all my time at Yale!",
                "Lectures get packed and dense at time. Having more guidance on what concepts to prioritize learning during the middle of the term. The professors were a major strength. They were super welcoming and clearly cared about the students.",
                "The slideshows were sometimes confusing, and the lecture recordings were very difficult to understand.",
                "I am an MB&B major, so I was expecting to find this class's content interesting, and it did not disappoint. I particularly enjoyed the contextualization of each fact we learned both within the history of science and with structural information, where that information existed. The exposure to original experimental modalities, the focus on interpreting data, and the story of science as discoveries made by individual scientists allowed me to connect the abstract ideas we were learning to the work I have seen going on in active labs. However, the lectures themselves were not so interesting. Between the professors' tendency to read the slides with almost no additional commentary, the huge amount of information on those slides, and the extent to which literally any of that information could form the basis of a question on an exam, the best way to learn the content was not to attend lecture at all, but instead to sit down and memorize every concept one by one, slide deck by slide deck. This strategy proved especially effective when it was announced, five minutes before the final exam began, that the final was worth not 35% of the grade, as listed on the syllabus, but instead 50% or 100%, whichever was higher, making all other work in the class almost completely irrelevant.",
                "strengths: I think the professors listened to class feedback and implemented it \r\n\r\nweakness: I found MBB 300 to be better structured in comparison to this class. I feel like less information could of been presented on the slides. I think having a study guide like in 300 would be beneficial for students so that they have idea of what is important. I dont really think the final exam was fair in terms of difficulty. I think this class would benefit from a having 3 exams and dropping one of them just because there is so much information. I also think the professors should have a mic because sometimes it was very hard to understand what was being said.",
                "Strengths: professors are kind and supportive\r\nWeakness: too much covered in lecture",
                "I think the TAs werent as helpful as other classes. They either taught us too much irrelevant material, or didnt go into the course content detailed enough for it to help us. I think it wouldve been more helpful if they actually ran recitations at section, where they go over the material taught in the lecture, instead of just sitting there and taking questions. The professors can do that.",
                "The course encourages engagement with biochemistry on a level beyond simply memorization (although there is a factor of that).",
                "I think this class is an exceptional biochemistry course. I felt that the professors genuinely cared about their students as well made sure to listen to our concerns as much as they could. The only thing that I would change would be the pace of the lectures. I felt that we often rushed through some material such as the CRISPR/Cas 9 material. I think devoting less time to questions and discussions during lectures could help with this.",
                "This course is overall well taught between professors. I feel that more could be done to make course assessments feel more fair. Oftentimes, the actual exam would have little resemblance to the practice tests, and the material tested was not clearly communicated to us. Instructors would emphasize that there is not much emphasis on memorization and more emphasis on conceptual understanding, but this was often not true on exams. Exams would ask questions that do require memorization. Particularly on the second midterm and final, I felt like expectations were not clearly communicated. I think this course would benefit from more clear communication about what is important for exams."

This course covers so much fascinating material, and students develop valuable skills in analyzing experimental data and communicating those conclusions to others. The lecturers are excellent, and the course environment is warm and welcoming. If you have the space for two semesters of biochem, I HIGHLY recommend this course.",

But barring this prepossessed knowledge, it will prove extremely difficult to have a good time as fact after fact is added to the list of required topics. However, any biologist who wants to add a structural knowledge base is probably already an MB&B major, and must take the class. Thus, I struggle to imagine a scenario where I would recommend it to someone not already in it.",
