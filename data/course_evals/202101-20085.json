                "I really didn't like being fully remote and just watching people do experiments in Module 1; although professor was nice, we were basically staring at a screen the whole time. Module 2 was really nice in that we worked together to do the lab and code; I thought some parts were a bit repetitive, but I liked being able to apply machine learning & report content was fair. In module 3, I loved being able to do in-person work, even if it was only for 1\/4 weeks, and it was much better than all going in at once and doing experiments.",
                "The course did a great job of transitioning to a remote-friendly format. With the ability to have one team member in person and the rest virtual, we were still able to collaborate while completing the experiments.",
                "Strengths: In-person component for Module 3! In a semester that was entirely remote, it was nice to be able to come into the lab and create nanoparticles. Module 3 was the most enjoyable module personally, for this reason.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Why does BME use so much MATLAB? There was literally an entire module dedicated to MATLAB. That's just something you'll have to deal with though. Also, Module 1 was very passive, as we were watching a bad-quality movie of experiments most of the time, and sometimes they were hard to follow. Luckily, a lot of background information was provided in order to help us better understand the logistics of it.",
                "the virtual lab in groups was great as we were able to follow the student in the lab and contribute to what was being done.",
                "Strength: The material from Module 1, 2, and 3 are very interesting and applicable. I liked the short form format of module #2. \r\nWeakness: The lab report instructions could be improved by being more specific and either allow a larger page limit or reduce the amount of written requirements to fit the 8 page limit. It was difficult to see (through Zoom) what was happening in Module 1 due to poor camera and audio quality.",
                "This class was very difficult over zoom and not engaging.",
                "The style of teaching and the format of the three module is very different. For the first module, the assignment was supposed to be a 8 page lab report, but everyone ended up with around 30 pages because of the amount of images we needed to include. We also did not receive the grade for the first lab report until the completion of module 2."

                "In the NMR module, we mainly had to watch the professor on Zoom complete the experiment with the help of two students (due to space restrictions). The professor kept it very engaging and helped explain what was happening at each step. In the image analysis module, the work was completed in MATLAB, so screen share and breakout rooms in Zoom made that module easily adaptable to the virtual format. In the biomaterial-cell interactions module, one lab member went in at a time while the rest were virtual on zoom, so we were still able to collaborate.",
                "In-person component for Module 3 was great! I was lucky in that I ended up going into the lab three times, so I feel I gained a very thorough understanding of the lab material compared to if I had just been remote the whole time. \r\n\r\nModule 2 was nice in that it reaffirmed that in order to free up space in the in-person lab, maybe an entirely MATLAB-based experiment can be done remotely.\r\n\r\nModule 1 needed drastic improvement to optimize the course for remote learning. The computers in the TAC NMR lab were very old and did not have zoom, so we could not see anything on the screens clearly. New computer installation would be very beneficial.",
                "It was hard to contribute to the lab remotely (particularly for the nanoparticle lab). Normally the camera is pointed in some weird direction and so you can't really partake in the lab. I think this hindered my learning. I wish members of a lab group could have all been there at the same time so we could all learn the techniques.",
