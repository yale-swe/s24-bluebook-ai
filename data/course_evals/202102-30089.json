The reserved films and articles were rich. The topics of the lectures cover a wide range.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I hope there could be more sports in developing countries or fewer popular sports. It was a little pity that we didn't have access to a deeper discussion of these sports although some of these sports were taken into students' presentations.",
