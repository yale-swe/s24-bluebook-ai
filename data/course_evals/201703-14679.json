    "This course exposed me a lot to various contemporary artists that I had not heard before, as well as films that I had been meaning to see but had never seen. I also learned a lot about film technique through talking about the various films and learning how to use the tracking dolly, even though the class isn't necessarily about learning technique."

    "The best part of the class was hearing other students presenting on the material of the class and seeing them fold their own work into the presentations. It would be great if more of the classes had presentations by students and Corey himself, with the first half being presentation and second half being film screening."
