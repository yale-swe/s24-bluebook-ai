                "It's a very chill class and the professor is so smart, nice, and interested in what he's teaching. I like that I am exposed to a lot of music that I would not have otherwise heard or thought too much about",
                "Strengths: the concepts are clearly illustrated through numerous listening examples in class, then directly applied in assignments. Nate is very knowledgeable of what he's talking about, but he's simultaneously open to many interpretations as long as you have a reason for why you hear something that way. You get to do all assignments, especially the final project, on songs you like, which makes for good motivation. Weaknesses: each student mostly sticks to analyzing their own songs. I think more discussion could be encouraged, especially since it would be a good opportunity for people to talk about music they wouldn't usually listen to.",
                "I liked how Professor Adam structured almost every lecture around example songs. It worked a lot better than introducing a concept and then playing an example, because we could hear what was happening first and then have it explained. I don't really know how the class could be improved. I think it was super effective and straightforward.",
                "The weakness of the course is that often the strength of your ear can limit your ability to follow along. The strengths is that your ear will improve and also its engaging to listen to the song choices of Professor Adams."

                "Yes best class at Yale. Such a fun course!! So easy and you're listening to pop music by choice every day anyway. The assignments are literally counting measures, transcribing a few measures of melody, and stuff you already know how to do. But then you get to talk about your favorite songs and listen to Professor Adam talk about pop music. If you are really music-y then you'll like this class because Professor Adam is really smart and will argue with you about your music theory and analysis which is fun. If you are taking this for gut then you'll like this class too because Professor Adam is chill. Yes, this class is capped and you might not get in, but the best things in life are that way. If everyone had the good thing, would it still be good? If a song is forte without any piano, does it have any forte at all? If a song is syncopated with no sense of downbeat, is it really syncopated?",
                "Yes; love the music classes here.",
                "Yes. If you're interested in music theory or love pop music.",
                "Yes! You gain a lot of insight into the music you listen to every day, as well as songs that other people here enjoy. It's an awesome 5th class to keep you sane if you have an otherwise heavy workload :)",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in music at all. You learn a variety of interesting basic concepts, and are able to pull from whatever examples you choose to analyze.",
                "I have already recommended this class to a few of my friends who play music. Beyond stretching my understanding of music theory, it also introduced me to a lot of very cool songs, genres, and artists!",
                "100% yes. Beware if you dont have the strongest ear for relative pitches and chord progressions, because a lot of the class is spent trying to identify patterns with them. Professor Adams has an incredible understanding of how to analyze pop music. His intuition with how to convert classical theory into this medium feels singular. Unfortunately, it is a challenge to teach his deep intuition and a lot of the class is spent trying his best to illustrate it. The good thing about this class is that if you dont get it all, or dont hear it all, its not a class that will drown you in work or be that much less fun( youre just listening to great music in class after all). At the very least, you will find some great songs for your playlist. But most everyone will improve their music analysis in a way that is practical and non pretentious."
