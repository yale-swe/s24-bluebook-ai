                "This was an incredibly engaging and eye opening course; I'm incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to take this course as it helped me figure out how I should approach my education here at Yale.",
                "This course didn't bring me to an answer that I fully understand, but more of made me ask questions about what do I want from my Yale education and whether what I want is even worth wanting.",
                "The main skill I've developed is to ask questions and question my own decisions through introspections.",
                "This class really taught me to search deep within myself and reflect on some of the long-held values I held coming here. More importantly, it taught me to apply insights from various philosophers to my own life. Alongside a LOT of self-reflection, I also developed my text analysis skills. I've become better equipped at synthesizing the main idea\/arguments of texts.",
                "Wow, this class was fascinating!! Hard to really summarize what I learned in this course because it's so broad and deep at the same time- what matters to me in life, what my sense of purpose is, how to cultivate a happy life, etc. These aren't things that you can list and quantify, but they are invaluable. I think it's a very personal journey for each student.",

                "I loved the discussions we had in class, I thought they were really productive even in the altered format with Zoom and everything. I think the only issue I had was how long it took to get our papers back.",
                "Strengths: Small class size where we became relatively close even with the pandemic, the professor seemed more than only knowledgeable about the information we learned about (he knew everything inside and out). Completely understanding of needed extensions. The conversations you have with you peers not only teaches you about them, but about yourself. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading at time were long and did not feel like they added to our understanding of what the course was meant to help us understand. A lot of the course is devoted to the ancient ways of what defined a life worth living and little time devoted to modern day views",
                "Strengths: course is well-organized, Matt is a blast, office hours are plentiful and easily accessible (as is Matt), readings are not long ~40 pages\/week\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: slow grading, discussions can sometimes center around text analysis than application to our own life, harder to really discuss when online bc a little awkward",
                "I think this course was very strong in general!! I often wished that I had this course three days a week instead of just two. Matt is great and so is the discussion format. There is flexibility that allows students to explore what they find most compelling. Maybe one place of improvement would be with the Christianity readings? I know that Christianity is the tradition Matt is most familiar with and subscribes to, but at least for me, I often didn't know some of the \"basics\" that are assumed in the readings. Additionally, the Christianity readings were also generally drier and harder to get through (with the exception of William James Jennings and some of Augustine).",
                "Strengths: This course encourages you to think deeply about your life through the lenses of ancient traditions that have affected our current culture and the way we see the world. Everything we talked about in this class is super relevant to my life and choices we all make in college.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that just as a breakout room was getting to the productive part of the discussion, we would change discussion topics. We do go through rich material pretty quickly, I do feel we could have done with some more time on the modern authors (the last unit of this course).",
                "This course is my absolute favorite, and I can tell it will be one of my favorites beyond my freshman year. This class pushes you to think critically about what you hope to accomplish during your college years and beyond, as well as what kind of person you hope to become. This class completely changed my perspective about success and college for the better. No weaknesses at all.",
                "Lots of discussion and breakout rooms which fostered rich discussions with classmates. I wish the writing prompts were a bit more specific.",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging, Matt offers great insights and prompts us to think critically about what exactly we want from our own individual education experiences\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: May benefit from more time to discuss ideas before moving into the next, timely feedback on assignments"

                "I think the breakout room discussions that we had were actually pretty effective; we were able to connect with each other even though we weren't able to physically be in the same room. I honestly really enjoyed the online format especially with the running online chalkboard of notes because I was able to reference them throughout the semester.",
                "I personally hate breakout rooms, but I felt like this course used the in a way that didn't make me want to cry. It didn't feel like we were thrown into a breakout room so the professor could have free time away from seeing our faces, but like there was a purpose to the breakout rooms.",
                "The utilization of the break-out rooms and the shared google docs really improved the experience a lot, but it is still a shame that the discussion was conducted virtually.",
                "It's really hard with a pandemic since I think this course is probably best in person. I think we still found ways of cultivating relationships and deep discussions, but it's a lot harder over zoom. I really wish we were able to spend more time in full-group discussions instead of so many breakout rooms. I think the \"chalkboard\" document did work well though.",
                "I thought the virtual seminars were very well structured given the circumstances. I think the breakout-rooms were a super good way to facilitate discussion because large group discussion over zoom is just too awkward. I think more time is needed in breakout rooms to have good discussion than in person because it is a little awkward at first. I think there should be less breakout rooms with more time spent in each one.",

I'm really glad I had the opportunity to take this course during my first semester.",

You will learn a lot about how to think about the big questions and how different cultures have shaped the way you think. Everyone should apply for this course!",
                "YES! 100%! Do take this class. This class completely changed the way I view myself, my education and society. The final reflection paper was so fun to write and now I have a better understanding of what I hope to achieve in the next four years at Yale.",
