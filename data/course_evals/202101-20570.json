                "some ULA's didn't know what they were doing \r\n\r\ndeeper engagement with the maths of the material would be great",
                "The course is pretty practical-- we learned the general concepts behind analysis techniques, but mostly focused on applying them to datasets.",
                "I would recommend any of JDRS's courses; although the material could very easily become challenging, the immense amount of resources and structure make the class very manageable, in and out of COVID.",
                "The only weakness of this course was that the lectures were not always posted on time.  Otherwise, it was really a great class.  You learn a ton of cool and unique statistical techniques, the problem sets and assignments are fun and very fair,  and JDRS's lectures are great.",
                "Strengths: lectures were well-organized, and lectures slides were helpful for independent studying of the material. I also really liked the group learning environment; working on the homework assignments and final project together helped me strengthen my teamwork skills!",
                "I really enjoyed the example-driven teaching in the class and JDRS was a super engaging lecturer who also provided a solid theoretical background for those who really wanted it. I do tend to prefer live lectures to recorded ones just in terms of keeping me engaged, but I did appreciate the convenience of recordings. The biggest weakness of the course was definitely the fact lectures were sometimes released late in bunches, which definitely made it more difficult to keep up with the class and really get the most I could out of the lectures.",
                "Strengths - The topics covered in this class are phenomenal and will be of use to anybody who needs to do data analysis in any discipline. JDRS does a phenomenal job of explaining the theoretical groundwork without getting too far into it and also a wonderful job of showing you real-world examples that involve these techniques. He is the only professor I've ever had who assumes no theoretical background - he spent the time first week explaining linear algebra basics. This course is truly low stress and well-organized for learning, a rare combination.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - You get out of this class what you put into it. Because there are no exams and the psets are all group projects, it is quite possible to get thru this class without learning much (be careful with who's in your group thought). Also, lectures were not posted on a consistent schedule; sometimes they'd be posted a week after the actual lecture date, making it difficult to stay on track.",
                "I think that this course is well designed to teach new multivariate techniques in slides and notes during lectures to learn more about them and balanced by practicing said methods during lectures as well. There are plenty of examples to work through each method to understand them and how to code them in a variety of languages. I'm also happy with the amount of office hours offered by ULAs and the professor. Even though this course was asynchronous, we were offered lots of support. I think it was distracting the couple times that lectures were posted late but other than that the schedule was pretty consistent.",
                "Strength: all lectures are pre recorded, and the entire class is run asynchronously. Perfect Covid edition class! All assignments (p sets and final project) were done in groups, so I recommend taking the course with friends you already know.\r\n\r\nWeakness: At times, I felt pretty disconnected to the class because the entire class is run asynchronously and you only go to OH when you need help with assignments. Taking the class with some friends help, but still I at times felt very stuck because the class content is not gutty at all.",
                "I definitely enjoyed the topics covered in this course, and if you actually engage in the material, I think it can be really rewarding. I also love JDRS' style of teaching, and even though the lectures were recorded, he still makes a concerted effort to keep his students engaged. Workload is also relaxed, which is nice if you're taking a few other time-consuming classes. All in all, a great, chill class with no real weaknesses!",
                "Professor Reuning-Scherer was usually delayed in uploading the lectures ahead of the scheduled class times. This really messed up my weekly schedule of lectures. Also, many of the lectures felt rushed likely because Professor Reuning-Scherer was so delayed in completing them.",
                "Strengths: very chill, group-based work. set-up of the problem sets made it so that our final project was simple if we did the problem sets. \r\nweakness: virtual setting made it difficult to stay engaged in the class",
                "Strength: Because the classes were asynchronous, you didn't have to \"show up\" to class. For the psets, you have to option to work in group which is a huge help in terms of accountability. The final report is essentially a compilation of your psets in a coherent form if you choose to use your own pset. Overall, if your goal is to get an A  you will get it. If you want to learn, you will also get it. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The last month was rough  a pset due every week seems reasonable until you realize how much work it is.",
                "Interesting how we had a data set where we tried out multiple multivariate methods on it throughout the class. Professor is good and class is interesting.  Asynchronous nature of lectures made the course sometimes not as engaging.",
                "Strengths - A large overview of multivariate statistical techniques.\r\nWeaknesses - It was hard to keep up with the course when lectures weren't posted at the appropriate times. (Although this wouldn't probably happen when classes are in-person).",
                "A very chill class, no real weaknesses",
                "Strengths: JDRS. He's such a funny and engaging lecturer, and he is able to explain complex subjects in a digestible way.\r\nWeaknesses: the last few topics felt a bit rushed",
                "strengths: really well organized, plenty of office hours, lots of reference material and examples, content is well explained and interesting\r\nweaknesses: honestly none",
                "Professor JRS was SUCH an engaging lecturer! The pace he taught at was also perfect. I came in with a rudimentary understanding of multivariate stats and did not find it super difficult to follow.",
                "Strengths: learn a lot of statistical methods, group work model is really nice , very low stress\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 0 effort to make the course engaging, TFs were straight up bad and could not answer our questions, little incentive to learn the material thoroughly because there are no exams and the class is all groupwork",
                "The homework assignments based on a dataset of our own choice were all very helpful and helped me learn a lot about the statistical techniques.",
                "The recorded lectures allowed me to pause and go back to really grasp concepts before moving on - I liked it better than in-person lectures.",
                "great class, and worked especially well during the pandemic given that it was asynchronous.",
                "Strengths: Skills acquired in this class are applicable and different from the machine learning techniques you learn in other courses. Thus, it gives you a unique toolkit as an S&DS major/student. Also, JDRS' familiarity with recorded lectures was great for adapting to the virtual learning environment. Assignments are meaningful and interesting because you are using our own dataset in all analysis. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because lectures are not live, there was no incentive to get to know others in the class.",
                "Strengths: JDRS. Weaknesses: All of the TA's were poorly equipped, except the Lead TA's, who were AMAZING.",
                "Very nicely structured class and JDRS is amazing. I wish the lectures were live, because it was hard to keep up with the class at my own pace.",
                "Strengths: The material we covered represents common multivariate techniques. I encountered them in passing in other classes this semester (in journal articles we read), and it was great to have a basic understanding of how they are used, when they should be applied, etc. There's no other class that provides such a great look at this information!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a couple times in the semester where JDRS got behind in posting lectures (at one point, I think we were 1.5-2 weeks without the lectures) and students needed to play catch up and make up that time because assignment due dates were only shifted slightly. I think expectations could have been defined a little more clearly as well (the quiz due dates, etc.). There were many logistical items that were only answered once a student brought them up on Ed, the virtual discussion platform for the class. I think the feedback on homework assignments could be improved. Usually it just showed where points were taken off in the rubric, but usually didn't provide comments on which part of that rubric section needed improvement. It was a bit challenging to collaborate with group members on assignments in R. I feel like the work and learning didn't get split evenly among us, partially due to this challenge.",
                "This was a low-key course: not too difficult or demanding, with plenty of flexibility. I actually wish some of the assignments had been a bit more challenging.  I failed to earn less than full marks on any assignment, many of which were doable simply by copying code that had been generated by JDRS in class. While I appreciate that, I also felt that I wasn't fully exercising my scholarly muscles on most assignments. The flexibility is great and the techniques taught definitely seem like they will be useful, especially for people working in data-related careers. But the course was not much of a challenge. I wish it more heavily emphasized the mathematical background of the fundamental concepts and techniques, because I think this foundation may be helpful in future implementation of these methods.\r\n\r\nThe course would certainly be improved if JDRS was better about posting recorded lectures on time.  There were multiple points where the Canvas site was missing lectures for the prior two weeks.  This, I think, is a bit unacceptable, especially since students would have an overwhelming number of videos to catch up on when they finally were posted.  I appreciate that JDRS wants to make sure lecture material is up to date with the latest packages and versions of R and the other software programs, but backlogging lectures for multiple weeks (two or three distinct times during the semester) is far from ideal.",
                "Strengths:  Prof. Reuning-Scherer is all-time great.  One of the best professors at Yale and makes learning statistics easy and enjoyable.\r\nWeaknesses: not many--there is a ton of support available and the content is valuable.  It's a great course."

                "yes",
                "Absolutely!  You will learn a ton of cool multivariate techniques (and brush up on their univariate analogs), and the workload/pace of the course is not too burdensome.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about fundamental and important statistical analyses methods, which are relevant to many different fields! I believe that having a basic understanding of multivariate statistics, and how to perform them on software programs/languages, is a crucial skill.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely take this course no matter what you are studying. You learn a lot of practical skills throughout the course and JDRS is super reasonable when it comes to grading. It's a great class where you get out what you put in and don't have to stress too much at all.",
                "Absolutely! Take this course with JDRS. You'll learn the theoretical basis and R implementation of so many practical multivariate techniques that you've probably heard about but don't yet understand. JDRS is the only professor I've ever had who assumes no theoretical background and explained linear algebra basics during the first week. This course is low stress and low workload, but you can learn a lot. Even better if you go in knowing somebody in the class because all of the psets are group projects, for better or for worse.",
                "I think this course is an excellent way to get practice with a variety of multivariate analysis techniques in the coding language of your choice. I personally had more opportunities to code in R which I think is always helpful. Some of the definitions, assumptions and background info can be a lot of information but it is made simpler when you start coding and look at examples. I think that the workload is fairly manageable throughout the semester and working with partners on homeworks and the final project help a lot in dividing the workload and sharing ideas.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in multivariate analysis and working with statistical softwares (like R), this is a great course. If you are looking for a continuation of S&DS 230, and have friends to take the course with you, I also recommend taking this class. The class is overall less stressful because all assignments can be turned in groups.",
                "Yes! This is a great class to take where you can potentially learn a lot but in a very low stress environment.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they're interested in learning a few different statistical techniques. I didn't really know much about the different kinds of analyses studied in this class outside of PCA, and this class did a good job of describing the high-level ideas behind them.  Because of how the class is structured, you don't really need to know the theory behind the ideas, but rather just how to implement them in practice and analyze the results. As with a lot of classes, I think you really get out of this class what you put in. If you're willing to really engage with the lecture material and understand the math--which is actually pretty involved, especially if you don't have the background--then you'll get a lot out of this class. If you just want to do the assignments quickly, then it probably won't be as rewarding of an experience, but still a good one nonetheless. All in all, a great class to take for the S&DS major or certificate!",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I was not a fan of Professor Reuning-Scherer's lecture style, and it was annoying to wait every week for the lectures to be uploaded.",
                "Yes!! If you're an S&DS major looking for a chill class, this one is it.",
                "Absolutely. This class really is what you make of it. Would highly suggest taking it with friends and finding a good dataset at the very beginning.",
                "Yes - great course to learn multivariate methods.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in multivariate statistics. The workload is not overwhelming and there is a lot that can be learned.",
                "As always, Professor JDRS is amazing! Must take. Super interesting and project allows students to go in whatever direction they are most interested in. Great course.",
                "Yes! A very chill class.",
                "Yes; you learn a lot and you don't necessarily need to learn the theory behind all the techniques. A very practical and application-based course.",
                "would be a great class for many different majors! the content is well explained and not incredibly difficult, and picking your own dataset to use makes the psets interesting and definitely more unique than other stats classes i have taken",
                "Yes! You learn a ton about multivariate data analysis in a stress-free environment.",
                "Take it if you need a good gut stats class. I don't think I have any great takeaways from this course (I could have had them, but there was just so little incentive to learn)",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to learn more about statistics and how to use them in various different programs.",
                "Yes, its approachable and you learn a lot.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn more complex R and are willing to put effort into the p-sets. Word with a homework group!",
                "Yes, for both major and certificate students. Skills learned in this class are applicable to social sciences and are great tools to have as a data scientist. It was a breath of fresh air to get away from regression to be honest.",
                "Yes. I would recommend it if you're interested in learning multivariate statistical methods in a setting that is relatively low stress.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this class, even if you are not a stats major. Really useful material",
                "Yes, would recommend. This is a great course to get exposure to a wide range of multivariate techniques that are widely used in research today. I will say that this class is absolutely an example of the saying: \"you get out what you put in.\" It would be possible to skate by in this class without learning much, but you'd then be doing yourself (and potentially your group mates!) a HUGE disservice. Especially for the S&DS majors out there, I'd really encourage folks to at least take a look at the papers and supplementary resources JDRS points to that show more of the math and proofs behind the techniques (I think a lot of the resources are especially accessible if you've taken linear models). Overall, really enjoyed the course!",
                "This course is an excellent fifth class, and it does a good job of providing a baseline for future usage of these multivariate techniques. I would recommend it for students who are interested in the material or who may find it useful down the road.",
                "Yes--take this class with JDRS if you're taking it.  It's the best environment to learn multivariate statistics in."
