    "Writing research papers, formulating strong argument, reading well-cited scholars, discussing readings",
    "this was such a good class - favorite class of the semester. you were asked very tough questions and had to share your thoughts in class -nowhere to hide; had to learn how to formulate thoughts well.",
    "I think my writing improved during this course and i think it was a good introductory writing course for me to take",
    "I definitely feel like I understand pain on a deeper level now. Even though its so subjective and complex you learn about it from so many interesting perspectives, from medicine to race to literature. On another hand, you might just leave the class with more questions than before coming in, but honestly how can you not with a topic so ambiguous and complex as pain. Its a great course, Id say take it, especially if youre interested in medicine",
    "I learned lots of writing skills at strategies. Along the way, I also learned a lot about pain and suffering."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: really interesting topic, great readings, interesting papers, great instructor, well organized, easy communication via Slack\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "strengths: the readings were incredibly interesting. class was taught extremely well. participation was excellent. everyone got a lot out of it. came out a stronger writer\r\nweakness: structure for each class didn't shift much. wished there was more variety in types of engagement and the form of each class discussion",
    "I really liked the readings (even though some were more difficult than others",
    "Sometimes the professor asks convoluted questions that no one really understood, so there will be awkward silences a lot... but throughout the year they became less and less",
    "A strength of the course is definitely its organization. The smaller class size allows you to get to know fellow classmates and the professor and truly get personalized feedback. If the class had to have a weakness, I would argue its the volume of reading on nights that papers are due\/near due. Although readings are a key part of the course, and I liked the use of Slack in my section, they sometimes became a lot to handle."

    "Yeah, take it, youll take away so many new insights and understand your own pain much better",
    "Yes I would as I learned a lot about myself as a writer. One thing, I would bear in mind the subject of the English 114 class before taking it as you will do a lot of readings and research about the subject. Although I'm not pre-med, though, I still found my section Communicating Pain, to be interesting."
