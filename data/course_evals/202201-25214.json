                "James Green brings in brilliant speakers to round out his own knowledge. This included a Yoruba woodcarver, curators from other institutions, and museum world professionals.",
                "This course places emphasis on becoming familiar with specific African artists, primarily from the 21st cent, as well as understanding the importance of provenance research. Green provides extremely helpful, clear, and thoughtful feedback on each assignment in a timely manner that really encourages students to further develop their project and critically analyse their approach. Green is also very eager to meet with students and provide any assistance during office hours and over email. I felt like my work in this class could easily have been developed into a multi-year research project and Green has the same enthusiasm and curiosity that makes this class enjoyable and feel worthwhile.\r\n\r\nSome changes would only serve to add to this great class. The assignments \/ readings and due dates were changed frequently, and while Green and Beth communicated these changes via email, the syllabus was not updated. Updating the syllabus would help. Additionally, the prompts for the assignments and expectations was often unclear or vague, as the instructions were not listed on syllabus \/ canvas and were only communicated via email. Again, adding these clear instructions to the canvas site would help a lot.\r\n\r\nFinally, in terms of course content, I found that Green missed opportunities to discuss important subjects in the discipline of African art history. Often, we were assigned very interesting articles that discussed provenance, research bias in terms of gender and race, display strategies, etc and yet we would not discuss these topics. Instead of engaging in discussion about such pertinent topics, the classes would often focus on tours through Yale's collections and visually analysing a group of objects. While this visual analysis and personal connection with objects is extremely helpful and special, the class felt disjointed since we were reading about pivotal theoretical frameworks but not discussing them in depth. I would prefer in the future to have more of a balance between the theoretical and visual analysis.\r\n\r\n(Some classes, such as the presentation by the label writer for the YUAG and the woman helping to create the new museum were not very useful and took away valuable class time. Since the course meets for barely 2 hours every week, future versions of this class should pay more attention to what is truly vital and these sessions felt long \/ redundant.) \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I felt that race was an elephant in the room felt by myself and my peers but not addressed in class. I would have liked either a set of 'community norms' or a class period dedicated to addressing positionality and the role that race, and gender as well, play in researching & valuing & discussing African art and artists. Omitting talking about race felt like a missed opportunity but hopefully in the future could be paired with the theoretical texts I mentioned above."

                "Absolutely, African Art is amazing and James Green is an excellent and passionate teacher",
                "Yes!! Taking a course taught by a curator is so valuable because it allows you access to their deep knowledge (and network) as well as unparalleled access to Yale's amazing art collections. Green is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor who is eager to help you learn and deepen your scholarship in a way that is so authentic and interested that it feels almost like a graduate class. I learned a lot about African artists and really enjoyed deepening my knowledge in this area of art history too, especially since Green provides flexibility to focus on specific areas \/ artists that you enjoy."
