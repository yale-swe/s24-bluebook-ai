                "We learned the basics of reading, writing, listening to, and speaking French at an intermediate level.",

                "My understanding of french (aurally) developed a lot over the semester and my writing skills also improved a lot. My speaking skills could have developed a bit more and my reading skills are slightly improved.",
                "This course is great for helping spoken French. There are plenty of opportunities to practice in class. The grammar learned is largely similar to French 120\/121, but with more nuances. The course helps a lot with fluency.",
                "furthered my understanding of the french language as a whole",
                "French culture and better listening and speaking skills",
                "I developed much better French vocabulary, and conversation skills.",
                "i learned how to communicate better in french",
                "Greatly improved my french vocabulary, grammar, and conversational skills.",
                "My grammar capabilities improved drastically from this course. I came in with little confidence about my ability to even conjugate in the simple present tense and I left able to speak in numerous tenses. Additionally, I gained a new appreciation for Frech culture through the books that we read and the movies that we watched. I especially enjoyed comparing and contrasting the pieces that we were exposed to.",

                "The course is highly engaging in order to learn French effectively. Level 3 has a much greater focus on literature specific vocabulary in comparison to earlier level courses. It is a lot of work but I do not think much could be changed while still maintaining the integrity of the course to prepare for the next level of classes.",
                "The major strength and weakness of this course is the same thing: the workload. Its unrealistic to find (sometimes more than) two hours of free time a day to do the homework. At the same time, that amount of engagement with the material helps you learn it. However, Im certain there is a compromise between the two, as the most important part of learning a language is daily practice.",
                "Meeting everyday does help you learn french, though I dont think it would make a difference if it were to be shortened by one day as a break or asynchronous day. The assigned reading was good and the grammar exercises were very helpful. The tests were generally reasonable and helpful as well. The course packet exercises were usually unhelpful and tedious.",
                "Strengths: the books and movies are interestingly, in class discussions are very engaging, the workload is quite high but it never feels like busywork\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the about of memorization (vocab words, characters, plots) is very high, so you might end up studying that more than the grammar etc.",
                "strengths: office hours\r\nweaknesses: curriculum structure, redesign it to be less repetitive",
                "The strengths were that the teacher was very interactive and helpful. Everybody was involved in the class.",
                "this course was challenging but taught well",
                "The strengths of this course was that it was well organized and had a strong emphasis on comprehension and vocabulary. One area that the course could be improved is by providing more feedback on conversational abilities. While there were ample opportunities to practice speaking, there was little feedback in this area, which I would have preferred.",
                "A major strength of this class was that it moved at a pretty fast pace resulting in a huge improvement in vocabulary and grammar. Each lesson was different and consisted of a good mix of discussion, vocabulary activities, and grammar practice. I really appreciated that it felt more like a class that I would have taken in high school in that I felt a strong sense of community and it didn't feel like everyone was trying to always have the perfect answer.\r\nOne minor weakness of the course was that some of the vocab that we were expected to memorize has little application in practical life such as \"pimp\" or \"scaffold\". Even though both of those words were relevant to the story, I think a greater emphasis could be placed on words that we will realistically use. Additionally some of the exercises on the tests seemed a little useless such as distinguishing auditorily whether a word has an r in it or not.",

                "Yes, but not unless they were serious about truly learning French. If a student is not as passionate, its a lot of work to manage.",

                "In general the French classes are difficult. If you didnt mind French 120, youll probably find the workload of this course to be lighter. If youre considering starting French classes, then this course is really going to help your fluency and expertise with the languagebut its also harder than other language options.",
