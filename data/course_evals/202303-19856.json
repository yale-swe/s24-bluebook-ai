                "Developed my ability to think critically about a diverse range of topics in Spanish; I also improved my ability to speak spontaneously. I appreciated how the course focused on the experiences of marginalized communities.",

                "Strengths: asynchronous day allows for creativity and collaboration. I liked the focus on art and representation. Weakness: the professor. She was not an inspiring or engaging person, and this could be improved by having her teach L1 spanish instead of L4. Her accent was terrible and she gave us nothing to aspire to, and the ability to corral the class into understanding something like a past participle was entirely beyond her. I felt like she became nitpicky on assignments as the semester went on, searching for reasons to take points off on writing assignments or projects.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, interesting content, \r\nWeaknesses: assignments were finalized at the last minute",
                "I enjoyed how the course was very focused on conversations and oral expression, but I would have liked to see more specific grammar review. Or, perhaps optional, department-wide evening review sessions a few times a semester covering different grammatical topics (past subjunctive, conditional, future, etc...).",
                "Strengths: Pretty well organized in terms of homeworks and assignments, the movies were fun too. Also asynchronous Wednesdays helped me out a lot.\r\nWeaknesses: A fair amount of work (nightly) and not a whole lot of breathing room, but it is what you would expect from a 5 day a week class so I can't complain too much."

                "Strengths: A good amount of the content was interesting, especially the films we watched. I enjoyed the focus on race and gender. Weaknesses: Grading for writing assignments was harsh and very subjective compared to my experience with other Spanish classes. It felt as if you were being graded on how much your writing style fit Prof Glenski's personal stylistic preferences rather than whether that writing met the rubric's criteria. I also feel as if the class had a lot of busy work, but that's typical for all Spanish classes. Also, be prepared to be assigned hour-long homework assignments without any prior notice. Hopefully, the course coordinator (not the instructor) can do better with giving students more information beforehand.",
                "Absolutely not, at least not with my professor.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in Spanish and would like to gain a richer understanding of a myriad of challenges that Latinx communities face, then definitely take this course. I also think the style of assessment was conducive to critical thinking and creativity.",
                "Absolutely! I believe this is a great course to learn and improve an individual's spanish-speaking skills."
