In this way, this class made sure that I was always making a conscious effort to be conscientious about French. I learned a lot stylistic French writing and speaking as well, learning more than just how to communicate but also how to communicate in ways that felt natural and proper to the French ear.",

                "I greatly improved my speaking skills, learned about the diversity of Francophone countries, became more comfortable with dictation, studied France in World War 2 for a large part of the course, etc.",
                "I developed my French language skills and learned about French culture.",

                "Wayyyy too much work it affected my mental health",
                "This course is very difficult. It could be improved by lowering the amount of pop quizzes, from my experience the quizzes caused such a high amount of stress for the students and never really seemed to help us understand the concepts because we never went over the correct answers. Also, the final seems a little too comprehensive, with too many vocabulary words to be able to remember from throughout the year. Other languages at Yale do not have finals at all, like the Spanish department. The French finals feel unnecessarily difficult in light of the fact that other languages at this school don't even require a final exam.",
                "This course could be improved by maybe taking away one unit or book so the course doesnt feel so fast-paced",
                "Too much work",
                "There are lots of opportunities to practice speaking which is really nice.",
                "Well structured course.\r\nNo significant changes to be made-- maybe more formal assignments and less small homework.",
                "Strengths: actualits and exposs were very good speaking practices, frequent dictation exercises to become more comfortable listening, many discussions with smaller groups allowed for more conversations, interesting stories that were relevant to the world today\r\n\r\nWeakness: the averages throughout the class are unclear but it seems as though evaluations are difficult very few get As (no curve?), sometimes discussions were so focused on niche topics that regular conversations were infrequent, last month or so was solely on a book (very good and interesting conversations), however, there was no more grammar taught which I believe we still have a lot more to learn",
                "The strengths were the materials that were presented to us. The stories and films were very helpful in improving my French. The only weakness I would say is how the grammar was taught because at times it felt rushed andnot as thorough as it could be.",
                "Madame Burton did an amazing job of incorporating all disciplines of language learning into the class, but especially emphasising the importance of being comfortable at speaking, and challenging us to become comfortable at both spontaneous and more prepared conversation. I also really enjoyed the selection of texts, particular Diversite and La Symphonie Pastorale."

This class will greatly elevate your French language skills, but demands a high daily workload, which feels like around a 2 credit commitment. The course moves quickly, so if you are willing to dedicate an immense amount of time to biweekly tests, in class presentations and essays, you will improve immensely in your French language skills.",

                "Yes. The course will hone every aspect of your French skills, and you learn a bunch about the world.",
                "Yes, I would. This course made me much more confident in my French abilities in every way. I became a more confident speaker and writer and throughout the whole course, we grew in our listening abilities as it was conducted entirely in French.",
                "I would if they are interested in French. I really do think I learned and improved a lot and am looking forward to using these skills in some upper level French classes",
