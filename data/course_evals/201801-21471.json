    "Learned about solving special cases of first order and second order equations. A pretty basic course where you learn a simple computational concept and apply it over and over again on homework psets.",
    "General knowledge of how to solve diff equations.",
    "Math246 helped develop techniques to solve first- and second-order differential equations. This was an overview class that focused more on introducing various methods to solve ODEs rather than delving into proofs and theory about how these were discovered\/justified. However, there was some emphasis in introducing some of the easier proofs for theorems that were taught.",
    "Good course to learn basic techniques for solving differential equations. Useful skill for other math courses.",
    "Solving some difeqs",
    "It helped me learn different techniques for evaluating differential equations.",
    "I learned a lot about ordinary differential equations.",
    "All the essentials ways to solve ODEs",
    "I learned a variety of techniques that I can use to solve various types of linear first order and second order ordinary differential equations. I did not really gain anything more than that.",
    "How to solve ordinary differential equations. We did first order, second order with a few different cases, and then series solutions for a more general case. However I feel like a lot of it was more difficult to comprehend initially than the professor thought, so the lectures were often spending time on the wrong parts of the lectures and it was hard to learn some of the important stuff. I learned a bit from the textbook, which is ok, not great, but not bad.",
    "This class is a lot of memorization and you don't learn much of the theory behind it, and certainly not rigorously.",
    "Knowledge of differential equations",
    "Learned course material, not much application or broad understanding",
    "Survey of methods to solve ordinary differential equations",
    "I learned how to solve first order and second order differential equations, mostly linear cases but some non linear cases as well. I also gained new insights as to how series expansions work and are useful to solving differential equations.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength is that I did learn some of the material, mainly by studying for exams. The lectures are very dry as the professor is just copying his notes directly onto the board every lecture, although I will add that he is very enthusiastic to answer questions (it's just that pretty much nobody ever asks). Material is pretty dry; I felt that I could have learned the material on my own just as easily and did just as well.",
    "It is taught horribly",
    "Weaknesses lecture not engaging at all. Material is dry and no effort is made to make it more attractive.",
    "Professor Moncrief makes the material so much harder than it needs to be. Make sure you understand the textbook, and the material wont be too bad. He is great at anaserring questions, so make sure you ask them when you need help.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the weekly problem sets, which provided ample opportunity to practice the techniques taught in class. Additionally, the in-class review session was very helpful in reviewing all the methods learned in a comprehensive manner. I believe that the course could be improved by having shorter midterms (it seemed like the entire class was unable to finish either midterm).",
    "Straightforward, no frills class. Kind of hard to follow lecture but textbook is helpful.",
    "Lectures not engaging, material not super interesting, lots of busywork",
    "The professor was sort of boring which was not conducive to in class learning.",
    "It was good but I wish their were sections for more practice problems.",
    "Content was straightforward, but there was never enough time on the midterms",
    "The strengths are that it is very straightforward, and it is fairly easy to learn all of the material from the textbook. The weaknesses are that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in class because the professor is all over the place and does not teach in an organized and clear manner. The grading is also fairly harsh for such a straightforward class.",
    "Moncrief is very nice and means well, and he is certainly a genius. But that might actually be a bit of a liability here, because a lot of these things seem really easy to him but can be harder to grasp for us. So it would have been better for him to go slower on some things and really explain them with examples (instead of \"ok this is the rule, now convince yourself that it applies to this example,\" which ends up leaving us a bit unsure about what to do). The problem sets were often tedious, which is somewhat avoidable, but they weren't as terrible as they have been for some other classes. Textbook wasn't great, but it was often more reliable than the lecture.",
    "I think this course needs to decide if it's going to teach ODEs with full theory and rigor, or just teach how to do calculations.",
    "The teaching style was very outdated and relatively unorganized. Midterms only tangentially reflected what was on the problem sets. Very difficult even if you kept up with material.",
    "I feel as though offering at only 9:25 am caused it to be overcrowded and did not allow for everyone to fully engage with the material.",
    "Lectures could be more engaging, more insight through course \/ ability to be assessed other than two large midterms",
    "Strength is that it follows the textbook closely and is organized reasonably; weakness is that lectures were somewhat confusing and exams seemed to test not knowledge but equation solving speed.",
    "A strength of this course is that the material is very interesting and applicable to many other courses of study. A huge weakness was how un-interesting the class was. It was so difficult to stay focused because the lectures were not engaging. I couldn't follow what the lector was writing on the board because he often skipped steps or just said \"convince yourself that this is what you would end up getting.\" I found myself wishing I was still in my high school math teacher's class because it was so hard to gain anything from going to class. Another strength is that the problem sets were manageable, and I learned a lot from doing them, but a weakness is that I ended up teaching myself everything from the book. At times it felt like I was taking 3 classes, and math was just something I did on Sunday nights. That was pretty unfortunate because before coming to Yale I was really passionate about math and could articulate exactly what I love about it, but now I feel pretty indifferent because I find it hard to get excited about math at Yale.",
    "Strength: detailed steps\r\nWeakness: can be of more scope",
    "This is not a math class. This class tests your ability to compute quickly and copy from the textbook and past problem sets. There is no reason to go to class - but there are plenty of reasons not to!",
    "Strengths: good practice on p-sets, material clearly taught, clear expectations on exams\r\nI don't see how it could be improved.",
    "The course works from a really great textbook: Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (Boyce, DiPrima) 10th Edition. The problem sets were reasonably assigned. Lectures were dry and exams (open-notes, open-textbook) were often too challenging.",
    "The tests were too long and seemed to test the speed with which you could solve a lot of easy questions rather than the extent to which you actually understood the theory",
    "This class was taught very poorly. It was nearly impossible to follow along what was going on in class."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it for your major, take it. Otherwise, try to avoid this class if you can.",
    "No unless it is a requirement",
    "Only if a requirement. Class does provide you with useful information for all STEM fields but it is a very boring class.",
    "It is not very well taught , but the material isnt too hard to learn in your own and the workload isnt bad.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they need it for their major or are very interested in learning about ODEs. The class is decent, Professor Moncrief teaches quite well, the weekly problem sets are definitely manageable, but the midterms were way too long. The course was taught in a somewhat disorganized fashion - there did not seem to be a clear schedule of when we would be moving on to new topics.",
    "Recommend as an easier Math credit for Math, Econ\/Math AMTH majors.",
    "Not really, just a lot of busywork with a boring lecture",
    "I would recommend it because it's a requirement for some majors and is fairly easy BUT you do have to teach yourself a lot of the material. Overall not a bad course at all",
    "Yes.",
    "It covered strong math concepts, but the instructions was uneven.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who can count it towards their major because it will take up almost no time except for the few days before each midterm. However, it is very boring and in class, it is difficult to ever know what is going on, so in general, it is not an enjoyable class.",
    "I mean, not if you don't have to. Like I wouldn't say you should dread this course, it isn't that bad, but I don't really have anything good to say about it either. ENAS 194 is often another option, and there are some horror stories about some of the people that teach it, so if you're looking at one of them, then take this instead. \r\n\r\nHopefully you're good at math and can keep up\/teach yourself from the textbook, because things go fast, there isn't a lot of support, and Moncrief isn't very good at explaining things. And everyone else is pretty good at math so you have to compete with them. I've heard from past years that the grading is pretty generous, which is good, because I only got through 70% or so of the second midterm... no way to do more than that in the 75 minutes we had. I wish that we could just have a proper final in the finals slot if the exam is going to be that long, or better, just make it one question shorter so people actually have a chance to finish it--I don't think it's really fair for the speed with which you can complete an exam to have such a strong bearing on your score.",
    "This course isn't a lot of work but it's hard to follow and might not be worth the time if you're looking for an easy math class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It made differential equations easy to solve and this knowledge will be very useful as I continue on with math and physics.",
    "Yes if math major",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this to another student unless they needed it for a prerequisite; you can absolutely apprehend the information learned in 246 from the textbook alone as the material itself doesn't need that much theoretical background.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they need it as a prerequisite or a low-engagement QR class. I personally didn't gain more than that, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a mind-blowingly amazing class.",
    "Must-have to learn more about ODE.",
    "If they'd like a fifth class, a QR credit, or generally just something to which they don't need to show up, this is the class for them.",
    "Yes, it is a good course in differential equations.",
    "I would recommend this course and the follow-up MATH 247 over ENAS 194, as it seems like one gets a better understanding of the material by taking the two-semester route. The open-notes midterm and final is great.",
    "No! I hated this class and do not think I did well at all, even though the material is actually very easy. Do not assume you can just take it as an easy math credit and get a good grade because the tests are actually hard. You could learn the same amount from maybe a day's worth of looking at problems. \r\n\r\nDo not take this."
