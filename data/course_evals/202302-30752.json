I especially treasured my visit to the Yale Art Gallery; I saw lots of wonderful art there, and choosing my favorite was a real challenge! And of course, the discussion on Drug Control we had in our last class; that was one of the most interesting yet intellectually, morally, and emotionally challenging things I have ever done in my entire life, as both groups presented really strong points that were difficult to defend against - partially because Drug Control itself is a tough, multifactorial problem."
