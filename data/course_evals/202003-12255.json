This course taught me all of the basic grammar needed to communicate in the language. Prior to this course, I had never read a full-length French novel. I found my reading comprehension improve greatly by taking this course.",

                "The assessments were structured in ways that felt unnecessarily difficult, but a big strength of the course was that whether Madame Devos was teaching or it was Madame Koizim, the classes were engaging and the material was taught well.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the willingness that the professors had to engage and help students. The course material was time-consuming but I felt that most of the exercises were important either for improving grammar or for understanding the current reading assignment. A notable weakness is the lack of speaking exercises which could be improved upon by including assignments that required students to speak with other students or the professors.",
                "I think that the department needs to include more literature from around the Francophone world, not just France. This course also was very heavy, with each of the works we studied dealing with death except for Le Petit Nicolas. While the French are often macabre, I think that for an intermediate to Advanced course such as this, it was a bit too heavy. I also think that there was not enough that focused on people of color. The closest we got to that was Monsieur Ibrahim and the \"Arabes\" in L'tranger.",
                "The language learning method was great for me, working on the course every day is very helpful in developing and maintaining language skills, and it is clear the method has been meticulously put together. The professor was engaging and understanding. The core weakness for this course is the lack of diversity in its curriculum, I would have loved a more diverse selection of reading and watching, the majority of which was by and about white men. Because this is a language class, there is not much time and space to address the racism and sexism in some of the material (esp. L'Etranger and Jules et Jim) (and it may not be the right place to do so anyway).",
                "The course is very well geared to fortifying the concepts from L1 and L2 French. I was appreciative of the flexibility of the teachers, particularly considering the circumstances of this semester. I think the biggest area to improve is the specific literature we engaged with. I felt as though some of the literature felt a bit dated and could have been changed with more contemporary options. I would appreciate a balance of the two, particularly when some of these engage with social issues, it would be nice to see some more up-to-date content."

I took French throughout middle and high school but I felt that I learned more in one semester taking FREN 130 than I did all of the six years I took French prior to coming to Yale. However, if you have other classes that require a significant time commitment, then you might want to reconsider.",
