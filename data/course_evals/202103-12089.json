Besides the basic knowledge of working with a camera, editing, and printing, I was exposed to a lot of artist work and photographic theory. It was very beneficial for creating a photographic style and finding sources of inspiration, as well as gaining insight about the process of creating a narrative in my work.",

                "It was perfect. The course was informative and productive. An amazing introduction to the discipline that was well structured with critiques, guests lecturers, and theoretical discussions.",
                "I thought Professor Singer was amazing and that we were exposed to a lot of great artists that helped everyone find something they were interested in. The crits were also extremely helpful for creating and improving my work. I think that one improvement could be a stronger emphasis on creative cohesive narratives, but this is hard in only a semester-long course.",
                "Danna is such a personable professor and knows how to engage her students endlessly, whether it is through insightful photo crits,  photo talks with invited speakers or class visits to Haas to see the MFA works of legends. Danna was direct in her crits, which was immensely helpful since her investment in her students was palpable, and her criticism made everyone's work go miles above where they started as the semester progressed. I'm so incredibly thankful to have taken this class with Danna, and hope that she returns to Yale so that other students can be inspired by her and feel less intimidated about taking themselves seriously as artists. She truly is a one-of-a-kind art professor -- I've taken and shopped many art classes. I struggle to think of weaknesses for the class -- maybe we could have done a class trip outside of New Haven? That's not even a complaint -- I just would have loved to hear her speak about photographers' works in New York museums or galleries.",
                "strength: Danna and Emily were very, very supportive of our creative endeavors, especially creative risk-taking! They also made sure to give a lot of attention to each student in the class, and I truly appreciate that! I also got exposed to the work of so many great photographers, and the class field trips to the photo archive at Haas Library and the Yale University Art Gallery were absolutely amazing. \r\n\r\nNo weakness",

                "Yes! I think that if you have prior experience in photography it is a great next step, but if you don't some of the intro courses would be better. It's still accessible to everyone and it definitely will improve your photography.",
                "I definitely would recommend this class to other students -- both art students and non-art ones. Danna reframes the way we think not only about photography, but also visual culture and how embedded we are in it. Danna helps students key in on main themes in their work that evince more fundamental concerns that underlie their thinking: What does it mean to be first-gen at Yale? How do my different identities shape my worldview? How do I cope with the imminent death of a family member? All of these questions are then productively explored through photography, thanks to Danna's determination to helping us excavate these concerns in our work and then channel our thinking through photography.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!",
                "If you feel like you need a space to work with sequencing and narrative in your photo practice, this is a great place. People with different levels of skill and experience were in my class and it feels like we all grew together by the end of the course.",
                "Definitely!"
