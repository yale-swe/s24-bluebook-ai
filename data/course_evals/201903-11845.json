   "comments": [
    "I have improved my Spanish speaking skills as a result of this class.",
    "I improved my Spanish skills, especially speaking skills, and learned some new more advanced grammar topics.",
    "I think that I got much better at speaking and reading Spanish as a result of this class. Practicing daily and periodically reviewing helped me to keep strengthening concepts that I would otherwise work around in speech. I think that the way that we would all participate in class and have to come up with our own examples for different grammatical concepts really helped me because I had no choice but to learn harder concepts since I would be expected to use them.",
    "My Spanish-speaking skills greatly improved! I came into the class with a decent Spanish foundation, but I now feel quite confident in my speaking abilities. I also gained new knowledge about Spanish culture, global history pertaining to the Spanish-speaking world, and a class of new amigos.",
    "This class improves one's abilities to speak, write and read in Spanish.",
    "Lots of practice with grammar and speaking",
    "I developed participation skills, learning how to engage more in class material by pushing myself to develop thoughts with greater care since I was doing them in another language other than english.",
    "I felt as though this course truly helped improve my fluency and confidence in speaking the Spanish language. While there was a large focus on grammar, I appreciate how the class also focused on the implication of the grammar rules."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: improves spanish, professor was very engaging. Weaknesses: Supersite homeworks are not an accurate way to measure your skills.",
    "Strengths: since it is every day, it is very hard not to learn what you are being taught when you are taught it\r\nWeaknesses: the same class every day can be daunting. Also, the supersite (online textbook) homeworks were sometimes helpful, but sometimes confusing and annoying",
    "I can't really think of a way this class could be improved. The syllabus made expectations clear, our professor was always organized and prepared, and I think the workload was reasonable. This course was a much better experience for me than Spanish II or III and I think I improved a lot. The only thing I can think of as a weakness is the way that supersite is graded sometimes. Sometimes super small things will make a whole question wrong or the instructions will be unclear.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the syllabus is clear from the beginning -- the class meets every day, and from the first day of class, you can look ahead and know what to expect for the rest of the semester. The class also has clear thematic development, so it is obvious how all the course material is intended to fit together. And although students are tested pretty much every Friday on different skills (which did get rather stressful at times), this takes the pressure away from single examinations and also allows students to practice skills. To improve the course, perhaps there could be variation in activities. Most classes followed the same exact format, and although the consistency left little room for surprises, it did feel a bit repetitive.",
    "The textbook and syllabus structure are not great but Professor Cividanes was awesome and really made the class as good as it was. Her activities and teaching style really improve your Spanish.",
    "Strengths: There are a lot of interesting readings and different types of sources, such as films and presentations.\r\nWeaknesses: The online homework is structured in a weird way in which it is about material that you have not actually learned in class yet, which is a bit counterintuitive. Additionally, the syllabus structured in a confusing way.",
    "Strengths are lots of grammar practice. Weakness is very fast paced",
    "It's an incredibly heavy workload class, especially with the online homeworks every night -- if the work could be lightened, or even made more relevant to the class, it would really improve it.",
    "I think the Super Site homework system can be fixed. I don't think it is a good system to have homework due at 9:00 am in the morning.",
    "The strengths of this course are absolutely the close bond among class members (small class size) and the bond with the students and the professor. No weakness come to mind, it was an excellent and enjoyable class!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes!!! Take cividanes, she is the best and will make sure you improve your spanish speaking skills every day! She pushes you, but she is super nice.",
    "The course is successful at teaching Spanish. It is daunting to go every day, but you will improve",
    "I would definitely encourage people to take Spanish 4 and to take Spanish classes in general. People seem to think that Spanish 1 is easy, 2 is, to be honest, super hard and stressful and sort of made me want to cry, and that 3 and 4 are more relaxed. I would agree but I don't think that that means 3 and 4 aren't useful. I feel like I grew this most in Spanish this semester while also having what felt like a lighter workload. I think the difference is that 4 is paced more reasonably and you really learn and understand what is taught, instead of it being like 2 where you cram a set on conjugations in your head to pass the exam. Unfortunately, I would tell people to hold on through 2 and that 4 will be a lot more fun and they'll really feel like that know useful Spanish after this class.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish, then absolutely! You will need to put in the work, but you will definitely see the results by the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you can take it will Professor Cividanes. It is a challenging class compared to Spanish L3 but very rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it made me more confident in my speaking and writing abilities. All of the grammar lessons were thorough and the content itself was very interesting. The seminar dynamic of the course was really conducive to learning and feeling comfortable enough to practice your spanish",
    "Yes, this course is a very good way to improve a lot of basic Spanish skills such as vocabulary and grammar, while engaging in a fun way and developing friendships with classmates that you see five times a week.",
    "Yes. Good for improving Spanish speaking and grammar",
    "I would recommend this course, but more so recommend my professor, Ams Cividanes.",
    "Yes. It is an engaging intermediate Spanish course, but not too work-intensive.",
    "If youre taking this class, its probably for the requirement. Its an extremely heavy workload class, so make sure you have the space  but Prof Cividanes is good, so otherwise its not a terrible class.",
    "Absolutely! You will not only learn a great deal in this class, but you will also enjoy the environment the professor is amazing and the classroom dynamic is enjoyable."
