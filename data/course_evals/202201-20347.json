                "I learned about the Indigenous histories that you dont hear in school  for example, we spent a unit on the American Indian Movement, which I had never learned about until this class.",
                "I learned a lot about tribal histories in the US and Indigenous political movements from the mid 1900s to present day. I also learned about many different approaches to studying and writing about indigenous history from the numerous books we read and discussed in class.",
                "This class is primarily a historiographical course; instead of covering all of Native American history chronologically (which would be impossible to do in one course), it focuses on current works by Native scholars and offers a critical perspective to the way that Native history has traditionally been communicated. I think that this class is incredibly useful for history and ER&M majors in particular. Professor Blackhawk maintains a rigorous historical standard in his class, and I left the course with not only a more thorough understanding of Native American history (because we do read a lot of books on topics from tribes across the United States and in different time periods) but also with a more critical lens through which to view historical works.",
                "Learned a lot about many different American Indian tribes and influential Indians. Developed my writing skills.",
                "Learned a lot about modern Native American history (20th century) and the various ways of thinking about history",
                "I learned not only how history is made, but how historians shape history from scratch. Further, I learned how to read historical and literary works considering the intent of the author whenever a history seeks to make an event historically significant. I also gained experience formulating my own histories, all the while in a grammatical structure that facilitates making bold claims."

            "comments": [
                "I loved all of the books we read, as well as our lively discussions  however, I wish some of our discussions had been more focused.",
                "Strengths: Excellent syllabus, good seminar guidance and teaching by Professor Blackhawk, visit to the Beinecke (amazing!), incredible group of students in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I struggled a little bit with the way that the class is structured (readings before spring break and student presentations after). I think this made the course feel a little bit top-heavy at times, and I did feel that my engagement with the course decreased towards the end of the semester as a result of this structure. I also wish that Professor Blackhawk would have provided slightly more structure and guidance for the final research papers. There were also really only two graded assignments over the course of the semester (one paper in the first few weeks and then a final paper), so there was not a ton of feedback.",
                "Loved the range of topics covered and the ability for discussion to take a turn in any direction the students\/professor took it. Having class for 2 hours once a week was helpful because it allowed time for the readings to get done and then plenty of time to discuss the readings. No real weaknesses in my opinion.",
                "Could be improved with more readings; it felt odd for half the semester to be entirely spent on term papers when there could have been so much more covered in terms of variety",
                "Strengths- Wide scope of historical mediums, invested class body, history relevant to Yale undergraduate students, commitment to strong grammar, etc.\r\nWeaknesses- Sometimes difficult to arrange office hours. Every few weeks the class readings would be overwhelming, prompting discussions where students walk into class unprepared."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes. An understanding of Native American history should be a requirement for all students (and Americans in general), and this course definitely helped me develop this understanding. Professor Blackhawk is a uniquely talented and adept seminar leader-- he is constantly challenging students and pushing us to engage more deeply and more accurately with readings and concepts. This is not a class where people can BS vague historical statements in class discussion, which I appreciated. The workload is pretty typical, though the final paper is significant (14-16 pages) and so you need to prepare ahead of time.",
                "Absolutely, one of the only classes available to teach about American Indian history in a non-whitewashed manner.",
                "Strongly recommend for anyone interested in the topic!",
                "I would recommend the course to students interested in learning how to shine a light on a subject underrepresented\/misrepresented in academia. I would also recommend the course for Native and Indigenous students seeking to explore their own histories through their own work. The course is also engaging for students interested in exploring the history of tribes from their home regions."
