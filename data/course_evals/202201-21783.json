            "comments": [
                "Strength: I did well because of my section leader, so a strength is the weekly sections.",
                "Strengths: amazing textbook\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures do not follow the syllabus, the textbook (which is such a great resource) does not match the lectures based off the syllabus, boring lectures, extremely complicated problem sets, extremely hard exams, awful curve",
                "Strengths - good overview of material, nothing was convoluted, just straight forward giving us the information, great TFs and Peer Tutors who helped a lot on psets/test prep\r\nWeaknesses - Moved quickly so hard to fully grasp material as the class went, more context to the theory would have been helpful\r\nImprovements - putting some of the theory into layman's terms to help with understanding in context",
                "Strength was that office hours was very helpful and the TFs were very willing to help. Weakness was that lecture was very boring and a lot of information was covered in very little time.",
                "I think the course includes a lot of theory and less practical things, which makes it dull.",
                "Strengths: Accessible for someone with no background in economics whatsoever. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were quite dry, the majority of the class content felt very self-serving and isolated for someone who is not going to major in economics in the future.",
                "One weakness is how politically biased it is and how much it relies on one school of economics above all others. In addition, the lectures were not engaging  and I didn't feel like I was learning much until it got around to a midterm and I had to study a ton.",
                "I think the weaknesses of this course is that I watched every single lecture, but would look at practice problems and have no idea how to do them. I think the course too heavily focuses on section. They do not explain things in the most simple way to understand.",
                "The office hours, peer tutor hours, review sessions, and sections were all very helpful in learning the course material in time for the exam, so that's definitely a strength. The exams were pretty straightforward; doing the problem sets and practice exams were enough to get a decent enough grade on the actual exam. I wouldn't say the course had a lot of weaknesses other than the lectures sometimes going over the end time, but I think that's an issue that can be found in any lecture-based class.",
                "Strengths: PSETs are concise (about 6 questions) and relate very well to the exams and lectures. Exams are fair, I wish they weren't online (but they're open note, so that's nice), but the content is a fair representation of section sessions and PSETS. Lectures are helpful (go to them in person)! Weaknesses: This may just be the amount of content to be taught but lectures go by super fast and you're often cramming to finish your notes, which sometimes makes it difficult to retain the information. I found it helpful to annotate/skim textbook chapters at times.",
                "I liked that the course was recorded so I can always refer back to a lecture.",
                "Strength is that the class was very well organized and there are a number of resources to go to for help. The TFs were all very accessible and helpful for the most part. The midterms and the final were all easier than expected and graded rather generously.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness is the fact that I learned very little from lecture itself. I felt as though that the content we were learning in lecture and the psets we had to complete were quite different. For the most part I found myself learning through doing the psets and after a certain point, I stopped using lectures as a resource entirely.",
                "The weaknesses is that there is a lot of information to be learned, and it feels cramped. The lectures were pretty boring. The material was not easy but not hard. A lot of time I could not figure out what to do on my own so I would go to an outside source. The strengths was that it was recorded and it had a nice curve.",
                "The course might as well have been an algebra class. It was also not very introductory as a lot of the concepts we were expected to already know. Furthermore, the sections did not explain anything they just went through problems in a disorganized manner.",
                "Strengths: This course has a lot of great support, from TFs to peer tutors. There are extensive office hours offered, which were always helpful. The weekly PSet was a manageable amount of work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections were helpful, but sometimes seemed like another lecture. It was helpful to do problems, but sometimes the amount assigned for section seemed to much to cover (especially if people in section had questions).",
                "This course was very well structured and there were many opportunities to seek extra help.",
                "I loved Prof. Goldbergs clear style of lecturing. Made the content very accessible",
                "The course could be strengthened by covering every topic in lecture so that when we attend section we would be ready to apply the knowledge.",
                "This course really teaches for the exam, which is helpful in terms of doing well in the course, but it can be difficult to be engaged and/or understand how to apply the concepts to real world situations.  Section was a really helpful part of the class as well as the availability of office hours to learn material.  It would not have been possible for me to learn the material without section and office hours/review sessions.  A lot of the class felt like developing test-taking strategy and memorizing steps to solve problems while forgetting what concepts mean in real life contexts.",
                "This course could be improved by including practice problems within the lecture because it was extremely difficult to learn the material and then go to the problem sets seeing quantitative questions for the first time .",
                "strengths: many many academic and human resources/outside of class opportunities to learn",
                "This was a great introductory course with many resources for students.",
                "The option to watch recorded lectures was SO helpful. If you missed class you could watch them, but if you were confused on a specific topic or graph it was very helpful to be able to go back and hear her explain it again.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures moved fast, and if you didnt go to office hours, the problem sets were difficult.",
                "Strengths: structure is very organized, helpful office hours, midterm and final review sessions, many resources \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: difficulty is different for second midterm",
                "strong disconnect between what was taught in class and what appeared on assignments and problem sets. concepts outlined but processes to solve numerical problems not offered in lecture.",
                "Strengths: generous grading (!), lowest three Psets dropped (!!) and all exams are open-note (!!!). TFs are very helpful and available to answer any questions.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were dry and a bit technical, but Professor Goldberg brings in a lot of cool real-world examples when giving lectures. Also: although only high school math is required for the course, it helps significantly if you have an intuitive understanding of calculus. Trust me on this.",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful",
                "strengths: real workd applications. obvious how this connects to our day-to-day lives. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures went iver time almost every class. went theough slides very quickly",
                "All good.",
                "No improvement needed. Sections were very helpful.",
                "The class was really well-organized and engaging. The problems presented in section and in problem sets complemented the lecture material very well.",
                "The theories were taught in class and you were expected to apply them on your own, there was not a lot of guidance in this way. If you go to section and office hours then you are okay. But the lecture material does not always translate super easily to the problems you are expected to do.",
                "I really enjoyed learning how the concepts applied to the real world.\r\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to discuss the theories more in depth in section, but obviously practicing the math was extremely beneficial.",
                "Professor Goldberg was quite a good lecturer and did a reasonable job at conveying the topics that we needed to understand. The course was poor in the sense that there were quite a few barriers between Professor Goldberg and the student, and it was almost discouraged for students to contact the professor. We were instead directed towards Dr. Morar and the TAs.",
                "Section was helpful",
                "Strengths-- the amount of office hours and the online accessibility of the office hours, as well as the connections to current topics .weaknesses were that some of the TFs were great while others could barely explain the material-- i had to learn over the semester who could actually help me. no real feedback given on midterms, or when talking to the TFs, in how one could actually positively improve in the course of they were already attending lecture and section (the bare minimum). i mainly relied on peers for help in this class, not university resources, which is a shame",
                "I think that this class could be improved through more examples throughout lectures of real-world applications of the material. I really appreciated having section with the ability to go over the types of problems we learned in class. I also appreciated how the expectations of the class were clearly outlined.",
                "The content is interesting and could be taught in a more engaging manner",
                "Strengths are hello from TAs and office hours times (there were a lot).",
                "Organization in studying and teaching within the lecture what is tested",
                "I liked the course overall. Good progression of topics and the many office hours were very helpful. I think psets did a good job preparing us for the exams and sections did a good job covering information we didnt have time to reach in class as well as preparing us for the psets.",
                "I thought the lectures and seminars were incredibly useful for learning the information.",
                "This course is very well organized. The lectures were clear and so were the exam procedures.",
                "It is an hour and 15 minute class that goes so fast it is hard to attend in person because I miss a lot, but watching it online is also exhausting and I have to rewind a lot. On top of that there is a non mandatory section that is helpful, but they are so early in the week that I have rarely had time to go over the information yet.",
                "Weakness would be that some concepts are very abstract. Strength is the examples and case studies provided in the lectures that apply to real life.",
                "strengths: the discussion sections were excellent and great ways to practice\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more practice material would be nice",
                "The strengths involve strong organization and plenty of previous midterms for practice. I did feel that lectures were a little boring and could have been made more engaging, but that's an intro course for you!",
                "I think a strength of this course is that it presents a lot of foundational information very concretely and in a way that does not require any previous knowledge of microeconomics. A weakness, personally, would be that it could be hard to engage with the subject matter as it can be hard to connect graphs to real world concepts.",
                "Strengths are that the content covered was pretty all-encompassing, weaknesses are that sometimes we would spend a disproportionate amount of time on one topic compared to another. For example, for the last few weeks of the class, I felt like we were rushing through certain topics that we needed much more time on.",
                "Strength: easy and fun.\r\nWeakness: lecture could be a little boring, but it all worked out.",
                "The material was interesting, and the discussion sections and office hours in particular were very helpful in grasping the challenging concepts. However, the pacing of the course felt rather fast, leaving me confused throughout many of the lectures. The feedback on both problem sets and exams was not  detailed enough in my opinion. The information about final vs. initial Canvas grades could have been clearer.",
                "It felt very abstract and I wish that we got a better conceptual overview of the topics, because the problems on the PSets and exams didn't feel grounded in concrete information since I felt like I didn't actually understand how the topics function.",
                "The lecture was generally not very engaging and not always in line with the problem sets. The sections were much more helpful, but the quality of the section varied according to the teaching assistant.",
                "I thought that the lectures never translated into the difficult application of these concepts in the problem sets from the lectures",
                "Personally, I think sometimes the material on PSETs did not accurately reflect the information we learned in lectures. I sometimes found it difficult to apply the concepts in the abstract to the actual problems we were given. I do think this course covered a ton of material in a short amount of time, which was one of its strengths.",
                "Strengths are that the course is well organized, and there are many opportunities to go over any content you don't understand. The downside is that not many people are excited about the course content. I think the course could do a better job on that front.",
                "The TA's were amazing and offered a lot of support. The professor is the worst professor I have had in over 4 years at Yale and is a horrendous person with no regard for her students. I hope other students will not allow her to smear the entire department. Again the TA's were exceptional.",
                "One strength is the number of resources available to get help. I also enjoyed the hybrid format, so I decided to watch the lectures instead of going to class because it was more convenient.",
                "Strengths - Good review material provided.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - There can be questions on exams that student's have never encountered previously."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. This is a good introductory class for anyone, even if you think you aren't interested in economics. This a good class where there is logic behind the math, and there isn't a lot of math in it either. You get to learn from world renowned professors and see the way the world works through a different lens. I would recommend going to weekly sessions and attending lectures in person, it made all the difference.",
                "Yes, but if you know you will not show up to lectures, take the seminar instead.",
                "Yes if you will use it for your major, if not as a major prereq don't take, or take credit/D. Very dry learning of theory so unless you are interested enough to continue with econ, take something else",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course alongside too many other courses.",
                "Not unless youre an Econ major",
                "I am not sure",
                "Unless you really have to take this course, no. Please don't feel pressured to take economics just because it's \"helpful for life.\" This course really won't teach you that many skills or lessons that are relevant for your own monetary adult life later on. Unlike many other courses at Yale, this course did not shape my understanding of the world in any significant way. On a week to week basis, I was just frustrated to look at the same graphs again and again.",
                "I would not recommend this course to the average student. I feel like there's some weird pressure that people feel to take econ even if they don't think they're going to study it, and I'd say it's not worth the bragging rights. I don't feel that much more knowledgeable and it mostly made me angry.",
                "Only if you are seriously interested in economics and have a good sense of math.",
                "Yes. This is a pretty straightforward QR, and the material taught is actually interesting and useful information. Even if you are not an Econ or EP&E major, I would recommend taking this course.",
                "Even if it's not a requirement, I would recommend the class (especially if the student is undecided on their major since it counts as a pre-req for multiple majors. The class is not a gut but it's also not super draining and if you haven't previously taking microeconomics (like myself) you'll learn a lot of basic info that I think is important to be aware of!",
                "Definitely if anyone has any interest in economics at all. While micro focused less on how modern economy is overall it still touched upon various topics and is a great gateway to learning the bigger concepts.",
                "I would. It is also a prerequisite for a number of majors so it's not like one has much of a choice regardless.",
                "I would reccomend this course to another student because it gives you an understanding what econ at yale looks like. If you want to major in econ then it gives you an understanding of what the workload looks like. If you are not interested in majoring in econ dont take it.",
                "If you are not STEM or thinking of majoring in Econ...run from this course!!! It is not worth your time and pretty much all just maths.",
                "I would recommend this course as an introductory class for anyone interested in diving into Econ. It can occasionally be boring or tedious, but it was in the end a good experience for me.",
                "This is a great introductory economics course. The first half is a little boring and covers pretty basic topics, however the second half of the course introduces some really interesting economic principles used in every day life.",
                "If you are interested in economics, this is a great trial class to see if it is your cup of tea  I hated economics in high school and absolutely loved this economics class at Yale its made me double major in econ which is saying something! Definitely worth taking.",
                "This is an intro course, and you have to take it to move on in economics.  I wouldn't recommend this course to another student to take for fun, but it was administratively very well-organized and I felt well-supported in my learning, even though I did not find the course content super interesting.",
                "Yes. It is a good introductory course, but the student must have an interest in economics to take it, otherwise it is difficult.",
                "yes! i think everyone should take an economics course if they can. and actually sit and engage with the material!",
                "Probably not. I just didn't like the material but that could be personal to me.",
                "This is a great course that every one should take. I can see the principles we learnt in class apply to real-life situations.",
                "Yes. I think that every student at Yale should have this information to understand any profession and all the future work that they will do.",
                "Yes. I think it broadens your thinking scope and provides different perspectives to looking at issues",
                "If you want to learn about econ, yes. If youre just looking for an easy Qr credit, know that you do have to put in work to succeed.",
                "Yes I would. I believe even as a non Econ major, this content was interesting and I believe relvent knowledge to have going into the world. The workload wasnt too bad and there are many resources to succeed.",
                "useful to hve basic level understanding of econ concepts but tricky applications of algebra. knowledge of calculus very convenient.",
                "As far as I'm aware, this is a much better class than the seminar (ECON 110). The grading is more generous, you can drop the three lowest psets (although I don't know if they'll maintain that policy moving forward), the exams are all open-note (again, don't know if they'll keep it that way in the fall) and the TFs are readily available if you need help. Professor Goldberg is very knowledgeable with the material and brings in a lot of interesting examples from the real world in her lectures. I admit I found the lectures a bit dry and technical sometimes, but if you're a prospective Econ major this is probably the best intro micro class available.",
                "Sure if you are looking to major in economics",
                "yes - everybody should understand how the economy works (at least somewhat)",
                "Yes, it was a great course!",
                "Yes! Great Professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted to get a feel for econ.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any students interested in gaining a fundamental understanding of economics.",
                "Yes! I think that knowing economics concepts is helpful for understanding the world around you.",
                "I would recommend this course content-wise. However, I would caution specifically seniors against taking this course. I got sick at the time of final exams and was given the option to get a zero on my exam or make up the exam in the fall, thus not fully graduating. This was a real shame after a full semester of effort and dedication.",
                "Yes. Good intro class",
                "I would-- but the student would also need an explanation of the accompanying resources and how to utilize them-- such as which office hours to go to since the Tfs varied so greatly in their ability to explain the material. If you are struggling, going to office hours does not help you catch up-- it only benefits people who already understand the material on their own.",
                "I would recommend this class if anyone has any interest in economics. While I do not plan on being an economics major, this class gave me a good foundational knowledge about economics.",
                "No, unless you need it for your major",
                "Yes if youre majoring in Econ or need a QR",
                "yes, its necessary to think financially and understand economic principles",
                "Yes, because it gives you an interesting perspective of the world and better understanding of how political decisions are made.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to the financial sector and economics.",
                "I would recommend this course only if the student is in need of the QR requirement and is interested in politics or global affairs.",
                "yes i would. the stuff you learn in this class is good knowledge for any responsible citizen. it goes at a nice pace and is generally interesting",
                "Yes, it's a great introduction and can help you decide if you want to major in economics of any form.",
                "Yes, if you want to pursue economics or even just try the class out, I think this class provides a pretty solid understanding and foundation for college economics.",
                "Yes. Dummy fun. Class was easy and interesting. Theres a sort of community. All answers are provided in TF office hours and Professor office hours are fascinating. Penelope is great. Like sort of astounding.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student because I felt that I did learn a great deal about introductory microeconomic concepts.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course for people who don't need it for a major requirement. There are better classes to get your QR requirement and it's not very engaging if you are not going to pursue economics in the future.",
                "No unless you are set on being an economics major I would not recommend this course",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are trying to decide if they are interested in the subject or not. I think this course pretty clearly communicates what its like to study economics and whether its for you or not.",
                "I would recommend if you haven't taken micro before. If you've covered a bit of micro,this course is probably still worth it. If you've taken a full intro econ course though, you can probably skip 115.",
                "If it is taught by anyone other than Pinelopi Goldberg, I would recommend it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was challenging but I learned a lot of new information."
