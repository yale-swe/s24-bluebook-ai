                "I learned a bit about how to use python for data analysis, but frankly I don't feel like I learned all that much in this class",
                "This course was great at introducing the material in an accessible way that did not assume prior knowledge of physical concepts or use of laboratory equipment. The pre-labs explained background knowledge thoroughly, and the pre-lab questions both cemented my understanding of the behavior of a system of study and helped frame our investigations in the lab. Lab handouts contained detailed instructions indicating how to set up an experiment, use a certain measuring device, and investigate the properties of a system. I enjoyed developing measuring plans for certain investigations. The process of determine what we can measure, how we can measure it, and how we can extract unknown quantities from these measurable quantities was extremely helpful in furthering my understanding of the physical properties of the system we were studying and I believe it prepared me well for other laboratory courses here at Yale.  This class was stressful at times because of the workload for any given lab. There were a lot of investigations per lab, and many questions per investigation that were not always clearly laid out, which meant that my lab partner and I often scrambled during the lab period to take data and then spending a lot of time analyzing it as homework. I think scaling back some of the labs would help students more deeply learn the material and data-collection process, which they could access easier in later labs, and would not sacrifice the breadth and depth of material learned through these investigations.",
                "I learned to work with real equipment such as multimeters, generators, and oscillators as well as code and graph data using python",
                "I learned error analysis but not much else.",
                "I learned some basic error propagation techniques, how to operate a lot of different lab instruments, and how to operate LoggerPro software to collect data.",
                "Not much. I should have been more dexterous in the lab, but the sheer amount of work required in the lab barely allowed me to focus on working on my hands-on skills. It might be me (and some of my friends who shared this same sentiment), but I just did not takeaway much from this class.",
                "Basic physics error analysis (formulas, but not so much the reasoning behind them). Understanding of the basics of running a physics experiment  and a variety of tools (oscilloscope, voltmeter, etc). We also had a chance to see concepts like Hooke's law and electricity in action.",
                "I learned how to efficiently perform labs. I learned how to use Python to create plots, graphs, and histograms. I also learned more about a few topics which weren't really covered in my physics classes (RC Circuits, AC circuits, optics).",

                "Python, Jupyter and Matplotlib. Error analysis. Use of digital logger software, electronic components and oscilloscopes. Good hands-on accompaniment to physics class, really helps with the intuition for things like gyroscopic precession and nutation, as well as electromagnetism and optics.",

                "Doing theoretical-like work with pre labs, constructing our own experiment plans, writing up our lab reports, and answering lots of questions throughout to enhance our understanding of the material"

            "comments": [
                "I can't really think of many strengths. This course was a lot of work for very little reward. This course would be more effective if it was turned into something like \"intro to python and data analysis for physics\" where for the majority of the course you learn python and data analysis techniques like error propagation, and closer to the end of the course you do a handful of labs to apply the techniques.",
                "This course effectively introduced the process of experimental design, error analysis, and concepts in experimental physics that can be applied to a wide variety of physics classes and situations. The pace of a given lab section was a bit too fast sometimes, and some labs seemed to have too many investigations than what we had time for in the lab section. I think reducing the intensity of some of the investigations for some of the labs, or making them optional, would help students understand the lessons taught in each section of the lab handout more profoundly, which would enable them to better apply the skills and knowledge learned to other labs and in other areas of experimental physics.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it allows you to really visualize physics concepts in mechanics as well as improve on graphing your data.",
                "The work is very tedious and does not feel productive or conducive to learning. With often >8 hours of work a week, the course should definitely not be 0.5 credits. It feels like it needs to be significantly reworked with a bigger focus on learning Python to be helpful. I felt like we only needed about a week to learn error analysis, but it seemed that was the main goal of the course.",
                "The workload was very very high.",
                "The experiment guides were sometimes very helpful, and sometimes distressingly vague. Some weeks the number of different tasks expected in one class period meant we didn't really have the time to absorb and discuss the results we were getting, which left me feeling like I hadn't learned very much from the experiment. \r\n\r\nThe last week we were given one mandatory task and allowed to choose our second experiment, which was much more manageable as it allowed us to play around with the setup, and really understand what we were doing. \r\n\r\nMy main suggestion would be to scale back the volume of tasks expected in one lab, and perhaps have one or at max two different experiments. I would also recommend overhauling the experiment guides to be standardized, and editing them for clarity.\r\n\r\nThe prelabs and homework often require Python, and I did lose a lot of time the first few weeks trying to understand how Python works, since the suggested code didn't always do what I needed it to. In later weeks they would give us pre-coded example workbooks that we could modify to analyze our data, and that was very helpful.",
                "Such a time-sucker. Prelabs are too much and better set as optional. The activity guide contains too many experiments, too many instructions, too many tasks. Dont take me wrongthese are totally appropriate for a 1 credit class. But for 0.5 credit class, it just felt an intrusion on our Fridays. But Sierra was the sweetest. She was not only kind in guiding us through 3 hours of lab-orious work in class, but also generous in grading.",
                "Experiments often contained more to do than was reasonable in 3 hours, especially if we wanted to deviate a little from the planned experiment and explore the uses of various devices (which, in my opinion, is what makes the course fun\/worthwhile). As a result, students end up staying late, or conducting sloppy experiments in a rush to get data, and then doing sometimes 3+ hours\/week of out of class analysis\/lab notebook writing (in addition to prelabs\/reading). The class could be improved by cutting down a little on the planned activities, and encouraging experimentation (I thought, for example, that lab #11, optics, did this really well).\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the instructors, they did an excellent job answering questions and facillitating exploration. When my partner and I wanted to investigate outside the bounds of the planned experiment, they were very supportive.",
                "there is an insane amount of writing in this course. I don't think that the course should change but Yale should definitely give writing credit for this class.",
                "The class effectively taught us how to perform physics experiments and display data. However, it would be great if more python graphing templates were provided for students with less coding experience, so they are not at as much of a disadvantage when working on the prelabs and labs, which can be very frustrating without that experience.",
                "unnecessarily tedious",
                "more independence in designing your own experiment.",
                "Extending lab reports to 11:59 pm on Friday half way through the semester was a literal godsend. Strengths were in instructors who wrote vital information and equations on the board, clarified the lab guides, helped us perform experiments, and gave us feedback on our work. Weakness was sometimes it felt the labs could not be completed in three hours and the write-ups took too long, having busy work ingrained in the lab summaries themselves. Pre-labs seemed like busy work for most part, you really only needed equations or concepts for the labs, not all the efforts the pre labs put you through."

This lab gives a good introduction into the process of experimental design and uncertainty analysis while also teaching physical concepts in an accessible way. The workload is a lot and lab work can often be tedious. But I believe that this course prepares you well for more laboratory physics courses, and they way it teaches a wide array of topics in physics helped me solidify my understanding of these concepts. Overall, I think this class is a good introductory physics lab sequence and I would recommend it to physics students who are interested in experimental physics and in taking more physics labs at Yale.",

                "I would recommend this course with the caveat that it requires A LOT of work outside the lab, more than the half credit it is assigned.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you take a lot of pictures and videos, and email copies of everything to yourself and your lab partner, because you will not have time to complete your lab notebook in class and you will NOT remember everything two days later.",

Felt like too much work for relatively low payoff, which was frustrating because many of the experiments we do are genuinely very interesting, especially towards the end. When my partner and I had time to deviate fron the planned experiments, and investigate what was interesting to us (eg. powering an LED through induction), it was quite fun, but this was a small percentage of the time I spent on the class.",
