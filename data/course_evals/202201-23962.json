                "In taking this course, I really enjoyed tracing thematic and stylistic through-lines from Don Quixote to Omeros. This class gave me skills for intertextual connection. I practiced taking a text and quickly noting it's narrative voice, its unique literary features, and its relationship to other things I'd read. Most of all, I really enjoyed the works we looked at, and I was grateful to Dr. Soles for introducing fun and novel ways of thinking about and connecting to them.",
                "I learned and gained a foundational background to literature of the Western canon in the premodern and modern eras. I learned how to have meaningful discussion about various works of literature and think critically about how each work interacts with its predecessors while also contributing to its own unique style. Additionally, I learned how to write meaningful literary analyses in deconstructive ways.",

                "Strengths: The structure of the course.\r\nWeakness: Too much content, too little time to discuss.",
                "Strengths: the books, some incredible lectures, detailed paper feedback\r\nWeaknesses: towards the end of the semester, the Literature track assigned multiple full-length books to finish over a weekend. Combined with the already increasing coursework in other courses, this made the workload almost unmanageable. This affected class discussions, where it seemed that a large portion of the class wasn't participating as they could not complete the required reading. It's valuable to finish an entire work of literature, but quantity of pages assigned and quality of discussion/participation can often have an inverse relationship.",
                "The course material was very rich. I enjoyed our discussions, loved having class outside, and saw value in the recitation assignment. One particular strength I noticed in this course was a general sense that many different types of contributions in class discussion were welcome. It is hard to teach to students with different sensibilities and backgrounds, and it always seemed like people could bring themselves fully to the seminar table. (At least I felt that way.) \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was that it sometimes felt a bit undisciplined. We meandered through the text and were not always economical in our use of our limited time. There were points, especially during readings of Don Quixote and Swann's way, when our conversation ventured quite far from the next, which felt imprudent given how short our class-time was. I also sometimes found it odd how much time we spent reading long passages aloud. It was nice to hear the text vocalized, but it felt potentially avoidant of other more content-based activities.",
                "Strength - the syllabus is incredible. I also liked the opportunity to get clear and consistent feedback on writing.\r\nWeakness - class conversations were often dull. Professor Soles is very passionate about the texts, but has trouble communicating that passion in a way that creates engagement for students. Many people skipped class.",
                "The strength of this course is its remarkable syllabus, fast pace, and engaged faculty. The lectures are likewise generally insightful and engaging.\r\n\r\nCourse could be improved by grading students more strictly and permitting fewer extensions. This would encourage deeper and more rigorous engagement with the course."

My biased viewpoint is that Fall is better (for various reasonsit's still fresh and exciting, and I think the texts are more interesting), but this is not necessarily a popular opinion (I can see the appeal of the Spring as well). The books this semester are crucial to understanding modern culture and society: H&P will show you the development of the language of natural rights; Philosophy, new systems of ethics and ways of understanding the world; and Literature, evolutions in literary styles and how texts respond to each other and the world around them. It will also show you how the books you read in the Fall set the terms, in many ways, for an intergenerational dialogue that still continues. It's also very rewarding feeling to finish an entire year of the course!",
                "Yes, I would! Dr. Soles is a fun and open-minded professor who teaches great analytic skills. His classroom was an environment into which I was always excited to step, and he is clearly passionate about the texts we studied and their histories inside the literary academy.",
                "YES! I loved Directed Studies Literature! Professor Riley Soles is a perfect match for this course. This course is a deep dive into a wide array of texts, enabling students to explore many different areas of literature.",
