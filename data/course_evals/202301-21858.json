                "I learned so many things in this course. Melville was a great writer and Professor Bromwich is a master of the literature and the history during the times the prose was written, and personal details about the author. All of these layers made the course exceptional.",
                "This course gave me a comprehensive look into the world of Herman Melville. While we read the entirety of Moby Dick, the course also expanded beyond the book to look at Melville's early and later works. We read additional readings which supplemented our discussion of Melville, situating us in his world. This class was made incredible by its teacher, David Bromwich, who shares his incredible insights into the texts.",
                "I learned about the historical and literary contexts surrounding the writing of the novel Moby-Dick and was able to read supplementary texts that further enriched my understanding of this central novel.",
                "Not particularly different from any other English class, but Professor Bromwich brings a rigor to discussion that's sometimes lacking elsewhere. He means every word he says, and expects everybody else to mean every word they say. That means he doesn't tolerate half-formed thoughts, but engages thoroughly with earnest ideas."

                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Bromwich\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n\r\nnot enough time.",
                "Need a good amount of background on Emerson and transcendentalist thinkers I think, which I lacked",
                "Professor Bromwich is obviously very intelligent, but it often feels more like a lecture than a seminar when he speaks. The first portion of class will be a lot of him giving his thoughts on the readings, which can take a while. He also has the tendency to cut into peoples comments when they speak, which isnt annoying, but if its something that youre not used to, then you may not like the way he teaches.",
                "Strengths - Bromwich is a leading voice in literature and shares his wonderful insights with the class. He is funny and nice, and encourages students to share their thoughts but holds us to very high standards, correcting misinterpretations of the text. I really enjoyed the option to write a reading journal as opposed to a final paper, it really was nice to see a collected log of what the readings each week made me consider! Weaknesses - It would have been nice to have a packet of the supplementary readings given to us during the first half of the semester so that we did not have to rely on the web print outs.",
                "Professor Bromwich is an extremely eloquent and knowledgeable speaker on the topic of this course, and it was an honor to be in the presence of a person as well-versed in the material, let alone have hour-long discussions with him. It often felt enlightening to speak closely with Professor Bromwich, either in class or during one-on-one conversations during office hours. \r\n\r\nMy one critique would be that it would sometimes be difficult to contribute to the conversations in class if they stayed on a particular topic / area of the book or reading in question. It felt unnatural to suddenly switch topics. (However, I think that Professor Bromwich navigated this well and would often steer the conversation in different directions over the course of the class period.) I also feel like Miltons Paradise Lost should have been incorporated into the supplementary readings for the class, given the number of times it was referenced in class discussion.",
                "Moby-Dick was an amazing book, and the supplemental readings were equally fascinating. I wish the seminar discussions had perhaps been a bit more energetic, with more people participating, but other than that I loved the course.",
                "Overall great class, but I felt it lost steam towards the end. The course was ostensibly centered around a single book, but by the second or third month (even before we had finished reading it) we got mired in cyclical discussions about other readings, including many that Professor Bromwich hadn't assigned."

                "I would recommend this course to other students. The immersion in the work, the discussions with my classmates, and the gift of context from Professor Bromwich were all amazing.",
                "It was a particularly wonderful experience to be able to read Moby Dick slowly, giving each chapter the attention it deserves. I learned a lot about Melville's life, including about his peculiar friendship with Hawthorne. Being able to write a journal instead of a paper gave us the freedom to make observations without the pressure of having to connect them artificially, which I really liked. Of all the courses I have taken with Professor Bromwich, this course has been my favorite because of how excited he was about Melville. Additionally, he has a knack for reading aloud, and this made class particularly pleasurable and entertaining. I will never forget the energy in the room when he momentarily transformed himself into Ahab, asking \"Now what do ye do when ye see a whale, men?!\"",
                "Please take this class! Professor Bromwich is a teacher that all Yale English students need to have at least once. He is genuinely so interested in the life and work of Herman Melville, and his personal interest is demonstrated in the way he gets extra excited about certain readings and topics of discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course to people interested in reading Moby-Dick but who either need to take a class to read it (I largely place myself in this category) or who would like to have context and a better understanding of its references and allusions while reading it. Professor Bromwich is a truly wonderful professor and I would recommend taking any course that he is teaching, but I do think that the student would need to be at least somewhat interested in 19th-century American literature to truly enjoy this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to English majors or anyone interested in Moby-Dick. The historical and philosophical content of the class is very valuable. I also think anyone at all interested in America would benefit greatly from the wisdom of the texts.",
                "YesProfessor Bromwich was a wonderful teacher, and Moby Dick is a fantastic book.",
                "Take it! Moby-Dick rules, and Bromwich knows a lot about it."
