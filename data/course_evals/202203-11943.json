I like how Professor McCarthy sort of took a multi-level approach, starting with cell signaling and ending with stress and moral decision making. It gave a taste into so many different areas of currrent neuroscience reserach and makes me feel like I can at least critically skim any news or media related to brain studies.",

                "Through NSCI 160, I gained foundational knowledge in a wide plethora of different neuroscientific topics, from reward systems to social behavior to stress and arousal.

Although I initially found some of the more granular, physiological concepts difficult to wrap my head around, the resources provided by the course website helped me crack them. I thought the class got increasingly interesting and rewarding as it moved into higher-order social\/behavioral psychological functions, but that just might be my taste.\r\n\r\nPeople are gonna try to freak you out about the final, but its really not bad if you prepare for it. My advice is to go through the p-sets at the end of the semester and practice responding to them. And also make sure you know where important functional areas of the brain are. Lastly, some flash cards will go a long way with forming connections between areas and functions. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Id recommend it.

                "Strength of this class include pre-recorded lectures I can rewatch. Also, the q sets were a great comprehensive review of previously learned material that week.",
                "I think that the biggest weakness and strength of the course was how much information was available. While I appreciated the access to previous lectures and the website, it did become kind of overwhelming and I found myself worried that I was missing out on crucial information.",
                "Strengths: Professor McCarthy. He's a genius and an incredible teacher able to take so many complicated concepts and present them clearly without sacrificing too much detail. Weakness: I wish that Professor McCarthy offered in-person review sessions or office hours.",
                "The course is extremely well thought out and designed. I think other lecture courses this size in biology\/life sciences have section, which would be a better use of TA time than the current office hours structure, in terms of student support.",
                "Posted review sessions were very helpful",
                "The way the course is designed is very well done. Prof McCarthy sets us all up for success with the comprehensive in-person lecture, access to lecture notes, and recorded lectures. He also runs comprehensive review sessions quite often, especially for the final. He puts in the work and does a very good job! A weakness is that there is no mid-term so the final is the first time we are assessed. I think I would have committed more of the knowledge to memory if we had to memorize it for a mid-term first. I did like the PSETs being timed because it was better for time management but I just think one mid-term would have made me learn more! At the expense of a little more stress of course. I think that could be balanced by weighting the mid-term low. I also think the quick quizzes weren't very effective because I never was prepared for them and they didn't promote learning, they just took away from my grade.",
                "Strengths: ...\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3-hour q-sets that take almost the full time with ambiguous grading rubrics, an insane amount of information that you are expected to memorize, a professor that prides himself on having no curves and few A's, too many readings",
                "The timed q-sets every week are incredibly stressful to not only complete but plan to complete. 3 hours in one sitting during the week is challenging to achieve at a reasonable time, especially for students who work. Additionally, the feedback on each q-set is not nearly enough for students to actually understand the correct answer, especially when there is no revision opportunity that would necessitate keeping the correct answer hidden. Speaking of, the lack of any revision opportunity provided no answer key and the lack of a secondary assignment for each unit was highly limiting. There was no way to demonstrate the development of knowledge after the q-set, it was almost like the q-sets were weekly take-home tests on the material. Considering that much of the final exam is memorization of terms, the fact that the class drops material as soon as it's covered is extremely nonconducive for actual learning of the material. Further, the weekly quick quizzes provided no tangible learning benefit. Held at the end of Wednesday's lectures, these quick quizzes covered material students were just introduced to the night before, which did not facilitate learning whatsoever.\r\nProvided that the answers to these quick quizzes were withheld for long stretches after their completion further hindered learning. The professor cited a desire to gauge learning as the reason for their existence and a lack of completion of them in prior years as the reason for them being graded, however, while the reason for them is understandable, making them a part of students' overall grade for that reason doesn't make sense. It would make so much more sense if they were the same amount, but as completion instead of accuracy.",
                "The quizzes were very hard which I did not think actually helped me learn but instead brought a lot of stress.",
                "It is super well-structured, but I wish we were supported in studying\/preparing for the final exam earlier. I would have changed the way I reviewed the material every week for the Qset if I had been more prepared for what the final would look like. Also, I found the quick quizzes to be kind of difficult -- never really got the hang of them because doing well relied on being able to recall very specific facts mentioned in lecture, many of which were not emphasized. Still, this course is a fun challenge, and you can learn a lot from it!",
                "There is a lot you need to know for the course and the weekly quizzes plus Qsets were, while informative, were quite hard for me. The class also goes at a fast pace. Though, I came into the class with a quite weak biology background (and the professor makes it known that he will be expecting background in biology going into the class) and this class is a neuroscience prerequisite, so I understand that the class is catered to a very different audience than me. So my commentary can only be as someone interested in the psychological aspects. I also had a heavy course load alongside this course, so I would say that this course is one that you should take alongside a lighter overall course load.",
                "Students were provided with a wealth of resources and information, such that when the sheer amount of content covered in class was too much to get during class time, students had plenty of supplementary resources (website, pre-recorded lectures, etc.) that can help them ensure they are on top of course content. The content itself was also very interesting, such that I  was highly engaged with the course throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nDue to the sheer amount of content that needs to be covered in NSCI 160, it is understandable that understanding course material and completing coursework can feel overwhelming much of the time. Much of this feeling could likely be alleviated if the material covered in lecture, in written form on the course website, and in the pre-recorded videos were the same. In particular, the order and breadth of information often differed significantly between the website and the in-person lecture, leaving students stressing about how much they are supposed to know about.",
                "This course was by far the hardest I took this semester as there was an abundance of material and lectures never went over previous information as it was all expected to be memorized immediately. Therefore, the class was always very overwhelming, at least for me. However, that being said I found the material really intriguing I just had to do a lot of work outside the class to teach myself the material on top of the homework.",
                "strengths: very interesting content, Professor McCarthy is a neuroscience genius and he's super passionate \r\n\r\nweaknesses: We're expected to know way more than we can retain in our heads. It would be helpful to refresh on previous lessons and give students a chance to improve their understanding. Additionally, the quick quizzes which required us to memorize super-specific facts were not helpful and stressful.",
                "I think it would be helpful to have more opportunities to practice answering questions in the same format as the final exam. The qsets were very helpful for understanding and reviewing material but I felt unprepared for the types of questions asked on the final even after reviewing the content.",
                "The course was extremely interesting, but the final exam was too focused on specific topics and not as generalized as the learning throughout the semester had been so I think that that could have been improved.",
                "I think the Quick Quiz method of evaluation wasn't the fairest considering it was right at the end of an hour-long lecture where the instructor unpacked a lot of key concepts wrapped in technical jargon we were still learning. I would love for it to have been due a few hours after class so I could take the time necessary to review the content after listening to the full lecture for the details to really cement themselves into my mind before being asked to take the quizzes. While intended to be low-stress and honor high effort, it was my largest source of stress this term.  \r\n\r\nOther than that, the lecture notes and recorded videos were incredibly helpful for committing the content to memory! And the review sessions were invaluable as well to my learning. Professor McCarthy is an engaging lecturer and he's incredibly communicative via EdDiscussion, which allowed us to ask our questions about the course content and beyond, as well as learn from our classmates' inquiries.",
                "This course was very organized, in that each lecture topic was clearly defined and laid out with lecture notes provided beforehand. The timed Qsets also held me accountable in understanding the content, which I found to be really helpful in prepping for the final.",
                "Strengths: The workload of the course is much more manageable than it seems at first glance; besides one single Q-set per week (for which a significant amount of flexibility is allowed), there are really no other assignments. In addition, the lowest Q-set and quick quiz grade are dropped, which is incredibly helpful. A student can expect to do well on the Q-sets by simply coming to lecture and paying attention to the material. However, the final exam does require a considerable amount of studying to do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the quiz quizzes were not particularly helpful to my learning of the material, especially considering that many of the questions consist of simply naming brain areas, information which may not be fully solidified at that time. During lecture, I tend to focus on understanding how a concept works rather than making sure I remember the name of the brain area. In addition, it did not help that the quick quizzes cover two lectures instead of one, since material from the Monday lecture is less recent and harder to recall.",
                "The strengths were that there were a variety of interesting topics that were covered in the class. The weakness is that there was so much content and it was hard to understand such a wide array of topics. I wish the main ideas were emphasized a bit more.",
                "Strengths: A lot of review material, makes it easy to catch up if you miss a lecture and there are multiple opportunities to learn any particular concept. The lecture notes and previous lecture videos were very clear and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course covers a broad range of topics and since there is no midterm exam, it's difficult to know what topics to focus on and to what level of detail by the time the final rolls around. Also, because the QSets are open note, there isn't an emphasis on memorizing information until the final which makes it more difficult to retain everything.",
                "There is sooooo much content. It is truly A LOT of work... it's good if you have the time and energy for it but otherwise please reconsider taking this class.",
                "As a Psychology student not used to the STEM workload, adapting to this course was VERY difficult. I had no idea how to remember the sheer amount of material we learned. I wish the office hours were more attainable. Since the QSETs were timed, I would just struggle through questions without any help, and there didn't seem to be a huge point going to a TF since we were already moving onto the next topic. Simply making help more accessible would be useful. It was also hard to stay focused during lecture because of the lack of engagement. This could be fixed by inserting some sort of PollEv or other activity. Nonetheless, the material we learned was SO interesting.",
                "I think the organization of this class is absolutely perfect. The weekly QSets push students to review the material and get familiar with it progressively over the course of the semester instead of cramming for a midterm. The weekly Quick quizzes also set clear expectations about the level of memorization expected from students. The thing that is most unique about this class is the pure amount of resources available to students. Besides standard office hours, Professor McCarthy also holds weekly review sessions to prepare for the QSets, posts old lectures online, posts review lectures online, and types out all material covered in lecture. I am so grateful for the organization and resources of this course.",
                "Really liked the low weight placed on the final exam. Would have learned more if the quick quizzes were less brute memorization and more conceptual.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, having a set p-set time (3 hours a week) was helpful for workload, interesting material \r\nWeakness: there is A LOT of material to keep track of when the final rolls around but it ended up being reasonable; Quick quizzes are annoying",
                "Professor explains concepts very clearly, and I love that he has a website with all the notes and lecture videos.",
                "Strengths: The QSets are my favorite part of this course. They make up 80% of your grade and are open-book, open-internet, meaning you can use Professor McCarthy's very helpful website. You can also take them whenever you want before the due date. This is a perfect model in my opinion, because the QSets are hard enough that you can't just learn everything in the 3 hours they give to you, so you are motivated to learn the content, but they aren't high-stress. Also, Professor McCarthy holds weekly review sessions and is very active in the Ed Discussion along with the TAs to answer questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of content. This makes studying for the final exam difficult, but this course is better thought of as a marathon instead of a race. The final exam is less important than how you perform all semester.",
                "Although the course is remarkable in its breadth, I really felt like I was constantly struggling all along. Because there is a lot of material to cover, the pace of the course is incredibly fast and for a person like me who has not taken a science course for 5 years, it was very difficult to adapt to this particular way of thinking and truck along.",
                "Strengths: fascinating contents, professor puts his heart and soul into it\r\nWeaknesses: I found it hard to focus in class cause its a lot of material at once so I watched lectures online on the website but its really based on what kind of learner you are. Either way there will be a way for you to enjoy the class",
                "The course is very interesting, very well organised, and Professor McCarthy is very engaged and knowledgable. I definitely learnt a lot and was extremely engaged in content throughout.\r\n\r\nThe assessment structure is difficult, since finding 3 consecutive hours in a week for qsets is challenging and also gets exhausting. QQs being graded on accuracy was also difficult, and the final exam was cumulative and closed book meant a lot of memorization.",
                "I think that the 3 Hour timed QSETs should not be timed. I performed very well on almost all of these QSETs, however, they helped me to really solidify my knowledge in the topics for the week when I did them. I think giving me more time to be more thorough with my answers will allow me to remember all the information long term.",
                "Strengths: lots of comprehension, great activities and knowledge acquisition. \r\n\r\nWeakness: too much content",
                "Strengths are the material, so interesting. Only weakness is there could be more clarity on anatomy.",
                "One strength is that the very complex information is presented in a digestible manner, such that students can understand even if it is their first neuroscience class. The review sessions held weekly by Professor McCarthy are also helpful in narrowing down the lecture material to what is most important.",
                "So much information for the semester its very hard to memorize but the videos and qsets were so helpful",
                "Strengths: straightforward course format, all content easily accessible online\r\nWeaknesses: too much content for one course",
                "The content should be presented in a more engaging way.",
                "Strengths: qsets honestly helped review material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish qsets were structured the same way as the final so it would be good prep and that the quick quizzes were completion based bc I think the scores on that are dependent on personal rates of learning",
                "It is helpful that Prof. McCarthy frequently repeats important themes related to the course to ensure that we remember them.",
                "The strength was the organization of the course, where each lesson plan was connected and well-sorted. The accessibility was very high as lectures were posted on the website, which allows for students to review concepts that they did not previously understand. The p-sets were also organized in a way that allowed students to learn the material.\r\n\r\nA weakness may be the quantity of material we go over every lecture, which if not learned over time can be an overwhelming amount of material to go over for the final.",
                "strengths: feel like I learned after each qset, prof had weekly review sessions that were very helpful\r\nweaknesses: qq were too hard and too short timer for covering the material just covered that class, qsets shouldnt be timed especially for those with difficulty concentrating for hours straight, the final was way out of pocket (raw score and 9 pages of niche material encompassing everything)",
                "I thought the class was well-organized.",
                "Some strengths of this course were that the topics and lectures were engaging and fascinating. The weekly Psets helped me solidify the key information from the lectures. A weakness of the course was that since the final was closed-book, while the Psets were open note and there was an immense amount of material covered over the course of the semester, studying and memorizing material to prepare for the final was very difficult and time-consuming.",
                "There is far too much material being covered and very little clarity on what should really be studied. It is like pouring every material on the textbook onto the lectures and slides and being expected to be tested on one of the million topics. No study guides on any of the assessments made it even more difficult.",
                "Strengths: taught with interesting case studies, professor was very interested in subject and his enthusiasm carried to his students, very interesting content and course structure was very well planned between topics from week to week, professor is very well rehearsed and brings in recent research which keeps things very fresh and interesting, lecture handouts (on prof's website) was very clear and very helpful towards studying for qsets and finals\r\nWeaknesses: grading structure was very poor (there wasn't any part of the gradebook that wasn't based on a timed assessment (including the qsets which are meant to mimic psets but instead mimic essay finals)) which made me more stressed about grades rather than interested in the content (which is unfortunate since the content is so interesting), slides were basically useless after the lecture if you don't take notes directly on the slides (i.e. if you take notes on a separate notebook) since they are all pictures, teaching fellows were essentially nonexistent in contributing to our learning",
                "Professor McCarthy is extremely consistent in his approach to lectures and assignments. If you have a question and post it on the class discussion, it will be attended to in a timely manner by him or the TFS. At times, it can move very quickly, and you will likely feel yourself struggling to keep up during a specific lecture or concept. It is A LOT of content and any section could likely be its own course. However, if you ask for help, the Professor will do his best to explain it in a way that makes sense to you. He also hosts frequent review sessions. Between those and the lectures, it becomes more manageable. However, with the large amount of content, this class had by far the most difficult final I've taken so far.",
                "The course material was interesting, but the workload was a little intense, and occasionally it was hard to focus in class.",
                "This course is incredibly fascinating if you are willing to put in the work. The professor is an excellent lecturer, obviously brilliant, and much more accessible than I expected, given the lecture is over 200 people. One thing that could be improved are office hours with the professor. He was very responsive to question posted on our discussion board, but I would have loved to ask him questions in person.",
                "This course taught concepts pretty well, especially as the semester went on, and it also had great case studies that helped aid the learning process. When discussing vision, the actually names of neurons and parts got confusing, so spending more time on that could be helpful as well as giving good models in the lecture notes, as models for the specific visual tracts are hard to come by.",
                "The detailed and well-organized lecture notes and recordings are very helpful for self-study.",
                "The course is very thorough  it covers the entire brain  providing a solid basis for neuroscience and psychology. I also enjoyed the clinical approach to the material, as I felt it solidified my understanding of concepts by offering an applied context. \r\n\r\nI did feel that it was too fast-paced for me to fully feel comfortable with all the material, however, I understand that the course is meant to cover a wide range of topics and it is difficult to fit all this information into one semester. I wonder if course pacing could be altered? I do appreciate the accessibility of the course material (lecture notes, recordings, and weekly review sessions), and found these materials to be grounding when chosing the focus for exam review. I think adding a closed-note midterm and having a closed-note non-cumulative (only testing the second half of the course material) final might improve students' ability to retain the information in the course.",
                "Strengths: very detailed overview of brain, learned a lot\r\nWeaknesses: the quick quizzes were extremely detailed and I don't think they properly reflected learning of the material sometimes.",
                "I liked how the course was set up this semester. I thought it allowed for reinforcement of learning. I think I wish at the beginning I had a better idea of the qsets and better feedback on them because it was hard to figure out how to approach them.",
                "strengths: very thorough and in depth of all brain related concepts. \r\nweaknesses: it's a lot of information thrown at you at once.",
                "strength: class has online lectures and online content that are so helpful in reviews\r\nweakness: felt like the final exam was too memorization based",
                "Liked the fact that most of the grade was based on weekly qsets and that encouraged steady learning. Thought that the course could have more emphasis on conceptual understanding instead of facts like the effects\/names of particular brain areas",
                "Strengths: Lots of information to go off of when studying\r\nWeaknesses: Engagement with the class could be improved as well as the detail present on the lecture slide. The amount of information provided makes it difficult to determine what would be tested on the final exam.",
                "Professor McCarthy is a wonderful teacher -- very engaging, passionate, and willing to teach. I think the course can get a bit overwhelming because there is an insane amount of material and it is only in lecture format.",
                "na",
                "The qsets were a very effective way to learn, although setting aside 3 full consecutive hours every weekend was annoying. Professor McCarthy provides ample materials (lecture notes, slides from class, videos of previous years' lectures, and weekly recorded review sessions), so finding the information you need was not difficult, and if you were willing to watch the review sessions you would know the most important information to retain from every week. I do not think the qqs were helpful, since they were super specific and tested short term memory of material instead of real retention of it.",
                "3 hour qsets bad",
                "I appreciated the flexibility offered by this course. While one should certainly attend lectures and read the lecture notes in order to absorb the material of the class, Professor McCarthy's extensive library of recorded lectures and notes allowed students who were absent to easily access the material they missed, and allowed all students to refer back to previous material when studying. While many people dislike the weekly Qsets, I found that I rather enjoyed them. All the answers could be found in the lecture notes, and completing them felt like an effective form of review. They did not, however, prepare me for the single final exam at the end of term, which we all kind of went into blind as there was no midterm or practice exam.",
                "I think the class is a little too anatomy heavy and presents a level of information that is extremely hard to retain and digest over the course of a semester. While I felt very engaged by the content and looked forward to the class, this is not an entry level class and requires skills that are rarely mastered over an undergraduate career. This is my second time taking the class, and I still feel that I was struggling to hold on to even the basic levels of information thsat were given over the course of the class.",
                "I liked how Professor McCarthy taught the class and how he provided lots of resources for us to learn the material (website with lecture notes & previously recorded lectures in addition to in-person lectures, etc.). But there were just lots of things to memorize. I think for someone like me, who is awful at just simple memorization for exams, I would prefer to write papers or do projects that is relevant to the content learned in class.",
                "Strength: Professor McCarthy is an expert in Cognitive Neuro and it is such an amazing opportunity to hear from him. Most of what is known about neuro comes from very recent research in the last 20 years so it is great to hear about such research from such an experienced instructor.\r\n\r\nWeakness: no space for interactions between students and the instructor. Course is unfortunately very one-sided. \r\n\r\nAnother big weakness: Weighted QQs is a very bad idea. Because they were held on Wednesdays, some details may have been forgotten, even if they were important. No chance was left for review. QQs were every stressful every week. While I appreciated the concept of a Qset, I did not appreciate worrying for 0.2% of my final grade for every question I may get wrong on a weekly basis. Maybe having a q-set that incorporates short MCQ questions from a QQ is better. Alternatively, having an unweighted QQ is better and makes learning smoother. I don't mind that extra 10% on the final exam weight.",
                "This course is very content heavy but very interesting.",
                "A strength of this course was that the QSETs make up a majority of your grade. However, some weaknesses are that the QSETs are timed and that the material is explained in a way as if you already know the topic, and the Professor is bad at explaining it in a different way that is easier to understand.",
                "The course is organized into weekly question sets, weekly \"quick quizzes\", and a final. I certainly appreciate not having the stress of a midterm, but there's a caveat: take care to memorize the anatomy presented in the first couple of weeks. You can slide through the question sets consulting your notes but unless you memorize the anatomy, you'll be frequently disoriented during lecture or readings by phrases like \"superior temporal\". Be sure that you can decode these easily."

                "Yes, if they are interested in the material",
                "I would recommend this to someone interested in the human brain, otherwise it would just be a lot of content to grapple with.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anybody with an interest in neuroscience. I was able to learn a lot through the course and I feel like the lectures were very easy to follow (assuming you're in class as it's happening). The class made me excited about what else we'll discover about the brain in the future.",
                "Yes! It's really changed the way I think about the way my body works and even how we behave on a scientific level. Study hard for the final, but it won't make-or-break whether you pass the course if you work on the Qsets through the semester.",
                "Yes, if one needs an understanding of human brain anatomy and physiology, otherwise no",
                "If they're interested in biology and excited to learn everything about the brain, then yes.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot very quickly.",
                "No. Designed to be a weed-out class, so definitely only take it if you absolutely must.",
                "Only if you have to take it. The workload is just too much.",
                "If you don't care that much about your grade, it is a really great opportunity to learn about the brain!! I feel like I've retained a lot of information after a semester of ... a lot of (interesting!) work.",
                "I would. Though I would encourage them to look at Professor McCarthy's website first and make sure this is a course they want to and are ready to take. I cannot speak for other teachers of this course, but he makes his expectations going into the class and the content of the course very clear on his website (impressively so).",
                "This course is very rigorous, and will come as somewhat of a shock, especially for a first-year student. However, if a student is willing to commit to putting in hours of additional study per week in order to understand a tremendous amount of content, that student will find NSCI 160 to be an insightful and rewarding course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter or hoping to pursue the field, but would probably not recommend it to a person doing it for a distributional credit (there are much easier options).",
                "I would only recommend it if they had to take this course or if they were genuinely interested in learning more about the brain since this class is very comprehensive and challenging",
                "Yes! Just go through the p-sets and don't start studying the day before.",
                "The course was extremely interesting, but the final exam was too focused on specific topics and not as generalized as the learning throughout the semester had been.",
                "I would, but I would suggest students start hardcore studying at the beginning of the course. There is no space to fall behind. If the foundations do not cement earlier on in the course, the rest of the content will seem disjointed and incredibly difficult to remember and cement into a full, clear picture. I came in with no previous knowledge of neuroscience and psychology and found it incredibly challenging, but I also loved the content and picked myself up at the end of the term. There are plenty of opportunities to ask questions and learn, but you should enter the class understanding that it's challenging and that you'll have to put a lot of time into this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others if they need it for a prerequisite since it was very interesting. If you don't need it, I would recommend for the challenge, as it is very doable as a non-major.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students with a strong interest in neuroscience, as it provides a much more in depth understanding of the brain than an intro psychology class. All of the concepts taught were novel, interesting, and make you think. I learned a great deal from the class, and would take it again if I could.",
                "The class is very interesting, but be prepared for a high workload.",
                "Honestly, no. If you are a psych major, please consider taking intro to cog sci. This class is just a lot. The lectures are long, the weekly qsets are long, stressful, and hard to prepare for, and the lectures are not quite engaging. If you dont absolutely need to, please don't take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that have the time to devote to it. I really enjoyed the material, and I'm glad I took this course. However, in order to do well, I had to spend a LOT of time with the information.",
                "YES!!!! A million times yes. Especially for people in all majors related to the brain, this information is absolutely crucial.",
                "Definitely, its a lot to take in, but if you make sure youre learning throughout the semester , youll be alright.",
                "Yes if you are not afraid to really put in the work for the p-sets and to stay on top of the material as there is a lot covered. I wish I had done a weekly review each week of my own notes\/the lectures. But it is pretty easy to do well on the p-sets since he has pre-recorded lectures and notes on the website and you are able to finish the p-set comfortably within the 3 hour limit (I usually had about 20 minutes left).",
                "Yes, you learn many aspects of the human brain, and a lot of what you learn in this class sticks with you.",
                "Personally, I loved this course. However, I am someone who is genuinely interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology. If you are not interested in any of those things, and just want a science credit, you'll probably be overwhelmed by this course. There is a lot of content to be learned, and if you aren't interested in at least some of the content, it will suck. However, if you are interested in the human brain, this course is amazing. Professor McCarthy goes quite in depth (but not too in depth, he knows when to tell students they don't have to know something) and provides lots of resources to help students learn.",
                "I would for a Credit\/D\/Fail, because the amount of topics that you have to keep up with is an incredible amount and from time to time, I felt like this was the only course that I was taking because I was putting much greater effort than any of my courses. The topics are very interesting and resources that Professor McCarthy has provided us with were very helpful, but it is a very challenging course. I attempted to write a summary sheet for the final, for instance, and it turned out to be over 300 pages.",
                "Yes!!! It was so interesting and solidified my decision to be a neuroscience major. The content is genuinely fascinating.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in neuroscience! It is a lot of work but also very interesting.",
                "Yes I would. It is a very interesting field\/topic and I feel people would benefit intellectually from learning in this class.",

                "Yes absolutely",
                "I would recommend this course because we were able to review much information about every part of the brain in one semester. It was a great introduction to the neuroscience field, and gave me great insight into what neuroscience topics I am most interested in and want to pursue.",
                "Yes if you interested in neuroscience",
                "Yes for everyone if you take it credit\/d\/fail. Yes for cog sci\/psyc\/nsci\/premed majors, but be prepared for a challenge.",

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in neuroscience, but it is not a gut science course as there is a lot of memorizing involved with this course, and the three hour q-set every week can be a bit time consuming.",
                "only if u need it, credit\/d if not. lots of work",
                "If you're interested in neuroscience, I think this is a really great class! You'll learn a lot about the brain, from evolution to anatomy to function. Something that was helpful for me was setting aside a consistent three-hour block of time to complete the qsets each week (since they're timed and you can't stop once you've started working).",
                "Unless you really have to take it for your major, I would strongly advise taking a different course or studying by yourself to learn about the brain.",
                "I would recommend this course because of its content (i.e. anyone can take this course if they credit-d-fail it) because the content is truly amazing and the professor is also very cool so anyone taking this course is guaranteed to learn a lot. However, this is not the class to take if someone is looking for a gut\/grade boost since the grading is very stressful and somewhat absurd in being all timed-assessment based. It is not the worst class for a neuro\/psych\/cogsci prereq since it does what it intends to do (provide a very solid primer in the human brain and also insight as to how crucial experiments and studies can reveal information about the brain) but it is stressful for a prereq class.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you have an explicit interest in the human brain or concepts in neuroscience and psychology. This course rightfully fulfills a science credit, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart and does not constitute as a class that you would take simply because you need a science credit.",
                "Absolutely-- if they are interested in the brain and are ready to put in a lot of work.",
                "Absolutely. If you are willing to put in the time, it is an incredible course. I am not a STEM\/neuroscience person, so the class was out of my comfort zone, but it is totally doable and became my favorite class.",
                "I would recommend this course to people interested in learning about the functionality of different brain regions.",
                "I would recommend this course! I think it might be a bit more than most are wanting to take on for a science credit (as opposed to taking it for your major), but if you are at all interested in the brain, the material is truly fascinating.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the brain this is a great course to take.",
                "I would! I thought the content was really interesting and it was well taught.",
                "yes. it is a very engaging course however it comes with a large courseload.",
                "Yes only if they want to learn about the specific brain parts and are interested in neuroscience",
                "If you're interested in neuroscience, it's good to learn the fundamentals. Though there is a lot of memorization involved.",
                "Yes this is a perfect introductory course for individuals if they're looking to pursue neuroscience and Professor McCarthy explains the concepts well.",
                "Yes, this is a great introduction to the human brain and it provides much needed foundations for neuro-related majors.",
                "na",
                "Yes, if you have the time and are willing to put effort into this class. It was very interesting material, but the amount of information you are expected to be responsible for is a LOT. Professor McCarthy provides ample materials to help you learn it (lecture notes, slides from class, videos of previous years' lectures, and weekly recorded review sessions), but you will have to put in effort in order to succeed in this class.The qsets, while annoying, are a very effective way to learn, and they are a large percentage of the grade, so if you put in consistent effort every week you don't need to be too worried about the final. I enjoyed this class, and would take it again. Do not take this as a 5th class.",
                "No unless you are a neuroscience major. Its interesting but not worth the torture.",
                "Yes, particularly if it is relevant to your major.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although it is very challenging and there is a lot of content, it is very interesting to learn about our brain, which controls everything that we do.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in neuroscience. If the human brain does not excite you, I would not recommend this class, as this class is difficult and shoves so much information about the brain at you in a short time.",
                "Think of this as a meatier version of Intro Psychology. You learn a lot of the same \"surprising truths\" about human behavior, but presented with a grounding in anatomy and neuroscience. I'd highly recommend it.",
                "Not unless it is required for your major or you are extremely interested in the topic."
