The class also had a fantastic sense of community, even over Zoom, which contributed to my comfortability.",

It is true that you might have to do a lot of work, but I think it's completely worth it, and both Shiri (the prof) and Naama (the TF) support you all the way through.",
                "Yes, because we should all learn hebrew. That said, it felt very class-like which made it kinda stressful and took away from what should have been a low stakes environment. Easier than L5 French but harder than L2 Hebrew so think carefully about the balance of prioritizing learning hebrew, not being stressed, and doing well in the class."
