The class does start out a little slow because of the reading you have to go through, but Seamus makes the class worth it in the end.",
                "This course is incredibly engaging, but it started off a bit slow at first with the amount of readings compared to other sources of media (e.g., movies and musical soundtracks). However, as the course continued it got increasingly engaging. The feedback given by the professor was also incredibly helpful!",
                "This was my absolute favorite class of the semester. We talked about the high school experience from so many different perspectives both through readings and media. The small class size made it really engaging and I loved hearing everyone's perspectives and different high school experiences. Seamus is amazing - so supportive, helpful, enthusiastic, and the class wouldn't have been the same without him. If I had to think of a weakness, it would be that sometimes there wasn't a lot of participation during discussions."

This course does an excellent job of both presenting a wide variety of experiences and helps analyze ones own experience within the spectrum of experiences.",
                "Absolutely. I loved this course not only because I learned to improve my reading, analyzing, and writing skills, but also because the theme of the class is something that everyone has their own experiences and perspectives."
