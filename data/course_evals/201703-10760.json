    "Beyond just understanding many positions and theories that fundamental to the Western academic tradition, I now view a variety of issues from the existence of God to the value of education in a more nuanced, rich way.",
    "How to write a good philosophical essay and analyze texts.",
    "How to write a philosophy paper\r\nHow to read a dense philosophical text and extract the important points\r\nHow to construct a philosophical argument",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy did a great deal for me in helping me develop as a writer and arguer. It exposed me to a myriad of incredible texts that I would not have known to read without the class. Professor De Souza also did a great job of explaining the texts in greater detail. Because of this, I gained a good breadth of knowledge in western philosophy from the classical period through the middle ages, and have developed an interest in studying the subject further.",
    "Overview of the first canon of the western canon",
    "I learned how to analyze philosophical works and write philosophy papers.",
    "I learned in broad brushstrokes the thinking of the philosophers of the Western tradition. I also learned how to critique them effectively through my papers.",
    "This course was a brilliant introduction into the study of ancient philosophy and covered how to read, discuss, and write about philosophy. While the learning curve was steep, I am more confident as a writer and as a philosopher, and am looking forward to taking more philosophy classes.",
    "The first skill I developed is philosophical analysis of arguments. While critical analysis is generally a valuable skill that I felt most people in the class had at the beginning of term, the nature of philosophical analysis is unique. What can pass off as a self-evident truth in other contexts is questionable in philosophy. Analogies and thought experiments are fundamental parts of philosophical discussions to a much greater degree than in other contexts. Skills in these areas, which were heavily present in this class, were my most important development in the class. \r\n\r\nAlso, writing philosophy papers is different from writing other types of papers. The clarity of thought (and words) and argumentative cohesion of a philosophy paper is difficult to attain. This class  got me a little bit closer to being able to write a proper philosophy paper.",
    "I learned the basics of writing a philosophy paper, something I had not done before. I also gained an introduction to philosophical reading and analysis, something man high school students do not have. It is a great intro to western philosophy.",
    "This course was my first introduction to philosophy. I learned how to construct a philosophical argument and how to compare different thinkers' styles and ideas. I also explored many interpretations of and arguments for the immortality of the soul, God, knowledge, and the creation of the universe."

   "comments": [
    "DS Philosophy covers interesting material in good seminars. I especially appreciate that the course took its time over certain works, but also managed to include a variety of authors.\r\n\r\nThe final exam felt somewhat out of place in the writing and discussion focused semester. I think I would rather have written a final paper that allowed a more thoughtful synthesis of ideas from throughout the semester. The lectures were hit-or-miss -- sometimes by great lecturers who helped me to understand what the works were saying or view them in a new way, or sometimes simply boring or unhelpful.",
    "Covers basically all the major authors of ancient philosophy with an emphasis on Plato and Aristotle. Lectures range from confusing to brilliant (Igor's were brilliant) and the discussions are thought provoking.",
    "I really wish we could spend more time on the texts we read - I realize this is difficult with the volume of work but at times it would feel like skimming through 2 texts was not worth going deep into 1.\r\nBeyond that, I really loved our discussions and thought they were some of the most illuminating arguments I had this year.",
    "A great strength of the course, and the Directed Studies program in general, was the deeply personal help each individual student received. I felt that if I had a question, comment or concern, it was not intimidating to voice that. It is absolutely a strength that the course provides such a comfortable environment for students. Professor De Souza did an especially great job at this. I looked forward to going to the seminar every time. In terms of improvement, I think the program could do a better job of not just implementing diversity in the texts, but also explaining socioeconomic constructs that hindered the education and human rights of minorities in western civilization for centuries. I think this context is essential, and perhaps more essential than the basic context of the life of the author. Obviously, this critique could be better suited for the second semester, which covers a time period where minority voices were more prominent and a larger effort was put forth to silent dissent, but I think Directed Studies in general can do a better job of implementing these important contexts to diversity (and lack thereof) throughout the year.",
    "Great overview, pace is very fast",
    "The strengths of this course were that the professor explained everything very well and made it easier to understand. The weaknesses were that sometimes there was so much reading that it was impossible to process everything.",
    "Prof. De Souza was an excellent instructor with a strong command of the material that we went over in the class. He was also a really fun guy who empathized with his students and obviously really cared. I think that class discussions could be improved to go over the arguments of the texts more, but that's a small issue. All around a good course.",
    "The strengths in this course is in the readings and the discussions of the readings, which encourage students to apply their own thinking to the writings. The weaknesses lie in the lack of clear introduction for beginners in philosophy because of the differences in high school backgrounds.",
    "Many strengths:\r\n\r\nThe supporting, welcoming environment fostered discussion and healthy disagreement. \r\n\r\nOur professor was incredible at explaining esoteric, complex arguments in a simple, understandable way. \r\n\r\nOur professor gave fantastic feedback on papers, which not only let us understand our grade but also helped us improve in future papers. \r\n\r\nOur professor effectively related ancient ideas (from Aristotle, Augustine, Sextus Empiricus, etc.) with modern or contemporary philosophy or current events in a manner that made the class extremely engaging. \r\n\r\nThere were others strengths as well, but these were the main ones. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I felt the class occasionally digressed from the most important areas of discussion. In this regard, perhaps the professor could have done a better job at guiding the discussion towards relevant areas. Still, this was not a significant issue.",
    "The course offers some great texts for philosophical exploration, but I think the instructors could do a better job explaining philosophy writing, as students were kid of thrown into writing a philosophy paper with no background.",
    "The strength of this course was that it was a good introduction to a new subject because it began right at the beginning with the most influential thinkers. It also taught you how to analyze arguments more clearly and concisely. A weakness of this course is that sometimes the quantity of reading was excessive especially considering how dense and thought-provoking each line could be. There just never was enough time to process everything."

    "I would definitely recommend taking Philosophy with De Souza - he strikes the right balance between fun and instructive. As to taking DS as a whole, it is something that is a good fit for some and not for others. But overall, the quality of the texts, professors, and discussion outweighed the quirks of an old program and the great workload.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in philosophy. Disclaimer that there's a lot of religious authors so if you're not comfortable with religion or just can't take the idea of God seriously, think twice.",
    "Yes - as long as they are willing to work and are interested in philosophy",
    "Yes. Directed Studies was a great way to improve my writing and reading skills heading into the academic rigors of Yale. Philosophy specifically helped me improve my argumentation skills, and allowed me to have an environment that was very conducive to my personal academic improvement. It is not an easy class, but the program is absolutely worth the work.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, the professor was excellent and I enjoyed the texts we read.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend taking DS. The philosophy part of DS was my least favorite, but that's just me personally. I expected to come into DS and like philosophy the most, but I didn't really enjoy nor engage that much with the texts on the syllabus. That's no fault of the excellent instructor that I had. Prof. De Souza came Into every class very energized and willing to engage his students with the text. The lack of interest in the subject is all on me, not the instructor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students because of the fascinating discussion and high level of intellectual challenge. It emphasizes reading, writing, and discussion, making it a course that improves a student in a variety of areas.",
    "Yes. It helps you think and look at arguments in a completely different light. It is a superb environment for learning about the history of philosophy, but more importantly, for analyzing philosophical arguments themselves.",
    "I would because my writing greatly improved, and I gained a strong foothold in philosophy. For students looking to boost their writing, take this course but it is a challenge.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to someone else. It was very comprehensive and though-provoking."
