Covering a variety of perspectives , the course provided key insights into the ideas and practices of public humanities scholars and professionals in actionfrom literature to film to museums and more. I learned how the paths available to people doing humanities for public audiences work go far beyond the walls of traditional institutions, and was able to participate in such work myself through class projects aligning with my own interests.",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of the course is definitely its content. I wish that there had been a better syllabus up front or if the expectations had been adjusted to take into account that the students weren't made a ware of deadlines in a reasonable amount of time. Also, if there are going to be multiple projects, the readings need to be reduced so that students can dedicate time to finishing up their projects in time without having to juggle hundreds of pages of reading per week on top of that. A fully fleshed out proposal for the group project ended up being extra work and, had we been assigned the groups earlier based on a sentence or two of general interest (not a full proposal draft), then the project may have been more cohesive. As long as expectations are clear from the beginning and realistic, then the course will be the perfect \"Introduction\" to Public Humanities. If instructors intend to keep the syllabus the same, it needs to be out well-before students sign up so they know what they're getting into and change the title to \"Immersion in Public Humanities,\" so that the level of commitment required for the course is better communicated in the title.",
                "Two strengths of the course were its rich and interesting readings and its highly generative class discussions. Readings were interesting both on their own merits, and as examples of the kind of work considered to be public humanities. Because the class was made up of students from a range of backgrounds, discussions always provided insightful new perspectives on these readings. Finally, class projects using the StoryMaps program were an exciting part of the class because students were able to concretely apply the ideas covered in class on their own humanities interests. Because of the breadth of the course, I think that it might have been help to lean more heavily on the historical/theoretical/practical foundations of the \"public humanities\" as a concept at the start of the semester, before delving into examples. Formally identifying important concepts in the readings and returning to them more frequently would be helpful for student comprehension.  Additionally, I think that making the class projects more integrated with course concepts (even at the price of making them slightly more structured, including a certain set of expectations or rubric etc. though this could also be done by having students reflect on these connections in writing) would have helped to make them feel more integrated with the class as a whole.",
                "I loved this course, especially how we focused on a different topic in public humanities every week, and how our assignments and projects were not simply reading and writing, but multimedia to reflect the state of public humanities as a discipline. My only criticism is that I wish we had had a bit more direction on what the final project should look like earlier in the semester, as well as more time to work with our groups on the project. I felt that the groups were assigned too late in the semester, giving us too little time to flesh out lengthy research projects.",
                "I like that a lot of open ended questions were discussed. The group work was good and the guest speakers were too, but the course itself was disorganized, had too much reading, and it had structure just not helpful structure."

                "Yes, but depending on what the syllabus looked like I would let them know that it is much more rigorous than the title suggests.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the ways that knowledge from humanities fields can contribute to society at large, especially to communities outside the bounds of the Ivory Tower of academia. Students should expect more of a gathering of ideas and practices from the class than a formalized curriculum on how to go about \"public humanities\". They should be ready to take initiative in engaging in public humanities themselves, individually and in collaboration with others. Students should also we ready to explore a range of modes of knowledge and professional activity, keeping an open mind and considering each as a potentially valuable source of knowledge. More than a class, this course acts as a pathway towards participation in the public humanities that anyone can take, regardless of their background. You will get out what you are willing to put in.",
                "If you are interested in learning more about public humanities, and experimenting with traditionally non-academic forms of knowledge (e.g. podcasts, documentary, oral history) in an academic format, absolutely yes!",
                "In a different year with a different professor, yes. The material is good but this year the course was just disorganized. Our TA and prof would give different info and deadlines were poorly constructed. This is not a reflection on them, just that they had to jump in to teach last minute. I think a syllabus that's been tried a tested for a few years would fix these issues so I recommend taking in a normal year."
