                "Really enjoyed how each class was different and unique. I learned many things about Yale and museums in general. The 2 hour lectures can be a bit long at times, but I definitely prefer having a longer class on one day than two shorter ones.",
                "We only met once a week for a three-hour long seminar. At times this would feel like a lot, but the 10-minute break in the middle of class really helped. Asking question was highly encouraged, and my favorite part of the class. Each class guests (librarians that work with the corresponding collection we were looking at that week) came. As they directly work with the material we were exploring that week, they were more than happy to answer all of the questions we had. They were also equally excited to hear what we had to say about the collections.",

Online it was still really interesting, so I remained engaged with each special collection we saw each week. I can only imagine how exciting it would be to be able to visit all the collections in person! There was always something to be learned. In fact, this class has helped me find my new favorite artist (Titus Kaphar) which was very unexpected. In short, this class is an incredibly engaging way to learn both about Yale, but also generally archival work.",
