    "MUSI110 teaches the basic ideas of music analysis, comprehension, and history. I definitely learned some of the more basic technical skills like identifying key signatures, naming\/writing chords, transcription, and some of the harmonic theory.",
    "Basic understanding of notation, key signatures, etc. and the way music is employed in movies and TV to set a mood.",
    "I loved this class!!! I loved learning about the progression of music throughout the 20th century, and in particular loved learning about the blues and jazz genres.",
    "Basics of music theory: sheet music reading, major and minor keys, melodic dictation\r\n\r\nMusic and cultural analysis of many different genres including jazz, blues, pop, and contemporary art music.",
    "I learned music theory along with a solid grasp of music history in the last century or so.",
    "I came in with no knowledge whatsoever of music theory and now I better understand how to read music, the circle of fifths, chords in a key, and how I might go about writing a song. Also, learned some cool stuff about music history.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of music theory-- key signatures, the circle of fifths, major and minor scales, chord progressions, and the blues scale. I improved my ability to transcribe music from ear. We also covered some music history, including jazz, blues, musicals, hiphop, and film soundtracks."

   "comments": [
    "This course started with some very interesting technical material but then stopped moving forward with the theory. I would have loved if we could have gone into actually writing melodies and harmonies, using the theoretical skills that we learned. In the last month of the course, we shifted towards talking about the history and culture related to different aspects of music. This was kind of interesting but also got pretty dry as we would just do 2 readings, a discussion post, and then would spend the entire class period discussing the readings and themes; it got redundant. Again, I wished we did more with writing and composing than analyzing texts.",
    "Strengths: well-organized, we cover a lot of material in one semester; Weaknesses: n\/a, exactly what you'd expect for an intro music theory class",
    "I feel that if this class dedicated more time the basics of music theory, I would have enjoyed this class a lot more. The music history was fine, but there were too many academic papers which was something I didn't expect too much of.",
    "I really liked the structure of the course. Spending the first half of the course studying the fundamentals of music theory was a perfect launching point for the rest of the material. I liked the small size of the class and really enjoyed our seminar-like discussions. I also liked that my peers and I got to give our input on what material we would like to see in the second half of the class. Our assignments helped reinforce topics covered in class, and I really enjoyed working on the final project."

    "I you have a strong interest in music and want to get to the higher-level courses, then you should definitely take this class. Just know that each professor teaches this class very differently, so shop different sections to find what works for you. If you are just looking for a cool elective that involves music, I probably wouldn't recommend this course - the beginning is heavy on technical aspects and the end was a little dry (more history style).",
    "I'd recommend to a student with little music theory background who wants to learn about how to read music, key signatures, all the basics of music.",
    "Yes!!! Super fun, but probably would be a bit challenging if you had 0 musical background",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking this class with Tatiana because she is a great and understanding instructor!",
    "Yes, especially with Tatiana!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. It provides a solid overview of music theory, which is really great for anyone who enjoys music to know. Even people who already know how to read\/ play music benefit from the course because we cover so much more than just learning the staff (that was only the first two weeks)."
