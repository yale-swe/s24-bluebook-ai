    "I have continued to hone my compositional skill set with my private instruction. Moreover, I have learned much from listening to other composers speak and share their work, from practical career advice to new styles of artistic thinking.",
    "I significantly improved my composition skills from my private lessons with my TF and learned much about the many directions and possibilities for composition from the guest lectures.",
    "I continued to hone my skills as a composer.",
    "-composition technique & DAW usage\r\n-orchestration\r\n-business & self-marketing\r\n-insight into the state of concert and film composition as a whole",
    "This course provides great practice for writing concert music, as well as a chance to interact with some of the most influential people in the field today."

   "comments": [
    "This course really benefits from the collaboration between graduate and undergraduate composition students. Grouped all together, we are placed within the same high standard of learning and we are all fortunate to listen to every great guest. Another great strength is the freedom to pursue whichever composition project that we want. This allows musicians from very diverse backgrounds to gather and share their own voice in the class.",
    "This is truly an excellent course; I cannot think of any ways to improve it.",
    "I think better critical response to our pieces would benefit the students greatly",
    "-strengths: engaging guest speakers, accommodating schedule\r\n-weaknesses: could use more structure, direct feedback, a more reliable lesson schedule, and more content-based classes rather than guest lectures",
    "I found my TA to be very helpful, and learned a lot. I also always appreciated the meetings with Dr. A. She is consistently helpful and supportive. However, I wish that in addition to the guest lectures, there could be a real score study component. The guest lectures always felt a bit long to me, so it might be worth looking at spending the first half of seminar looking at a guest's influences, scores, etc, and then have them talk the second half?"

   "comments": [
    "I would (and have!) recommend this course to other students, especially those with a strong musical background. The workload is not too overloading or intimidating, so it is a good place for people even mildly interested in composition to come and learn a lot.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in music composition of any style.  The professors and TFs all know about many different styles of music, and the guest lectures also cover a broad range of styles and careers.",
    "Yes, there is a lot of freedom to pursue the music you want to write as well as teachers and resources to help you",
    "-yes; it's essential for developing fluency in music composition and notation",
    "Yes, but keep in mind that what you get out of it is what you put in, and some of the guest lectures were more useful than others."
