                "The support staff and professors were invaluable.  The only thing that could have improved this course was being in person.",
                "The office hours of the professors and TAs were excellent (easily the best of any class I took). \r\n\r\nI feel that this class went too fast through a lot of concepts. Going through quantum in like 2 weeks was too fast. Professor Tipton is vocal that he has to go through certain things quickly to stay on schedule, but it's still not ideal. I feel that my base of understanding for much of the stuff this semester is weak, as I had to rush to do problem sets rather than truly learn.",
                "Professor Tipton is pretty humorous and formats his lecture material really well -- in retrospect I probably would have appreciated this so much more if I paid more attention during class lol. 201 also covers quantum, which was super cool to learn about, and Tipton does a pretty good job explaining concepts  that seem super out of reach at first in just 75 minutes. The highlight of this class was definitely the office hours \/ ULAs \/ TAs, though. They were helpful, super approachable, and always on top of it. Genuinely, go to office hours for this class. The professors do a great job organizing the curriculum and adjusting the course to accommodate for us, too. I took 260 last semester with Professor Harris and had a much better experience in 201 with regards to organization, helpfulness of peer tutors, and test \/ homework difficulty.",
                "The course was very well-designed. Professor Tipton gives great lectures and was very engaging throughout the semester. The problem sets were difficult, but office hours with the professors and TA's were incredibly useful. I do not think there were any weaknesses.",
                "This course does a great job of giving a broad overview of many concepts.",
                "Class was well taught, strengths could be more engagement from the classroom but it is probably just an issue with online learning.",
                "Incredible course",
                "I appreciated the placement of more computationally intensive questions on the homework with more conceptual questions on the exams. Along with homework making up 50% of the course grade, I thought this made the exams less stressful while still keeping the course challenging and rigorous. The lectures were also generally clear, although there were a few spots which were very math heavy (mostly during derivations) that I found hard to stay focused for.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I felt like some lectures developed an idea that we didn't really come back to. For example, we spent considerable time in one lecture doing the math for AC RLC circuits, introducing the idea of complex impedance, but since it wasn't reinforced in any problems or other lectures I didn't feel like I ever mastered the topic. I think topics like this could either be reinforced elsewhere or shortened in order to give more time to other important topics.",
                "extremely well taught but lectures and lectures notes should be numbered better",
                "Strengths: Wide review of material students may have already learned but with a deeper dive into some topics, lots of professor and TA office hours, some really cool lectures on more modern topics in physics like SR, quantum mechanics, cosmology\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I only felt that the course moved a little too quickly for me at some times. Other than that I don't have any suggestions for improvement, this was a great course.",

                "strengths: problem sets, weaknesses: test difficulty was highly variable",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, great professors and peer tutors. There were plenty of office hours either with Professor Schiffer, Professor Tipton, or TAs\/TFs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the topics we learned about were very bare-bones and introductory, I think it could be better if we look at fewer topics but at a greater depth.",
                "I think the discussing problems in breakout rooms method in the beginning of the semester was very helpful and decreasing the time of students working on problems was one thing that could not have been done.",
                "Engagement was obviously quite low, but Tipton does a good job of pacing out his teaching and makes the class fun to attend.",
                "The course was well taught, well organized, and the problem sets and exams were good. The low engagement that I reported was no fault of the course of the professors but represents general zoom fatigue on my end. If in person this would be an excellent course.",
                "The lectures are on-topic and well-delivered, and the professors are very responsive to questions. The TA's provided a true wealth of office hours, which was very helpful especially as time zones make scheduling even harder. I also really appreciated that the exams were, in my eyes, faithful to the material we had learned in class and really testing the right concepts (which was not my experience in some other classes). I'm not really sure what I would suggest to improve this class going forward: I had no complaints!"

The material can be tough at times, but pretty much any day you could join a Zoom to clear up your confusions with the course. I think all of the course practices were done well. You were never confused and unable to ask a question to professors of TA's. I do not think any practices could be improved.",

                "I think that this was once of the few classes that probably would be the same in person as it is purely just lectures and some light question work. I would have liked some more breakout room work, but I understood why Tipton began to stray away from it; not many people knew what was going on so the breakout rooms began to become a waste of time that he could use to strengthen out knowledge.",
                "I'm glad they got rid of the breakout rooms, but the course somehow lacked engagement. I have no real suggestions, and I think it did the best that it could given the situation.",
                "As I mentioned above, the recorded lectures and varied office hour times really made the course accessible to students no matter where in the world they were. There was occasional participation in the lectures (answering polls, that sort of thing) and the chat was open to questions, which helped keep students more engaged over Zoom."

Problem sets are difficult, but again you can find aid to make sure you perform well. The tests were pretty challenging, but I do feel like they were fair. The course material is interesting and does not require a great math background. The end of the class was particularly cool as there were a few lectures on cosmology and modern physics.",
                "This course serves as a great introduction to a variety of concepts in physics. The professors care a lot for the students, and the students themselves managed to create a community around the class. I think this is a great class to take if youre interested in majoring in physics but didnt have the math background for the Physics 260 and 261 track.",

                "Yes, I'd recommend it. I took PHYS 180 last semester because of a scheduling conflict and I'd say that while the 200\/201 series seems to be more conceptually difficult that 180\/181, this was balanced out by fewer annoying computations. If you have any background in E&M (or if you don't but are willing to learn quickly), I definitely recommend this course for exposure to a fair number of interesting physics topics. If you're very strong in the course topics, 261 is probably best for you (but I'd assume you took 200 previously).",
                "If you have a strong interest in physics \/ are looking into the physics major, and if you want to challenge yourself but still have a manageable workload, you should take this course. It's a nice run through topics people may have seen in high school, but it also explores some really cool stuff in special relativity, quantum mechanics, and some qualitative topics in general relativity and cosmology. If you're looking to take a physics course as a requirement for another major, unless you're really into it and want to challenge yourself in all your classes, it might be better to take 180\/181 instead.",
                "yes but I would caution you because it is very fast paced and not easy by any means you need friends in the class to do psets and be ready to go to many office hours. For some reason there is a lot of quantum mechanics which I thought was very pointless",
                "Good introduction to E&M and modern physics",
                "I would recommend this course for physics majors (it is a requirement anyways). I also think it is a valuable course for people who enjoy the sciences and I learned a lot. The workload is not terrible (pretty much a problem set a week) although the concepts can be pretty difficult and take a while to understand.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in physics.",

                "It's a nice solid physics course, so if that's what you're looking for I'd recommend.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It was an excellent experience for students with a pretty wide range of physics preparation; personally, I started out the year in PHYS 260 and dropped down because I was dissatisfied with how much 260 focused on math instead of physical application. I'm so happy I made this decision, and I learned so much more in 201 than I was even expecting, despite having the preparation to take a \"more advanced\" class. I had classmates with less preparation than myself who also really enjoyed 201 and felt that they learned a lot from it. So overall, I would recommend it to anyone planning to major in physics, regardless of their preparation."
