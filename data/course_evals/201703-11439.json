   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read texts that teeter dangerously close to the \"insanity\" line of philosophy. I also learned how to fight the use of the word \"ontology.\"",
    "We learn the limits of our world, the limits of our understanding of the world, the ways we produce and receive reports between ourselves through the way we produce and receive reports from things other than ourselves, until we finally start to sketch out an idea of what it is to inhabit a world, be a world-inhabitant, and to engage in reports. Reading fiction, philosophy, and science, we see the formal parallels and deep distinctions between the many worlds with which we can and do interact.",
    "This class had us think a lot about what the boundaries are between human and other are.",
    "Through this course I had the opportunity to consider philosophical questions from new optics. In doing so, the standard assumptions of the science of philosophy were critiqued.",
    "The main skill I got from this course was a purposeful epistemic modesty. I learned to understand the limit of my own human perception and recognize the fuzzy boundary between humanity and the rest of the world.",
    "learned a lot, but plenty more to learn"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There's occasionally too much reading, making it so that most people have done very little of it, making discussion painful. Some of the readings themselves are extremely out there in terms of thinking about things normally. The required lectures and dinners were generally of lower quality than the seminar with the guest, but if you know that ahead of time, you'll be fine. Paul North is a strength of the class because he's kind of a weird dude and it just works.",
    "I think you are your own limitation in this class. When the task is (at least in part) getting outside of yourself, there is the persisting, nagging feeling of still viewing a text in exactly the framework it's supposed to counter. The first day the class met, part of the advice is to 'have fun with it;\" through the semester, I think that became the method by which to \"receive\" the reports each text presented.\r\nThe speakers each had rich proposals, though it may have been productive to discuss the topics without the speaker immediately after or in the following week. Unfortunately, class participation started to lull, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "Strengthsavailable to wed a diverse set of readings into a coherent examination\r\nweaknessesmaybe one more problem set",
    "Strengths: Professor North is extremely charismatic and intelligent, so his leadership of the course was great. The texts were all very intriguing and I could at least sense the connection. The guests lectures were great and included very delicious food. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, though I think the course should have been more explicit with the work it demanded because deadlines got to be confusing.",
    "some weeks were chill, others were intense, one or two were boring",
    "This course was very unfocused and not well structured. The materials often lacked a central focus and class discussion did little to make the the curriculum more coherent."

   "comments": [
    "Take it to stretch your mind. At some point you may start to think the class is, well, bull-nonsense, but I think that's a worthwhile limit to find for yourself. Be warned: you may find yourself thinking that your own interaction with the course could be analyzed as a part of it, but that is a deep dark rabbit hole that it's probably better to avoid.",
    "The course will likely make you doubt a lot of what you took for granted that you didn't want to stop taking for granted, and it's unsettling. Therefore, you should take it. You might get weird looks when you describe the course, but that just reveals the urgency of exploring the existence and communicability between our and non-human worlds.",
    "This course was really interesting. I'm not sure how exactly to explain it. The readings don't always seem like they have anything to do with the course, but Prof. North usually ends up explaining how they do, and it's very interesting hearing his perspective.",
    "Of course",
    "yep!",
    "No. Not only was the premise of this class fairly \"out there\", the execution and organization of the class did little to help. The materials on the syllabus were glossed superficially if at all, and discussion was a free-for-all, where any and every suggestion or interpretation, no matter how whimsical, was weighted equally with centuries of serious inquiry. Discussion of ideas in class was fantastical rather than critical, and frequently disjointed and unfocused."
