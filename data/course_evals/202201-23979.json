                "I gained a solid understanding of the views and arguments of many influential philosophers. I learned several new approaches to tackling philosophical questions and discussions, and also came to enjoy philosophical discussion more than I had before.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- lots of opportunities to participate in class and propose our own ideas about philosophers' works. I really enjoyed the lively debates we had. Weaknesses- not many, but I think the pace that we moved through material was uneven throughout the semester. We ended up cramming the last few philosophers into one or two classes, and I think they merited more time than that.",
                "Strengths: Dan was a fantastic professor (he explains concepts so clearly and generates a lively, interesting conversation), the texts (though challenging) are often mind-blowing, paper feedback\r\nWeaknesses: some odd choices on the syllabus (especially the last two readings), some lectures didn't really clarify the important take-aways\/ideas, but otherwise no weaknesses with this particular section!",
                "Strengths: Good & clear teaching, helpful lectures, professor available for office hours, texts that generally build on each other and contribute answers to similar questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated a clearer explanation of different branches of philosophy (metaphysics, deontology, epistemology, virtue ethics, etc) and how each author we read fit into one or another of them.",
                "The Directed Studies philosophy department professors were the biggest strength of this course. I felt very supported by them and found all of their lectures very engaging and interesting. The only weakness I can think of is that the amount of assigned reading often felt very overwhelming.",
                "This course was great. Strengths are a global view of modern philosophy and a challenging, yet manageable, workload. Weaknesses are a crazy speed moving through philosophical history.",
                "Strengths: Directed Studies Philosophy in the spring, I feel, is much more diverse than the fall in terms of the texts and authors that we read. We got exposed to authors writing in various key moments throughout world history, spanning different times and geographies. This diversity continues to foster an intellectual rigor, and the process of grappling with the texts continues to be a challenging but rewarding process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. I would have liked to have spent more time on certain texts, but overall, I have absolutely no complaints about DS Philosophy. It is simply magical."

                "Yes! This is a great opportunity to get an overview of more recent philosophy in a small seminar with a great professor.",
                "Absolutely. Even though the material in spring semester philosophy is arguably more challenging than the fall (with all the weird metaphysics), it can really be an eye-opening experience. I also think it's one of the best ways (other than, maybe, Intro to Modern) to get a firm foundational grasp of modern Western philosophy. The discussions and texts will stay with you, and you will find yourself thinking about Kant's \"things-in-themselves\" or Hume's \"is-ought gap\" outside of the classroom.",
                "Yes I think it provided a valuable philosophical grounding that informs and will continue to inform my engagement with other texts and with the world more generally.",
                "Yes. I have gained a solid background in philosophy and a better understanding of how to write a philosophical analysis. I also just really enjoyed all of the sections and lectures and found them very engaging.",
                "Yes, I would. DS Philosophy gives you a broad overview of all of philosophy that readies you for any philosophical discussion, teaches you many interesting and useful lessons, and prepares you for any future philosophy classes.",
                "PLEASE. TAKE. DS. There is only one word to describe it: MAGICAL. After taking DS, I look back with tears at all the amazing memories I've made with friends I cherish. DS is not only a course of study, but also a family. Your professors and fellow students will push you to become not only a better student, but a better critical thinker and person."
