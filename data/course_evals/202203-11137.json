                "strengths: extremely fascinating material and a professor that really cares \r\nweaknesses: the exams sometimes strayed from the material taught in class, it seemed like the TAs were a little lost on what the material was",
                "The course covered very interesting material, did a good job of offering a hybrid option for sick students, and had a professor with great passion for her students and entomology. \r\n\r\nSometimes the material in lecture could have been presented more clearly and in a more organized fashion, as sometimes it was hard to remember what the topic of a given lecture was, or how we'd arrived to the point we had. The TAs were surprisingly unhelpful and uninformed. Though they hosted review sessions before tests, they never knew answers to any students' questions. They insisted on answering them anyway, however, often misinforming us or offering misleading explanations.",
                "This is a good survey course but focuses a lot on spiders. It's also not clear what information is required knowledge as there is a lot of detail provided.",
                "Honestly, I loved this class, Marta, the TAs, etc. Marta puts such an effort in to finding fun and interesting videos for us and it really pays off for the class environment. She's also a very kind and understanding professor. Never thought I'd be so fascinated by these little creatures but as they say, Attention is love. I saw a cockroach in a classroom bathroom a few weeks ago and instead of skittering away like I usually do I went up closer and thought, you're not a bug, you're an ARTHROPOD.",
                "The lectures are pretty engaging even for a non-science person like me. They include lots of video clips from people like David Attenborough which made the course more interesting. There is minimal work outside studying for exams. That being said, the lectures felt pretty disorganized especially during the first third of the semester. The material didn't always feel particularly sequential. There are also three midterms and a final which is a lot of studying and stress. You do get to drop your lowest midterm and I think my final grade will be fine, but the format of the course (and the difficulty/harsh grading for the first exam) made things stressful. I'd say there are definitely easier science credits out there, but I did learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: Marta and the TAs",
                "Strengths: It's a fun class! Lots of cool snippets of nature documentaries and cool fun facts about different neat organisms. Marta is awesome and kind and funny. The exams are frequent enough that you have to learn something but not so much work that it's often stressful. \r\nWeaknesses: This class is super far away from the rest of campus so it's a bit of a trek to get there, especially a class right before or in bad weather. There's also a rush at the end of the semester with a midterm, a paper, and a final all within about 10 days.",
                "The professors and TAs were amazing. I also loved the things we learned about in class (e.g., insect reproduction, spider webs, survival skills, etc.)! The lectures were a little boring and repetitive at times, but the interactive content (e.g., videos) made them a little more tolerable. Marta was also just a funny lecturer.",
                "The content for the last two midterms was extremely interesting, but because the first midterm focused primarily on overarching/broad features (eg theory, evolution , arthropodization), it was not as interesting as the more detailed and up close behavioral studies.",
                "The recorded lectures allowed for review of class material and helped tremendously with preparing for the exams. However, better audio quality of the recorded lectures would have been helpful.",
                "The class was pretty easy and the lectures were usually entertaining. It would be nice to have a better sense of exactly what concepts would be on exams since I felt like I spent a lot of time studying concepts that werent tested.",
                "strength: the material is very engaging, feels like a documentary. The professor is very kind and understanding",
                "Strengths: you can study a few days before the exam and learn so much. There's a lot of memorization but some of its really cool and sometimes marta would finish early. \r\n\r\nWeakness: can feel a little boring sometimes during lecture because i think marta tends to talk straight through without a lot of theatric pauses but that's okay :) \r\n\r\nThe TAs really helped us with those reviews sessions and helping us focus on what was good",
                ". The upside of taking it as that there's no homework, or weekly assignments. But the downside is the excessive number of exams that cover basically all the course info.",

The videos and lessons are so interestingbugs are so smart! I looked forward to watching every lecture and having a video option was really nice.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who want to learn more about insects and arthropods or wants an easy introduction to evolutionary biology/the biological sciences.\r\n\r\nI would mention to them, however, that the TAs were very unhelpful and sometimes even offered misinformation at pre-test review sessions.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a course that will teach you about terrestrial arthropod natural history! I took this course to try to desensitize myself to arthropods. I'm not sure if it worked or not.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to non-STEM students who still want to learn something and a fun classroom environment. I feel like I learned so much about these little critters and honestly it was the best experience I've had in a science classroom, ever. Marta is also a great professor who really puts effort in and clearly loves her topic. The TAs Arata, Swathi, and Claire were also great people. However, I would not recommend this class as an \"easy\" gut -- while you barely need to put in any time in-between classes during most of the semester besides showing up to class, the midterms and finals do require significant studying. For me, this was a reasonable trade-off, but maybe not for others.",
                "I think there are easier and less stressful science credits out there if that's what you're looking for. I was pretty stressed out by this course during the semester especially because the first exam was pretty difficult and harshly graded. The TFs didn't seem particularly engaged. That being said, Marta is incredibly kind and sweet and lectures were mostly engaging and interesting. I'd say depends what you're looking for/how stressed out you get by lack of clarity.",
                "Yes, very interesting and low barrier to entry.",
                "Yes! It's a solid option for a science credit if you need one of those - fun info, fun videos, not too much work, cool professor.",
                "I would if it's required for your major! Or if you're looking for a Science \"gut,\" and you couldn't get into the other ones (like Astro or Dynamic Earth). Warning thoughyou have to put in a lot of time memorizing vocabulary and specific examples before the three midterms (of which the lowest score is dropped). You also have to write a research paper (which wasn't that bad) and take a final exam, so there are a lot of assessments to keep track of. You will definitely find more \"guttier\" Science credit classes at Yale.",
                "Yes!!! Very very interesting and I have learned to appreciate bugs and spiders and lose some of my negative perception. They are truly necessary components of our ecosystem.",
                "Yes absolutely I love Professor Wells and her passion that she brings to the course",
                "A great science credit for non science majors!",
                "Yes, the professor is great and very understanding, and material is engaging even if you aren't a STEM major.",
                "Learn about bugs! A lot of content is covered so you will have to do some memorization, but nothing crazy.",
                "Absolutely - it was a science credit which gave me an unexpected admiration for insects (I tend to look at flies with more curiosity than disgust now). Lectures were well-geared for exam content and the paper allowed us to dig into an interesting subject I would have never encountered otherwise. Overall, a great science class for non-STEM majors and a tremendous experience overall!",
                "I would recommend this class if you actually want to learn a lot about arthropods. I would not describe this class as a gut. Although there are very few assignments associated with the class, the exams are very hard. I had a really good time. Especially in combination with the lab, you'll learn a lot!",
                "Might feel overwhelmed at first but especially with lab it's a special experience. Maybe don't take if you're super scared of bugs and spiders and stuff. Really helps once you start getting the hang of the material. The final didn't have any bonus. But like they do tell you what could be on exam it can just be a lot sometimes.",
                "This course is NOT a gut. You will find yourself having to dedicate a lot of time to studying for the THREE midterms, final, and (short) term paper. Do not register for this class assuming that you'll do well with minimal effort",
                "Yes!",
