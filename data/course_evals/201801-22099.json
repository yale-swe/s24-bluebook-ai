    "I learned a great deal about putting ideas together and developing arguments.",
    "Philosophical analysis and writing. How to logically construct arguments and how to interact with each philosopher (e.g., how to raise questions\/counterarguments)",
    "I learnt how to actually write a philosophy paper to a strong standard. Aside from gaining a good breadth of knowledge regarding philosophy of the Western canon, I gained greater confidence regarding evaluating and reconstructing arguments.",
    "This was a fabulous course, and I learned a lot about how to read and interpret philosophical texts.",
    "I learned a lot about philosophy and gained a ton of writing skills. I learned about different ways of thinking and the fundamentals of ethics.",
    "Great course, learned how to dissect philosophical texts",
    "I learned so much about he western philosophical tradition and various belief systems and ideologies that have shaped philosophy. I also learned how to more clearly argue my ideas, as well as critical thinking skills.",
    "I gained general knowledge about the Cartesian and post-Cartesian schools of philosophy. I gained skills related to thinking about and doing philosophy that built on what I learnt last year. I also learned about types of philosophical argument and objection which were helpful in writing papers.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt like Douglass should have been read in H&P",
    "The selection of the texts, perhaps. For instance, I felt it a little bit awkward to read Murdoch without reading any existentialist philosophers.",
    "A strength of this course are the lecture, which are great at helping students to understand what the crux of a particular philosophical work is about - all the professors make tricky philosophical ideas understandable. The seminars are well-structured, making it easy to unpick and evaluate arguments. The representation of women could be improved in the sense that Anne Conway and Elisabeth of Bohemia seemed like they were just inserted because they were women. It would've been good if we had spent slightly more time in seminar discussing their contributions to philosophy. I would've also liked the inclusion of another existentialist like Sartre or a look at the philosophy of language like Wittgenstein and Ayer.",
    "This course has a fabulous syllabus, and was very well taught on all sides. We learned a lot in seminar about metaphysics, and focused on interpreting philosophical arguments (something that will be indispensable for future philosophy classes). The only thing I might change is that I would have liked to talk about the philosophical material more concretely sometimes, in the form of examples or thinking about how it interacts with our everyday lives.",
    "This course could use more ethics and less metaphysics. The syllabus is pretty good and the intense writing program helps you improve a lot as a student.",
    "The course is verb ambitious in attempting to broadly survey the entire western philosophical tradition since the renaissance, but it is very successful. Of course, it can be difficult to really delve into the information with such a broad survey, but you do learn a lot in a short period of time. Also, the course proves very helpful in providing feedback about our writing.",
    "The course was very good. I think the biggest strength is the wide breadth of works read and the high level of attention given to each and every one. No real weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is impossible to improve one's philosophical faculty without discussin with professors and students. DS philosophy's dense discussion and well-organised lectures are the best opportunity to train yourself to well engage in philosophy.",
    "This is a great course to get an overview of philosophy of the Western canon. The readings can be a bit dull but the lectures and seminar make up for that.",
    "This is a fabulous intensive course and I really recommend it!! You will come away having gained so much knowledge, and all the philosophical conversation you hear around you will make so much more sense.",
    "Yeah I would because it teaches you a ton that students dont learn otherwise at yale and prepares you for higher level writing courses.",
    "I would recommend it to another student interested in DS. I was pretty ambivalent about my first semester DS philosophy class, but I absolutely loved this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student hoping to learn a lot about philosophy and the major thinkers and ideologies hag have defined and shaped the western tradition, as well as to anybody hoping to improve in their writing and critical thinking, in a small environment that facilitated conversation and close student-teacher relationships.",
    "I would because it offers a great introduction to doing philosophy and thinking about important questions.",
    "Yes. It's a great way to get acquainted with the main philosophers in the Western tradition."
