    "I learned a lot about the origins of Italian opera and also about how it was performed both in study and in practice. I learned a lot about the performance of Italian Baroque opera.",
    "I learned how to perform baroque-era opera with historically-informed performance practice.  I learned an entire opera and through rehearsing and performing it, became a better musician, actor, and performer.",
    "I learned how to sing recitative, and how the staging and rehearsing of a professional opera works.",
    "I learned about the performance history of Baroque opera and learned practical skills about how to perform opera today.",

   "comments": [
    "There should not be papers; I feel as though a reading-response structure might be slightly more helpful.",
    "I was just an auditor, but I would like to say that, for the few courses I observed, I loved how the course was split into musical analysis,as well as acting\/character analysis and intention\/discovery. Toni and Grant are gems of this campus. It was beyond moving to see undergraduates so engaged and smiling.",
    "An incredible amount of focus and attention from the professorsto making you better thinkers, performers, singers, and scholars of Italian Baroque opera.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is the best opportunity on campus for Yale College students to engage with opera.  It is a very large time commitment, but for those who are highly engaged, every minute put in sees a reward.",
    "This course is excellent, and one of my best experiences at Yale. After spring break, it becomes a much bigger commitment, but its really worth it and is so much fun. The quality of music-making in this course is really high.",
    "I think that music sung together like choruses, duets, and trios in addition to scenes with a lot of back and forth could be rehearsed together sooner.",
    "It was an excellent course, I would not change it.",
    "Interesting guest lectures at the beginning - more of those would be nice.",
    "This is an amazing program and opportunity that needs no improvement."

    "This is an incredible course! It is SO YALE! Combining the academic study of Italian Baroque traditions with the performance of Baroque opera. It is so so so wonderful for people who see themselves as scholar-performers.",
    "Absolutely everyone with an interest in opera should take this course. I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "If you are interested in performing opera, you should definitely take this class. This experience of performing in a professionally produced opera is incredible!",
