   "comments": [
    "The psets frequently asked us to use SolidWorks features that had not been (and were never) covered in class, while lectures were focused on the history of graphics and different simulations. More focus on actual \"how-to\" in SolidWorks would have drastically improved this class",
    "Some homework assignments were very long, the grading was ambiguous and sometimes unclear.",
    "The course does a great job of going through all of the analysis that can be done on Solidworks. We did examples in class and built off of that for the homeworks.",
    "The course is consistent and the assignments provide practical application of the topics from lecture.  That being said, the lectures themselves can be somewhat slow or dull.",
    "Well structured and paced classes with engaging assignments helping reviewing the material. It can be a bit difficult to gain intuition for why we do certain steps without more background in Solidworks."

   "comments": [
    "Yes to learn SolidWorks",
    "I would definitely recommend this to other students. The skills I learned from this class were very useful and very interesting. It was a great elective for me, and I think any engineering student would enjoy it.",
    "Frankly, most of the Solidworks topics can be learned from tutorials online, but some of the simulation specifics were very helpful.  The other subjects were interesting and the homework was manageable.  I would recommend the course, although it can be competitive to get into it.",
    "If you aren't already very comfortable with SolidWorks (or some other CAD program) analysis techniques, this is a must take for anyone going into engineering after college"
