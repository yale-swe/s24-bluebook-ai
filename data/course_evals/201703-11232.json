    "Gives you basics of German language in a fun way.",
    "The instructor was amazing. I wish he was teaching the class next semester!",
    "I think this course does a good job of teaching the technical aspects of the language ie vocab\/grammar.  I would say the shortcoming comes in the form of speaking\/listening.  I found the listening part to be the most difficult part of the tests consistently and didn't feel like we would practice this enough.",
    "I do not have any critiques of any weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe course was orientated towards student learning and was highly engaging.",
    "Taught so well. Only other thing there should be is more in-class listening practice, since it is a difficult part of the tests.",
    "I think the course is very well run. I especially found the extracurricular events to be helpful and engaging.",
    "The class runs on class participation so the atmosphere is greatly, but not entirely dependent on your classmates (the other part being your teacher). The assignments were quite fun, there were many German events scheduled (every week), and Dr Wolf-Farr was always ready to answer questions after class etc. It got slightly exhausting nearing the end, especially since classes were every day and assignments got heavier. I would suggest removing or tapering off the email assignments near the end because I did not find it very useful for learning the language."

    "I highly recommend this course to any student who wants to begin exploring German language and culture. The class was very engaging, rewarding, and teaches a high level of understanding of German language and culture for an introductory course.",
    "If you want to learn German, then yeah, take it. It's awesome!",
    "Yes. I think it is a great introduction to the German language.",
    "Yes!! you will learn a lot, but choose a section with the right instructor and amiable classmates.",
    "Yes. I progressed very far very quickly."
