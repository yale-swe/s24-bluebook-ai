                "This course is designed in a way to facilitate student discussion and participation, which is something that is crucial to learning a language. By constantly asking students questions, it gives us a chance to apply what we learned in front of a professional Chinese teacher. This way, we can receive feedback on the spot. We had a variety of different types of homework to complete, from writing exercises, to speaking recordings, and to reading the textbook.\r\nThis semester, however, I felt the workload was quite heavy (a lot more than the first part of the course). I would spend hours upon hours every day trying to interpret the text in addition to writing sentences, completing the Quizlet, doing daily homeworks, and reading quizzes. The one thing that could be improved is to try and spread this out a bit, or remove some work. A plus side of this though is that my Chinese truly improved.",
                "This course has many strengths. Zhou laoshi is an excellent professor. He takes a lot of time to explain complicated grammar rules and is very considerate of his students. You also will get very good at understanding the formal Chinese writing style. The only weakness I can think of is that on Zoom, there weren't a lot of opportunities to share your opinions on the topics or practice speaking for long periods of time. If you're coming to this class after going on Light, it feels like my speaking level declined over time but my reading comprehension improved.",

                "I think everything that needed to be done to have a successful class was done. We had live sections three times a week in addition to weekly TA meetings where we could receive one-on-one feedback. This addition allowed us to receive additional guidance in these hard times.",
                "The daily syllabuses were helpful for preparing for class. In addition, Zhou laoshi gave us a couple of extra break days throughout the semester where we had asynchronous work such as watching a short video and answering questions. Zhou laoshi was especially considerate and understanding of students' sleep schedules and mental health and would often talk with us as a group or individually about how to adjust the course to our needs.",

Not only is Professor Zhou super understanding and helpful, but the course itself is designed to really improve your Chinese in a matter of one semester. Despite the great workload, it is truly fulfilling and rewarding to see how much your Chinese has improved at the end.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. If you've taken a lot of Chinese courses at Yale, CHNS 155 is a fair workload with an excellent professor. If you are interested in getting the Chinese certificate, this is the last course required and it is really manageable if you already have the study skills built from past Chinese classes. I now feel ready to take post-L5 Chinese courses at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you are this far in the Chinese program, why not continue? It's well structured and you will learn a lot under Zhou Laoshi.",

                "Yes. Essential for improving Chinese as final course in sequence.",
