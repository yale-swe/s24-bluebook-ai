You learn all the way from the Minoans to Alexander the Great and read influential texts such as those of Herodotus and Thucydides. Having very little education on this, I now feel very comfortable with this period of 1500 years. Discussion sections are also very dynamic; you debate, make podcasts, create accurate timelines, and more.",

I learned a lot of factual information but also, more importantly, how to synthesize the facts into stories about the evolution of democracy, leadership, colonialism, archaeology, and national identity.",

                "very interesting and easy to follow in lecture.  not too hard of course work.",
                "The content and lecturers were amazing only complaint would be the multiple choice questions on the exam felt unfair and counted for too much of the grade",
                "Strengths; interesting lectures, good readings, sections very helpful\r\nWeaknesses; a museum trip for one of the classes would be fun although maybe difficult to arrange with the number of people",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the content and Professor Lamont is amazing. The course offered a nice mix of chronological classes and thematic ones which moved the semester along nicely. The lecture format was expected of the type of class and Professor Lamont does a great job of being engaging. Moreover, if you have any questions, she's happy to address them there. Section was very dynamic, fun and useful to supplement and flesh out the lectures as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The idea of opting in for section and therefore adding a 20% participation grade seems attractive, but I don't think you'll fully benefit without discussion and a TF anyway. The exams would also account for 75% of the class in the other case. A minor point related to exams: a quarter of the grade for each were for 5 multiple choice questions; around 13% of your grade (with a TF). I've never seen this in a history class before and the midterm questions were quite hard.",
                "I loved the response paper and podcast project, which helped diversify the work so we weren't just cramming information for tests. Professor Lamont is great at delivering all the info in ways that tie into previous lectures and the big picture so that we don't get lost in the details. Still, the pace was pretty rapid at times, especially when we were covering the period between the Peloponnesian War and the Macedonian invasion. When the narrative is less linear, it might help to slow down the pace a little bit, because I know a few people in the class who felt kind of lost during those weeks. I would have appreciated more guidance with test preparation; I felt like I was just studying everything because I had little idea what would be covered.",
                "The strengths are Professor Lamont's lectures (I found them engaging and fun), the TFs of the course, and the material taught. The reading was also a great survey of classic Greek literature. The only small weakness I'd note is that Professor Lamont also name dropped figures or places with complex Greek names and did not put the names in the lecture, making note taking difficult occasionally. It would have been helpful, I think, to have the occasional slide that summarized dates and figures to allow students to note the important information.",
                "Pretty much only strengths. Section was actually super enjoyable, a testament to my TF. But class was super informative and quite engaging. I didn't know what to think going into the course as I had never taken an ancient history class before, but I'm so glad I did.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, incredible professors and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: Great structure and thematic focus. Lots of freedom of when to turn in the single written assignment, and section was optional for a grade (though I took it) meaning that you had some flexibility in workload. Discussion sections were especially fun (with Eleanor!).\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture slides in class were often vague, so if you're someone who needs interactive slides lecture may get a bit hard to follow/not as interesting as it could be. Each multiple choice/identification was worth about 5%, so if you got unlucky with a question it brought down your grade significantly. Heavy emphasis on dates compared to the average history class at Yale (which can get overwhelming in Greek History-- something that took up time from other valuable focus on overall themes/primary sources). Also, if you're interested in cultural history this class is not for you (lots of the semester was covering military battles and conquest which is a big part of Ancient Greek history",
                "The content was interesting and engaging, but I wish lectures were recorded and/or lecture slides had more content on them. I regularly attended lecture and did nearly every reading, but I got maybe 70% of the information that was put forth."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Lamont is a gem of a lecturer who made this course shine. The content is already interesting by itself, but her presenting skills and insights really enhanced it. I had never done any reading or taken any courses on Ancient Greece, and by the end of the course, I felt confident that I had a solid understanding of general movements through time in Ancient Greece, and an understanding (or at minimum, an awareness) of the major events, locations, and people throughout the time. This was one of my favorite courses I took at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Solid survey of Ancient Greek history from Minoan civilization through Philip.",

                "If that student is interested in ancient greek history, then yes absolutely. I have always been interested in the topic, so I was really engaged in the class, but I still got kind of burnt out by the end. I imagine the extensive reading and memorization might be even more exhausting for someone who is less invested going in.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're looking for a history lecture that is really fun and doesn't require much previous knowledge, this class will leave you with a really good general idea of the events of Ancient Greece.",
                "Definitely recommend. However, readings can be dense at times so make sure to allocate the appropriate times for reviewing the material. Lectures are a must attend not only cause they are great but otherwise not doing so will put you at disadvantage for the midterm and final.",
                "I would! A solid history course with a fantastic professor and great TAs. If you're interested in the subject matter, take it!",
                "Yes, if they're willing to memorize dates and are comfortable with primary source ID/multiple choice being weighed high on exams.",
