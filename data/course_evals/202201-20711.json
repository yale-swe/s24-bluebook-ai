                "This course was especially good at varying work: there was a constant stream of assignments but it was never overwhelming and the content was super interesting. I would say a weakness is if you're looking for more of a seminar set up: Professor Creswell usually lectures for part of the class and only part of the class is discussion so it's good to keep that in mind.",

                "Strengths: great readings, engaging discussions, and a very manageable workload (always w/ opportunities for creative assignments!) The only weakness I could think of was that I wish we did more ice breakers/activities to bond as a class-- All the students were great, and I only wish we were closer",
                "The Arabian Nights is a fascinating reading experience, and I was able to appreciate the tales so much more thanks to themes we discussed in class. Although I loved the source material, the class was run slightly more like a lecture (with occasional questions and comments from students) than a seminar. Perhaps that's because the class size tends to be larger than for other English courses. I would have enjoyed the course more if each class were more structured, perhaps with a 20-minute lecture at the beginning and then the rest of the time reserved for discussion.",
                "Such a fun course! The readings varied a lot in length. Streamlining may help.",
                "The course was fun and engaging, and I learned a lot about the Arabian Nights.",
                "The strengths of the course include the course content and content of the assignments. Weaknesses included the lengths of the assignments which sometimes caused me and other students to sacrifice one portion of the readings/assignments for another."

                "YES! This class is absolutely delightful and there are many opportunities to creatively approach the texts. We had some great guest speakers come in too!",
                "Yesthe \"work\" I did for this class never really felt like work. The stories are fascinating and wildly different from the types of literature you encounter in other English classes. Rather than write traditional essays, you get to write 3-4 short \"thought papers\" that are only two pages each and don't require a formal thesis statement; they're genuinely fun ways to engage with the material. The class does border on being a lecture at times, so if you prefer seminars for English courses this may not be the best choice.",
