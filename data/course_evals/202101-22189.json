I enjoyed ending the year with Walcott's epic, and I think it's place at the end of the syllabus is perfect in that it contains references to many of the books one has already encountered in DS Literature. However, I felt that I did not get as much out of Omeros as I could have, because there were so many passages that I struggled to understand. I know the lack of an annotated version makes this more difficult, but a worksheet with explanations for some of the references would go a long way in improving the reading experience.",
                "This course is very strong, I found it to be immensely enjoyable and I learned a great deal. My one small piece of feedback is that some of the translations for certain texts were controversial. I might recommend that the Directed Studies program consult with experts in the languages of certain texts before instructing students to purchase a certain edition.",
                "I believe that the level of class discussion in this course was very high  I appreciated the occasional guidance from Professor Yeazell as well, through the form of outside materials and guiding questions. I will say that I believe that this course will transfer much better to an in-person setting, because it was often difficult to pay attention during the seminars given their length and complexity.",

It has been one of the greatest intellectual experiences of my life, I cannot say enough about how much I have learned through DS. DS literature is especially close to my hear and has inspired me to shift my area of focus. If you like reading books or desire to understand the history of the great novels and poems of the pat 3000 years, do take this course.",
                "Yes  Professor Yeazell gave great feedback and led fascinating discussion sections, and I really enjoyed the Directed Studies curriculum of books that we explored. The syllabus was quite varied in terms of style, and led us to quite interesting historical and cultural contexts as well.",

It is a highly enriching experience to read all the challenging and enjoyable texts and discuss them with peers in a small seminar.",
