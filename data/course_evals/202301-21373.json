                "As a graduate student, it felt like much of it was review, especially with the applications covered. Knowing which lectures would cover graduate level material would have kept the course more engaging.",
                "Second half of the material is not very useful since we are not graded on it. I would have preferred a few problems sets on that material as well!",
                "The lectures are a little disorganized. Other than that, the homework scaffolds really nicely and helps drive home the key concepts in computational methods. I feel like I have a codebase that I can actually apply to my other work.",
                "This course is excellent. The lectures are engaging, the problem sets are doable and helped me better understand the material, and the final project was a great way to practice the methods I had learned and to learn more about a subfield of econ that I am interested in. I can't really think of any ways to improve.",
                "I think the topics covered are interesting and useful, and I appreciate how the problem sets are designed so that we can try applying the technique to an actual problem. I think that the course could be more effective if there were different sections for undergrads\/graduate students with techniques and applications more targeted to each student group.",
                "Tony is a fantastic professor. TA section was also very helpful. The course would be improved with more engagement in the second half of the course - without the psets it was hard to feel like I was grasping the material.",
                "Project was fun to work in, homework very manageable, not always the most engaging",
                "The strengths of this course were in the problem sets which were challenging but helped me to think about how to computationally represent recurring problems in microeconomics and macroeconomics.",
                "The psets are so good and the organization of the course fully exposed me to what economic models look like! I think the classroom instruction could be made more effective by a more linear progression of topics. Also, some of the content feels very wishy washy.",
                "Strengths: the course covers a wide breadth of numerical methods that can be used to solve so many different economic problems, well-defined course structure, flexibility and freedom on the final project, which allowed me to focus on a topic I found interesting and make a cool project out of it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because so many topics were covered, we didn't receive many examples applying the topics we used, so when tested on those methods in the problem sets, a challenge was turning the theory and explanation into something more tangible to provide a problem set solution, very quick turnaround time on learning challenging topics within Julia to implement complicated principles",
                "The problem sets were very helpful in understanding the material, but it is a little daunting with so many different skill levels in the class. Also, (and I think Prof Smith is going to improve this) the high level material at the end of the semester was difficult to grasp without any applications. Also, it is hard to know what grade you will get because most of it is the final project. Again, the level of skill for a senior who can use thesis research or a phd student will be much higher than a student without economics research experience.",

It fulfills the joint CS-Econ credit needed for the CS-Econ major and honestly offers a pretty interesting way to complete that requirement. That being said, I'd only recommend it to someone who is comfortable with advanced mathematical notation and ideally has programming experience. I'd definitely recommend that the student has actually completed the prerequisites for this course to allow them to get the most out of it because the material does get pretty challenging.",
