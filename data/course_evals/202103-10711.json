                "This course was an excellent introduction to real political science and political economy literature. I learned how to analyze sources critically and pick apart the argument from the model in papers. I feel like I gained a much better understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of state formation as well as state building, and the knowledge I gained here has improved my understanding of other political science material as well.",
                "This has to be in the top 3 most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. I feel like I left the class with a really solid understanding of different theories of state building in different eras and areas of the world. It illuminated a different, more scientific approach to thinking about how states evolve and are shaped over time.",
                "Oof, that was A LOT. What a rollercoaster ride of a course (and not necessarily the fun kind).  What did I learn, I learned a truck ton, probably.  I learned much more about the bellecist hypothesis of state formation than I could have EVER imagined.  I learned about how the literature on state formation thinks about state formation (maybe a bit obvious), compared to what I would have thought about it without seeing the literature. To be honest, I probably got a little better at statistics, and\/or at least being able to interpret statistical model when encountering them in the literature."

            "comments": [
                "This course was strong in that it offered an excellent range of literature and taught me a lot about how to dissect real political science articles. I feel well-prepared to critique research and understand it better now. \r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like too much of the class was dedicated to critique, and there was little to no explanation. Sometimes we would jump into a very complex article without any preparation, making discussion confusing and disjointed, as everyone had different understandings. I also feel like my knowledge was never systematized. There was no overarching structure to the course, so every week felt like a new and disconnected strand of information. Even when there were intersections between articles, I feel like I never got a comprehensive picture of the field.",
                "The readings are simply unmanageable. Certainly they are very interesting, and beneficial to our class discussions, but regardless of how much time I allocated to doing the readings for this class I was never able to finish them. What I ended up having to do was pick about half of the required readings and read them in full, and then just skim over the remaining ones. Considering that I did not know ahead of time which readings were more relevant or interesting or academically sound, I would have preferred if we had simply been assigned less readings so that I could give them all my full attention rather than abstractedly picking and choosing which ones to read and which to merely look over. Beyond this, I have no complaints. The class was well-structured, the lectures\/discussions were engaging and informative, and the paper topics provided a fair opportunity for us to demonstrate our understanding of the content.",
                "I loved the interdisciplinary nature of the course. The readings are very interesting and cover anthropology, history, game theory, economics, and political science. Class discussions are great in facilitating understanding of the readings, which can sometimes be difficult and dense to understand. Professor Queralt is great at explaining the papers and helping the class understand the material. The only thing that could be improved is if there was a bit more time for students to discuss the readings amongst themselves.",
                "Strengths: The course readings are very well curated and always super interesting. The students in the class were also one of its best qualities -- everyone brought super interesting lived experience and academic backgrounds to the class, and that made seminar discussions a real highlight of my week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was not well organized to facilitate student learning as well as it could be. While seminar discussions were excellent sources of clarification on different theories and ideas, there was very little written or oral feedback on assignments. The bread and butter of the course are 2 page reading responses the critique the readings, and while Professor Queralt grades those papers quite harshly on a consistent basis, he provides very few comments on what students could do better.",
                "I must say the readings are a relative strength, I nearly looked forward to them (especially the non-econometric papers, as my background in statistics was not as strong, and even some of the readings were characterized as much harder, particularly in this statistical aspect, than others). The response papers got pretty annoying, pretty fast.  However, I do recommend doing them, and doing as many as you can.  I found that I was often more prepared for the discussion the next class period after doing\/preparing a response paper.\r\nTo the professor, I do recommend making fewer response papers mandatory, and assigning a constant number of extra credit points to be given for each additional response paper turned in (assuming some minimum threshold is met; I think this might help get the incentives \"more right\").  Additionally, I found the grading to be QUITE HARSH, in just about everything except attendance (but I'll be honest, I thought that was going to be a lot harsher than it was). The other graded assignments (besides attendance) were response papers and short papers, and at least for what I got feedback on, I often and DEEPLY questioned whether the feedback given matched the points deducted, with some instances being that I thought the instructor simply got it wrong. I don't know if English is the professor's second language, but it often felt like some things were \"lost in translation\".    \r\n\r\nAdditionally, expectations for assignments were not nearly as clear as they could have been, which may tie into the grading woes (especially on the response papers and short papers).\r\n\r\nGoing back to the grading woes, I think part of the frustration was attributable not really having any idea where you were at in the course as it progressed (response papers were graded out of three, and it was as hard as anything to get a three, which means students were potentially out on a limb with a bunch 66% for assignments, in what was then expected to be an un-curved class), and no grades were posted to canvas or anything else.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I do not know if the professor went through with this, but they suggested curving the class late into the semester, which would have brought some grades up, but it seems at least unheard of to curve a class of around 12-15 students."

                "Don't take it unless you're really prepared to do the work and have a deep interest in state formation. Also, I think there should be an economics prerequisite for this class, since a good portion of the material was math\/economic theory heavy. If you're up for a real challenge and you have the time, take it. I just found that the class swallowed up my free time, and the response papers were very stressful, since there was little to no guidance throughout the semester, and the feedback was occasionally cryptic.",
                "This class has earned my hesitant and conditional recommendation. In specific, I would consider recommending this to another student as long as they are prepared for i) an unmanageable amount of readings and ii) somewhat ambiguous instructions in regards to papers and reading responses. That said, I do endorse it. I think it was a very informative class, and Professor Queralt's lectures are very engaging.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in an interdisciplinary topic and are excited by quantitative polisci readings, then absolutely.",
                "I would recommend this course -- definitely one of the coolest I've taken at Yale. The readings are great, and the seminar discussions are very interesting. But, don't take this course if you're someone who worries a lot about what grades you get on assignments. Professor Queralt is a good seminar leader, but a very tough grader.",
                "Know what you're getting yourself into; look at the readings, do you find them really intriguing? Expect great readings (but still look at them) and harsh grading.  If you're going to take it, really ask for what the professor expects on assignments, GO MEET WITH THE PROFESSOR ABOUT IT, especially for the short papers.  If you want to get three's on the response papers, you may not be able to take that full of a course load, and may need to do some of the RECOMMEND READINGS (and yes, I felt your pain reading that)."
