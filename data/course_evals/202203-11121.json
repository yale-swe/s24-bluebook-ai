                "This was an excellent studio!  I learned how to consider architectural space from the inside out -- how to focus on the human experience within a space and work out from there.  There was an emphasis on architecture as a conduit for psychological expansion.   The box\/void project explored the paradox of emptiness\/fullness.  The Long Wharf project set a stage for fixing a gaze on the horizon.  The crisis center concretized the liminal zone between hope\/despair, anxiety\/calm, alarm\/nurture.",
                "I really gained so much from this course. I feel that this course gave me a strong appreciation for the consideration of site and context in the design process. For our first project we worked at 1:1 scale through which we engaged with physical construction at a site in Rudolph Hall, and our other projects were situated on sites in New Haven--all of which we visited and documented. Throughout the course of the semester, I developed and refined skills including building, model making, and 2d & 3d representation, and gained more experience communicating ideas and constructively working through the design process alongside great people.",

                "I love this class, studio with Turner is the best.",
                "This is was an exceptionally good course.  The limited number of projects allowed for deep development and reduced scrambling\/panic when trying to balance major projects in other classes.  The range of projects was fun, traveling from a contained object to multi-room, multi-story building.  The choice of critics for reviews was excellent.  The critics came from a variety of disciplines and were neither too harsh nor too blankly positive.  \r\n\r\nMy criticism of the course is the same that I have for all Yale studios - there is too little instruction.  Although each of us should research and explore independently, sometimes we are left to reinvent the wheel.  This ends up being a \"sink or swim\" situation and development among students is asymmetrical.  Each of us leans into what we're already good at with the result that certain design muscles never grow.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we are in studio for 6 hours a week, there is roughly 45 minutes of interaction with the professor and teaching assistants.  Because conferences between student and professor are private, only one student benefits from the professor's critique.  If critiques were public, we would all benefit from our peers' experiments and the expert reaction.  If one studio per week were dedicated toward instruction -- perhaps exploring and discussing precedents or addressing a common problem like how to introduce light into the depths of a building -- students would learn something they wouldn't be able to invent on their own and then use that as a spring board for experimentation.",
                "There are so many strengths to this course--where do I even begin? Turner and the wonderful TFs Silas and Gina fostered a studio that was collaborative, constructive, and fun. The projects were incredibly interesting and we were constantly being pushed to think about things in different ways. Through conversations at desk crits as well as at reviews, collaboration and constructive criticism encouraged us to be more mindful and intentional about our design choices. In our extended final design project, we had a wonderful opportunity to develop comprehensive projects alongside mental health professionals, and learn from their important work. Taking field trips to each of the project sites was also a ton of fun and very rewarding. Can't think of any weaknesses for this course. This class was absolutely great.",
                "I thought that the setup of the course--two short projects and a final project--worked well to teach us how to work over a longer time period versus producing something new on a weekly basis. As with other studios, I wished there had been more instruction and \"refreshing\" on modeling and editing softwares. During the longterm project, the amount of desk crits also felt unhelpful at times, since students didn't always have something new to show with an on-going project in development.",
                "Turner and TFs are just amazing, by far the most pleasant, and fulfilling, studio experience yet at Yale. Having just three projects with increasing complexity and \"realness\" really made for a nice progression, and gave me enough time to get each project to a point where I really felt satisfied. Not the case with prior studios where you kind of just go with whatever your first or second ideas were because the deadline forces you to."

Our ideas were criticized and reimagined; we collaborated and created new possibilities cooperatively. We developed and refined our skills,  engaging intimately with the sites of our projects, and building upon the experiences and perspectives of each other. Being a part of this class was a fulfilling and enriching experience that I will never forget. I recommend this course to the highest degree!",
