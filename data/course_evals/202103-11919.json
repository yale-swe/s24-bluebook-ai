This course gives you a solid training in knowledge about vector spaces, linear transformations, and techniques with their matrix representations. Further topics covered include eigenvalues, determinants, Markov chains, inner product spaces, etc. You do get a general picture of the essence of linear transformations, receive some training in proof writing, but not that much in mathematical thinking.

In taking this course I truly believe I improved both my logical reasoning and proof-writing for higher level courses. Knowledge wise, the course covered a very theoretical framework for linear algebra and few applications were mentioned, and when they were, felt like a side note.

                "Strengths: fast-paced, proof-based math, problem-solving, foundation for other math courses, helpful TA; Weaknesses: homework problems sometimes unnecessarily computational,",
                "Strengths:  The content is somewhat interesting and I think the psets are appropriately lengthy and challenging.  Generally the psets were relevant to the course material with very minor exceptions.  The TA office hours were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I don't think the professor could feel more indifference towards us if he tried.  He showed up, taught very dryly and left.  He barely entertained our emails and our concerns about pset grading and offered very little support.  He refused to offer me extensions on psets when I had bronchitis, in my second damn week of college.  He invokes his policy of dropping the two worst psets in every situation just to discard our opinions and concerns.  He takes a while to respond to emails.\r\n\r\nI also think that the curve should be a bit more generous.  The median grade in this class is a low B+, which I think is a little disappointing since all of us would be getting at least an A- in 225.  I took the intensive version despite apprehensions because I wanted to challenge myself and give myself a solid background for my remaining semesters as a math major -- I don't think my GPA should have to suffer so much for it.",
                "Due to the highly cumulative nature of the course, it felt very easy to get lost if I fell behind a lecture or two. Other than office hours it does not feel as if there are fleshed out resources for getting through this course yet (one example being unexplained notation inconsistencies between textbook, class, and convention), so a lot of the burden is on the student to keep up with the work. That being said, it is a first semester for both the class and the professor, and the essential material of the course itself was very well organized.",
                "I think the lectures times were too short. The lectures were 3x a week for about 50 minutes. I would have preferred 2 meetings a week totaling to the same amount of class time, since I felt that each lecture was very quick and the material was not as deeply covered as it could have been in class. For example, the start of each class we spent about 5-10min reviewing the major theorems for the last class to prove the results of this class, which we wouldnt need to do if wed had a contiguous time block.",
                "Good homework problems",
                "1. Way too many psets. We had 14 psets in total this entire semester. There were psets during break, during reading week, during midterms.\r\n2. Instructor was often unreliable in his provision of an exam syllabus and review material for a lecture exam. Often, he included content on midterms that he claimed he would not include, which left it impossible for students to complete certain sections of the exams. We were not given any practice finals for our final which made it hard to study, especially for a self-selecting intensive class. \r\n3. Instructor inaccessible due to his commute and horribly timed office hours which were hosted in the morning during other classes. ULA did not host office hours during reading week and professor only hosted 2 office hours sessions, each 1 hour, during reading week. \r\n4. Course goes really fast. Professor basically recites theorems from the textbook and spits them out in order during class. Made it easy to follow because everything was following the  textbook, but really dry and unengaging to listen to.",
                "The main strengths of the course are providing a challenging experience to students who want to engage in math at a high level and solidifying a grasp of proofs. The main weaknesses were the teaching style (mostly textbook-to-chalkboard) which made it very hard to keep up with quicker students and a lack of built-in interaction with the professor or classmates. There was very little constructive feedback given on the problem sets.",
                "Reviewing: MATH 226, Professor Kevin O'Neill. SJM. Strengths of this course: The topics covered are representative of the necessary and relevant knowledge in linear algebra and familiarize the student with math studying in the sense of being a math major. The pace is slightly faster than other courses, and you get to push yourself in the learning process. Weaknesses: Not enought mathematical training; the topics are not covered in depth enough and the students really have to do much more work by themselves in order to really master the material. To improve the course, there should be more assignment and more lecturing on the way of thinking about proofs.",
                "Lectures seemed pretty useless, and I mostly learned directly from the book. Be prepared to do a lot of self study.",
                "Lectures were clear and content was communicated well. Exams were difficult but the curve was always fair. Weekly problem sets covered course content well, but did not always seem to align with tested material, particularly on the final.",
                "Strengths: This course was a solid overview of linear algebra and really improved proof-writing skills. Our ULA was fantastic and exceptionally helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that the course had started with the more concrete things like matrices. I think it would have made concepts like dimension and rank much easier to understand from the beginning.",
                "The fact that this class is an Intensive version and assumes knowledge of proofs is a major strength because it allows you to start earlier. Another strength was the ULA who was always helpful and ran very productive exam review sections. I think the organization is more of a negative because I realize that there is definitely a better order the class could be taught in after seeing what other colleges do. Also, towards the end the class became significantly more intense while the first 2 months could've been shortened to 2 or 3 weeks. This made the final much harder than I had expected due to the sudden increase in difficulty. You could be having a very easy time in the class and suddenly feel very lost so always be ready to ask for help.",
                "The course could improve by using psets with more interesting or pedagogically focused problems. All problems were from the textbook and felt like a jumble of which ones the professor thought were interesting.",
                "The material was a repetition of the textbook, often in a more confusing way. The lecture notes were not legible. I did, however, enjoy the feedback on the p sets, they were often pointed and showed care.",
                "Professor ONeill is obviously really invested in the class and seemed to care a lot about our experience. The class was extremely demanding, which isnt necessarily a bad thing. However, I feel like class time focused too much on proving every single thing mentioned (often skipping steps, which made notes confusing to look back on) in a way that made it difficult to absorb the material. I wouldve preferred spending more time going over general concepts and cementing ideas. I took proof based linear algebra before this class and still feel like it was too fast paced for me and that there was not enough explanation. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I didnt like the specific textbook we used. It went in a weird order (going straight to difficult, abstract concepts before the more simple concrete topics that help understand the abstract stuff) and it also used made up notation that was confusing. \r\n\r\nThe 50 minute time slot was also too short to really go over difficult concepts and it felt like too much material was crammed into the semester.",
                "This course could be improved by including a deeper introduction to proof-writing and to using Latex. I know this may not be able to change, but I think a weakness of this course could have been how early in the morning it was combined with how short of a class period it was. This meant many students slept through class or were tired in class (unable to participate to their greatest ability), and if students came late, they would come with very little time left in the class. This proved to be an issue when near the end of the semester, very few people were showing up to class. In addition, the room felt quite small and cramped with chairs, and on days everyone was there, like on days of a midterm exam, the room felt very crowded, and, may I add, not exactly COVID-friendly.",
                "Strengths: The class does exactly what it promises, and does it well! Potential math majors should absolutely take it to build a strong foundation in linear algebra. Having lecture notes be posted on Canvas was a nice alternative to the textbook to catch up on material if you missed a class. Problem sets and especially exams were turned around quickly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Minor detail, but I personally wasn't a fan of the pset extension policy, with no extensions granted (barring a Dean's excuse), but the two lowest pset scores dropped. It's not very flexible and adaptive to individual students' circumstancesfor example, asking for a minor extension that doesn't rise to the level of a Dean's excuse isn't possible; you have to blow one of your two freebies on it. It also leads to students not attempting the problem sets that they find most difficult, which hinders their learningthose are exactly the psets students would get the most out of delving into.",
                "Strengths- served as a challenging yet though provoking class. Weaknesses- Felt detached from text book at times, made it a bit harder to know what to study especially for exams.",
                "The course seems to get exponentially harder. It may be better to go faster at the start and leave more time for the much more interesting yet tough topics at the end? Only personal opinions from me who has self studied a bit of basic linear algebra.",
                "A majority of the class had already taken linear algebra before and was unaware of it before signing up. The class is very fun covering a nice range of topics with interesting and engaging work yet the midterms and final were significantly harder with the average using being a failing/near failing grade. Course can also be very abstract with no grounding ideas to orient yourself. Only half the class would be there on a good day. Only two office hours sessions as well. The ULA was exceptional but there was only one."

I picked this class over 225 as I thought the latter might be intellectually boring, but I increasingly found it difficult to motivate myself to absorb the abstract parts of the course material, even as someone coming from olympiads in high school. You should also keep in mind that a very large proportion of the people in the class have studied linear algebra prior to taking this class (and I suppose if you are one of these people, you will also have no problem getting through the course). That being said, if you are fairly confident that you can stay motivated through this class for one reason or another, the course is surprisingly well organized for its density, and Professor O'Neill is very nice.",

I was uncertain if I should take this class vs 225 based on my background and I am glad I took 226, however, I can easily see how if this is a first introduction to proof or linear algebra it can become very quickly overwhelming.",

The only caveat I would add is that, although the course is labeled as 'intensive', if you have taken linear algebra before or have a solid background in proof-writing, the pace of the course will sometimes appear to be too slow.",
                "SJM. I would recommend a student not to take this class if he/she has 4 other classes, because I believe maths needs practice and you will need more time for that. I would recommend this to a student who is really willing to spend 50% of his daily time in learning and writing about maths.",
                "The exams and midterms were hard, but not in a good way. Both mid terms were during class periods, which meant they were 45 minutes long at 9am, which was annoying. But the egregious part was the length of the exam. All three time pressure was a huge factor, which when you have to write proofs just seems like a terrible way to structure the class. In addition, no theorem sheets on the midterms is just annoying.",
                "If you have some experience with proofs, yes. It was a good first course in college level math.",
                "Honestly, I wouldn't. I took this course because I'd taken a linear algebra class at a college in high school, so I thought the extra challenge would be good. I really wish I'd just taken 225 instead -- it still would've been plenty challenging and I think I would've had a much clearer grasp on the material. I think the biggest lesson I learned from this class was that just because you can do the hardest version doesn't mean you should.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is ready. There was a sharp decrease in averages between the first two midterms and likely another one between the second midterm and final so you have to be ready for all the material and not just what's at the start. I took a linear algebra class while in high school, but this covered a lot more content, especially towards the end.",

They do the exact same things we do (my roommate took it, and there was literally no difference whatsoever), and the level of instruction and pedagogical understanding is far superior.

I personally did not find the knowledge I learned in this class to be applicable to other fields or studies, so I would not recommend it unless someone actually wanted to study pure math (rather than someone who just wanted to get a QR credit or just mildly enjoys math). I would also only recommend it to a student if they are self-driven to learn material on their own (as the material is difficult) and if they have a very strong foundation in math and proof-writing (especially since proof-writing isn't reviewed as thoroughly as I expected). I found the environment of the class to be somewhat competitive and not friendly to newcomers to math, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a class that they can be guided through/work collaboratively in.",

It's a great first proof-based course if you haven't done many proofs before, and if you have (just not in linear algebra), then it'll be at the right level for you, moving slightly faster than 225 would through the \"introduction to proofs\" material.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, you have a solid background in proof-based linear algebra, especially having covered it from the perspective of linear maps, not just matrices, then you might find you don't learn much in this course (even though it is the intensive version)I would recommend seeing if you can test out of it.",
