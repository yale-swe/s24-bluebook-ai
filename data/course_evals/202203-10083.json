This class has made me think about commemoration and the transmission of memory in much more nuanced ways, and I know that the insights and readings from this semester will continue to shape my academic path."

Weaknesses: this isn't a weakness, but just a heads up that I found this class to be by far the most conceptually challenging class that I have taken at Yale. I've learned so much and am very glad to have taken it, but I'd go in prepared to struggle to articulate yourself and to feel lost before or as the pieces start clicking."

The weekly reading load is very doable, but you should take this course only if you have time to write a weekly reading response and devote a significant amount of time and brainpower to the final research project.",
                "Yes I would! It's a lot of work but very rewarding and I feel like I learnt how complicated memory can be.",
                "Yes! This course is a wonderful opportunity to explore the field of memory studies while pursuing a specific topic of interest as well. The final research paper process is a valuable process and unique opportunity to piece together a high-level research paper with instructor and peer feedback along the way. All of the students come to the course with such diverse interests and insights into memory studies making for a really valuable, peer-based classroom learning environment."
