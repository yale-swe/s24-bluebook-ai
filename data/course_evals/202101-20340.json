I also got the chance to write really interesting papers which explored truth, lies, and post-truth from a variety of interesting perspectives.",

                "The major strength of this course is that when theres a difficult reading Professor Shore does an incredible job of explaining the difficult concepts.",

They definitely helped me engage the text more seriously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is probably a consequence of zoom, but it felt like our discussions were aimless sometimes. I think we would have had more engagement if we had specific questions to answer, rather than general remarks on the reading. For example, if we started with comprehension questions, then comparative questions, etc, then we would have easier questions to answer at the start, which would warm people up, let them start articulating their thoughts out loud, and then the latter half of the discussion would flow more naturally.",
                "Strengths: Readings. The readings are terrific, interesting, and diverse. Some are challenging, but getting through them is rewarding. Professor Shore is also really great. The paper assignments really let me explore non-traditional avenues for writing, which I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like the discussion was stalling, but I think it was really a Zoom issue because it was awkward. Sometimes people would try to talk at the same time, that kind of thing. I could see how the discussion could easily go on and on in person.",
                "I like the freedom of an open discussion, but a more structured class format could possibly be helpful.",
                "Great course material. Was expecting it to be more existential rather than political but I'm glad that we covered both.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, incredibly interesting topic\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of!",
                "This course was absolutely fascinating. It had a nice amount of guidance and discussion, so that it really felt our conversations were productive.",
                "Very compelling collection of texts which kept me engaged. They were sometimes a bit long and tough to digest, however. Might be helpful to have shorter segments.",
                "The material was very interesting and engaging. However, I found that conversation over zoom was not always super productive. The stakes felt high and most students did not feel very comfortable talking (or so was my feeling). Despite Prof. Shore's efforts, there was a certain formality that prevented me from speaking as much as I wanted to."

At times, this felt a little bit onerous -- it always took me ~way~ longer than I expected to craft my discussion post -- but it legitimately was very helpful to see what other people were thinking, so overall I'm glad we had it. I remember the professor saying that in the past she had students keep a journal, but honestly I think the discussion board might be more valuable, just because it gives everyone a chance to interact with each other's thoughts and ideas before we discuss the readings in class.",

Professor Shore is a great professor, gives excellent feedback, and explains certain difficult points really well. It's also not a philosophy class, but rather a history class, so it's a great way to engage with philosophy from a historical perspective...I think that it made the philosophy much more approachable. If you're not totally into philosophy at all, there are also plenty of readings that are narratives, summaries, opinions, and other academic work (e.g. language of propaganda). We also had some guest speakers, which is super cool.",
                "Yes, a great course to take if you are curious about the nature of our existence. How can we know that we are real? Very interesting topics that might leave you bummed out after realizing there are no clear answers, however.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I definitely would! The content was fascinating, and the professor was fantastic -- she was very kind, she facilitated a low-stakes and comfortable discussion environment, and she always had plenty of fun and interesting anecdotes on hand to use during lulls in the conversation. This is definitely a course that I will look back on fondly. While the readings could take a while, the vast majority of them were of a reasonable size, which I appreciated. Oftentimes, classes give readings so large that you can't possible find time to read all of it, forcing you to skim them and lose a lot of detail, but I rarely had to do that with this class. I took a bit of a gamble on this course, because it required me to wake up for a 6am class (yay covid), but looking back I'm very glad I chose to take it.",
