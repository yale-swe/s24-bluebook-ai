                "This course really helped me think about my own writing in a more critical way and be able to completely revise ideas/plot during the editing process, as opposed to just making small changes. 123 also allows you to engage with readings and writing by classmates very meaningfully, and seeing and listening to how other people read and write was incredibly beneficial to the class environment",
                "I loved every part of this course - I got to read pieces that I've always wanted to and I looked forward to writing so very much. Besides the tools in the specific genres, I learned about what makes a story effective, no matter what form it takes. I have found that the discipline of creating in this way has changed how I view and think about much of the art in the world.",

            "comments": [
                "This is a very solid introduction to college-level creative writing. The opportunity to try multiple genres and the workshops made the class especially engaging. The only weakness was that our class had nearly twenty peopleI imagine an ideal size would be around twelve.",
                "Strengths: very productive and useful workshop comments really help you grow as a writer; the readings are overall interesting and not difficult\r\nWeaknesses: not enough opportunities for workshopping and having feedback from classmates throughout the semester; very little guidance leading up to assignments, so it feels like you're on your own until you get comments back from the instructor",
                "The discussions, readings, and guest lectures were always very engaging and would make me look forward to coming to class. Having practitioners before every unit speak so passionately about their work was very inspiring and set the tone for the exploration ahead. I was hesitant to take the class as an upperclassman, thinking mostly first-years would dominate the discussion, but my class was a wonderful mix of perspectives and always contributed to good discussion.\r\nI did feel that sometimes it was intimidating to churn out longer works, like the final scene at the end, only having read Zoo Story and never practiced writing in that genre before. The way I got around that was writing multiple drafts about different ideas and then turning in the one with the most promise. I'm not sure if there are time for more exercises in the way the course is formatted so we have more practice before the final project.",
                "I loved the course and its many strengths, though I would have appreciated less direction in telling students exactly what to write (Ode, monologue, etc).",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The lectures. Every unit would start out with a general overview of the genre, and each one left me feeling inspired.\r\n- The guest speakers. I loved the opportunity to ask questions to authors that we spent a good chunk of time studying.\r\n- The professors. Ive heard amazing things about every one of them, but take it with Professor Deming if you can  he makes every class enjoyable.\r\n- The seminar setting. Although the introductory lectures were great, the ability to have a lively conversation while discussing a work was invaluable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The workshops would occasionally get a little tedious, because it felt like people would try to say something without having any substantive comments.\r\n- Nothing else.",
                "It was an incredibly strong course. The lectures that framed each unit were useful and inspiring, and the seminars throughout were fantastic. I really enjoyed all of the readings and the level of intellectual discussion for each of them. I also really appreciated the assignments; being forced to write pieces very frequently, especially at the beginning of the class, helped me overcome much of my hesitancy with writing, and getting regular feedback on everything I turned in helped me improve."

                "Yes, to anyone interested in creative writing, regardless of major. Try to get Deming if you can, he's stupendous",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in creative writing. The course felt like a break from my other classes since Deming allowed us to write about nearly anything; students really get to tailor every assignment to their interests. The readings are also fantastic.",
                "Yes, but only as a first creative writing course at Yale. Because 123 doesn't require an application, this course is great for students who didn't get into an application-based creative writing class. However, I wouldn't recommend taking this course after taking an upper-level creative writing class because it would not be as useful. The experience in 123 is also incredibly dependent on the instructor you have, so make sure you like the professor teaching the section you choose",
                "This was the best class I have taken at Yale so far and would highly recommend anyone in any year to take it.",
                "Yes, if they have not written creatively it was a great introduction.",
                "If you are considering this course at all, you should absolutely take it! My writing has improved so much because of it, and I genuinely looked forward to every class.",
                "I have already recommended this course to others and I'm sure I will continue to do so. The organization of the class as a seminar combined with occasional large guest lectures gave it the benefits of both seminar and lecture-style classes; I felt very familiar with my immediate classmates by the end, and I really appreciated getting the chance to learn from published writers during the lectures. It was also very effective as an introductory class, and I was glad to have different units on prose, poetry, and drama. I came away from the class feeling like a better, more confident, and more inspired writer, and I am grateful for having had the opportunity to take it."
