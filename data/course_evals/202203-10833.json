                "Building on French 110/120, this class introduced me to French books, films, and furthered my knowledge of the language, grammar, and vocabulary. Its a good continuation of the French sequence that emphasizes grammar and vocabulary.",
                "Learning a language expands your mind in a way no other subject can. Taking French L3, I learned to manage my time with a high workload in college and critically think in French at a pace I never thought I could do before. Its definitely a very difficult class, but even with my external circumstances, I became able to mentally argue in French about topics I didnt think was accessible to my current level of French. While I came into college with external circumstances that significantly diminished my French abilities (and I did struggle for a big while from the start of the semester), I see that I have greatly improved in my French abilities and my understanding of my academic potential. French at Yale is definitely a highly difficult course, but it is also very rewarding and what you put into it, you get back tenfolds.",
                "Major improvements to grammar. I can write and understand much better, and my speaking is improving.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I really learned a lot of French! This course enhanced my knowledge of the grammar structures and increased my vocabulary. I came away from the class feeling more confident in my speaking, writing, and reading abilities. Also, take this class with Prof. Ngame if you can! He is truly a Yale treasure  with him, youre excited to come to class every day.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class emphasizes grammar and vocab in tests. As such, it incentivized learning very specific grammar/memorizing a very specific list of vocabulary to do well on tests, rather than emphasizing a more cumulative, holistic acquisition of the language. Also, some of the course materials (especially Jules et Jim) were quite dated, and it was difficult to work with the online interface that held the videos and audio links. I think modernizing some of the course material would make this class excellent.",
                "Pros:\r\n1. Professor Ngame is very amazing, and he understands each student goes at their own pace. He encourages every student to do the best they can, but one has to reach out first in order to get help which is understandable. I believe without Professor Ngame, I would not have improved in French as much as I did this semester or want to continue in my French learning journey. The semester was very rocky for me, and there was even a point where I thought I no longer enjoyed learning French, but after persevering and Prof Ngames help, I was able to do the best I could do till the very end.\r\n2. The books and films for the class get more and more interesting as the semester follows. My favorite book was Monsieur Ibrahim et Les Fleurs du Coran. Absolutely wonderful book, and it was the first book in a totally different language where I shed a tear while reading it. Goodbye Monsieur Ibrahim you will be missed.\r\n3. Teaching and expectations are clear. The modules on Canvas are organized very cleanly, and it is understandable what is expected of you every day. There is no misinterpretation unless you dont check Canvas.\r\nCons:\r\n1. The first few books/films are a little bit on the uninteresting side personally, but that is not really a problem. Theyre definitely on the lower side of comprehension than the last few books/films which made me feel like I was actually reading/watching in real French for the first time.\r\n2. It is a very high workload course and meets every day M-F. Though it is kind of like high school in this way, French goes at a lot faster pace and workload. There is a learning curve with this pace+workload combo as well as how French classes at Yale is run. But after a month, you get to used to it. Just keep persevering. You got this.",
                "I found the worksheets we received in class to be incredibly helpful/most effective. I also found reviewing and discussing why things were correct was helpful in cementing the grammar rules in my own head. I think vocabulary was a little difficult to learn and retain because these were words not used in normal conversation throughout the week, so I wish we learned words/phrases that we would be more likely to use when talking to each other in class or would use in a francophone country. Additionally, super helpful online tools for learning vocab such as Quizlet now require payment for any beneficial features to be used, it can add another barrier for students to obtain tools to improve. I think it would be helpful to move homework and vocabulary practice onto an online platform the department provides to students. I think Spanish courses use an online interface to ensure students are practicing daily and offer additional practice where they can receive immediate feedback, a similar format for French outside the classroom would definitely make consistent practice helpful.  I also think it may be worthwhile to make the class/language requirement not for a grade, or assess students based on the efforts they make to improve rather than just on benchmarks set by the department since everyone is starting from different places and progresses at different rates. I think language learning varies greatly from any other subject area in many ways, so I don't know that the traditional grading schematic is the best and most fair way to assess the efforts of students. I think a lot of people would be more encouraged to continue with French beyond what is required for the sake of learning the language if they didn't have to worry about how the class may impact their GPA.",
                "This is a very engaging course that uses multiple forms of media for instruction. Its organization could be improved (i.e. Canvas deadlines, homework, and evaluation information)."

                "It depends on the students goals. \r\n\r\nSituation 1: You want to fulfill your language distribution requirements as soon as possible.\r\n- If you know you are amazing at French, then the workload will be high but you will get over the learning curve rather quickly. You will do well!\r\n- If you know you are good/average/bad at French, then the learning curve will be very high and you may have a better semester taking an L1 language of another course. \r\n\r\nSituation 2: You enjoy French.\r\n- Yes. Take this class regardless of what you feel about your French abilities. You are placed into L3 / you finished L2 or L1+L2 for a reason. It is very challenging, but the enjoyment and satisfaction you get from what you put into the class, you will get back tenfolds. You learn at a quick pace but dont leave a stone uncovered. Its an amazing course Id recommend to anyone who loves to learn French/languages.",
                "I would recommend this class. I would warn students that it is a lot of work, but you are learning a whole new way to connect and communicate with people. Going to office hours is a great way to get extra help.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this course and my class schedule allowed me to devote adequate time to it. I would caution another student of the workload."
