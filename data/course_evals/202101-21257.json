                "Professor Gorski and Anne (TF) did a great job of breaking down each theory and trying to apply it to situations or scenarios that we would be familiar with and could comprehend more easily. Sometimes, this included supplemented the longer/denser theory with a more recent article that was somehow related and using THAT as the jumping-off point for discussion.",
                "Strengths: I think the class was set up to privilege student participation, and that was appreciated. Discussion was always fostered, and there was a very friendly relationship among the class that helped us to talk through ideas in productive ways. \r\nWeaknesses: I wouldn't have picked some of the readings tbh, (I think we could have read something for formative for when we introduced intersectionality, for instance).",
                "The syllabus was wonderful, I loved the inclusion of Patricia Hill Collins, Crenshaw, and Pyle. I think the course should feature Black feminist theory more heavily though and perhaps more background information on non canonical scholars.",
                "Strengths: very relevant and diverse theories and theorists. I really enjoyed the session where we had one of the theorists speak to us. The TA and the Professor were very warm, accessible, and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: 5pm deadlines don't compute in my head very well (I don't know if this is just a me issue or an issue for students in general). I think having discussion posts due 2 hours before class has been a very effective method in my other classes (as it still provides the professor/tas enough time to read the responses to prepare for class).",
                "Strengths - I really enjoyed reading so many thinkers, and I believe this class did a lot to expand the sociological canon.",
                "This course benefited from a great and diverse set of readings and an equally diverse group of students. The discussion format of the class made it easy to engage in the texts on a more intimate level, but occasionally discussions seemed too unstructured. More directed explanations of key topics and more clear guidelines to discussions would have helped to make the learning objectives of each class more clear."
