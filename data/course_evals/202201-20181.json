The big topics are assembly language, I/O, interrupts, concurrency, and scheduling. All of the homeworks (labs) involve writing/running code on an Arduino (if you're unfamiliar, it's basically a mini-computer). They can be a little tricky, but you have plenty of time to complete them and will learn a lot by putting the topics discussed in lecture into practice.",

                "The course was exactly what I had been looking for as an EECS major. It was the next step to the CS and EE concepts and material learned in the past, but now for the greater purpose of building a working system. I loved all the real-life examples Prof Manohar would insert with every concept as it solidified the relevancy of the material.",

You'll work a little with your hands but not much. The coding is mostly trivial besides Lab 4, where you implement context switching, concurrency, and locks on the Arduino in C using pointers, structs, etc. I also learned a bunch of interesting stuff about scheduling algorithms for real-time systems, and interesting cases of embedded system failure in industry.",

I learned SO MUCH. Firstly, I learned a lot about digital systems themselvesall the interesting problems and workarounds, and I thought it was taught in a very engaging way. I also learned, maybe more significantly, about making physical projects combining electrical engineering and computer science, which I had never even come close to doing before. Now I feel like I can make anything!"

                "This course was well organized. I wish the office hours were a bit more helpful for some of the difficult labs. Manohar is very good at what he does and is incredibly intelligent.",
                "The labs are a big strength of the course, as they are interesting and a lot of fun. The lectures were also very informative, and Professor Manohar keeps the lectures engaging. The only thing that could be somewhat improved is the experience during office hours. My partner and I usually figured the labs out by talking with others in the class rather than working with the TAs.",
                "Strengths: very approachable course even if you have no prior EE knowledge. Weaknesses: PSET 4 was unnecessarily hard (not intellectually or length-wise but debugging was a nightmare without the ability to use print statements) and it was due too close to the final project",
                "Overall it's a really solid course. Rajit is really good at explaining things, and I think you get a lot out of the course relative to the time you have to put in (especially if you have some prior exposure to the topics).",
                "I would say that this course is primarily a CS course, rather than an EE course, as you are expected to know how to code decently well. Manohar said that it would only require arduino code knowledge, but one of the labs was straight CS and no circuits whatsoever. As a EE major, it was pretty difficult lab-wise for some of the labs, as I felt that the stuff being taught in lecture was not all that helpful in doing the labs. Lecture material was more or less straight forward, and Manohar is a great professor. Quizzes were kind of annoying but if you are EECS, this is a pretty good class for you. Final project was also fun you were basically given complete freedom to build an embedded systems device.",
                "The course is very well taught and meant to facilitate student learning. The labs were very hands-on, and the weekly quizzes were useful in terms of understanding concepts.",
                "Thought was great course, maybe final project could tie into course content more",
                "Professor Manohar is an awesome professor and I learned so, so much from this class. The labs were all really fun as well.",
                "The professor is an excellent teacher, which is rare in the EE department, and and the labs are interesting enough.",
                "Strengths - Great lectures, problem sets teach you a lot, whole course is designed to really help you learn and Professor Manohar is great! \r\nWeaknesses - You are not taught basic circuit making or CS so if you are inexperienced in one area you really struggle and have to rely on online sources to teach yourself.",
                "Strengths: Very fair quizzes and exams, the labs felt relevant to the material we learned in class, and Prof Manohar was very involved with students and receptive to student feedback/suggestions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the lab specs felt very vague and TAs would also be confused, most of the confusion could be cleared up with an Ed post though",
                "Great labs + professor",
                "The course was very interested and covered a lot of good material. I think the lab specs could have been a little more specific or the TAs could have had a bit more training when it came to the lab so they could help.",
                "strengths: great lecturer, very organized class, loved the structure of having labs as our homework!\r\nweaknesses: sometimes it felt like there was a big difference between the level of material between lectures and labs/assessments. it was also definitely more challenging to understand some topics as a non-cs major. i also think there could have been more communication/interaction between tas and students.",
                "Some office hours or walkthroughs for the psets would be helpful!",
                "Feedback was definitely one area for improvement. Much of our work wasn't graded until the end of the semester, and no comment were given. Grading took an excessively long time. No comments were given on the quizzes either which was very unhelpful. The slides are pretty much exactly what slides should be--not too detailed, and nice and concise. The labs are great and I loved Lab 4 because we did some nontrivial stuff with concurrency. The open-ended final project is also great. Weaknesses included feedback, organization (no one ever really answered questions on Ed, and Canvas or Ed should be used more to make important announcements), and responsiveness. I also think a lot of students couldn't follow during class because the lectures were very auditory and not very visual. More visuals on board etc. could be helpful.",
                "Around the middle of the course things started to go way over my head (starting with analog inputs and then especially with digital I/O protocols). Now, this was certainly worsened by the fact that I definitely did not have the proper qualifications to take the class, but it seemed like everyone else was struggling as well. Everything else was amazing. Overall, this has been my favorite class so far at Yale."

                "I think so. If you are a CS student, this course is easier than the digital embedded systems course, but covers very similar concepts. There is only one exam which is great and the final lab is a self created project using Arduino and the skills you've gained over the semester. This class helps you understand many of the lower level concepts when it comes to computers: concurrency, process scheduling and algorithms, I/O, digital and analog. Plus Manohar is one of the chillest dudes on this campus... seriously.",
                "Yes  especially if you're EECS! The class is a great combination of EE fundamentals and low-level CS concepts and is one of the only classes taught at Yale that fully combines the two subjects. I think it's a great class even if you are only studying one of the two subjects or even are just interested in learning about embedded systems.",
                "Definitely! As a CS major, this class was so accessible, and it was awesome to be able to understand computers on an even lower level than 323. There is a lot of overlap in topics from 323 and 365, but you work with the information on a different level which is really cool.",
                "Definitely. Works well as a second CS class. Not a huge workload, but you learn a lot.",
                "Yes if you have the CS background its pretty hard without having knowledge of linked lists, assembly code, etc. But otherwise in terms of concepts they are actually quite interesting. Labs are just kind of difficult due to there being a slight disconnect between the labs and lecture material.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It provides some of the best instruction on how computers function.",
                "Definitely if interested in electrical engineering and or computer science",
                "Yes! It's a very hands-on class and I enjoyed being able to learn so much about Digital Systems from Professor Manohar.",
                "Yeah, if you're interested in operating systems and want to physically build a project at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes! Great elective for CS majors to really understand the hardware-software relationship. Also an excellent way to get exposure to Arduinos and how they work.",
                "Yeah, this was a class that I really appreciated because of the labs.",
                "Yes! The labs are a bit of work (especially the 3rd / 4th ones), however, it is all extremely fulfilling and feels like what an EECS class should be. The real-world examples of the concepts we learned were also amazing reminders of how the concepts we learn are important to science and tech.",
                "Yes, feel like I really did take something from this class",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about building digital systems and playing with Arduinos",
                "yes!! great for ee people or eecs people more interested in building hands on projects! i had a great time as an ee major and learned a lot. i genuinely can say that i really enjoyed this class, which i can't say for many other classes in the ee department.",
                "Yes, definitely! The labs are really fun, and you'll probably learn a lot, unless you already have a lot of experience with Arduino. The course is not much work. If you've already done a lot of Arduino and have taken CPSC 323 and know about concurrency, locks, etc., you probably shouldn't take this course. It's pretty introductory. But either way you'll learn something about actually implementing concurrency and locks, and about scheduling algorithms.",
                "YES. I had nearly no qualifications going in, and I definitely should not have taken the course, but looking back, if I was in the same situation, I would take it again. This course is so fun, it fills in all the missing pieces of how computers work that you've wondered for so long that you've forgotten about them. How is a bit physically stored? How can you have two windows open on your computer at the same time? Take this class."
