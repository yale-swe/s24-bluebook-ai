In the second half of the course, we learned and analyzed a lot of thermodynamic cycles (Carnot, Rankine, Otto, Diesel, Carnot refrigeration, and Brayton refrigeration).

Professor Cha understands students struggle and has a reasonable grading table.\r\nWeaknesses: exams embody \"extension of learning\" strategy. As a person who appreciates numbers instead of letters in math, I feel like I got tripped up on algebra/variable manipulation instead of the actual concepts of course on tests. Class is just hard and many will struggle.",
                "I would've liked more flexible office hours, and the addition of review sessions before exams.",
                "The course has a great textbook that does a good job of explaining the concepts and provides clear examples, Professor Cha is kind and enthusiastic about teaching, and the homework assignments are not too unreasonable.",
                "Weakness: The grading of the first midterm seemed extremely unreasonable. Points were almost solely awarded to correct numerical values and not your understanding. This led to an alarmingly low mean/median.",
                "This course was excellent. The lectures were very fun and engaging. Professor Cha delivers the information at a great pace, and everything is explained excellently. I felt that the problem sets were never very long, so the time commitment was not bad at all either. The exams were very fair, although the average on the midterm was super low. There is ample practice available in the textbook in order to prepare for tests. Lastly, Professor Cha was very compassionate in regards to overall course grading as she offered extra credit.",
                "Too abstract, too vague.",
                "Strengths: Diagrams in the notes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Harsh grading for minute mistakes",
                "Strengths: The class was well-organized. Lectures were relatively easy to follow, and they followed the textbook closely enough that I could use the textbook to review concepts I didn't understand the first time. I also really enjoyed the tour of Sterling Power Plant: it was really interesting to see a real system based on what we'd learned, and it was very humbling to realize just how much engineering goes into a power plant relative to what you can learn in one semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion, given how highly the midterm and final were weighted (35% each), they were too short (75 and 100 minutes, with only three questions each). This meant that every question was extremely high-leverage, which was very stressful.",
                "Strengths: Prof Cha gave lectures that were incredibly clear and easy to follow. They clearly flowed from one to the next, so it was easy to see how one concept built on top of the ones we had learned before. They were also engaging, and made me excited to go to class each week! Another huge strength is the support via Prof Cha, TAs, and ULA office hours. They often stayed late to make sure everyone had their questions answered, and were offered at multiple different times throughout the week to accommodate different schedules. Overall I learned a lot and felt I had the sufficient support to make sure I did so. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think of is that I actually found Ch 14 very interesting but it was a bit rushed. I would have enjoyed spending some more time on it.",
                "The examples in class were really helpful. The peer tutors were great. Professor Cha is a good lecturer.",
                "Weaknesses: Not set up very well. Exams, especially midterm, were graded in the worst way possible. Heard multiple people losing 15+ pts (of 100) for one missed negative sign. Did part b of a question completely correct but got -10 bc answer for part a was incorrect... You could understand all of the material and one stupid mistake will put you in the same place as a monkey taking the test.",

                "The course was very well organized and paced.",
                "The exams gave extremely low amounts of partial credit which felt very unfair. Many answers were extremely close to posted to solutions but received 25% credit",
                "Great class with a great professor",
                "Strengths: clear lectures, lots of support given by professor (who won't be teaching anymore)\r\nWeaknesses: material was repetitive and did not use real-world examples",
                "Not very well taught: too much focus on bare equations rather than why things work. Bare minimum for practical learning",
                "Strengths were the helpful TAs that aided me with homework and studying for exams. This course requires so many formulas to be memorized, with small cases that help you identify which ones to use. However, the importance of these formulas was not highlighted in class, which made it difficult to perform well on exams and homework. There was also only one midterm exam when the syllabus originally listed two exams. This did not give students much ability to improve their grades after they were graded rather harshly on the exam. Also, students were allowed to bring one cheat sheet into both the midterm exam and the final. It was near impossible to squeeze all of the necessary information and formulas onto that sheet for it to be helpful."

                "I have mixed feelings about this course. While I loved Judy as a person, her teaching could be confusing as the lectures often focused on halfhearted derivations of formulas that left you more confused then you initially were. She is a lovely person though and often interspersed small funny anecdotes throughout the lectures which made them entertaining. Psets were not too difficult, you could usually figure them out using the textbook and your notes, and they usually only took a few hours a week which was pretty nice. The class wasn't a huge timesuck on a weekly basis, but you definitely have to focus a lot on studying for the midterms/final. I studied an insane amount for the midterm and did decently, but it took me forever to relearn all of the content since I didn't understand it too well when I initially learned it. The class didn't do too well; we averaged a 57/100, and she decided not to curve it, instead curving the class and offering extra credit (5% of our course grade for going on a field trip to a power plant). I'd say the class is solidly mid, but if you're taking this it's probably required for your major. Not the most interesting/well taught class, but definitely not the most cursed one out there.",
                "No, not unless you are an engineering major of some kind. Too difficult and not many applications outside of intention as it's very tailored to mechanical engineering.",
                "Yes, these concepts are important for scientists and engineers, and the teaching and textbook help solidify the material.",
                "Yes, I would. This course was very interesting, and I thought the questions on problem sets and exams were really fun. The cycles are very applicable to real life, so learning about them feels even more important. Professor Cha also enhances the material and makes it easy to understand what is going on. I genuinely enjoyed going to class in this course. The workload is also never burdensome in this course. This was my favorite class in the mechanical engineering department so far.",
                "If it were much better taught, yes, the study of thermo can be fundamental. But it is to be taken as a pre-req, basic knowledge for understanding more advanced topics.",
                "Professor Cha said on the first day of class that sometimes it's important to do things even if you don't particularly enjoy them, and I think that applies to this class. I took this class because it was required, and I wouldn't say I particularly liked thermodynamics, but at the same time, I feel like thermodynamics is something that I should learn and I'm glad I took the class.\r\n\r\nI found this class deceptively difficult. Mathematically, it's very easy: nothing more than simple algebra. However, there are so many formulas to keep track of--especially for ideal gases--that figuring out the right approach to a problem isn't always easy. Also, compared to most other MechE classes I've taken, a lot of the quantities we discussed, such as entropy or the difference between internal energy and enthalpy, were abstract enough that it was hard to develop an instinct for when to use which one, although I eventually did.",
                "YES!! It is so applicable to many fields and you really will learn a lot!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. The material is interesting and the workload isn't bad. Partial credit is pretty harsh on exams, but Professor Cha does publish a grading rubric.",
                "If Judy is not teaching and you're interested then sure.",
                "No, unless you require it.",
                "I would.",
                "Yes! Professor is very good at answering questions, and spending more time with you when needed",
                "No, unless it's necessary.",
                "No, it was not taught for practical learning. This is a very widely applicable subject within mechE and it is taught as basically equation memorization",
                "I found the material to be difficult to understand, and the professor's teaching made it even more difficult. There are other ways to take thermodynamics at Yale, and I have to imagine they would be better than this course."
