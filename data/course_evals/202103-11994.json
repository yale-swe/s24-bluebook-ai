I more have an understanding of many underlying meanings of Modern Chinese characters and sentence structures. Through memorization tasks, I have internalized aspects of literary Chineses form and structure.",
                "This course provides a thorough introduction to Classical Chinese. From a purely technical standpoint, I learned to recognize (and in some cases, write) more traditional characters, and acquired a great many grammatical constructions used in literary texts. Our readings also yielded a better understanding of Chinese history and culture, e.g. the origin of certain chengyu.",

                "This course does a good job at introducing you to a wide array of texts, grammar, and vocabulary that are mostly useful in reading other texts. It builds a very good foundation and strongly emphasizes simple and foundational grammar and vocabulary points while also maintaining a discussion on the culture of early China. However the way the homework is organized is really not conducive to helping you understand the texts or showing your understanding of the text. It would make more sense to have a translation homework after you have learned a text in class, but in this class we were expected to finish the translation before class, and then we had a short period of time after class where we could correct our translation. I find it cemented bad habits and misinterpretations more firmly for me to do the translation before class, but there was simply not enough time after class to wait and do it then. Another pitfall is that we almost never made it through the lessons during class in the last half of the semester, so we had to finish half of a lesson in the next class before we could start the new one. This meant that we were expected to translate and turn in a text when we hadn't even learned half of it yet.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the care that Dr. Lin puts into each lesson. Dr. Lin answered every question that I had in a thoughtful manner, and planned her assignments such that the coursework never felt like busy work. \r\n\r\nOne way that the course could be improved is to post the slides related to important grammar patterns on Canvas. After the midterm, this would be particularly useful as there were no longer any grammar exercises to refer back to during review before the weekly quizzes. One example of this is the ObjSubVb pattern which did not have a corresponding grammar worksheet but was still on a weekly quiz and the final.",
                "Great course. Perhaps we could look at more texts without punctuation and try to punctuate them before attempting to read  them?",
                "One strength of the course was its emphasis on reading and translating passages on our own, as this was probably what I learned the most from.  \r\nOne weakness of the course is that we did not address in class some of the more unusual grammar structures we had to translate for homework, so I would have appreciated more breakdowns of particularly difficult phrases.",
                "Strengths: Engaging instructor, insightful texts and manuscripts, applicability to other courses and practices I've undertaken \r\nWeaknesses: Some stress from high workload and regular assignments due",
                "Good student engagement, interesting readings\r\nNot enough time left for class discussion because quizzes were too long"

My focus in studying Chinese is on modern usage of the language (especially for interpretation), and this course was still very interesting and helpful to me. Studying literary Chinese has helped me speak modern Chinese in a more elegant and native-like way, especially by integrating idioms and understanding the origins of grammatical patterns.",
                "Great class! Professor is incredible and the material is very fun and interesting. Just note that the workload starts off very light for the first month or so, but at the end the translations due each class become much longer and take several hours to complete. That being said, the work is quite pleasant!",
                "Yes, though specifically for those with an interest in pre-modern Chinese history and literature, whether for research purposes or to satisfy other intellectual curiosities. Course was well-designed to provide exposure to the building blocks of literary Chinese and a great confidence booster as we progressed from short tales to long narratives.",
