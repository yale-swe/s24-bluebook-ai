                "In Spanish 130, I learned how to communicate effectively  both in writing and verbally  through the Spanish language. More than develop my grammatical and constructional language skills, this course has taught me how to navigate complex conversations in the Spanish-speaking world, while feeling more confident in my fluency and myself. Additionally, I feel much more comfortable in my ability to study language after completing the variety of engaging projects, exams, and assignments from this course.",
                "I developed my grammar skills, reading skills, and speaking skills.",
                "I greatly improved my ability to write and converse in Spanish, especially through improved understanding of grammar and exposure to new vocabulary.",
                "I bettered my comprehension, speaking, reading and writing abilities just by practicing them everyday and doing so many activities that involve those skills."

                "I didn't learn much more in terms of Spanish grammar. Much of the first part of the semester was simply review from SPAN 120.",
                "The course covered a fairly broad breadth of vocabulary, communication media, and cultural topics. In each class, I was almost always engaged with the material  there is very rarely a quiet moment in class as we're always chatting with a partner, watching a video, listening to Spanish-language music, reflecting as a group, or completing a worksheet. One of the setbacks of the course was the lack of clarity on what assignments were do when, and what the expectations for those assignments were. I often found myself completing projects too early because of discrepancies between what was discussed in class and the syllabus, without the knowledge I needed to accurately and successfully complete assignments. I would have also liked to receive more timely feedback on my work so that I could be a more active agent in the improvement of my skills.",
                "The strength was the grammar skills, and it felt good to review every grammar structure from ser\/estar to learning future tense and subjunctive. It was very cumulative, and a great summary of Spanish. Professor Reymundi is great in allowing you to speak with a partner and with the whole class. It was very relaxed. There was a lot more grammar and speaking at you than you speaking.",
                "Strengths are how participation is highly encouraged. Speaking in class is what helped me improve the most, so it is a good thing that participation accounts for a fair portion of our grades. The stories and movies we watched were engaging and facilitated learning. One thing that could be improved is the order we read the stories in; I think El Recital del Piano was a little difficult for us to read so early in the semester. I also think that at times the syllabus was confusing because the homework there did not really match what the professor told us in class. Updating the syllabus could help clear up this issue.",
                "The strength of the course are in that it sharpens comprehension since everything is done in Spanish and students are able to interact with non-academic content such as \"Tambien La Lluvia\". Something to improve upon could be lining the VHL up with the lessons, because those activities were practically independent of what we were learning in class."

                "Unquestionably, I would recommend this course to another Yale student. Throughout the duration of the course, my confidence in the Spanish-speaking language grew exponentially. However, if you are not interested in Spanish language and cultural and and are just seeking to fulfill a language requirement, I would not recommend this course. You will get the most out of it if you're truly interested in speaking Spanish, since that is exactly what this course will expect you to do.",
                "Yes! Professor Reymundi is an amazing, caring, and such a nice professor. She facilitates a classroom that is so fun and engaging to learn Spanish. It felt nice to have such a nice professor. It was fun.",
                "Yes, I think there was a reasonable amount of work especially considering how much I feel I learned from this class. Professor Reymundi did a great job and I enjoyed coming to class 4 days a week. It was fun and engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish abilities. Your comprehension, speaking, reading and writing abilities are honed and improved in this course."
