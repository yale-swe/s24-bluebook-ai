                "The course is very engaging and the content is wonderful. Although it could feel like a fair amount of work at times, nothing was unreasonable, and this is expected for a summer course with less time.",
                "This course is a very thorough breakdown of corruption and its caused and consequences. The only issue is the sheer quantity if material, which can be borderline overwhelming at times.",
                "The course is very well-structured, which is both a strength and a liability. It is good since students know what to expect, yet it is bad since the instructor made little effort to adapt the course from last year. For example, all the dates in Canvas are messed up, which can cause a lot of confusion. It is a good class to take over Zoom since it has been like this for a long time, but the level of engagement is quite low since we don't dive deeply into readings in lectures.",
                "The strengths were Prof. Palifka's eagerness for the course. She was very knowledgeable and appeared invested in the topic and the students. The weakness was the overload of materials presented to us each week without much guidance. We had multiple journal articles, book readings, and lecture materials for each week, adding up to 15+ hours to realistically get through the material. It made it difficult to really fully process and comprehend the material. I think instead of assigning multiple textbook chapters, on top of recorded videos to watch and other journal articles, it would be more worthwhile to pick and choose specific readings to focus on instead. A lot of the material was redundant anyways.",
                "The course had a lot of different assignments that were due weekly but it was pretty organized and very manageable",
                "This course was very well organized and designed to facilitate student learning. Since some people were dominating our discussion during class, it may be nice to incorporate more breakout rooms in order for all students to get the chance to contribute more.",
                "Very interesting topics and good exposure through guest speakers",
                "Strengths: Learned to work in a group and coordinate ideas without leaving anyone behind as well as develop solid time-management."

                "Yes -- it is a very interesting course with so many applications to the real world. My favorite part is how we discuss real world events and real instances of corruption instead of taking a traditional economic approach where we only focus on the theoretical.",
                "Yes. It is both interesting and useful towards understanding corruption, not just on the large scale but also in individual circumstances.",

                "Yes. I thought it was a great course",
                "Cool guest lecturers, interesting concepts, but I think writing a group paper is awkward. Lots of emphasis on the final group paper, which was my least favorite part of the class. Overall a pretty good course but kind of harsh grading by the TA, and a little by the professor. Definitely a class you have to put effort into.",
                "I would recommend this course as it teaches you about a concept that is present in every country around the world and in every domain. I think this course additionally helps you understand the ways you can fight against corruption which I think is one of the key takeaways."
