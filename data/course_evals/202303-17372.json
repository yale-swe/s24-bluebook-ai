                "Goshwhere to begin? This class is genuinely biblical. It gave me a whole new language to talk about writing, which includes Davids, bowerbirds, nuns, fragile pork chops, and pickles. I wish the whole world had the same vocabulary I'll greatly miss sitting around a table with people who all understand what a \"left clavicle\" really means. The selection of readings is tasteful and transformative both in content and form and made class discussion the most engaging I have experienced in a Yale course. When I felt stumped about how to do something in my essays, I'd always turn to the readings to see how the authors achieved somethingtransitions, adjectives, sentence structure, I-plots. I understood grammar rules for the first time in my life and developed an appreciation for perfect prose. I developed an intimate relationship with a thesaurus that I can now never exist in a city without. I learned how to feel more confident in my voice, how to develop techniques to become a more productive, disciplined, and self-confident writer, and (something I wasn't expecting to enjoy so much) how to offer constructive comments when editing others' writing. I loved reading and discussing other students' work and fostering literary relationships with people beyond the class."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: everything. Anne. The hugeness of the Yellow Pages assignment (difficult, but a great learning experience re: how to persevere with a creative project). The people. The structure (this class is a well-oiled machine).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing except that its hard to get into! Having to apply multiple times is normal. Reader, dont give up. Its worth it.",
                "STRENGTHS: This course is baked with so much diversity into its syllabus, both in the reading list and the assignments. You really get the best of a journalism and memoir/personal-essay writing class with this one! You give and receive consistent feedback from your peers on CANVAS as well as have a workshop during the semester.\r\nWEAKNESSES: The workload is somewhat unrelenting?? But you get out what you put in.",
                "It's just a terrific, life-changing course, and I'm not exaggerating here! There is so much feedback -- from workshop, from Anne, from your fellow students; the readings are fantastic, the writing assignments are challenging; and Anne provides so much wisdom in the class periods. It's sort of difficult for me to imagine how the class could be improved -- the worst part of it is that it ends! Some specific strengths: you get a one hour 1 on 1 editing session with Anne for each piece, which is extraordinary; you develop an intimate relationship with the rest of the class; and you get to spend about half of the semester on the final writing assignment, which is a super rewarding experience.",
                "This course has too many strengths to count. The first strength is Anne Fadiman. She is an exceptional teacher. The second strength is the other students in the class, all of whom are exceptional writers and people. The third strength are the writing assignments, which are carefully organized to maximize learning. The fourth strength is the syllabus, which is filled with gorgeous model texts. There are no weaknesses.",
                "The people bring this class to life. Anne is, famously, a fantastic professor and person--witty and warm, thoughtful and caring, ultimately just an incredibly gifted writer and editor. She plans the class down the last minute; I never felt there was any wasted time. The syllabus deliberately draws from a wide range of authors and styles, and I hope the class composition itself will evolve to better reflect those diverse backgrounds. That being said, my classmates were all wonderfully talented writers and funny people. It was such a delight to read and learn with them each week.",
                "Strengths: (spoiler, too many).\r\nI have never experienced a professor putting this much effort into a class or caring as strongly for their students as Anne. Anne prepares every class down to the minute  and every minute is pinch-me-quick perfect. She organizes hour-long one-on-one conferences with every student to discuss and edit every piece and one or two revisions. I don't know how she has the time but thank heaven because these writing conferences are transformative. Not only does she help you make the essay better, but teaches you how to channel a little Anne-editor angel in your head. Anne encourages weirdness and truthfulness, which I've found is a secret to writing well. \r\n\r\nThe course reader is a gift TycoPrint might as well wrap it with a bow. Each essay is breathtaking and has infinite \"blue objects\" to teach good writing. From these essays, we develop 649's quirky but invaluable language on writing. Not only are the individual essays brill, but the way Anne orders them is carefully considered. The essays build perfectly on each other and each one offers a new blue object to be learned and emulated.\r\n\r\nClass discussions were something I'll treasure forever. Every student is interesting and smart and, most importantly, cares so much about the course. This is evident in the responses students wrote on Canvas on other people's pieces and the way people were eager to share favorite sentences from essays we read for homework. I loved the author's presentations they not only helped us fall in love with the authors, understand their backgrounds, and make them memorable and human rather than canonized and God-like but also made us feel more comfortable with each other and allowed us to experience each others' creativity and initiate class-bonding.\r\n\r\nThe essays: Home, Place, Object, and finally, the YP assignment are all evocative yet simple prompts and incredible learning experiences. They build into each other and allow the class to be vulnerable with each other. They push journalists to be more vulnerable and creative writers to try their hand at reporting. For a generation that doesn't look up from their phones, the Yellow Pages piece is a real gift. As a student in our class rightly said, the Yellow Pages serve as a lifetime inspiration guide and remind you that there's always a story behind every storefront or person you pass on the street. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was hard but here are suggestions (feedback is a gift...):\r\n\r\nA first draft of the personal pitfall list is due for the final class so everyone has to share one that's most significant. It would be nice for students to hear what everyone else struggles with and might inspire people to add some to their list that they forgot. The deadline would make the revision process less daunting and force students to start earlier without there being scary pressure. It would also guarantee students have lists before the final revision process. \r\n\r\nYou have the procrastination discussion earlier in the semester and share the heavy/light flywheel metaphor to help students become more self-aware of bad habits earlier on. \r\n\r\nPartners critiques are posted as replies to the discussion Canvas page just like comments and final YP revisions. I think editing is a really valuable learning experience of the course and, like the pieces themselves, should be made public so people can learn from them. Some students are more experienced than others and it would be nice to see how different people edit. Some of my classmates and I were insecure about the quality of our critiques; though you gave helpful (and positive) feedback during our one-to-one conferences, it would be nice to 1. feel motivated in writing the critique because it's for your partner and the class's benefit and 2. get inspiration for critiques based on how other students approach them. This is not so everyone edits the same; the critiques are essentially verbose comments and would be fun to share."

                "Yes. If you get the chance to take a class with Anne Fadiman, you take a class with Anne Fadiman. \r\n\r\nThis is the first creative writing class Ive taken in which the professor was actually invested in making us better writers. Anne crafts each seminar with such care. Every moment thoughtfully planned and carefully executed; every word is valuable.\r\n\r\nThe classroom environment is supportive and warm. Everyone helps everyone else. Yes, assignments are challenging. I get the high work rating. But its well worth it. This is rewarding work. The readings, class sessions, and assignments fit together better than any class Ive taken at Yale. It all just makes sense. If you do the work, you get better. \r\n\r\nAlso, its just fun. I looked forward to every class, assignment, and Canvas post. Not to be sappy on CourseTable, but this course made my Yale experience. I feel grateful.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS! It has totally made me reconsider who I am as a person and a writer; how I approach any assignment and how not to procrastinate! It provides you with a tight-knit cohort of fellow writers who all try to make each other better.",
                "Yes. If you get in, take it. You must! See the strengths section.",
                "Yes! If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to take this course, you should drop everything and take it. Just be aware that you will get out what you put in. If you are already busy outside of class, I would suggest a serious reorganization of your schedule, so that you can put in all the time this class deserves. There is so much to learn, from Anne, from your own writing process, from classmates, and from the syllabus, that you will be shortchanging yourself if you don't give yourself time to engage.",
                "Yes! If you're lucky enough to get a spot in this course, you should absolutely take it. Prepare for a lot of work but a lot of growth along with it.",
                "Yes. A thousand times yes. This is by far the best class I have taken at Yale. This class convinced me that I want to be a writer professionally. I learned that I love writing for the sake of writing, words for the sake of Roget, and that very little is as important or inspiring to me. This is the first class I have taken C/P/F and did it for the right reasons. The all-nighters I pulled were sustained not by caffeine but by sheer joy. You learn a whole new vocabulary for writing that will carry you through your life. The visits from professional writers were such highlights; the opportunity to write letters and ask questions to authors about their process was invaluable. You get to read amazing essays by famous authors and (perhaps even more) amazing essays by your peers. Most importantly, you get to share the table with a group of intellectually curious, quirky, passionate students who make being vulnerable so easy."
