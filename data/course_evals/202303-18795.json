            "comments": [
                "This course is strong in that it teaches you a variety of concepts and tools, and the professor keeps it interesting.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd say the class was almost too easy, which can lower one's engagement.",
                "The one critique I have is that I wish psets were aligned with material bc for much of the semester we were one or two lectures behind the psets so we had to teach ourselves the material before it was actually taught in class",
                "Strengths: the truly amazing Professor Smith! Take this course with him and only with him (this is my personal advice). Class content and material are REALLY well composed together, and the professor cares about the students so much. Two-sided \"cheat sheet\" on the exams that you can write yourself really helps to not lose points due to not having the most excellent memory for the specific equations, but rather focusing on the actual application part and using your skills that you have learned from the course in a creative way. The Application Project in lieu of a second midterm was a really fun part of the class, however, I spent my first 2-3 days of November break working on that. No matter how much I enjoyed it, it became a bit hard to complete. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the true/false questions on the exam are quite challenging and I felt like we did not prepare enough in-class for them, however, Prof. Smith provided additional material that students can look through and prepare from before the exam. Still, I would consider making it about 20-30% less of a priority on the exam. (Also, specific to this semester, walking to Kline Tower for a 9 am class was really challenging, and sometimes made studying late for other classes not possible. Some students have a sleep schedule that focuses on late studying, often until 2-3 am, and therefore I would recommend considering moving the class start time to around 10-10:30 am at least, especially if the classroom is at Kline Tower -- which I would highly recommend keeping.)",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course was the project, which was super fun to do. However, I think that it would be good if lectures were a bit more organized.",
                "Very solid, no notable weaknesses",
                "Excellent slides, and fun psets.",
                "The course was very consistent and well-designed, especially with midterm/project/final spacing. Psets were consistently made and there was a lot of help offered.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging, genuinely interesting, amazing professor. \r\nWeaknesses: None!!",
                "Strength was that I just loved the content and I thought it was was interesting how we used real-world examples to explain what we learned. I really can't think of any weakness except that sometimes the class would go quiet and I would feel bad for prof because he was really chill but my mind couldn't keep up that fast in class.",
                "Brett Smith's teaching was excellent. He moved through the material at a good pace, but made sure that the class was following along. A weakness was that we ran out of time at the end of the year and did not cover some of the more advanced topics in the text.",
                "Strengths: Very good, straightforward coverage of the fundamentals of linear algebra in one semester without being overly burdensome or difficult; workload was very fair and the problem sets were certainly helpful in understanding the material; interesting tie-ins with applications of the mathematics; maintained a good balance between fundamental and application-based knowledge. The lecture slides (available via Google Drive) were very well made and easy to review after class in order to prepare for problem sets or study for exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did become lost somewhat easily during certainly parts of the course (especially towards the latter half of the semester), and it sometimes felt like the lectures were charging into certain topics rather abruptly without too much of a tie-in to previous concepts that we had discussed.",
                "Strengths - good lectures, homework is not too much\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lectures not recorded",
                "Strengths: simple, straightforward, and well-structured with clear expectations. Weaknesses: None, really. It teaches you linear algebra in the way that the syllabus advertises. Flipped classroom style videos might be useful (like in MATH 120).",
                "Strengths: much better course layout and organization than MATH 225 in my opinion. Take with Brett Smith and you'll have a very solid instructor who's good at explaining concepts, too. Weaknesses: exam was a good degree harder than homework questions, just prepare yourself for that",
                "Course was well organized and TPS is a good way to involve students. Canvas is well structured. \r\nSome of the concept on the pset is only covered on Tuesday and the pset is due Wednesday so the time is quite intense and requires a lot of self learning. \r\nIt will be nice to update the course syllabus and give us back our final exam score.",
                "This course has a great textbook, and Professor Smith is a very good professor. I only wish that this class had some kind of notes or recorded lectures for when I was not able to make it to class, but the class follows the textbook pretty well so it is doable.",
                "The course was very well taught, the material was engaging, the peer tutors were incredibly helpful in facilitating student learning, and I walked away feeling like I learned genuinely valuable skills.",

                "Totally! If theyre a CS major they should def take some linear algebra and 222 (with Smith) is the best! Workload is very manageable, material is not too bad (before midterm at least) and the application project is fun",
                "I enjoyed this course so much that I even considered to pursue the math major at Yale. Weekly problem sets had varying lengths and sometimes it got a bit tedious. However, the length almost never goes above around 8 hours, and generally it is in the 3-5 hour range. the professor and peer tutors make sure people have enough opportunity to submit the materials by the deadline, and address last-minute questions in office hours, or in exceptional cases, can even provide additional time to finish a p-set. I think the workload was really fair.\r\nYou must remain engaged throughout the course and attend classes to do well on the midterm and final exam. Both tests are well organized, but prepare to be challenged with the questions. They require creative use of the material, which I personally enjoy, and got an A- on the midterm. Currently waiting on the Final outcomes. It is also great that they have so many questions, that if you miss one, it might not affect your score that much.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! One caveat that I want to highlight, though, is that despite the relatively low workload ratings on coursetable, be prepared for the content of the class to get a lot more theoretical and generally more difficult to understand in the latter half of the semester.",
                "Yes, the best linear class at Yale",
                "Yes, very good math class.",
                "Absolutely, both if you need it to take classes in CS or stats, or if you just need some QR credit. Doesn't require math that's too difficult, but a lot of interesting concepts and they all link together!",
                "Yes, but with Brett Smith",
                "YES! Linear algebra is a lot better than MATH112/115/120. If you had a hard time in those classes (like me), linear algebra approaches concept understanding in a much more engaging and interesting way! Also, the midterm and final are very similar to the problem sets. There are no questions that are meant to trick or surprise you (like there were on the MATH112/115/120 exams).",
                "YESSS! Technically I didn't have to take it for my major but it seemed silly so I did. I don't regret it except for the fact that it's gonna hurt my gpa, but the content was genuinely interesting to me. Also, learning with connections to the real world made things so much better and easier to understand.",
                "Yes, I think the material was very applicable to the real-world in an explicit manner.",
                "Yes, great class for non-math majors to be introduced to Linear Algebra.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in learning the basics of linear algebrafor a requirement or just for funthen MATH 222 is definitely a very good option; you'll certainly learn a lot (which can then be applied to other areas of STEM), and the workload is very manageable. I don't know much about MATH 225, but I think that 222 would probably be the better option for those majoring or primarily interested in non-math STEM fields. I've heard that the workload for 225 can be quite burdensome with a heavy focus on theoretical knowledge and proofs, sounless you're a math major or have a special interest in proofs/theoretical knowledge and are willing to do the additional work222 is probably the better option for most students.",
                "Yes, good lectures and learned a lot",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the basics of linear algebra and don't plan to pursue further math courses (otherwise, take 225).",
                "Yes - take it with Brett Smith! He's very good at explaining the mathematical concepts. It also helps to just read through the textbook as a supplement. Solid math class, just follow the syllabus, figure out how to use what formula when, turn in your work on time, and you'll do just fine. Make sure to practice mixing up concepts for the final exam because that final exam was more difficult than the homework problems, but not THAT far out of reach. You need a solid understanding of the concepts and you'll do fine there, too. I would also recommend you take this class with a friend in mind to do that group project with; I didn't know very many people and got assigned someone who wasn't quite pulling their weight, and so that group project was a hassle, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this class if you just need a linear algebra course. Much better than MATH 225 (which I took and didn't continue with last semester because the organization was just... highly confusing, and standards for whether a proof was sufficient felt very arbitrary. For me at least. Brett Smith plus clear expectations and homework questions made this course a much better choice). ALSO Prof Smith has an art background and so the visuals he draws on the board are GOLDEN, so easy to follow and see what he's doing, and not the chicken scratch you usually get from math teachers. He's amazing at graphs and 3D depictions. Highly recommend!",
                "Yes! Totally great class, esp. if you take it w/ Prof Smith. Best math professor I have had in college.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting and I have recommended it to many of my friends.",
                "Yes, if you are even slightly interested in math this is a very doable class that covers applications, so stays interesting.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Whether you want to pursue higher level math or not, this course is well worth taking, as it blends theory with application, a rare find among courses here. Brett Smith is an excellent professor and looks for all his students to succeed. The psets aren't too long, the assessments are fair, and there's ample resources to pick up concepts you may have misunderstood the first time around.",
