                "The course had just made the jump from a seminar to a lecture and it was quite clear. Professor Ferguson wanted to keep the interactive element of the course alive, but many students did not participate in the lecture setting as actively as they would in a seminar. The material is interesting and relevant from writers of many different identities regarding many varying themes throughout the semester. Sections fell short for me and seemed to be tangential, in a bad way, to discussions we had in class.",
                "The course is very well organized and engages in a lot of thoughtful literature and art relevant to the course. The course also does not assign irrelevant or meaningless busy work which I appreciated.",
                "Strength - The assignments were genuinely fun and interesting to accomplish. \r\nWeakness - None",
                "Professor Ferguson is a wonderful lecturer. I also really loved my section!",
                "The class is amazing. 10/10. Take the class if you want to learn about queer and trans politics. Professor Ferguson's as well as the TAs' investment in the class is clear by the quality and care of the instruction.\r\n\r\nWeakness: can be a lot of work if you're not interested in the material.",
                "unfortunately, people didnt seem to do the readings or attend lecture regularly sometimes awkward pauses where no one would speak up in lecture but I really loved the material and Prof Ferguson is a brilliant lecturer",
                "This class is by far one of the best I have taken at Yale! This history covered in this class is one is often excluded from other gender and sexuality classes, and does a great job of challenging some of the mainstream narratives in LGBTQ history. The assignments did a great job of engaging the theory we learned in class and pushing our analytical skills, while at the same time feeling like relatively low-stress assignments. One of our assignments was to conceptualize a nightlife space. I also appreciated the open ended nature of the final project, and the option to pursue a creative project.",
                "strengths: the class is low-stakes and the teaching staff genuinely cares about learning rather than the formal academic conventions that tend to stress people out, super accommodating, great chill way to learn something new\r\nweaknesses: felt like it was hard to maintain engagement in lecture and also it didn't feel like there was much actual intellectual discussion in discussion section or lecture (as there was no real diversity of viewpoints discussed, such as those that were on the opposing side, etc.)",
                "I had heard great things about this course so honestly felt a little disappointed why what I felt was not a structure most conducive to learning. A lot of the readings were about the same person, same moment in history, and centered around the same themes, so I felt like I learned one or two concepts really well (concepts that I was already well-versed in before starting this course) instead of learning more about the specific intricacies and nuances of this time. I'd love to see a reading list that is better organized and lectures with a common theme throughout that clearly show the purpose of each reading. I also didn't love the discussion format of lecture- I much rather would have heard Professor Ferguson's insights during class and used section to discuss amongst ourselves, as it was often the same few people raising their hands.",
                "Strengths: Everything. The professor, the material, the workload, the topics. Truly outstanding course.",
                "The course's biggest strength was structurally embodying the values that it identified through its literature. The class felt like a reflection of our desires and hopes a posteriori to learning about queer abolition's desires and imagination for ourselves. It was very forgiving and generous and insightful. A very rare and personally valuable course. My TA in particular, Minh Vu, was an incredible teacher. His feedback on our assignments showed so much insight and care.",
                "The readings of this course are fantastic.\r\n\r\nHowever, the lectures are inaccessible and unegaging. Very few people show up to lecture because they are hard to follow and not grounded in much material.",
                "No weaknesses at all! This was the most perfect class Ive ever taken!",
                "This is an excellent course - it engages so many different queer creations and historical threads, and is very well-structured for student success! I'd honestly say my only recommendation for improvement might be to have more regular opportunities for engagement with Professor Ferguson, who really made an impact on me.",
                "Strengths: readings, Professor, lecture style, TFs, videos, thought and care",
                "As much as a strength is that this course is super accessible to a variety of students due to short readings and comprehensive lectures, I think a weakness was that there was little accountability for students to even do the minimal readings that there were. Asking for student participation in a large lecture hall was also a bit intimidating and led to awkward silences, where it wasn't clear what level of analysis or interpretation or mere observation was being asked.",
                "strengths: amazing tfs and professor, amazing readings, well-organized course, emphasis on learning and not grades, engaging lectures \r\n\r\nweakness: my only critique of the course is I wished we'd had some more small group discussions in lecture. I loved how people spoke out in class but I wish we had been able to speak with those around us more.",
                "Professor Ferguson is wonderful and really passionate; I appreciated that the emphasis in this class was on learning to adopt a more creative mindset when approaching the readings and the final project, which was very open-ended and incredibly rewarding. One thing I will say is that this class feels like it should remain a seminar. I know that due to student demand, this class was expanded and converted into a lecture, but I think that the way Professor Ferguson leads classes by encouraging and fostering student dialogue/discussion is catered more towards students who are more outgoing and have already engaged in the material in past coursesit felt like the same students were always participating in each class. I think I was expecting more of a lecture-style class in which the professor gave a chronological recounting of the history, as opposed to providing context for and explaining the readings. With the way that this class is currently structured, I believe that a small seminar would allow more student engagement with the materials and bring more voices into the conversation.",
                "Very good",
                "Super awesome course, would recommend.",
                "Strengths: amazing course, empathetic instructors, flexibility in assignments",
                "Professor Ferguson is an INCREDIBLE presence, and delivers more engaging and thoughtful lectures than anyone I have ever seen: it was an honor to hear his insights. The content of this course is well-curated and delivers a solid overview of the complex histories of queer community organizing since Stonewall, especially in its focus on intersectionality and QPOC experiences. I will say that if you have a solid understanding of this history already, you won't learn much from this course, but it's worth it just to hear Professor Ferguson talk.",
                "Only strengths. I will cherish this class.",
                "I think that Professor Ferguson brought in a lot of interesting primary sources and texts that helped me dive into concepts like multi-issue politics and direct action. However, I wish the course had more of a flow/historical order to it. Sometimes it felt like we were just circling around the same topics/ideas over and over again, rather than learning how ideas built on each other over time/shifted through the decades.",
                "Strengths were the interesting information and the care for students shown by the instructor, even in a large lecture.",
                "Strengths: The lower workload of the class was incredible in facilitating true learning. Most Yale courses inundate students with work such that the student does not fully have time to process the material and engage with it. The readings were amazingly and expertly chosen. Section leaders were very understanding and kind. Professor Ferguson is very knowledgable.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "I think both a strength and weakness of the course is that your engagement with it is largely determined by how much you want to engage! There's a lot of flexibility and room for creativity which I think is really amazing, and also offers a lot of space to imagine what education can mean and look like. I really loved the class, so I did all of the readings, went to lecture, section... but never felt stressed or overwhelmed by it. I wonder, though, what it would be like to have more opportunities to apply learning built into the class (maybe in a way that involves writing or creating something, getting feedback). I'm not sure if it would add to or take away from the impact of the class, because I know in some ways the class is constructed to avoid that, but I worry a little about my ability to apply the content, theory, etc. that I learned.",
                "Strengths: Prof  Ferguson an amazing lecturer, the texts were engaging\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The class is very well-designed. Each reading was relevant to the courses main argument, and the work load was one of the most manageable workloads that I have had during my time at Yale. Professor Ferguson was a very engaging lecturer and had us learn from a variety of materials, including articles, movies, and photos.",
                "Strengths are in the material covered and the tracking. I think there could be more classmate  interaction.",
                "Everything about this class is a strength!! Definitely an amazing professor who cares so much about the students and wants us to do well, TAs who were wonderfully chosen and made sections fun, light workload with flexibility on assignments. No weaknesses at all",
                "The assignments are low lift while engaging and allowed me to be creative. Professor Ferguson as well as the TFs all emphasize self-care and are understanding when it comes to attendance and deadlines.",
                "I enjoyed the structure of the course. I thought it was designed for students to take as much away from it as they decided to, and for me I really enjoyed going to lecture and discussion section and was able to do so without being too stressed about the work or my performance. I think the structure really allowed me to take in the material.",
                "It was a wonderful course, perhaps a bit repetitive. The writing was great, it felt like you had time to try to do a good job. It felt like it was designed for us to do well.",
                "Amazing flexibility and understanding. This is how a class should be run.",
                "The light workload allowed for more engagement with the class lectures and material.",
                "I really appreciated how the coursework was organized in this class. It allowed students to go at their own pace of learning instead of constantly making them fear losing an A in the class.  I also found lectures very engaging and full of different mediums such as movies, clips, and music. Sometimes student engagement was hard to get because it is a bigger lecture. I think it might help to have students discuss with their peers a bit and then have people participate."

Professor Ferguson and the TFs are some of the most accommodating instructors I've encountered.",
                "Yeah, it's a very chill way to learn more about a topic that has become more and more prominent in social politics over time. But be wary that this is mainly just for overview rather than any real critical discussion about the topics",
                "I still would recommend it because I think it's filling an important gap in Yale's curriculum, but I think it needs to be substantially improved and is not filling that gap to the best of its ability.",

                "YES a thousand times yes. You must take this course. It is the best course Ive ever taken.",
                "Yes!! It was so inspiring to learn about how the original Stonewall protest movements were so closely tied to and shared a lot of member overlap with civil rights, anti-colonialism, anti-capitalist, and Marxist activist and protest groups, and why all of those causes are interconnected. Professor Ferguson does an incredible job at explaining how single-issue politics hurts everyone involved and how we can draw upon direct action protest techniques today. Readings are short but Professor Ferguson does an incredible close-reading of them in lecture to show how much is packed into and what we can learn from oral histories and speeches.",
                "Yes and I already have. This course was a great overview of queer and trans politics and I learned so much. The tfs were smart and engaging and the lectures were interesting and thought-provoking.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants an introduction to the histories of trans and queer politics in the U.S. and who hasn't taken any WGSS course (or a similar class) in the past. One thing I would say is that this course feels more suited to be a seminar than a lecture.",
                "YES",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to every student at Yale.",
                "yes yes, 100% yes!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! Especially if you don't know much about queer history and politics, this course is a stunning introduction. WITP feels so different in its philosophical approach to learning to other courses at Yale: this class encourages you to think beyond the normative institutional logics of Yale to derive deeper truths about yourself and the world around you: I absolutely recommend it.",
                "YES.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in expanding their perspective to understand the experiences of others. I think the material is important for everyone to know so that long-marginalized communities do not remain pushed to the sidelines.",
                "Yes, but do not take it if you are not interested in the material or just want a gut. You will waste your time and everybody's time if you have nothing to contribute. You should take it if you are actually interested in queer history, otherwise, it is so obvious you do not want to be there.",
                "Yes!!! This was such an excellent, fun, enlightening, and engaging class! The TFs and Professor Ferguson create a learning environment that is both incredibly academically interesting and engaging while also super manageable and as stress-free as possible. It was by far one of the best courses I have taken because of how I was able to engage with amazing course concepts and readings and produce worthwhile and proud-worthy work related to them while not having to worry about the grading.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Ferguson's thinking is brilliant, and the readings curated are so so interesting. Together I think they create a space for the thinking, reflection, and insight so critical to understanding and resisting injustice in all forms.",
                "ABSOLUTELY, take it",
                "I would definitely recommend it! I learned a lot in a short amount of time and the workload felt manageable. The sources we encountered were really interesting.",
                "Yes! It is such a great overview while still being thorough about topics including queer liberation, intersectionality, abolition, and Third Worldism. The pacing is great to keep up with while you still get a lot out of it, and Professor Ferguson is really engaging during lecture.",
                "yes!",
                "YES!",
                "Yes! One of the best classes Ive taken.",
                "Absolutely. It was one of my favorite courses.",
                "Yes 100% please take its An amazing class that doesnt have a high workload and they all want you to succeed. If you take it please go to the lectures because theres a lot to learn and Professor Ferguson is fantastic",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Being able to learn the history behind queer liberation with a strong emphasis on the idea that queer liberation is also a fight toward liberation for BIPOC, sex workers, and other oppressed communities is what makes this course really interesting. Professor Ferguson's lectures left me in awe every week, as he always has something really insightful to say.",
                "I would! It was very well taught and the lecture was great.",
                "Yes, you get to learn a lot, and you have a lot of flexiblity in what you decide to write your final project on.",
                "Yes absolutely. Not only is the course material very interesting but the way it is formatted is way more flexible and forgiving and therefore more conducive to healthy learning and understanding than any other classes Ive taken at yale.",
                "Yes, without a doubt. It bring lights to the urgency surrounding queer and trans politics.",
                "YES! This was a great extra course that kept me engaged in class while also not having a very heavy workload.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course! It gives you a great amount of uncommon knowledge about LGBTQ revolutions and revolutionaries, especially about popular events like the Stonewall Riots. The course also frequently includes capitalism into the conversation which helps you understand why we see a lot of the things we see today."
