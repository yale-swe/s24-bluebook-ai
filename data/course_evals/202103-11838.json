Introductions to basic functions, derivative rules, linearization, optimization, exponential functions, and even basic algebra were all reinforced in this class. Because of this, I feel good moving onto 111 with integral calculus.",

It is a little boring, and the mandatory extra sessions make the workload very high. Not exactly difficult but very time-consuming. One weakness would be the lack of feedback after the P-Sets",

                "I didn't notice any weaknesses but I thought the pace of the course was just right for our learning.",
                "The strengths of the course is that it keeps students on track because of the assignments due after few days like concepts checks on Fridays or Mondays and problem sets on Wednesday. \r\nA weakness that can be improved is increasing engagement with students during class hours.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is the support that you have access to. Between workshops, office hours with ULAs, and class times, you are able to get all of your questions answered. The only weakness of this course was the spread of assignments at times. Towards the beginning of the course, p-sets and concept checks were spaced too close together. But this was later adjusted in the course, which leads me to the second strength of this course: instructors take our feedback seriously and apply necessary changes.",
                "Could have gone to class and been more engaged",
                "There is a ton of support for the students in this class: three professors and I forgot how many TAs, all with office hours throughout the week. Plus, there are extra workshops where a TA leads a small group of students in a small p-set the focused on the topics discussed that week in class. The opportunities that 110 students have to seek help are wonderful!",
                "The strengths are that it has very good help outside of class and the TLA's really helped me when I needed it. There really isn't any weaknesses."

I was placed into 112 but I was wary of taking an intro calc course in just one semester. Dropping down to the 110/111 sequence was a great decision (for me, at least) because the content is spread out and developed (the math workshops are great).",
