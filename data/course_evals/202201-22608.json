                "Low workload but lecture slides were not easy to read",
                "The final project is a large strength as it gave students the ability to work together and produce a well thought out project. It was also helpful that we get more than one try on homework assignments. This allows students the ability to reflect and learn from their mistakes.",

                "This course is great only if you need a QR gut. Literally less than an hour of work a week.",
                "It could be better if the the professor gave constructive criticisms rather than calling his students stupid",
                "Strengths - friendly TFs, good format of lecture/recorded lecture/lecture slides. Content well explained, easy to understand. Weakness - after the last problem sets have been submitted, there isn't much motivation to go to class, as you know you won't be examined on the content.",
                "gephi was not explained well",
                "Its a great work load",
                "The strengths of this course are that you have the opportunity to correct your homework answers an unlimited amount of times until a certain deadline. This allows students to see where they went wrong: perhaps they had a minor arithmetic error, or incorrectly performed a 2 by 2 matrix equation. This then helps students be more cognizant of small mistakes during the midterm and final exams, both of which we can only submit once. The final exam and midterm exam are formatted exactly like the problem sets. A weakness of this course is that once you get to a certain point in the semester the lectures stop corresponding to the problem sets which can be a little confusing. Additionally, a lot of people solve their problem sets on their own by either teaching themselves or by trial and error. There are a generous amount of office hours available across multiple TFs, but a lot of students go through this course independent of TFs and the professor. This could be a strength or weakness depending on what your learning style and preferences are.",

If you have basic understanding of math and probabilities, this shouldn't be a problem. If you have more experience with math this class will be incredibly boring to you. Also, if you struggle in group projects I wouldn't recommend this class as you have to coordinate for a final project worth a lot of your grade.",

                "Yes - you will get an A",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a QR class, I would recommend this course. As long as you put forth effort into learning the material for the problem sets, the midterm and final exams will not be difficult for you. And while the final project requires more work than any other assignment for this course, you do get to work in a group of up to five, so the labor is divided.",
                "Yes! Great way to fulfill the QR requirement and learn something new without stress. The TA's were great and responsive, as was Professor Coifman",

                "Yes",

TAs are really helpful but I don't think anyone knows exactly what the Professor wants, and that makes things very confusing",
