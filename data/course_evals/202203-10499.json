More specifically, that is Immagina chapters 1-6, which is more or less the overwhelming majority of content in L1 and L2. It is nice as you get to cover the content you learned piece-by-piece in L1/2 altogether. e.g. when you review object pronouns you cover them in relation to all of the structures in L1 and L2."

That being said, I would appreciate not having a significant portion of my grade determined by a final, especially given that many/most languages at Yale do not even have a final at all, instead opting for presentations, projects, etc."

                "Taking Italian was easily the biggest mistake I have made academically at Yale, and possibly within the last decade. I haven't enjoyed any second of it, aside from the post-exam drinks. But this is L3, and maybe you, the reader, enjoy Italian, and if you do, this class will probably be a continuation of that enjoyment. Not much changes, essentially. \r\n\r\nPersonally, though, I am happy I do not have to open vhlcentral.com ever again, and I am happy to not spend any more of my time learning a language defined by a falling number of speakers and attached to a nation-state that is failing. That might be a reason to learn it for the romantics reading this, just don't expect it to have any economic relevance or for it to help you in the future - may I suggest Mandarin or Spanish for that? Or maybe ASL. That shit is pretty cool."
