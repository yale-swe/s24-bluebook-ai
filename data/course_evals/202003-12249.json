In addition, watching the videos and listening to the audio exercises have improved my French accent. In addition, participating in class and small-group discussions allowed me to grow more comfortable expressing myself in French.",

                "This course is very, very time-consuming. Homework assigned is too heavy to reasonably get done. Not many people finish it. When I did all the assignments in the beginning of the year it came out to be 4 hours. As you get more proficient I'm estimating that it might take you 23, but at that point I was only spending around an hour and a half a day or less. Naturally I found I could not keep up as well as I would have liked, which is partially my own decision to focus on my other coursework. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this course will teach you French, and lots of it. It'll even teach you French in a moderately interesting way, with the \"French in Action\" film series which has a fanbase outside of Yale. The course is very well-structured and the syllabus is amazingly clear. There are study guides for every test. The professor is available for questions.",
                "Mrs. Skorupa's energy is beyond wonderful! Every day, I was not only learning something new, but I found myself thoroughly looking forward to learning with her.",
                "The French In Action method is comprehensive and effective at imparting grammar and vocabulary knowledge. However, it is dated. The videos concern such things as navigating telephone booths and using physical movie catalogs. \r\nIn addition, some of the videos have racist, sexist, or otherwise outdated references, including multiple offensive cartoon drawings of Native Americans. There was also a questionable conversation about dieting, including workbook exercises asking one to state that the main female character does not need to go on a diet because she is \"already skinny\" (in French, of course). While these are minor instances, they impact the experience of watching the videos. Perhaps some warnings before videos including such content should be instated.\r\nIn terms of the course,",
                "One strength of the course is the frequency at which it meets and the course load. Since I was essentially doing French daily for 1 hour or more, I was able to better retain the language. The projects were fun to do too and provided a \"break\" from all the essays and psets.",
                "The course ensures that students build upon previous lessons in order to enhance their overall understanding of the French culture. Students were taught a variety of ways to express similar ideas and were able to communicate with students in France to practice their acquired skills. However, it was difficult at times to understand the relevance of certain vocabulary terms or grammar structures, so being provided with more real-world examples may have helped."

                "The telecollaboration Zoom aspect, meeting with French students, was well-executed, though there could have been more prompts for the breakout rooms to discuss. Madame used the chat in a clear and helpful way to let us know spelling and to clarify, and she also took notes in Microsoft Word. Share screen was very important. The museum trip could have been better if it was in person, and the group projects. Zoom is not the best medium for crystal-clear pronunciation work. After every exam there was a window of time to check missed questions but if you missed the window, tough. I only checked a few of my tests as a result.",
                "I feel that this course was aptly changed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Classes were synchronous pf course, but when there were review sessions which would fall out of class time, they were always recorded which allowed students to study at a time that was convenient for them.",
                "I feel as though I interacted in my classmates in a way that mirrored an in-person class experience rather closely, or at least more closely than my other classes. For example, we did some online skits that I thought turned out rather well - there are some Zoom features are conducive to performing that one cannot replicate live. \r\n\r\nThe procedures for taking exams were a bit bulky - they involved signing into multiple websites with a separate device for Zoom monitoring - but I suppose they were explained well enough. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure this can be improved, but one thing that was unclear due to the online nature of lecture was the policy on participation - specifically, whether one needs to raise their hand or not. Class in L2 French moves fast, and when the instructor wants us to fill in a grammatical answer, she does not necessarily expect us to raise our hand. (I say this based on what was in the syllabus AND classroom events). And yet, it feels rude to say answers without raising one's hand - and potentially interrupt someone - on Zoom. Again, this might be unavoidable, but perhaps a statement by the instructor  could help with this.",
                "I really liked the in-person seminars, especially when we had sessions with the Telecom students. I had opportunities to talk to my classmates during the breakout rooms and make friends.",
                "The Breakout Rooms were an engaging way for students to collaborate with others and put their communication skills to practice. Sharing documents and notes through the \"Chat\" function on Zoom also helped with overall engagement and comprehension."

She responded to emails promptly, she made her expectations clear, and she even came to Cross Campus to meet us in person, socially distanced, once. As for the course itself, French is an interesting and useful language. Learn it!",

                "Yes! The standards of L2 French are high, which allows a student to have a very strong hold of their French. However, I think it is possible to meet the standards simply by doing your work daily. There is, certainly, a lot of homework, but if you allow yourself to get invested in the storyline of the videos and serious about speaking the language well, you'll be successful. What's great about L2 French is that the style of the course doesn't allow you to forget what you've learned right after an exam - it stays with you.",

While the workload is demanding at times, the class is highly rewarding as it increases knowledge in vocabulary, grammatical structures, and overall understanding of French culture. It is also highly engaging and offers a great opportunity for growth in written and verbal communication."
