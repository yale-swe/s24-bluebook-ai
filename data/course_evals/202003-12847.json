                "This course had good material and the lectures were easy to follow. However, it could have benefited from more organization; there is little information on the Canvas page besides assignments and the expectation were unclear at times, particularly for the final project.",

The Professor is cute but could work on being a little less intimating because sometimes I was afraid to ask questions for fear of getting judged. However, he was ready to answer the questions when I did ask.",
                "Jun is a fantastic lecturer and explains things very clearly. He goes a bit fast sometimes but overall pretty easy to follow. Also great selection of topics for the course. Problem sets were usually interesting subjects with relevance to what we learned in class.",
                "Strengths: very wide range of topics covered. Examples are simple enough to gain some intuition on the topics without going into too much formal theory. If you every come across a problem in complex systems, you'll probably know where to look in the literature to find an answer.\r\n\r\nWeakness: this breadth comes at the expense of depth. This class covers a lot of techniques, but don't expect it to prepare you to actually use them in a research setting without further reading."

I still think there should be some importance put on attendance though because you really must be in class to understand it all.",

If you're looking for very rigorous theory, this may be too much of a breadth course. Only take this course if you have a really solid background in differential equations, but if you do then this course will be rewarding and informative. You have the opportunity to develop your own final project which is unique and really can cover whatever you're interested in, which is nice.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend doing this with friend and particularly one that could help you on coding. I would not have survived if I didn't reach out to the other students for coding help since I only had experience in coding from 205L.",

                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in gaining a broad, surface level exposure to various complex systems. However, if you are looking for a more in depth and rigorous treatment of the material, this may not be for you.",
                "Absolutely. Course covers an interesting variety of topics and gets you to think about physical problems in unique ways. Lectures are engaging, and the slides are very well organized and prepared. Jun explains things very clearly and precisely, and also has many interesting stories to tell. The only thing is that Jun tends to ask tough questions during class, but he really means the best for your learning and you get used to being called on. Maybe goes a little too fast sometimes but show me a math class that doesn't. Overall great class"
