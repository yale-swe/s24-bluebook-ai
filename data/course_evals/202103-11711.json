                "In this class I became better at discussing scientific papers, evaluating papers for their strengths and weaknesses by examining the methods, figures, and general writing styles. I also learned about the basics of conducting field research and how different data collection methods may be better or worse for evaluating a scientific question.",
                "This taught me a lot about different methods field scientists use to conduct research. Also was a class where I was able to learn how to use Excel. I was a beginner at using Excel when many other students were already very familiar with it, but I was able to get a lot of help and still did very well in the course! The readings were always cool, and covered a wide range of environmental science literature.",
                "I learned various skills in field sampling including local tree transects and ID, arthropod pitfall sampling, experimental design, and the usage of iNaturalist and camera traps.

                "I wanted to love this course, and there were many great things about it. The field trips were well thought out, as were the topics covered on the syllabus. I feel like I left the course with a greater understanding of the natural systems around me. However, Dr. Freidenburg really struggled to get organized all semester. This had a few notable impacts on the course: 1) Tuesday sections were completely led by students and thus were often ungrounded and unfocused. Dr. Freidenburg should really be giving a mini-lecture before every Tuesday section-- one that sets up the topics of discussion in a clear and logical manner. Despite promising to do this after mid-semester feedback, it never happened, which was very disappointing. 2) The lab report assignments were very stressful, especially because the objective of the final two field trips wasn't elucidated before we went to collect the data. If we were given the opportunity to discuss potential topics before the field trips, it would be much easier to collect the necessary data and thus tell a compelling narrative. Furthermore, the first and second lab reports should not be due within two weeks of each other, especially when feedback was so scant. 3) Although not formally required, you really should have some statistical or coding experience before you take the class. The lab reports would have been overwhelming if I didn't know R, and I feel really bad for those who didn't. 4) Lastly, the final month of classes/field trips felt thrown together last minute, or not planned at all. Although we certainly appreciated the sentiment of \"you all are busy at the end of the semester so we'll just end class early\", it felt like we weren't having class because Dr. Freidenburg forgot to prepare something. On a few occasions, this was literally the case, which was awkward. All in all, I learned a lot in the course, but it could certainly be improved with a little more organization on the instructor's part.",
                "This course was great. I liked the weekly field trips, which start the first week, because they are highly engaging and also allow the class to get to know one another quickly. This makes for a better learning and discussion environment because we were all comfortable working together and sharing thoughts. The field experiments were great because they gave us an idea of different types of field science that can be conducted. In addition, the final iNaturalist project was a great way for everyone in the class to look at ecology of New Haven through a lens that they found was interesting, leading to a diverse array of presentations. The TA and professor were both very helpful and clearly wanted to help us learn. One weakness was the timing of the lab reports, which sometimes came very close together and felt far from the time we actually conducted the labs.",
                "The field trips were amazing! My favorite part of my classes every week. They were always fun and taught me a lot about how to conduct field research.",
                "This course is significantly easier than advertised. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is marketed to seniors, but may be more appropriate for sophomores and juniors who have simply completed any intro bio at Yale. Some skills, such as proficiency in R or excel, may be less accessible to those students but in general the skills gained would be much more beneficial to a student earlier in their education at Yale. Other than that, the discussions kind of dragged on some days, but the field portions were always a great success and I very much enjoyed Professor Freidenburg and Janeys kind words, engaging personalities, and field snacks!",
                "The field trips are definitely where I learned the most. Discussion sections could benefit from more lecture content, because some weeks there was not much to talk about in the readings.",
                "Strengths: loved all of the field trips!!!!!! They all were super valuable, led to me really bonding with the rest of the class, and it was so great to have time spent outside. I loved all the labs that we did\r\nWeakness: I think the Tuesday section should be reworked in some way. A 1 hour and 15 minute discussion section every week going over scientific papers did not feel like the best use of our time - maybe instead working in some lecture time as well? I think that learning the fine points of plant or insect ID, or even going over one of the Professor's old labs and how she set it up could have been useful.",
                "Strengths:\r\nMaterial was interesting\r\nFieldwork was very helpful for drawing connections between readings/discussions and practice.\r\nClass size was perfect for good reading discussions\r\nWorkload was mostly reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe turnaround between getting data and turning in a write-up was sometimes stressful\r\nI expected more technical lessons in analysis\r\nSome topics didn't go as in-depth as I would have liked.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\nSome lecture maybe, like in the first few weeks when we were learning about experimental design. More of that would be great- maybe have a pair-led reading discussion every other week instead to make time? I also enjoyed the activity of the iNaturalist project while it was essentially bioblitzing, but the presentation was incongruent with most of the rest of the course, and most presentations were very similar since we all worked from the same dataset. I think maybe having iNaturalist as a smaller separate thing, and then having presentations of an actual/proposed experiment related to urban sustainability could be really cool (and then the write up of it also).",
                "i loved thursday sessions - they were engaging and i learned a lot of diverse field science skills\r\ni thought tuesday sessions were a waste of time - the discussions went on for too long and didn't seem to really have a central focus. would have appreciated if we had lectures during this time instead and maybe 30 min for discussion"

Overall, despite this, Professor Freidenburg is lovely and engaging and sincerely wants each and every student to succeed, and the field portions are great.",
