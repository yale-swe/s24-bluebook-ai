The curve kept me from failing and gave me a B-range grade, however, in terms of actually doing well in the class that did not happen for me. I learned that graphs, which are seemingly rather simple, become extraordinarily complicated when it comes to economics. I loved the concepts in this class and found them very interesting, however, the mathematics portion of this class did not connect to those concepts in a coherent way.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lecture was a lot better than I expected because of Prof. O'Dea! The concepts he taught made sense most of the time, and he really tried to tie the concepts to economics problems in real life, which was really interesting. Section was not that helpful, I found peer tutoring to be more helpful for help on the psets.",
    "Professor did a good job structuring daily lectures.  Weakness is maybe more of an introduction in lecture to the problem set problems but the TA's office hours were always more than helpful.",
    "Make review sessions more tailored to test",
    "Cormac O'Dea is the strength. He is a fantastic lecturer and made the material very conceptual and relatively easy to understand. Of course, Econ is still a relatively hard subject at times.",
    "Strengths: Very well organized, clear expectations, taught well, ample time for office hours, very helpful TFs, many resources\r\nWeaknesses: Curve can be frustrating especially when aiming for an A; only top 13% can receive an A",
    "Cormac is a great instructor, and he's better than most of the previous course instructors. He's willing to help his students and goes out of his way to engage students in economics. That said, this class is a huge lecture so it's very easy to get lost in the crowd and feel no personal connection with the instructor. I'd recommend going to office hours.",
    "Strength: Content is organized well and this is reflected in the order of the problem sets. There are many resources available to students with misunderstandings.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture is boring and so large that there is no incentive to pay attention.",
    "Strengths: Economics is actually very interesting. Cormac O'Dea is an adorable human being with a great sense of humor and made the class bearable. There was lots of help available for Psets and studying for exams, however, this availability did not translate into a good grade in economics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The teaching fellows. They do not know how to teach economics. Being an economic genius does not translate into knowing how to teach it and that was the case here. There were unnecessarily hard questions on exams that were never covered in class or section that made a lot of people lose points. Additionally, the graders on the exam were entirely to apathetic and didn't understand that this was an introductory microeconomics class.\r\n\r\nImprovement: This course makes so much more sense when calculus is used. Please stop avoiding using calculus in this course it makes it so hard to follow. I understand trying to make this course open to everyone by not including calculus, but you're impeding the learning of everyone else when you don't explain that marginal cost is the derivative of cost.",
    "The course is typical of a microeconomics lecture and Professor O'Dea managed to make it more interesting and understandable than I thought it would be. However, section seemed entirely disconnected from what we learned in lecture, which made me confused and made exams unpredictable.",
    "Overall, the large lecture structure of the course sometime made it difficult to remain engaged, but the material was presented well, with a reasonable amount of real-world examples and a few interactive activities to keep the class interesting. It could be improved with the further integration of active participation activities such as surveys.",
    "The course was surprisingly excellent. The biggest strength was Professor O'Dea. He was especially good at explaining the assumptions and shortcomings of the models we learned so that we didn't leave feeling like economics is a myopic field. The weakness is probably the students, many of whom can't wait to get into finance and extort the poor for their personal enrichment.",
    "Strengths - wonderful professor\r\nWeaknesses - lot of content",
    "Strengths: useful course to take for life and jobs. Cormac is actually a fantastic lecturer for someone teaching a class this big. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course director seemed quite disorganized at times.",
    "I thought it was boring but it was econ so its okay.",
    "Fairly well organized- but it moved a little fast towards the end. I felt like I was learning so much all at once.",
    "I like how they post the lectures online So it makes it easier to study for exams. I wish the lectures were recorded so you could rewatch them.",
    "Strengths: The level of understanding you gain on what makes you buy what you buy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture engagement is tough, however, there was a lot of help outside of class through section, office hours, etc.",
    "The strengths of the class are that the material was really interesting, fun to learn, and not too much work. However, sometimes it was unclear what was expected for the tests.",
    "just should be more seminars offered, better TAs, more designated times for question asking in lecture, more written out steps how to do problems",
    "This course's greatest strength is the professor. Cormac O'Dea is a wonderful, funny, and engaging professor. He is a wonderful professor for this course. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are that the TAs very greatly in quality. It could be improved by a more consistent hiring process.",
    "Professor O'Dea was a great lecturer, and the peer tutoring resources for this class really helped with p-sets. Overall, it felt like this course tried to pack too much info into one basic intro course, and I think that there was a big gap in performance and perceived difficulty of the class between those who had taken an economics class before and those who had no exposure. Providing extra enrichment\/review could help to decrease this gap. Also, the lecture slides and format could be more entertaining if it maybe incorporated more videos, polls, etc. to engage the class.",
    "Weaknesses: we could benefit from doing at least one or two of the higher-level application type problems during lecture that we see in the problem sets. I often felt unprepared to complete the problem sets because I didn't have the proper intuition to complete them, despite consistently reviewing the underlying concepts.",
    "Psets and office hours were very helpful to learning the content and Cormac O'dea was a great lecturer.",
    "great lecturer, covered a lot of topics in a short amount of time but all were explained well.",
    "I honestly can't think of any weaknesses, it was taught extremely well.",
    "i liked the style of the course",
    "You learn a lot really fast. Lectures could be more engaging.",
    "Weakness: TAs are hit or miss for section",
    "Great course material and great lecturer!",
    "Strength is the style of teaching and section. I learned a lot and exactly why was tested. I never felt there was a missing link between class and an exam. Professor Odea truly prepared students to answer questions and taught them the material. However, I felt lectured spent a lot of time on rudimentary topics and I got bored often.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good course. Because it is so big I think it can be easy to disengage but Professor O'Dea did a few interactive type activites which I found especially helpful. I didn't find section useful but it is nice that it is not graded.",
    "The way the course was taught DID NOT ALLOW FOR INTUITION TO BE DEVELOPED.  There was a lot of algebra thrown at the class and not a lot of explaining of what those numbers mean.  The parts I understood best were things I learned in high school and on Khan Academy.  Professor would use examples that (it seemed) he would expect the class to be confused by.  Not conducive to learning.",
    "Strengths: Decent workload. Fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: The psets were graded out of 5... 1 mistake meant getting a 4\/5",
    "The lectures were very well organized and presented clearly and the psets were organized in a way that helped to review the material.",
    "Strengths: Competent, engaging, and helpful instructor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Cormac was a great lecturer who kept the class engaged. Problem sets were generally not too hard and there were no major curveballs in the exams. Sometimes though he would discuss examples which would not be on the exam so people began to zone out during that time. Also, section often was very boring and dragged on for a long time. Review sessions were helpful though.",
    "Strength: Great professor and TFs\r\n\r\nWeakness: N\/A",
    "Section materials are too different from what is on the problem sets",
    "This class is a great introduction to microeconomics and the professor was engaging!",
    "I felt very strong in this class - To improve my weaknesses I should've gone to more office hours",
    "Better TAs next time",
    "The course instructors are excellent.",
    "Strengths:\r\nCormac O'Dea is a great prof 10\/10\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish sections had been structured differently. Rather than slowly go through practice problems, I feel like it would have been more helpful to review the information addressed in class. Although I cannot speak for anyone other than myself, it is incredibly intimidating to ask a question in a 250+ student lecture. So, having the opportunity to ask content-oriented questions in section would have been very useful.",
    "lectures are very boring and not very helpful, teacher teaches in very monotone manner",
    "This course was amazing. Cormac is one of the best lecturers as he was so organized and is so engaging",
    "Strength: Professor was good\r\n\r\nWeakness: hard to understand material because lecture was to fast, pset took forever",
    "Cormac is amazing. Take it because of him.",
    "Its very informative. Its a large class so it is hard to get one on one help.",
    "I think that the course gave a good overview of microeconomics, in a way that was relevant both for intended majors and people unfamiliar with econ. The only weakness, which is natural for a large lecture like this, is that it was sometimes hard to stay engaged with all the materail. However, I think Professor O'Dea did a good job bringing in examples to apply the theories and keep students interested in lecture, and I also think a lot of resources where made clearly available for students to seek help.",
    "Strengths: great lecture (s\/o to Cormac; it was easy to understand and went at a pace that worked quite well) \r\n\r\nEhh: it's an intro course: what do you expect? For an intro course, however, I thought it was quite good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the TAs often were so smart that they didn't really understand how to scale it back and teach some of the more basic concepts",
    "Improve the quality of TFs",
    "Great professor but still sometimes lectures dragged on",
    "Strengths: the knowledge in the course has a strong progression so you first learn the basics and then build on them so it doesnt feel like you just learn the material and then drop it. I also enjoyed the emphasis on real world examples and data analysis that the prof brought. The material was also really well justified and explained.\r\nWeaknesses: if you know basic Econ the class might move kind of slow. Also, minimal focus on mathematics.",
    "Strengths - good broad introduction \r\nWeaknesses - wide range of difficulty",
    "Strengths: Lecture slides were posted before and after each lecture - this made is easy to pay attention to the Professor's points during lecture rather than  having to make sure everything was copied down. \r\nWeaknesses: Section practice problems were often difficult and rushed, so sometimes I would leave more confused than when I entered.",
    "Strengths--Not too much work. The professor was also really good and a funny guy. Weaknesses--Lecture, it's hard to stay engaged during class with so many kids, and it can be a little boring at times.",
    "Really great lecture but the sections were not always useful. The sections were brief and lacked any opportunity to explain, in depth, the concepts that were discussed in lecture.",
    "The course had a great deal of support for students. It relies on a committed and great professor which I had this semester.",
    "HAVE CORMAC TEACH IT EVER SEMESTER PLEASE.  BIGGEST STRENGTH OF THE COURSE IS THE PROFESSOR",
    "Lots of material for self study, which was really good",
    "The strength of the class was the clarity with which the material was presented and the straightforwardness of the class. Exam material followed directly from what we'd done in class, for homework, and for review, so I never felt blindsided by material. In general, the course was just well run and well organized. It could be improved by implementing greater variety of teaching methods and student engagement rather than just powerpoint slides for 75 minutes.",
    "A strength of this course was the professor, and course director, and TA's. Professor O'Dea always came prepared to lecture and made an effort to make the lectures interactive, which was great. I also felt that the course director and the TA's were always willingly to help students, and provided wonderful resources like office hours and additional online materials to help with the course material. I really appreciated the strong network of instructors who wanted to help students learn. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was the slight disorganization with sections in the first few weeks. At first, there were not enough TA's to teach sections so we had to combine sections and then go to alternative locations for these sections until this issue was fixed later on in the semester. Another weakness of this course is the grading system, in my opinion. I found it stressful to know that the class was graded on a curve, which meant that 1) a certain percentage of students is allocated an A\/A-; 2) even if one scored a high raw score on a test, their score was compared to other students' before turned into a final grade (for example, if one scored a 55 out of 60 but the class average was 52, that would put the student at the lower end of the curve despite 55 out of 60 being an A- by traditional percentage calculations). I feel as if this system can be improved by ridding of the grading system, which would create more collaborative, less stressful spirit in the classroom setting. It was also stressful to know that because of the curved grading system, we did not know our final grade until after the term was over. I also wish there was some way for us to know the benchmark of our grades before then.",
    "Instruction was good; discussion sections could have focused more closely on the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Course was a taught at a fair pace and was truly introductory in terms of not assuming any prior economics knowledge.\r\nWeaknesses: Course was very basically algebraic, and at times it could have been helpful to explain things a bit more mathematically for those with the background calculus knowledge.",
    "Strength: lectures, reviews past material\r\nWeakness: sometimes a little too repetitive",
    "The major strength of this course was the professor. Prof. O'Dea made this course so much more engaging. He was passionate about the material, and his enthusiasm made an incredibly large lecture class very interesting and entertaining. He really tried to connect with the students, and he certainty made what could be a very dry subject quite fascinating. The major weakness would be the TAs. Many did not effectively communicate the major concepts to the students. They were quite removed from the course it seemed, and going to section did not help most students.",
    "I think this course would be better served as a 3 day, shorter lecture. A lot of time is spent reviewing and the lectures were long.",
    "The course was engaging and the problems sets helped with comprehension, but I think there could have been more optional practice problems offered.",
    "Very good course",
    "The main strength of this course is the amount of support available, as the TAs, professor, and other students are more than willing to help you understand the course materials. Further, section is available for those who need it. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is the lack of engaging course material - too often the professor would spend too much time explaining simpler concepts at a slow pace rather than delving into interesting applications. Further, the large lecture hall made it hard to pay attention and daunting to ask questions. Tests were also graded subjectively and varied by grader, which made the grades confusing and questionable.",
    "Lectures were amazing, sections not so much",
    "Strengths: Professor O'Dea is a great professor. He's incredibly engaging and really wants his students to succeed. There's also a lot of support from the Econ department and TA's\/TF's.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really can't think of any, expect for the occasional mistakes in the problem sets.",
    "It was pretty good in my opinon",
    "This courses strengths include many opportunities for help and further understanding, but the weaknesses are that the lectures are taught very quickly and are sometimes challenging to follow.",
    "The strengths were that there were many resources available for practice and further clarification (previous years problem sets, peer tutors, office hours, etc.) \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that lecture was often presented at a very fast pace and sometimes lacked sufficient clarification before moving on to the next topic.",
    "It was wonderful!",
    "Great class! Really nothing to improve. Cormac rocked",
    "Strengths: Offers a basic introduction to eco \r\nWeaknesses: grounded too much in quantitative proofs. Even if we didn't understand the theory behind it, we could simply memorize the equations and get the questions right, so the tests were not a true measure of our understanding. \r\nImprovement: have more qualitative questions that test theoretical understanding.",
    "No weaknesses",
    "I felt that the course was really organized and I liked that there were so many practice exams from previous classes which were available. There aren't many weaknesses in this course. I just wished that people who had already taken micro before took a more advanced class because there were people who already knew all the material and it didn't seem fair.",
    "Strengths: Professor ODea is a fantastic lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the TFs were not great teachers, the class was very disorganized.",
    "Cormac was a fantastic professor. However, I found many of the lectures to be rather dull. I am not sure whether this is because of the nature of the material or the structure of the course, but I became rather bored with the class as the semester progressed.",
    "This course was honestly one of my favorites at Yale, a fact I completely attribute to Professor O'Dea's dynamic teaching style. He is very diligent about stopping for questions and conducting a brief review at the start of every class to ensure that our intuitions from class are consistent and permanent. Given the rather strict confines of the ECON 115 class, he was really effective at going at a speed that didn't bore people who understood the concepts, but didn't confuse those who felt more fresh to the concepts being introduced. He gave us a good sampling of more advanced concepts as well in order to prepare us for what to expect at upper levels, while simultaneously ensuring that we had the more basic foundational understandings necessary to succeed at those levels. He understood that, especially in a class of 300 students, there is a diversity of adeptness with the material being taught, and strove to make his class accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nI do wish that section did more than practice problems, and instead was conducted as a bit more of a review. I also think that if attendance at section were included as part of the grade, more people would show up (I was often one of two or three students that came). Also, I think having occasional quizzes might, while increasing stress a bit, reinforce the ideas from classes effectively. A daily quiz at the end (even an ungraded one!) might be really helpful to test how the lessons from class have been conveyed.",
    "This course is taught very well during the lecture, but the TAs were not very helpful. They simply walked through sample problems, and it would've been more helpful if they could review some of the content in the lecture, as lectures covered a lot of complex content that needed to be reviewed. The readings also could've been more closely related to the lecture content.",
    "great professor\r\n\r\nnot great TAs",
    "This class is well-structured and taught in a relevant and applicable way. It sometimes seemed that we were expected to know how to extrapolate knowledge learned in class in very different ways on the problem sets, so some in-class examples might be useful, but in general I felt like the psets and tests were consistent and fair. I also thought that the mix of conceptual\/theoretical and practical applications was useful for understanding both the broader scheme of economics and society, and the ways in which these ideas are applied. Some more feedback on the psets and tests would have been useful, but I understand that that might not be feasible in such a large class.",
    "Strengths: Cormac O'Dea was a fabulous professor who took material infamous for boring large lecture halls and (almost always) brought it to life; I thought problem sets were well-created\/interesting and the tests were fair; strong support system with peer tutors; O'Dea made attempts to connect the material to real life with news articles during some lectures and a great Planet Money podcast that tied in with our coursework -- intro econ courses and instructors should continue to make and further that effort to connect content to the news. Weaknesses: Clarify teaching around algebra and graphs by listing out key equations and types of algebra\/graphing problems students must solve; Lack of day-to-day preparation - we had problem sets due once a week but no weekly assignments outside of this; I could have bought and prepared for our lectures with an introductory micro textbook if I really wanted, but I think giving students a website\/online resource\/short summaries as simple assigned reading before class (15 mins before each class, let's say) would help me keep my econ mind sharp throughout the week and would prime me to absorb lectures more than just glancing at pre-posted slides before hand; sections are a little monotonous",
    "I liked the course and the material that was covered was fair. I thought the amount of time spent on each portion of the course was well divided.",
    "Good course, does not need improvement.",
    "good class if you want an introduction to economics, but the material was pretty dry",
    "I particularly appreciated the balance between theory and applications in the lectures that helped me understand the practical context for what we had learned and showed examples of fitting real life into economic models. Sections and problem sets were key for being really prepared for the exams -- while group work can be helpful, it's also important to try to solve the problems on your own. The course did a good job keeping math prerequisites to a minimum, though applying a little bit of calculus to understand marginal changes would have been helpful. The short unit on market failures at the end of the semester seemed insufficient given the importance of this topic to the practical applications of economics.",
    "Good for a lecture",
    "strength: good lecturer, nice to have all the old review material from past classes on the canvas website\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the beginning and end of class seemed skip-able",
    "This course is overall amazing. I think sometimes things could be clarified the first time better (instead of going more in depth in the review slides) but overall it was great. One thing was I would really appreciate if the calculus methods were explained to us (because for people who took calc it makes it so much easier to understand!!!). Other than the calc thing though, no complaints."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but I can only speak for my experience with prof. O'Dea.",
    "If you're looking for a QR credit, this is way better than any math class at Yale.",
    "No",
    "Yes, I think its a good course for anyone considering econ to take.  Also good opportunity to test yourself in a big lecture course.",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes if you want intro to micro",
    "Yes, Econ is a very Yale class. When taken in lecture, you usually know a lot of people to work and study with. The curve also makes it easy to not really sweat making a decent grade. I had never taken Econ before and walked away with a good understanding and feel confident to take macroeconomics. Weekly set, 2 midterms and a final, so not an overbearing workload.",
    "Yes, 100%. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale because of how well organized and taught it is. There are an insane amount of resources and expectations for students are clear cut. Even though it is a large lecture (250+ students), I was able to form relationships with my professor and TF. Like any other course, you get out as much as you put in. In my case, I enjoyed it because I put a lot in. Also my first Microeconomic course! I may major in Economics because of how much I liked it.",
    "Yes. This class gives you a basic understanding of microeconomics. It is a great way to get social science credit for STEM majors.",
    "Yes, because it's not too challenging but doesn't feel like a gut. You're still learning a lot, but the workload is pretty chill and it's not mind-boggling content.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to someone else unless they were good at math or had a good background in economics. There is a lot of help for this course but not in the way that there needs to be help. Like even if you get help you will still struggle on exams. Class time can get incredibly boring with explanations for the math process instead of just giving us the formula and connecting it to the concept. A lot of my time was wasted in economics. Too much time proving economic equations instead of connecting them to the concepts and preparing me for the exams.",
    "If you need microeconomics, I think you should take it. It's not a super easy course and you really have to put in work if you want anything from it. The concepts can be difficult to understand and even though the math isn't rigorous, applying the concepts to the numbers is the hard part.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who might have an interest in economics, as it serves as a good course to decide if they want to continue their learning on the subject.",
    "Yes! Great intro to an important field for understanding our late-stage capitalist society.",
    "For a QR gut its better than a math course.",
    "Yes, not because the course is super special, but because it's a prerequisite for many courses\/majors and it has real life applications. Also, the current teacher (Cormac O'Dea) is a very good lecturer for a class this big.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Recommended even if you aren't an Econ major. You learn so much about how businesses and people make decisions in this world.",
    "Yes great into class for anyone who is considering being an Econ major.",
    "Yes. I am on the fence about being an econ double major, and I think this course gives a good foundation to someone who is thinking about the major. The information is also applicable to everyday life, so the course includes some information that would be helpful to anyone.",
    "Absolutely it gave me so much perspective outside of classes",
    "Yes, definitely. I think this is a course that every student should take, as it forces you to think in a certain way. It was not a lot of work and I enjoyed doing the problems.",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely! This was a wonderful introductory course!",
    "Yes, but only if you are genuinely interested in Econ or EP&E as a prospective major\/must take an intro microeconomics course as a requirement. If you are just looking for a QR credit, you may be able to find easier and more relevant classes elsewhere.",
    "Yes - very helpful introductory course to micro-economics and a great lecturer.",
    "yes if you need to take it, there are better QRs \/ So credits out there",
    "I would recommend this course if you would like an introduction to Economics. Even with no prior background, the material is very through and it builds on itself quite nicely.",
    "yes! its not very challenging and it is pretty interesting. Its also a prereq for other interesting econ courses",
    "I would recommend this course to every student at yale because it is an important subject area.",
    "Yes!!",
    "YES! I'd recommend it to more than just econ majors. It is a great intro class.",
    "Yes! I am not an Econ major but I figured it'd be useful just for common knowledge to take this. The problem sets are reasonable and section helps immensely. If you go to lecture\/read the slides, you'll do fine.",
    "I've heard mixed things about this course and I think the key is to take it with a good professor. But I enjoyed it with Professor O'Dea.",
    "It is necessary to open up many doors and for that reason I would recommend.  The course content is vital, the way it is taught is an obstacle.",
    "I would def recommend if you're up for it.",
    "Yeah, as a STEM person, this class was fairly easy because the math was trivial, and the problem sets are short (hour or two a week). Interesting topics and useful things were taught. Section is helpful if you are struggling, but not required if you don't need the extra help.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student. Even if you aren't an econ major, taking at least one econ class at Yale seems like a must. It will definitely expose you to a different way of thinking about the world.",
    "I would, it is an interesting, accessible, and relevant course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs micro for their major. Cormac was a great, funny lecturer and I would definitely recommend taking this class with him if possible. Having not taken Econ before, I did not know what to expect but the workload was manageable and I was able to understand most of the material relatively easily. The curve isn't great but there is nothing that can change that.",
    "Yes, great SS credit",
    "Yes because it is a strong introduction to economics that discusses not only microeconomics but also many current topics in economics such as labor markets.",
    "Yes, if you are even vaguely curious about economics, I definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes. It was a very engaging course",
    "Yes! Cormac is amazing and he actually cares about you.",
    "Yes, if interested in taking more econ after.",
    "Econ is a prerequisite for many majors, so you may as well take this course (you get a QR credit out of it, too). Plus, as snake-y as it sounds, understanding economics is incredibly important to understanding how the world works. And, as the class name would imply, this course is a nice introduction to economics.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes interesting and great professor",
    "Yes live love Econ",
    "Yes it was very informative and engaging",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about economics. This course is a good way to gain an understanding of the field without having to be completely dedicated to it. While the problem sets can be challenging at times, there are a lot of resources available to help like peer tutors and TAs, and the workload was never too overwhelming.",
    "Yes. I think a) intro micro is an important skill to access the world, and b) if Cormac's teaching it and you're remotely interested in econ, take it",
    "Good as introductory foundation",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the class",
    "If they are interested in economics and have a strong math background",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to pretty much everyone especially if Cormax ODea is teaching it because he is a great prof. The class has a bunch of material that is super useful for all of us living in a market economy.",
    "I would recommend because its not too difficult of a class but teaches you some good stuff",
    "Yes - this course offers you great exposure to not only microeconomics, but Professor O'Dea was also mindful to include other more interesting economic concepts, information, and studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's important to understand the basics of microeconomics and to get a taste of what the major has to offer.",
    "It is a very useful class and helps with many disciplines.",
    "Yes, take this course to get a broad understanding of microeconomics. The math is not difficult. The concepts should be common knowledge and the course teaches basic economic terms well.",
    "100% I would recommend if Cormac is the professor.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and Professor odea was excellent",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. If you want to continue pursuing Econ, this class (when taught by Cormac) is clear and predictable and leads to a comfortable semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student who is looking to gain an understanding of economics. I would especially recommend this course to anyone who is interested in being an economics major, because I found it to be foundational.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics at all, it is a valuable course that features an average workload and academic challenge.",
    "Definitely, if you're considering any major that will require any level of background economic knowledge. I came into the course not at all expecting to like economics, and left the course strongly considering the major.",
    "I would recommend any course taught be Prof. O'Dea to any student. This class in particular is not worth taking, in my opinion, unless it is a major requirement.",
    "I think this course covers information all students should know.",
    "Yes, take this course even if you are not an Econ major.",
    "Yes. The concepts introduced are interesting and provide a new perspective into how personal interests culminate in the market outcomes that come about in the real world. It's a course I would recommend especially if one has no economics background.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in economics or if they are looking for a humanities-adjacent course to fulfill their math requirements. However, prospective students should know that the course can be fairly difficult; it may be a big lecture, but it's not a gut.",
    "Yes, it is critical to have a basic understanding of the economy.",
    "Yess",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn the basics of economics without having to work particularly hard. However, I would not recommend this course to another student who wants to learn interesting material and be challenged.",
    "Yes because its a good introductory course",
    "Yes, if you plan on taking ECON 115, take it with Professor O'Dea. Compared to other professors, he is a much more engaging lecturer, and his exam questions are much more fair (no really out-of-place questions). I feel that you retain a lot more information from his class because he constantly reviews old material and builds his slides incrementally.",
    "Yes, I think it is essential to understanding any social science",
    "Yes, however they have to be willing to put in a lot of extra time and work every week in order to understand the material.",
    "Yes! It is a great introduction to microeconomics, and Professor O'Dea is amazing.",
    "Yes! Cormac is out of this world as a teacher!!! He kept students so engaged and so present through his clear breakdowns of the material, his great reviews of the last lecture, and silly cute jokes. He was great! Micro is a class most Yale freshman take at some point so minds well do it with cormac",
    "Yes. This class serves as a good introduction to microeconomics, and will be useful even if you are not majoring in Econ.",
    "Yes. If you're looking for Good foundational knowledge in economics. It's also a prerequisite for many classes at Yale.",
    "Yes. Well taught",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in economics. It was a really nice intro course that gave me a small taste of what being an econ major would be like. I feel like even students who aren't looking to major in econ should take it because you learn some pretty important stuff about supply and demand which applies in daily life.",
    "Yes, you learn very useful skills and ideas.",
    "I would recommend this course if one desires a basic understanding of Microeconomics. While at times the course is rather boring, the overall takeaways are important.",
    "This course was actually surprisingly fun. The tests were not bad at all, and doing the problem sets really did help prepare you for them. Professor O'Dea's teaching was engaging, funny, and dynamic, resulting in a fun lesson that both entertained and educated. If Prof. O'Dea is teaching again, TAKE IT! He really supports his students and wants them to succeed.",
    "Yes, it is a good intro course.",
    "yes. the teacher is great and its important to take Econ",
    "Yes, because I felt like it helped me understand the markets in which we engage every day and why producers and consumers make the choices they do. It was challenging, but also a reasonable introduction for someone who had never taken economics before.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor O'Dea. Econ was somewhat of a \"bucketlist\" college course for me -- something like computer science or statistics I thought it was important to possess a foundational knowledge of. Although the material is sometimes dry, it applies to a lot and is fascinating when you consider how economics impacts so many aspects of our lives.",
    "Before you take this class, ensure that you have a reason for doing so. If you are interested in a particular aspect of microeconomics, say game theory, it may be more worthwhile to study this aspect independently. Overall, the material is quite dry and not readily applicable.",
    "I would. I really liked this course. It is a great intro econ course for someone who has never taken econ before. The curve is hard though because many people have taken econ before.",
    "Yes, it's a good and easy social science credit.",
    "This isnt a fun course. Its usually pretty boring, although to his credit Professor ODea put lots of effort in to making the material engaging. The economics concepts can be interesting, but there wasnt anything particularly notable.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in analyzing human behavior from a mathematical point of view. The lectures included a good balance of theory and example applications, and the course provided plenty of support between small sections and office hours. Although math beyond algebra wasn't required, a facility with algebraic manipulations like those used in physics and chemistry was very useful. The course didn't focus on the macroeconomic issues that are most often discussed in politics and daily life, but it gave a good introduction to economic decision-making that helped me better understand everyday phenomena.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think microeconomics is an important class to take and the professor was very good.",
    "Yes if you are into econ",
    "yes! ignore all of the \"snake\" comments and just try it to see if you like it. it's probably the easiest intro class in econ and a prereq for a lot of majors",
    "YES!!! Especially if Professor O'Dea was teaching the class again. His teaching style was extremely clear, he encouraged class engagement, and answered all questions. Plus, he was very approachable."
