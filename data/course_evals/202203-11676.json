Learned more advanced forms of market structure that are often seen in real-life industry and emerging technology markets, such as vertical integration and patent licensing. Studied various forms of IP, including copyright and patents, that influence market behavior. Researched a technology industry of choice and presented a market analysis to the class.",

                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti is a wonderfully clear and supportive lecturer. Whenever we were learning how to solve a new problem (say, a durable goods situation), she would purposefully walk through those problems and the intuition behind each step on the whiteboard--this was a break from her usual presentation of slides for background information. I also felt like the homework forced me to implement what we'd learned in class on my own, but I was always able to find help if I needed it. It was also just a really interesting course. I love learning about topics that feel relevant, and this class's focus on AI/new tech really fed into that hunger to learn.\r\nWeaknesses: I like having more exam preparation materials, and we did have preparation in the form of practice exercises and homework problems, but no past exams. This was a personal preference though, and not something I felt was objectively taking away from my experience in the course.",
                "The course is well-taught and provides adequate examples for each of the math questions, making it straightforward to learn core concepts and adapt the methodology as more factors are added to the problem sets. It extends the core material taught in Intermediate Microeconomics well, and spends enough time to explain each new concept from IP to market structure. If time is available, it would be interesting to study the entire R&D pipeline from ideation to patent applications for a given firm.",

                "Yes, I would! It's really nice to be in a smaller lecture setting for this course, and I really feel like the topic material is incredibly relevant. Professor Chalioti is so supportive and clear in her explanations, and she was always happy to answer side questions we had during lecture/office hours. I also felt like the course was structured in such a way that I had enough background to conduct an industry analysis by the time that assignment rolled around. Definitely an economics elective I'd recommend to any Economics major!",
                "I would totally recommend this course to another student, not only to those interested in innovation and technological development in economics context, but also to those who are curious about AI. This class boosted my interest and understanding of AI and its applications across various industries.",
                "I would recommend this course to a senior in Econ who is interested in the intersection of technology and economics, especially regarding how changes in the former are driving the structure of new markets. The course provides a good overview of major economic changes catalyzed by recent technological advances, especially in the realm of AI, and may be helpful for individuals interested in working closely with industry firms.",
