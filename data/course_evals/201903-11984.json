   "comments": [
    "I learned about American history and the way that the structure of religions draws people to join them.",
    "I developed my ability to actively engage with material and think critically about institutions that we buy into.",
    "I have gained (1) theoretical knowledge on the framework to interpreting and relating to new religious movements, (2) a well of knowledge on proofs, reading, videos, and other reference materials to prove\/disprove my hypotheses, (3) a lot of joy and fun",
    "How to think critically about pop culture and the world around us. This class was less content-based about religion and more teaching you how to make connections with the world and religion, and to question everything.",
    "I learned how to form and support an argument, along with the ability to critically and actively read and watch. I also learned how to think about things in different ways and had my perspective what a religion was broadened.",
    "I learned a variety of topics as they relate to religion, popularity, and business.",
    "A bunch of different little things across a ton of different fields",
    "This course opened my eyes to the many ways in which religion is part of everyone's everyday lives and how it impacts me even as a non-religious person. It was also a course that offered a lot of space for self-reflection, a unique aspect of lecture that not many professors consider or are able to evoke. In a strange way, I feel like I also gained leadership skills from this class.",
    "RLST 115: How to Build an American Religion is a course involving the study of new religious movements in contemporary America, which explores how these movements form in terms of leadership, membership, and market structures, amongst others. Throughout my time in the course, I gained in depth knowledge about various new religious movements, and was challenged to think about the places in society where the formation of these movements might not be immediately obvious.",
    "I learned how to think critically about practices and patterns in my life and in this country. I learned about motivations for joining and characteristics of a new religious movement.",
    "Relationships and comparisons between groups we typically call \"religions\" and social\/cultural movements that act in similar ways",
    "I learned about religion and American capitalism!",
    "I learned an extensive amount about the religious practices that shape American culture, new religious movements in the U.S., and how pop culture and consumerism are religions unto themselves. This class built an incredible foundation on which to evaluate our current societys motivations.",
    "In taking this course, I learned to analyze ostensibly secular phenomena through the lens of religion in order to understand the mechanisms of human collectivity and interest. In other words, what can religion teach us about what things become popular and why?",
    "I wouldn't say I learned a lot about the discipline of religious studies, but I learned so much about how group of people work, and about America.  This class really opened my eyes to whole new ways of seeing the world, it is a must-take.",
    "I learned so much about people and their relationships to religion, as well as what draws people into religions. I also learned some about the religious history of America, but always within the greater humanistic lens. Mostly, I gained skills to look critically at religious (and non-religious!) documents and see how they appeal to and fulfill fundamental desires we may have. I also learned a lot about how undefinable religion is, and how many supposedly non-religious movements or beliefs could be considered religious.",
    "A broader understanding of America and how it has always been linked with religion, no matter how secular people claim it is. Made me think of different perspectives and angles that I could look at topics from.",
    "Going into this course, I had been exposed to your run-of-the-mill comparative religion\/ religious history course. However, this class took the practice of comparing and studying religions to an entirely new level that, in my opinion, allowed the course material to be infinitely more prevalent and applicable to daily life. In learning to theorize the structure, growth, and birth of religious movements, I came to realize the religious space in what Americans so vehemently try to keep secular, companies and cultural\/political movements.",
    "I learned that there are many different ways to view and think about religion. It opened my eyes and mind to new materials and new perspectives.",
    "Professor Lofton taught us all how to be comfortable with being wrong. She is extremely knowledgable in her subject matter, very well read, and cares about her students more than any teacher I have had here.",
    "How American religions were formed, how new religious movements were formed, how they impacted us, how we see religious tendencies everywhere, etc. Truly interesting and though-provoking class.",
    "This course taught me to think more creatively and make connections throughout different elements of my life. We spent time analyzing elements of pop culture and daily life that I have never looked twice at, now I see those connections on a day to day basis. Based on the quirky elements of this course I think I took more risks in my other courses. And, of course, I learned that the definition of religion is not as straightforward as I had previously thought.",
    "how to think about American Religions and analyze topics in popular culture today and in history through a religious lens",
    "This class offers a cultural overview of religion as popularity. Really an intro course. Very wide ranging sources of analysis (e.g., we talked about James Dobson and James Charles on the same dayso fun, ik). The class is so broad that it's hard to say anything about it; in general, I learned about how I might think about systems of social + political power through the lens of religious studies.",
    "I am thrilled with the amount I learned from the course. I loved Professor Lofton's framework for looking at American religion, the many and varied sources she drew upon, and her lectures which not only tied these sources into her framework, but made a heavy interpretive analysis of both and their implications and connections to other topics. The readings are many and varied, spanning early colonial works, discussions of believers of UFOs, writings of great American leaders such as MLK, to companies and corporations such as Tupperware, and more. She was eager to tackle unorthodox sources to get at the heart of what it meant to be an American religion, and I loved it. The papers were also fascinating, and were among my favorites to complete. I have studied history and primary sources, both as a PLSC major and a Religious Studies major, and this was unlike any other coursework I have done - adaptive, flexible, ready and willing to dive into sources not commonly studied but commonly known by the general public and thus more difficult to make academic claims about but more essential to the popular understanding of America and American religion. What a course!",
    "I learned a lot about American culture and religion, but also how to think and analyze critically what we see in the world.",
    "how to connect a wide variety of current events to concrete topics of popularity and so much more",
    "I learned so much from the material, peers, and instructors of this wonderful class. This course was the best organized class I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Loftons enthusiasm and passion for her work and the material made the class engaging beyond my expectations. The TFs were equally amazing. The knowledge and skills I developed through the class will help me excel in my major.",
    "I have a new framework to understand these questions  why do people do things? why is something popular? How do you create collectivity.\r\n\r\nI learned how controversy and \"weirdness\" doesn't detract from popularity but enhances it.\r\n\r\nI learned about how organizing collectives is so much a matter of affect  producing, organizing, and channeling feeling. Genre is an instrument by which to organize feeling (e.g. myths, esp. origin myths which often feature anger)\r\n\r\nI also learned about the variou rituals create collectivity. Initation rituals define who is in and out. Rituals too are often about feeling, about an erotic \"closeness\" to other people.\r\n\r\nI learned about how power operates in collectives. It's  more complex than top-down hierarchies. People don't opt to do something, and especially to voluntarily suffer extreme restrictions or conditions, because they're being brainwashed or they're \"slaves.\" They're getting something from the collectivity, even the confinement. Something is unlocked. And to understand why practice certain activiteis, you have to identify that \"something\" that they're getting out of the experience, even if it's an experience of confinement."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very confusing at times, but whenever I had to draw from class material and the readings to write papers it made much more sense. The papers also led me to start to apply the class to real life, and the format of the final encourages a level of understanding which led me to apply what I've learned to my life. Along these lines, if the midterm were replaced with another paper I probably would have learned more, as studying for the midterm didn't help me understand the class in any way.",
    "Professor Lofton's lectures were phenomenal and I truly enjoyed her multifaceted connections within the material. I do wish that the lecture slides were posted online as the lecture can move quite quickly, but the lecture itself was always interesting and something to look forward to. I also wish that there were more opportunities for students to prepare for the midterm as it was somewhat different from the other course assignments. The few weaknesses of this course mainly have to do with organizational strategies.",
    "The course did well in; (1) providing the conceptual framework in understanding the construction of religion, including classical religions and the new religious movements, (2) providing the toolkits for us to critique the established frameworks, (3) providing us the mental rigor, the critical thinking skill to read behind the lines, (4) using multimedia, popculture, other very relatable and contemporary references, allowing us to see the new phenomena with such framework mentioned in bullet 1 \r\nThe course did not do so well in: (1) there were one lecture of two that I wasn't clear about their connection to the other lectures; but my guess was professor was experimenting new materials",
    "Overall this course is really fascinating. The lectures are amazing and the readings, while random and sometimes hard to connect to the topic, are super interesting. The strength of this course is that it is so unique and it really teaches you how to think. Sections could be better facilitated as they seemed a bit unstructured and didn't help a lot.",
    "I feel like this course functioned very well as a thinking space and as a place to wonder at how cool religion really was. I think the only thing that could be cooler is a project involving building your own \"religion\" in whatever form that takes, be it a social movement or business etc. Other than that, the theoretical concepts and live examples given were eye-opening and very interesting.",
    "This class was always interesting and engaging during lecture. I loved Professor Lofton's lecture style. The discussion sections could be improved by providing activities instead of just opening up for questions.",
    "This class was disappointing. Its premise is incredibly interesting and exciting but it ultimately fails to focus and instead of being a tightly planned class that centers itself on some kind of underlying argument or thesis, its mostly a loose grab bag of shallow intellecualization of pop-culture. \r\n\r\nProfessor Lofton is great though. If nothing else, the class is super entertaining",
    "This course does a great job of challenging students to think about and rethink their pre-conceived notions of new religious movements, and fosters an environment that promotes discussion and discourse surrounding these topics. However, I did feel as though some of the topics covered were a tad unstructured in terms of how they connected to the assigned readings. I think that this could be improved by making these connections a tad more explicit, and by connecting various topics to other lessons.",
    "The lectures were so engaging, the readings were really interesting, and the assignments were well spaced. Towards the later half of the course, I think readings could have been shorter so that we would continue to connect the dots between most of the material.",
    "Professor Lofton is incredible, definitely one of the best lecturers I've ever had. She makes classes really fun and interesting. Readings aren't excessive, and the reading guides help relate the content back to the theme of the lecture.",
    "This course is amazing. The lectures are engaging, the readings are fair, and the professor is the best!!!! Cant think of any weaknesses",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! This class made me want to be a religious studies major; it was so well-taught and interesting, the lectures were engaging and provided a great overview of the topic.",
    "The lectures and readings were incredible, but section was lacking.",
    "Since it was a new course, sometimes the connections between the religious and secular case studies was a bit muddy and confusing. That being said, the course never stops being interesting or engaging, and Professor Lofton is truly the high point of the class: her lecturing is astounding. The use of pop culture and non-academic examples also makes the academic analysis we do all the more compelling, since we are able to do that so rarely in other courses.",
    "One of the strengths was that Katherine Lofton is the best lecturer I have ever had.  The class was so interesting and it was incredibly easy to stay engaged.  The assignments were interesting too, although usually more difficult than they seemed on face.  Not only was this class wildly interesting, it felt really important too.  As someone who was raised religious, this made me consider religion in an entirely new light.  This class is not anti-religion, at all.  I know this year a lot of people didn't take it because they were religious but I really would encourage everyone, regardless of background to take this class.  One of its weaknesses was the TA I happened to have, and so section was not super satisfying.  It can be difficult to see how the readings fit into the class, and although this class advertises itself as one that won't screw you over when it comes to grades, as long as you do the work, THIS IS NOT TRUE.  The expectations for assignments were unclear and I got points taken off more than once for stuff that wasn't on the rubric.  As a disclaimer, I have struggled to understand the expectations for assignments for American Studies classes before.  I am glad I took this class, I just wish I'd credit D'd it.",
    "The strength of the course is definitely Kathryn Lofton herself. I have never had such a genuine, down-to-Earth professor whom I literally just admired and respected to such a high degree. She made a lecture class feel like a seminar, and each lecture was simply astounding in terms of quality, effort, and sheer passion for the material. The only weakness I could think of would be the midterm - the grading on it was somewhat unclear, but aside from that the class was amazing and the assignments were enjoyable to complete. Kathryn Lofton truly is a gem, and not taking a class with her at some point in your Yale career would be a mistake.",
    "Very engaging and makes people think about the world differently. I began to apply the readings and steps into real world situations. Also gave very interesting readings and concepts for us to ponder over.\r\n\r\nProblem is mainly time. Such a rich course that difficult to fit everything into one sometimes. Wish I could have gone into things a lot deeper soemtimes but had so much fun.",
    "Overall, an excellent course. On occasion, it went a little too far into how to analyze modern culture and lost sight of why the professor thought it was important that culture be viewed through such a lens.",
    "Strengths: amazing professor!!! The material taught in class and the readings are very interesting and clearly try to encompass something that everyone in the class is passionate about.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that once in a while, I would find myself confused trying to understand the main point of the lecture and how the examples in class were connected to the topic.",
    "Strengths: so interesting, lectures are fun and engaging, pretty manageable workload, awesome professor. \r\nWeaknesses: readings were at times dense and extremely difficult to understand, grading lacked consistency among TF's (one TF was a significantly harsher grader than the other)\r\nImprove: make sure TF's are on the same page, provide more foundation before difficult readings, structure section better",
    "The lectures were the course's biggest strength! Professor Lofton is an incredible lecturer and made everything interesting. Every lecture was engaging and utilized different forms of media, and fun pop culture studies. The readings varied. Some were lengthy and hard to get through, but many were quite fun to read. There were not many checks on if people had done the readings, sometimes assignment instructions were vague, and section probably could be improved. Overall this is a very strong and incredibly unique course and I loved it.",
    "extremely interesting and Professor Lofton is an amazing professor and extremely engaging lecturer, the topics connected to current events and popular culture as well as the history behind it",
    "Strengths - fun, relevant, weird, a \"Yale class\"; weaknesses - vague, performative?",
    "This course was fantastic, and I only wish there were a Part II.",
    "The course was very fast paced but the reading was structure with a reading guide which was very helpful. Sometimes it was confusing to see how everything connected.",
    "there were many many strengths to this course, the main one being the varied course reading\/syllabus. sometimes, however, it was difficult to connect the readings to the lectures because so much was being covered. additionally, i would change the way in which the papers were graded. it seemed like the focus was largely on checking off the items listed on the rubric as opposed to the actual quality of the writing.",
    "There were no weakness of the class. Perhaps, less readings due to the expansive material covered through the course.",
    "Strengths -- Incredible lectures that moved me on a deeply human and intellectual level. Prof. Lofton and some of the key readings made me think about the world, narrative, and pop culture in vastly new ways. \r\nWeaknesses -- Sometimes confusing and hard-to-follow. I had to do the heavy lifting of putting together the various strands of information we learned over the course of the semester. BUT! It was still so worth it."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student so long as they have the time in their schedule to sit and think about the lectures. The format of the class does not permit passive learning.",
    "This class is really for anyone that wants to think critically about religion and American institutions and the close relatedness of the two. This is different than any other religion class that I have taken before, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any student who wishes to be pushed intellectually.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend (in fact, I have recommended this class to several people already). The content of this class is relevant to how we interpret and understand how this world is operating, and this class was delivered by an extremely engaging, interesting, and understanding professor - take it while you can!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a privilege and an experience to be able to take class from Professor Lofton and you should 100% leap at that chance! I couldn't even tell you exactly what I learned in the class, but it definitely taught me a lot in terms of how I think and how I view the world.",
    "Absolutely. I loved this course from the very first class and think it should be a paragon of other courses at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone and everyone who has room in their schedule. The lectures are always fun and engaging, and the course opens your eyes to why society functions as it does.",
    "If theyre looking for a gut, yes. If theyre genuinely interested in religion and religious attitudes in America, youre honestly not going to get that much out of this class.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. This was such a unique lecture. Although it sometimes seemed like a chaotic mess of topics, it always taught me something interesting that I would've never learned anywhere else.",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough to another student. It was everything a great lecture should be  engaging, exciting, and on subject matter that is relevant to our lives today.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student; the class encompasses a wide range of topics and is not limited to those heavily involved in religious studies. I think the syllabus offers a new perspective on contemporary society that can engage many elements of pop culture, and allows students to directly respond to these topics through open and unique writing assignments.",
    "This course was fascinating and fun. It asked more questions than it answered, but I feel really excited to continue all of the conversations it started. The material was varied and interesting, and the lectures were so engaging. It made me want to work hard even when I didnt have to.",
    "Yes, definitely to anyone in the Religious Studies or American Studies majors, and also to anyone else",
    "YES!! take this class! its great! do it!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course or any other course taught by Professor Lofton to my peers.",
    "Yes, if someone is looking for an interesting class to potentially change how they view large-scale changes and trends. Also, definitely take the class for Katy Lofton.",
    "Yes, I would without a doubt recommend this class to any student at Yale, regardless of religious affiliation.  It changed the way I look at the world.  If you are looking for an intro to religious studies class, this may not be the one for you, but if you are interested in taking this class because it sounds cool, do! Professor Lofton is the best lecturer I have ever had, and the material of the class is incredibly interesting, as are many of the readings.  The workload is very manageable, though the expectations for assignments can be a bit unclear and the grading can be harsh.  This is NOT clear at the beginning of the semester.  I would recommend taking this class but also credit D'ing it unless you are an Amereican Studies major.  I am very very happy I took this class, and I've been trying to get everyone I know to take it as well.  If any class at Yale has changed my life for the better, it's been this one.",
    "I would extremely highly recommend this course. I genuinely felt like my world was shook every single time I went to class - each day after lecture without fail, my friend and I would talk about how amazed we were by the subject that day and spend the entire walk back and more discussing our thoughts on it. The workload is not overly heavy (though it's not a gut) and the readings are very interesting, and I simply cannot describe how well-planned the course is. Kathryn Lofton truly created one of the best courses at Yale, in my opinion, demonstrating her passion for the material in each lecture and caring so, so much about her students and their wellbeing.",
    "Yes, very engaging and fun class, yet still learning a lot that could applied to the real world.",
    "Yes, definitely! Professor Lofton brought the energy every single class and always lifted the mood. It was extremely engaging and interesting, and I learned a lot of new ways to think about questions involving religion.",
    "Yes, but if you're interesting in how crazy religion is.",
    "Yes! Every student should take this course - part of me wishes I could take it again. I don't think any course at Yale is similar. The lectures are AMAZING and cover so many topics that there is truly something for everyone. If you want adventurous and niche classes, this one is for you.",
    "yes! even if you are not interested in religious studies, it is an interesting way to look at American history and American culture and gives you a new perspective on the things around you. Professor Lofton is also an amazing lecturer and classes and sections were extremely engaging and interesting",
    "If you're a first year interested in cultural studies, take it! I took it as a senior and wish I hadn't. But were I four years less jaded, I could imagine myself doing a lot of great learning and thinking.",
    "Yes 100 times over. I couldn't stop thinking of talking about this class.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. It is immensely \"entertaining,\" in the sense that Professor Lofton is a fabulous lecturer covering complicated topics in a way that is so interesting that each class is both an American drama and a thriller packed into 50 minutes. Attending lecture really was a joy that I looked forward to. On a practical more academic level, you will learn a lot (see comment on what I learned from the course), and on a personal level, you will feel like you better understand different components of the American experience that are not commonly talked about in a HIST, PLSC, or RLST course. Professor Lofton draws from a wide range of materials from a wide range of American history to fill in gaps from what we already know and give academic support to things we have a hard time articulating about the American experience. The course is an intersectional multidimensional experience.",
    "Yes, I found lectures very interesting and sections thought provoking.",
    "yes! kathryn lofton is amazing!!! the lectures were great. engagement in section really depends on who your TF is. my tf wasn't very engaging, so I rarely found my time there very productive or intellectually stimulating.",
    "Yes, I hope this class is offered again. I will refer all of my friends to this class!",
    "This course is the only time I've ever engaged with pop culture and \"subcultures\" in an academic way  and it so changed my mind. I love reading and writing cultural criticism, and this class allowed me to think about culture in a more complex and interesting way.\r\n\r\nAt times the course was disjointed, and I don't know if I would have gotten as much out of it as an underclassman (aka not having any context in which to structure and organize the things I was learning in class). But, as a senior who's studied sociocultural anthropology and history, it's been an invaluable course in cultural hermeneutics. I imagine it as the humanities' answer to the social sciences. The \"hard facts,\" demographics, and numbers don't always capture why people are, say, Trump supporters. There's something else there. And that answer can be analyzed using the tools of religious studies.\r\n\r\nDon't take this class if you want to learn more about religion. DO take this class if you want to learn more about culture, how we relate to each other, and why we do the things we do."
