                "Through this course, I deepened my understanding of the history of urban inequality and spatial exclusion in the United States during the 20th and 21st century. All of the materials for this course covered a wide range of topics, such as settler colonialism, racial capitalism, redlining, urban renewal, deindustrialization, and gentrification. I also strengthened my ability to write essays on a wide variety of sources, such as redlining maps, field observations, and photographs.",
                "I have never taken a class about urban studies, so it was good to expand my horizons and learn about a new subject.",
                "I learned a lot about different cities and how urban inequality manifests in them all. It was great to have insight from my peers about their home cities, and the readings from the course gave me a good historical and conceptual overview of how race, class, and gender (as the course title names) interact to reproduce inequality in the city. The course syllabus accurately identifies what is taught in the class!",
                "I learned more about how to approach looking at the world through the lens of larger structures that influence the way we exist each day + explored how to deconstruct them. Learned how to perceive the world and consider systems that further create inequality. Developed skills of how to speak in seminar format + contribute in a smaller setting.",
                "I learned so much about American urban development and inequities within urban spaces. This was a great course to learn more about such a niche topic and explore cities all across the US."

                "STRENGTHS: I believe this is one of few Yale classes that has dynamic and intriguing homework assignments. Even though no one likes to do work, I always found myself bursting with ideas for the assignments, and really satisfied with the finished product. WEAKNESSES: The assignments were mostly concentrated toward the end of the semester.",
                "All of the readings and class discussions were on fascinating topics. Additionally, we were able to cover many different cities and phenomena throughout the semester, which gave me a broad overview of many of the different facets of urban inequality. I liked the format where a student gave a presentation for the first part of class and the rest of class focused on class discussion because we were able to get a lot out of the discussions. All of the readings were manageable and interesting. The only tiny weakness of the course is that many of the essays are clumped in the second half of the semester, but the workload was still very manageable.",
                "The class kind of has two sections, the first focusing on a central text, and then after that there are so many different topics covered, I think the scope of the class topics could be narrowed, which I think would encourage deeper discussions in class.",
                "I liked that the format of the course this semester was a seminar. It facilitated great discussion on the readings, and I liked being able to get different analyses from having different people lead discussion each week. The work given was appropriate too. I didnt feel overwhelmed by the reading or writing amount.",
                "Strengths - incredible feedback and thought-provoking dialogues, great engagement\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the readings were lengthy and contained irrelevant information"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I always looked forward to our class discussions and all of the material covered in the course was fascinating. The readings and essays for the class were definitely manageable. The professor gave very clear feedback on all of our essays, which helped me improve my writing.",
                "Yes, especially if it's taught by Prof. Hankins.",
                "Yes, I would recommed this class for others, however it is usally taught as a lecture, so the review for the seminar is probably not that helpful.",
                "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in urban studies or about how intersectionality manifests in the city to produce urban inequality. This class was engaging, and everyone was extremely involved and had great insights. I loved learning from my peers and Prof. Hankins",
                "Yes  you learn a lot about how you perceive the world not only in an urban context, but also in all settings. You start to notice different elements of life that you may not have noticed + become more conscious to things beyond your own scope of experience",
                "Yes! This course is a great way to learn more about urban inequities in cities across the US, and to expand your understanding of the intersection of race, gender, and class within such."
