Prof Kim really focuses on mass balances in the first few chapters, and this comes back throughout the course. \r\nThe course also does a good job of connecting the relevant math to the bigger picture understanding of the physical process going on.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Kim knows his stuff and is willing to break down the material and repeat it several times if necessary. Its also at a decently basic level, so its a good introduction to the subject.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Kim said he got rid of lots of wastewater-related topics, since Peccias class covers them, but I wouldve liked to see more here. Not everyones going to take it as an elective, and its an important subject in env eng.",
                "A big strength of this course is the instructor's pace. The instructor ensures to repeat himself if he notices that some students look lost, or if he knows the subject material is rigorous and upper level. I would point out that the structure of recitation in relation to homework due dates is a weakness. It'd be preferable for me to have recitation earlier than the day before the homework's due date.",

The workload for the course is very manageable and the exams are designed so that you don't have to memorize formulas and you only need to understand key concepts. Professor Kim is an absolute joy in class and teaches with the intent to give his students useful skills.",

I feel I learned a lot and as an environmental engineer\/someone interested in water, I think material from this course will continue to be relevant to me for many years to come.",

                "Yeah, if you think you want to work in the field! Its very focused on the nuts and bolts of drinking water treatment, so dont expect a class on how water quality changes in the environment. But its insane to think about how the water that comes out of your tap gets there, and its a pretty easy class.",
                "Definitely an interesting class that is a bit more tangible than others in the chemical engineering curriculum. Dr. Kim is a great professor who is very patient and understanding. Would recommend this course to any student interested in the subject material whether they're studying engineering or not."
