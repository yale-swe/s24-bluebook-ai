                "This course really helped me learn how to make good slides for presentations and forced me to keep a very thorough lab notebook. The latter was especially helpful because my lab notebook prior to this was kind of a mess, so I appreciate that. I think that the idea behind this course is really good and I definitely learned a lot about how to talk about my research. \r\n\r\nHowever, I found most of the lectures on techniques to be not very helpful. The class block is two hours long, and it's very hard to pay attention for that long when discussing something that is not helpful to most of the students. Again, while the idea behind these lectures is great, most of us do not use those techniques in our lab, so knowing extensive detail about them wasn't very helpful.",

                "It really depends on what you're looking for. I took this class as a last minute decision because I couldn't find anything else to fit my schedule. If you want an actual hands-on bio lab, this is not it. However, if you're looking for a research for credit option that actually counts towards the MCDB major, this is a great option. I think that the organization of this course is well suited to help you improve as a scientist, but the feedback is harsh and it can be difficult to discern what is actually expected of and wanted from you at times. Again, only take this if you don't want a hands-on bio lab.",
