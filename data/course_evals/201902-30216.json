    "I learned not only so much about the art, history, literature, and even social movements of Frances Belle poque, but also valuable lessons on French culture and living in a foreign country. It was an all-around enriching class that was supplemented by engaging field trips to places like Giverny and art museums in Paris.",
    "Through this course, I received a vivid, interdisciplinary, and immersive look into Paris of the Belle poque. While the class emphasized literary classics of the period, it also traced similar themes across art, architecture, and history, such as as the rise of the femme fatale, the fall of the aristocracy, and the advent of vaudeville shows. I found the course to be very intellectually enriching, as the course material was richly thought-provoking and enjoyable.",
    "I certainly deepened my sense of independence. The course was structured in a way that allowed for independent study and exploration. I learned the importance of looking at literature and art in a broader cultural context, as well as how the ideas and themes of a period permeate artistic thought and expression. I now feel encouraged to understand the history of both an author\/artist and a period before engaging with a novel or a work of art.",
    "I learned a lot about French history, but also developed my critical reading and writing skills.",
    "How to read translated literature with a critical eye and how to observe and understand art as an intellectual."

   "comments": [
    "This course was well organized, challenging, completely enjoyable, and the perfect mix between academic analysis and dynamic engagement with the city of Paris. I would have loved if we had more of an opportunity for discussion during class involving social\/historical topics surrounding the literature we covered.",
    "Strengths - PARIS! Having the power to see the streets and sites that youre reading about is absolutely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunitythere are so many cathedrals, museums, and monuments to see in your free time time that you will never be bored. In terms of the class itself, Professor Bloch is brilliant and the syllabus is fantastic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The classes more closely resemble lectures than discussions. You get the sense that Professor Bloch wants to convey the same information that he has been teaching for years, and is not receptive or open to listening to students' diverging opinions. Aside from more active student engagement in seminars, I think the class would benefit from longer museum excursions.",
    "The seminar style gave students the opportunity to really engage with the readings, the lectures and our professor. The excursions outside of the classroom gave us the opportunity to explore the city and put our content into a cultural context. I felt as though I got to explore the city in a structured manner, which then gave me the courage to do lots of independent exploration! Due to the fact that we covered lots of material in a single week, however, I sometimes felt as though we rushed through our analysis of certain texts in order to move onto the next thing.",
    "The strengths of this course are the literature that we read. I really enjoyed reading and learning about the Belle Epoque history through the literature. I think one of the weaknesses of the course are the length of the individual classes. Three hours did feel long at times. I would also hope for a bit more student participation and class discussion in a class of such a small size.",
    "Professor Bloch does not completely give room for student discussion, but he is incredibly smart and says volumes on any subject at hand."

    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. I came out of the course feeling excited, cultured, and able to discuss literature intelligently.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. COME TO PARIS. The reading material for the course is phenomenal, and the coursework is completely manageable. While getting academic and experiential perspectives on the Belle poque, you will have PLENTY of time to explore the city, visit every cathedral, and try every crepe. The experience is what you make of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I previously hadn't taken a literature or art course at Yale and this was a wonderful start. The novels were engaging, the excursions broadened by ability to engage with art and I had the opportunity to grow with the other students in the program. I appreciated learning about the period through the important political figures and artistic movements. I feel more confident in my ability to deeply engage with literature and the importance of recognizing the historical context around a given novel. I believe that I have a true sense of the Belle Epoque era!",
    "yes! I learned a lot through reading interesting literature and also had time to explore and really get to know the city of Paris!",
    "Definitely. Excellent syllabus, and Professor Spitz is simply wonderful."
