   "comments": [
    "An in-depth introduction into understanding the US constitution, its history, and the principles that it creates.",
    "I learned how to write a scholarly legal paper. I also learned how to critically analyze and interpret the Constitution.",
    "Techniques of constitutional interpretation.\r\nHistory of the constitution.",
    "I developed a deep, thorough understanding of the United States Constitution, both written and unwritten. This course is based off two books which are heavy reading, but definitely worth it! The twice weekly discussions are what your class makes of them, so much can be developed.",
    "I learned more about court cases and the history of the constitution in the United States, allowing me to think more critically about various legal and political disputes. One must consider not only the written constitution, but other documents and the lived experiences of Americans at the time of the founding to get the whole picture of how the Founders wanted to us to do. I enjoyed discussing current events and Supreme Court cases and hearing Akhil Amar's perspective since he is an accomplished law scholar and a professor at the Yale Law School.",
    "I learned about the history and text of the Constitution, the context in which it was conceived, and the limits and extensions in which it is being applied and interpreted today.",
    "Critical thinking skills in regards to thinking deeper about essay topics and finding the more complex answer.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for the structure of the constitution, and also was able to pick up on subtle things present in Amar's works that I did not the previous times I read them."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Amar is extremely intelligent and you will learn a lot if you are willing to put in the effort. I think making a more efficient way of scheduling meetings about the paper may have been helpful maybe calendly or some thing like that.",
    "The strengths of the course was that outside from the readings and prerecorded lectures, the in class seminar\/zoom was very student based and designed where we pretty much controlled the direction of discussion.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is that it is hard to catch up if you fall back on a few recording or lectures because each chapter is 1 hour of prerecorded lecturing.",
    "Strengths: Good TA involvement, good assessment structure, interesting material.\r\nWeaknesses: Structured solely around two books, no structure to discussions.",
    "I loved how we did not simply discuss the readings or videos. We got to discuss what we found interesting each class and everyone, including Professor Amar, was always thoughtful and respectful of everyone's opinions. This class is so refreshing compared to the current political environment. The discussions were profoundly based in Constitutional text and unwritten parts of American lives, court precedent, and political movements.",
    "Strengths: recorded lectures, engaging discussion, interesting and thought-provoking questions and ideas\r\nWeaknesses: long readings, writing legal papers",
    "**Strengths:** Professor Amar is clearly a giant when it comes to Constitutional history and law. He has consummate knowledge and is one of the leading thinkers in the field. He always has interesting takes on topics, and can back-up his positions in fact when pressed (by students). The two books of his we read for this course were well-written and were information-dense. I learned a lot from reading them. Amar was impassioned, lively, and heavily involved in the course. He made himself readily available outside of class and helped curate topics and material for the essays. The TA Ben was also very helpful and kind in this respect as well.\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses:** A lot of the pre-recorded video lectures were like partial rehashes of what was already comprehensively covered in the books. I suppose it was helpful repeating for extra reinforcement of the topics, but it seemed largely extraneous. Of course, I cant really blame Amar as he wrote the books to be comprehensive, so I cant really expect him to reinvent the wheel in every pre-recording. The first half of the class over zoom felt a bit meandering, as he really focused in granular detail on individual words and historical context (which at times felt tangential), while I might have appreciated a bit broader exploration of clauses. Also, while Amars language is often charged, he could serve to be more direct when it comes to some of the more ambiguously interpreted passages, as sometimes he can tend to talk around a topic. The second half of the class was more interesting once students started posting more questions to our discussion board on Canvas (sometimes relating to current events), which Amar would spend the classes addressing.",
    "I wish I could have experienced the course in person. A little bit is lost by using zoom but obviously there is nothing that can be done about this right now. Besides that Professor Amar does a great job of keeping students engaged and participating.",
    "One of the main strenghts of this course was the use of the discussion section. We were able to direct the class, and recieved a master class in whichever area of the constitution were interested in."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is extremely accelerated but you really do learn so much and it is a great introduction to legal thinking before actually taking a more in-depth class like Prof. Amar's con law class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in the Constitution at all or want to go into political science. This class is basically for anyone and I think should be taken.",
    "It's an interesting introduction to constitutional law; however, it focuses strongly and almost exclusively on Amar's readings and positions. There's nice breadth on the papers to explore what you want and he's always willing to call and advise you.",
    "Definitely! Professor Amar is the best professor I've ever had, and he facilitates incredible class discussions.",
    "Yes! You'll get as much as you give.",
    "YES, I definitely recommend! It's so important that we look at the Constitution and its unwritten accessories to best assess various legal disputes that may arise. I loved learning to think more critically about the law and issues on freedom, privacy, and the powers of the government and individuals. I've been able to challenge my own beliefs and hear various perspectives that I never considered, and I loved this as an introduction to law class!",
    "Really only take this course if youre gung ho about law, and this isnt your first course in the field. Im a STEM kid, but even with a strong background in writing, having no prior background in legal writing felt like a definite handicap. Even when choosing a seemingly narrow topic, the Constitution comes with often several hundred years of historical proceedings, and is vast and expansive. It was extremely easy to get lost, often needing lots of extra intricate definitions and extra legal tests that themselves have been subject to myriad interpretation and reinterpretation by different Courts.",
    "Yes, you will leave this course with an exceptional knowledge of the constitution.",
    "Yes it is a great overview of the US constitution and made me think more critically about why things are the way they are.",
    "Yes, great course, I didn't particularly get much out of discussion, but the readings are interesting and Professor Amar gives great feedback.",
    "I would unhesitatingly reccomend this course! It truly was a great time to hear what Prof. Amar thought about pressing constitutional issues in an intimate setting. This course was really well done and I would highly reccomend it."
