                "As name implies, material was somewhat theoretical and dry - limited real-life applications until the end of the course. Strength: adapted very well to COVID",
                "The topics tie together quite well and provide a very strong background",
                "I appreciated that Dr. Brinda incorporated R simulations to help students visualize theorems about asymptotic distributions of test statistics.",
                "Strengths: I thought the homework did a good job of making us practice the concepts we did in class. Also, solutions and grading came out pretty quickly. Furthermore, the textbooks gave us a lot of practice problems as well. Also, I learned R. In lecture, I thought Professor Brinda did a good job of giving us both theory and application. Furthermore, he answered student questions well and clearly cared about our learning. Weaknesses: sometimes, I felt that a lot of class time could have been used more effectively. We did a lot of derivations already in Stats241. Also, Professor Brinda could have gone a little more quickly over some topics.",
                "The lectures were great and easy to follow and the psets helped with understanding the lectures. The tests were fair and straightforward.",
                "The course was just one long stream of consciousness lecture, so at times it was easy to get lost, but it taught material very well and there was a discussion section every Friday that was helpful.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures but they felt a little scattered and unstructured at times. Brinda explained the material well, and the class was generally interesting.",
                "It's just a tough course, very fast paced. The office hours are helpful.",
                "amazing course, no weakness",
                "Strenghts - This class was taught very clearly by Professor Brinda. The problem sets are designed so well such that students are capable of doing them independently (i.e. this class does not force you to go to office hours to get help). Why is this a good thing? Instead of having the problem sets make you feel stupid and unable to learn, the problem sets supplement the knowledge from class and help clarify any misconceptions. Great problem sets. Also, the tests were very fair (although the 2nd and 3rd exams were a bit tricky). Professor Brinda's pedagogy is one I wish most professors in STEM had. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - This was Professor Brinda's first time teaching this course and I know for certain he will know which lectures to cut content and which lectures to add more. It was also a little bit not nice to have a problem set due the same week as an exam and maybe those problem sets could be bonus problem sets or problem sets with released answers (and not graded?).",
                "I think one of the weaknesses was that it was very unengaging -  the professor had his camera off, every student had their camera off, and everything felt very low energy.",
                "too many exams and quizzes",
                "Extremely well-designed course in which the exams and homeworks naturally flow from each other and provide excellent reinforcement of the course material. No major areas of improvement immediately come to mind.",
                "Interesting material, very reasonable psets and exams, well-structured lessons. Grading was a bit slow.",
                "Dr. Brinda makes his expectations very clear and the course is very well structured in terms of its content. Everything was very tractable and I appreciated that a lot.",
                "This course had me highly engaged and as a result, I actually absorbed the material much more than in any other stats class before. Prof. Brinda was solid, but the TAs were amazing and are the reason I made it through this class. I also liked that the exams were given during class time. The exams were also reasonable. My one (big) critique is that we had zero breaks in this class. We had 2 live lectures a week with a quiz at the second lecture every week or so. We had a problem set every single week. We had 3 exams. There was no break at all, and especially with the absence of Yale's normal 2 week spring break, this was actual insanity and no students should have to work for 14 weeks straight like that.",
                "The biggest strength was definitely the TA David Gold, he put a huge amount of effort into the course by attending lecture and answering questions and being so well prepared during his office hours. Another strength were the lectures by Professor Brinda. His lectures are extremely clear and always motivated such that I was able to understand most of what was taught on the first pass through. Furthermore, the psets complemented his lecture very very well and reinforced the material strongly. A weakness perhaps was at the beginning his assumptions of our knowledge of probability tricks may have assumed too much but that was only really true for the first pset. Otherwise, this course had no real weaknesses!",
                "Exams and homework was fair and representative of the material.\r\nTeaching and teaching staff were not the best. Explanations were superficial and topics were covered with little depth.",
                "Strengths: Brinda is good at framing and explaining things. The psets are somewhat difficult and require thought and understanding, but don't take a huge amount of time. The ULAs I spoke with were very helpful (especially David Gold, thank you David!) \r\nWeaknesses: The exams should be somewhat longer. Otherwise people lose significant points for one silly mistake. Or graders are forced to be more nitpicky in order to attain a reasonable distribution of scores",
                "Professor Brinda teaches the material in a very intuitive way. By drawing everything out on the board (tablet on Zoom), I was able to learn and understand the material at a steady pace. Also, the problem sets are SO WELL DESIGNED. It is amazing how well they link together and help you understand the material. Even on like homework 10, we would use a fact or observation that we discovered on HW 2. The assignments did not feel like busy work and were instrumental to my learning. In fact. there are some times where the homework was like a class module and guides you through learning something new using concepts that were covered during class.",
                "This class was generally good and manageable to follow along!",
                "Strengths: The content in the course was interesting. The quizzes forced students to continue to revise the material making studying for the exam easier. Additionally, the homework problems did a good job leading students to a certain conclusion or solution.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Brinda taught the information by just providing information, but did not do too many examples in class or show how things connected. I learned a lot through the HW problems and Office Hours. Additionally, there were no practice tests and limited preparation material because Professor Brinda changed the way things are taught from the book.",
                "Great course!",
                "Weaknesses - feels unstructured and rambly\r\nStrengths - the topics that were explored were taught well",
                "Strengths: Brinda was nice, exams were very reasonable, I liked the inclusion of R\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that lectures maybe could have been more prepared (eg using lecture slides) because at times, there would be some awkward pauses in lectures or backtracking which made it hard to focus. More example problems in lectures \/ practice exams would have been helpful",
                "Brinda is an excellent and accommodating instructor. Really breaks it down into manageable pieces, has a great intuition on what level of details is most relevant for learning the material.  Highly recommend the class with Brinda for undergrads.",
                "Lectures were engaging, homework was reasonable, but grading was not always reasonable - especially for the early homeworks where they didn't take off partial points (just 1\/9 or 1\/12) so you could easily get 10+% off for a simple transcriptional error or otherwise nonconceptual mistake, which was frustrating. The release of grades could also be quite delayed for some assignments, especially in the first month.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Brinda is great with his lectures, homework and exams are fair in difficulty\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is a very small gripe but he did sometimes post homeworks really late in the week and still expect us to do them in the shortened time frame.",
                "Strengths: Great content that instructor communicated very effectively. Weaknesses: Did not use canvas for grades, which made it challenging to know where I stood relative to other students.",
                "Good course, but would have appreciated more in-class example questions.",
                "Great peer tutor office hours, accessible lectures",
                "It is a very tough course but it is well organized and the exams aren't all that bad.",
                "Strengths: professor was good at explaining things, TAs were excellent, problem sets were fair \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: for some reason, this class refused to make time zone accommodations. Having to wake up at 4:30 AM to take the midterms and 5:30 to take the weekly quizzes was ridiculous and I'm sure some international students had it even worse. In the middle of a pandemic, refusing to make time zone accommodations is insulting to the students and left a bad taste in my mouth for the entire semester (despite the excellent lectures and fufilling problem sets)",
                "Professor Brinda is an excellent teacher. He took a course that is traditionally quite poorly taught and made it much more palatable. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that psets would be due during exam weeks, of which there were 2, which made things difficult at times. I also found that some TAs plain didn't know how to do the problems on our psets. They had the answer keys and could work off that, but didn't actually know what they were doing. I don't know if there's a better way to vet this, it took a bit to sift and find the TAs who actually knew the material."

                "The course is required for the S&DS major, and in previous semesters has gotten pretty bad reviews. With Brinda as the professor, I found it interesting and enjoyable.",
                "Yeah! I liked learning about statistics and thought this was a pretty good introductory class.",
                "This class is great! Way better than 241. Professor Brinda is amazing and truly cares about his students. He is there to help whenever you need it. The coursework is hard, but Brinda makes it easy to comprehend and I left feeling like I really understood everything. The homework was doable and there was plenty of help if you needed. The tests were fair and a good representation of the course material. A great stats class!",
                "If the student is taking statistics it is a very fine course to take and will teach you a lot behind many of the methods commonly used. Otherwise, its a lot of minutiae with little benefit",
                "I would recommend it only if Brinda is teaching.",
                "Only if you require it.",
                "Highly recommend, please take it with professor Brinda",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if Prof Brinda is teaching this course. As aforementioned, the problem sets are very fair and grading is also quite fair (50% of your grade is the problem sets). This class teaches fundamental concepts that are necessary for higher level S&DS classes.",
                "This course is probably a major requirement or similar. It teaches you the. more mathematical part of statistics, so if you're looking to learn how to work with data its probably not that useful.",
                "It's required for BS for s&ds but I don't feel I learnt that much compared to other s&Ds courses",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in expanding their statistical knowledge. I entered the course with little background in statistics other than S&DS 241 and have emerged as a much stronger student.",
                "Chances are that if you're taking this course, you're thinking about majoring in stats or applied math. While it is annoying that this course is required for the stats BS, I also don't think it's necessarily unnecessary. If you like stats enough to major it in, then this course will be a good introduction for sure. On the other hand if you didn't enjoy this course much, you probably shouldn't be a stats major haha.",
                "If the student enjoys probability theory, then absolutely. Professor Brinda presents the material very well, and the material itself often feels like a natural application of concepts covered in probability theory, but with more of a statistical approach\/focus. I'd say that if you found probability theory to be easy or intuitive, then this class will be interesting but not super challenging. W\/ or w\/o a previous stats class, S&DS 242 under Professor Brinda is enjoyable and manageable.",
                "Absolutely, anyone would benefit from this way of thinking about statistics and this course is foundational for the major.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes I would recommend it. Professor Brinda is solid. The TAs are goated and saved me in this class, they were incredibly helpful at Office Hours. I stayed engaged in this course much more than in any other stats course at Yale, partly because I had to, but also it made me learn the material much better. We had weekly quizzes at the end of Wednesday's lecture which kept engagement high. There were also 3 exams and a problem set every week (literally 12 psets + 2 midterm exams, so 14 weeks straight). There was no spring break this year which was messed up and Prof Brinda didn't give us a break at all. But I'd still take the class because I learned a lot and the material is worth it, and you can get your psets done in literally 2 hours if you go to office hours.",
                "Yes!!! This course was so fun and a great use of the tools you learn in probability! I had never taken a statistics course before but now I feel like I could easily take one and understand the underlying principles driving whatever kind of techniques we would learn! Also, this course has extremely reasonable exams and psets. The TAs are great and really care about your understanding of the material. Also Brinda is just a very kind professor and is very understanding!",
                "NO! Please no. This class is already notorious for being a bad class and I dont think I should be the one to tell you not to take this class. If youre going for the stats BS, ask if you can substitute S&DS 410 instead (thats a WAY better class and covers the same material better than this class). \r\nThis iteration was better than other years since Brinda was teaching it. Hes pretty nice and fair with the homework and exams. However, hes pretty disorganized and that really makes it hard for you to understand any of the material. Youll have to really put in the time to search online for help (since the textbook is even worse), so take another class please [unless someone else than Brinda or Barron is teaching]. I feel bad for the grad students taking this class (hopefully their reviews will show up here. If not, look at the 542 reviews to see them complain).",
                "Yes, if you're a stats major, definitely take it with Brinda. If you're not, you can consider taking it with Brinda, but I probably wouldn't do it with anyone else. If there's an elective you want that requires this or something, could be worth it. But I personally wouldn't take it for fun",
                "Yes. Even if you're not a stats major, learning how to estimate unknown parameters, determine whether those parameters are efficient or sufficient, conducting hypothesis tests, and understanding the math behind linear regressions is useful to everyone. Definitely take it with Professor Brinda!",
                "Yes, it is a very important class for anyone who wishes to learn more about\/dive deeper in statistics",
                "Eh. I think this course would be a little better in person where Professor Brinda could see when students are not understanding concepts and when it's easier to approach after class. It was a little difficult to understand at times, but overall went well. It would be nicer if there were practice problems given to students.",
                "Yeah! If youre comfortable with probability theory, this course is the perfect gateway into applications",
                "Sure, if youre a stats whiz",
                "Yes if you're interested in how to estimate things lol",
                "100% with Brinda, it is a wonderful class.",
                "Yes but if you want an A, go to at least 1 ULA office hours every week - try to find the most helpful ULA early in the semester.",
                "Yeah, definitely! This is a great course. There's a lot of math behind statistics, and 242's mission is to cover as much of it as possible. Less emphasis is put on statistical inference techniques compared to the theory behind them. Prof. Brinda made lectures interesting and gave fair homework assignments and exams (though sometimes released the psets a few days late) and in all it was a really chill class. Prof. Barron's Friday sessions were also very informative and helpful. We had announced (not pop) quizzes almost every week that were very short and a lot like the most important problems from each homework, and he posted solutions to the homework problems beforehand so we knew what to review (this was also the case before exams which was really great). If you took 241 and you like stats, definitely keep going with 242 because you have to take it for the major anyway and it's very interesting and relevant stuff even if you're not planning to be an S&DS major.",
                "Yes I highly recommend. Brinda did a great job teaching. His homework assignments motivated the concepts taught in class.",
                "Absolutely! Understanding what statistics is & how it works is super important to understanding the real world! Also, Prof. Brinda is a good teacher with interesting insight & perspectives that depends my understanding of the course material.",
                "Yes, the material is interesting and Professor Brinda is a great lecturer.",
                "Good course for learning basic statistics",
                "Yes if you're a stats major.",
                "Yes absolutely. This is a class that all statistics students should absolutely take.",
                "Yes, if Professor Brinda is teaching it. Stats theory is traditionally very poorly taught, as the reviews make clear. Prof Brinda does a great job writing the notes out by hand and narrating what he's doing in a way that's simple and easy to follow. The psets and exams follow from the lecture notes, which makes studying straightforward. There's no dumb trick question stuff. I got so much better of an understanding of statistical theory from taking this class. It also cleared up a lot of things I didn't understand from 241, which was much less well taught (try to get Winston for 241).",
                "Yes, I think that this sequence is much more interesting and helped me understand statistics much more than intro statistics classes I've taken in high school."
