Professor Maggen is great at moderating conversation, teaching, yet also allowing for students to run the conversation, debate, and contribute. The papers allow students to choose topics they are more interested in within the topics of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Not many! If i had to think of one, I'd say some of the more theoretical readings could be less enjoyable and a bit confusing, but Professor Maggen explains them very clearly in class."
