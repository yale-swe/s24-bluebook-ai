I do think that it's unfortunate that it was held online, but Lim ssn still did his best and created a good environment for learning and for people to ask questions without hesitation.",

The option for asynchronous learning was tried a few times and worked to great effect: in the future, it might be useful to have some asynchronous sections for review and homework purposes, particularly for vocabulary study."

I think it was good that he tried to incorporate a lot of questions during his lessons to make sure that we were attentive and actively trying to answer the questions on the slides.",
