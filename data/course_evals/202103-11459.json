Pak Indriyo did a great job of teaching me many things about Indonesia, not just the language. I learned how to play the Angklun, a musical instrument in Indonesian culture. I ate an Indonesian fruit. I spoke with various teachers from Indonesia. Overall this class was highly enjoyable and educational.",

Language classes demonstrate the importance of reviewing your material as much as possible after it has been taught to you, so that it is easier to go about future events in the course. It is important to try new things because you may develop a love for them.",

                "I think this course was very well structured and easy to follow along. One way I think it could be improved is if deadlines for assignments were put on canvas when talked about in class.",

                "This course was highly interactive, and Ive spent many days interacting with my peers and Pak Indriyo outside of class also. I was able to learn through my peers. I did struggle from time to time with the organization of the class.  At times, it was a bit disorganized and hard to predict. I think it would be good to develop a better timeline for learning the beginning vocabulary, and maybe implement vocab tests or something to ensure that students learn the new vocab and are familiar with it.",
                "Pak Indriyo made great efforts to provide an engaging and interesting class experience, and was genuinely invested in the learning of his students. Kak Nia provided timely and constructive feedback on assignments.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course would have benefited from slightly more structure (e.g. flagging of key assessment dates at the start of term) and a more ambitious pace, particularly at the start of term",
                "The teacher tries to keep the students engaged by doing different activities, so that each class is a bit different. The teacher is awesome, but sometimes it can be hard to communicate outside the classroom with technology",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA are very good and run the curriculum well. They also know the regions well and can give us interesting information relating to the material.\r\nNo weaknesses",
