    "I learned so much about macroeconomics in this class... studying for the final reminded me of how much instruction we had. I specifically learned about modern examples-- the Great Recession etc. \r\n\r\nLearning how to use models and equations, and the theory that backs up all our frameworks, was all new knowledge.",
    "I learned about market forces, macroeconomic modeling, banks, recessions, growth, and money.",
    "The determinants of the long-term well-being (or not) of the economy and focus on questions such as the causes of economic growth, whether economic growth is desirable and why some countries are so much richer than others. Emphasis of analysis is on the underlying economic mechanisms to get a better understanding of which policies might be growth-promoting and why so many policies have failed in the past.\r\nThe concept of money and the functioning of the financial system to understand the role of interest rates and banks in the economy and the economic mechanisms explaining the financial crisis and the near-collapse of the US financial system in 2007- 09.\r\nShort-run fluctuations, i.e., recessions and the recent recession and recovery (sort of) in the US after the financial crisis of 2007-09 with concentrating on the underlying economics of this.",
    "I learned how to think about money, banking, inflation, recessions, and broad macroeconomic trends.",
    "I learned about basic macroeconomic principles",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness\r\n\r\n1) sometimes professor talks so fast",
    "This course is excellent. Having taken it, I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of not only economics, but also politics and capitalism. I would have appreciated more feedback, such as lists of topics to review for exams or actual corrections on homework, but this class is mostly great as is.",
    "Overall, I though the classes were very interesting and that I learnt a lot. \r\nI thought that class participation was a major weakness of the class. I felt like I was being graded on whether I could think faster than three people whose hands always shot up immediately. At the beginning of the semester, Professor Amand made an effort to wait to see if anyone other than the same three people wanted to answer. This was only for the first classes, however. As it was part of the grade, a few people also made a great effort to talk in every class, even when they had no questions.",
    "Strengths: Textbook was great, lectures and lecture notes were great; review sessions and questions were helpful",
    "I enjoyed our discussions of contemporary policy and appreciated Professor Amand's grasp of the US and EU's contrasting approaches and the supplemental readings he gave us. I wish the course exposed us to a broader range of political and economic perspectives. I would have liked to learn more about the human impact of macroeconomic policy and read some heterodox economists like Thomas Piketty and David Graeber to challenge and contextualize the textbook material.",
    "I thought this course was really good! well designed and organized, and it seemed like all the course material was interesting and relevant. I like that the psets are graded for completion and the weekly quizzes, which helped keep us on track",
    "Great discussion of key macroeconomic phenomenon.  PSETS are short and easy.",
    "Strengths: awesome professor, really interesting material, good balance of blackboard and slides, regular, useful hoemwork.\r\nNo weaknesses.",
    "Strenghts: Learn to think critically, learned to read the book to couple professor's teaching\r\nCons: Sometimes too fast",
    "A strength is the smaller class size from the big lecture. A weakness is that it is called a seminar when it is really a lecture.",
    "The course is well-structured and effectively delivered. The only weakness might be that many economic terms were covered but not necessarily explained in detail.",
    "An engaging class and the lectures were very interesting. However the format of only having two exams was very limiting.",
    "I took the lecture for micro and then decided to take the seminar for macro, and it was the best decision I could've made. It's so much easier to learn in the seminar than the lecture. If you're debating between lecture and seminar, take the seminar--especially if Professor Amand is teaching!!",
    "The course did a really good job of keeping the students engaged.",
    "Strengths: small classroom so it was easy to get a question answered in class. Weaknesses: it moved very quickly and it was never clear what was important and what wasn't as important in classes. The professor often stated that they didn't like what the textbook we had to buy said; so when studying for exams, there were two contradictory sets of knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially with Professor Amand!",
    "Yes if you need it, yes if you want to learn more about US economy",
    "I definitely recommend people take this class, whether it is necessary for their field of study or not. Professor Amand is great and the topics covered are both interesting and relevant. Based on what I have heard about the lecture, the intro macro seminar is far superior.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes because Professor Amand is a good instructor and I feel as though you learn more in this class versus the large lecture",
    "I would recommend taking macro in conjunction with Douglas Rogers's course on \"The Corporation\" (or reading Karen Ho's \"Liquidated\") to learn about the social context of the American economy and the rise of shareholder value paradigms  I think combining economic theory with a critical examination of its human consequences is really important, especially in our current sociopolitical moment.",
    "I would recommend this class! it's well taught and really good to be in a seminar setting",
    "Would recommend to people to have any interest in macroeconomics or how the economy and financial system operate.",
    "Yes, it is a very useful course for anyone looking to understand the workings of the general economy.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course because you will learn a lot about the basics of macroeconomics.",
    "Absolutely!\r\nIf you want to take intro to macro, take it with Professor Amand.",
    "Yes. If you have interest in learning about the economics of the world, I would definitely recommend this course. It is very interesting and gives insight into what the concepts are that are relevant to almost everything that occurs in the world.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Most prerequisites are simply courses to get out of the way, but I would recommend this course to even non-economics majors. I didn't really enjoy micro, so I wasn't sure about econ but I ended up loving macro. If you get the chance to take this course with Professor Amand, take it! He is such an engaging lecturer and makes the material easy to remember.",
    "Yes it was a great course.",
    "Yes! If you really like economics, Professor Amand is very fun and snarky and will spark your interest even more. If you hate econ, you'll still be able to get through it.",
    "Yes, macroeconomics provides a glimpse of how the economy of the US works and made me more informed about how policy and economics are intertwined."
