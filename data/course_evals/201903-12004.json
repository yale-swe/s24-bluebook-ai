    "I learned about Indigeneity, the politics of first encounters & colonialism, and the real origins of America. I also wrote a research paper.",
    "Gained an understanding of early borderlands histories in early North America.",
    "This class was helpful for building historical awareness of the Spanish borderlands and indigenous encounters--topics that have been largely overlooked in \"American history.\" Concentrating the second half of the semester on final paper research was useful for developing insight into the research and writing processes.",
    "I learned how to write clearer sentences. I learned a lot about Western history and how to make connections between history and contemporary legacies.",
    "How U.S. settler history should begin much earlier than the 1600s because there was plenty of Spanish settler contact with Indigenous peoples in the Spanish borderlands within what is now the United States.",
    "I saw improvement in historiographical analysis. This class was able to take the field of history and open it up for critiques based on educational and broader social trends.",
    "I have never previously studied the history of the borderlands, and I found that the course material, focusing specifically on considering how the Spanish and indigenous people interacted to be incredibly interesting. Also, the research paper is great-- we have to present our idea to the class way in advance which made me prepared to actually write the paper, and the seminar Beinecke session was valuable."

   "comments": [
    "Great readings, great lectures, great professor. No complaints!",
    "Strengths: Class discussion, papers, readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
    "Strengths: topic, student and instructor engagement, instructor support, dedication to research\r\nWeaknesses: would have enjoyed completing more readings on borderlands history (a bit unfortunate to end halfway through the semester!). Otherwise, no other particular suggestions.",
    "Strengths-professor Blackhawk was very passionate and he presented the material in a compelling manner\r\n\r\nWeakness-I think the final paper was overweighted for our grade",
    "I think the structure of this course is definitely a strength. I think I was not able to engage with the readings of this course in the same way as I have in other courses with Professor Blackhawk just because some of the content was difficult to wrap my mind around.",
    "Strength was the value of the information for anyone who cares about questions of the US state and colonialism. One weakness was that it functioned more like a lecture than seminar, but even then the lecture didnt synthesize readings, buy rather offered seemingly disjointed information.",
    "Sometimes it feels more like a lecture than a seminar. Students can be a bit quiet and it's a shame, because then Professor Blackhawk has to assume the responsibility of lecturing at us rather than a group discussion the course material\/readings. I think it would help to have an agenda for the seminar of some sort that goes beyond the syllabus, or perhaps reading responses for us to prepare for seminar. The course material is very interesting, and the workload is well worth it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Especially if you're interested in borderlands history, this is the person to learn it from.",
    "Yes! Take this class. These histories are essential to understanding the history of the United States, but they are often understudied and underrepresented. This is a great class for gaining a solid understanding of the colonial interactions centuries before the British came.",
    "Yes, especially if he\/she\/they is interested in indigenous and\/or Latin American history, this course bridges the gap between the Anglo-American narrative of American history and less remembered narratives.",
    "Yes. Professor Blackhawk is great. You definitely should have an interest in history or the American West if you are to take this course.",
    "Yes, I think it does a lot to make you think about what beginning dates U.S. history classes should prioritize and teach above others.",
    "It was a good way to get my Early Americas requirement",
    "Yes, the subject material is very intriguing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because material that is covered in Blackhawk's seminar is really lacking in Yale's curriculum. I do think more could be added to the syllabus to give us a more in-depth understanding of indigenous life and colonial rule in the borderlands. I think this is a very valuable course on the whole, though."
