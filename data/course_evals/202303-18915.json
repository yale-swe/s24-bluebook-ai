                "Strengths: Reading responses made sure students closely read every week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This ended up being one of the most badly structured, overly time consuming ,and fruitless courses i've taken. During lectures, I learned very little about Chinese history, and it seemed each class was leading up to a big, profound point that was never made. Even during classes that were apparently going to be discussion based, there was very little room for discussion and instead a lot of monologues. In lectures, it was almost as if language that seemed advanced and insightful was purposely used but very little was said. Even when wargaming in class, we learned very little from instructors themselves, and had to figure things out entirely on our own. When we simulated wargames in class the activities were incredibly basic and taught us very little about scenarios in China. We went through the Qing and Ming empires in a very, very scattered way. We breezed through some events and spent a lot of time on others, but it was like no effort was taken to provide students with context, such as how either empire rose/fell, and what else was going on in the world at the time. I wish there was more focus on Chinese history. The sections were enjoyable but honestly a mess. They had no aim and we were often discussing 2-3 questions in small groups for like 30 minutes (and it would take us about 5 minutes to get through the questions). Each section had no direction. I'm not exaggerating when saying there were sections where we would just sit there in silence for like 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nWith all of this going on in class, the assignments were far too long and we had almost no guidance. The canvas page was messed up all semester, with dates and assignments not in sync. So most of the time students had no idea when a given assignment was due. The instructors would realize the due dates made little sense, and then ask the class when they wanted them due, and this led to a very disorganized/confusing process. Students literally never knew when a given assignment was due. People also often didn't know what week a given reading was for. \r\n\r\n We were expected to put together a war game with almost no guidance in class as to how to do it. And each project related assignment was like 15 pages. On top of that, the main assignments were two 15 page group papers on our wargame project, and then two long personal reflections coinciding with each project assignment. So basically we'd end up spending a lot of time writing our part of our project, and then immediately have to turn in an equally long reflection on the project right after....which made almost no sense because you'd have to end up just writing the same thing but differently. This took up an unnecessary amount of time without giving us the chance to learn much at all. \r\n\r\nWe rarely discussed readings in class. And during section, it seemed like the TA didn't do the reading. It was just students talking for the sake of talking. This course had potential but was just poorly organized.",
                "This course is not organized at all",
                "I absolutely *loved* the final wargame project, it was really engaging and creative and was by far one of my proudest achievements to come out of the semester! On the other side of the coin, I was rather dismayed by how the professor often diverted from the syllabus: we simply didn't cover many of the topics mentioned on the syllabus, which I found a bit disconcerting.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor & TA, great course material",
                "Fascinating readings and helpful assignments. Could probably be improved by streamlining the game design process which is a significant portion of the course. Overall, great course"

Prof Dykstra is iconic: a captivating lecturer who really takes the time to be close with her students, which I really appreciated. The final project is engaging and helps you stretch your brain far more than any paper could. But, be prepared that while you'll become a better thinker and you'll have a great time in the class, you won't learn the names of the different rebellions and warlords from the time period. You'll also need to be prepared to show up for class and find out that you're doing something entirely different from the syllabus. So all in all, the course was for me about 70% exhilaration, 30% exasperation. The exact blend of that depends a lot on you and your tolerance for disruption.",
                "Yes absolutely!!! Professor Dykstra is amazing!! She made herself available for lunch every week, and she wants to get to know her students outside of just course material.",
