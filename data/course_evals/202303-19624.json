He teaches you so much without overworking you. He is amazing. It helped that my classmates were incredible. If you are planning on taking a language at Yale, take KREN, and take it with him.\r\nNo weaknesses.",

Aside from classes, many of our classmates would go to Korean language table every week, which was a great experience for more conversational practice."
