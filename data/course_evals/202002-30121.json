   "comments": [
    "I gain a general idea on relationships development and different stages that contribute to the maintenance and building of relationships, with abundant ideas of attractions that can be practically applied. Lots of theories are new and intriguing that broad my horizons.",
    "Relationship skills, why and how we are attracted to each other, the best ways to build (and dissolve) relationships, and how to conduct a relationship research study",
    "Developed understanding of the basic building blocks of relationships (romantic, friendships, family, etc), how relationships are maintained, and why some eventually end. Also learned about the theories behind the ways that we act within our relationships and why we are in fact attracted to certain people and not others.",
    "I learned a lot about what factors into the ways that people become attracted to someone and the ways to build and sustain close relationships.",
    "The textbook and lecture slides both referenced a large amount of research papers that studied all aspects of attraction and relationships from attachment styles to gender differences in attraction to types of conflict to consensual non-monogamy and other such interesting topics.",
    "By taking this course I developed insight into human psychology and human relationships. The relationships were not limited to just romantic ones, rather we explored a number of different relationships such as family ties, friendships, and social structure. We took an in-depth look into the sources of these relationships, how to maintain their well-being, the origins of conflict within them, and other concepts connected to these relationships.",
    "I learned about the main research and concepts in the subject. I improved my ability to work and share in small groups.",
    "Attraction, Relationships",
    "Learned to approach relationship psychology (familial, platonic, and romantic) from a number of different perspectives and different psychological approaches, and to integrate external and individual similarities and differences into how relationships function! Very insightful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is that it has clear structure with lots of interesting media involved that inform us great knowledge. The lecture is great and well-organized. The weakness is that the course is highly compressed with online contracts, which is an alternative because of the current situation.",
    "Strengths: super engaging, amazing professor, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: The slides should be numbered.",
    "The course was engaging and made relevant connections to real life situations which made it very interesting. \r\nThe lecture time\/time spent looking at powerpoint was very long at certain points.",
    "The course was very well organized and it allowed us to explore topics that we personally were interested to learn more about. I enjoyed everything and thought that the assignments given were excellent ways on building on the material. My only area that I think the course could be better without would be the video game assignment. Overall, the assignment was cool but personally for me it didn't really feel like I was applying material learned in each of the scenarios but felt that I was forced to make a scenario fit with material learned in the class. That honestly could have just been how I approached the game and the stressful situation that I was in during that week with another final going on. However, I do feel like that the instructions of the assignment about finding unique theories to apply and how the game itself was structured with the content, still makes it seem like it wasn't very helpful in my learning personally. The whole concept of using a game in the class though was very cool to me. I'm curious if there could have been another way to structure the assignment to better help facilitate students' learning.",
    "This was a summer class and so there was a lot of material covered every day. Classes were 2 hours 15 minutes long and were held 3 times a week with assignments due 3-4 days a week so students devoted a lot of time to this course but it was worth it. The class was held online but Professor Hirsch did a wonderful job using the zoom setup and would use tools such as break-out rooms to make sure everyone was engaging with the course. The material was extremely interesting and this class was by far one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the combination of the textbook material and the lectures. The lectures were not simply a repetition of the material covered in the textbook but an expansion on it with the emphasis on the newest studies in the field. The lectures were also full of different types of media, which made the lectures more enjoyable and made it easier to focus. That said, the 2 hours lectures were somewhat hard to be engaged in for the full time, especially considering the video format for this summer.",
    "I appreciated the structure and clear expectations. I think the course could have progressed more quickly.",
    "Very strong class! Very engaging and exciting class to walk into, and a very infectious positive energy walking into the course :)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course is very innovative and helpful towards students with clear instructions. I highly recommend this course to others.",
    "100%. I think you should just take this class to learn more about yourself and relationship building, regardless of if it fills a distributional requirements. If you have the space, take this class.",
    "Yes!! this course was a great way to get insight into why we have certain relationships with people and ways that we can maintain and enhance them. It is not at all a self-help course, but its just a great way to take a class and be able to apply it to your real life outside the classroom.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student mainly because of the topics of this course. Everything learned was so interesting and there is something that can always be applied to aspects of your life. There were so many topics and new information that I learned that always made me reflect on situations in my own life. I also really appreciated the fact that we got to explore topics that were interesting to us through the individual work day assignment. It allowed me to find answers that the class may not have directly answered on its own. It was also cool that we got to share this with the class and learn about other people's interests because there were topics raised that I had never even thought about and made me even more curious about this subject field.",
    "Yes definitely. I am not a Psych major but this course was incredibly interesting and was by far one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Hirsch is an amazing professor and makes class very fun and engaging!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students as it explores topics that we never really think about but that are prevalent in our lives. This is by no means a self help course, but you can also gain insights that will be useful for the future.",
    "Yes! Lots of interesting ideas that can be use everyday. Not too challenging and a fun atmosphere.",
    "Yes! Very interesting material, and Prof Hirsch is a great lecturer!",
    "Yes! Fantastic and fascinating course (it's not all about romance and dating! Very fascinating insights that connect to a lot of other sections of psychology -- incredibly fun intro course to psych, though some of the topics may already be covered if you know a little about social psych in general"
