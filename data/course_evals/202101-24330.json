Professor Almeling does an amazing job organizing the course, so even if you know something about gender in some space or for some group of individuals, it's really likely that you will learn or be introduced to something new. I definitely also developed a heightened interest in gender and have been made more aware of it in everyday life. Again, even if you think about gender often or are already interested in it, I think Almeling and this class will challenge you to think about it in new ways. In terms of skills, I really learned to write more succinctly while still being effective, which is a skill that will definitely be useful later on.",

                "One major strength of this course is Prof. Almeling. She is so knowledgeable and really challenges her students. Because of her, you will walk out of this class a more thoughtful writer and someone who thinks critically about gender. This class is also organized really well and all of the assignments were meaningful and fun to do. The workload is also very manageable and all of the readings are really important and interesting. The recorded lectures were also really informative. I really can't imagine any ways that the course could have been improved. The readings are diverse and inclusive and discussion was always excellent.",
                "I think the readings and the discussions were good for developing a foundational understanding of societal conditions of sex and gender and how they influence all sectors of life. I think the readings could be updated\/adjusted to be more intersectional and include information that is more relevant to modern trends in sex and gender.",
                "i really enjoyed the discussion format! i found that the class discussions worked really well even given the virtual format",

Even if there are changes to the class (I think it will be a lecture next year) I know she will make every effort to ensure that everyone is learning and having a good experience in the class. The content is also excellent. Not only will you learn new information, but you will be challenged to think about it really critically. The assignments were always manageable and allowed me to think even more critically about topics I chose and knew I was interested in. Professor Almeling also gives probably the best and most constructive feedback I've ever received, and I definitely left this class a better writer and thinker because of that.",
