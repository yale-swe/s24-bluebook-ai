                "You first start by counting things, applying central limit theorem, and deriving amazing things about the world that are non-mechanistic, such as temperature and pressure of a classical ideal gas. Then you move on to thermodynamics and just assume basically that everything microscopically is working as expected, and you do some calculations and things that are easier than the statistical mechanics you had first seen (micro canonical). Then the rest of the course is pure black magic: you unleash the canonical partition and grand canonical partition functions to basically do all of thermodynamics with very little work: everything is formal and less approximations are necessary. You move on to the UV catastrophe, quantum ideal gases, Bose Einstein condensate, and a little bit of phase transitions.",
                "In this course, I learned the basic results of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. In thermodynamics, I learned how to work with equations of state to obtain thermodynamic quantities, analyze stability conditions, and use thermodynamic potentials. We covered exact and inexact differentials, and particularly how to describe and compute quantities in quasi-static processes. For statistical mechanics, I gained insight into into the description of large systems of weakly interacting particles remaining close to equilibrium. I learned how to derive the microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical distributions through the postulate of equal a-priori probabilities, and use these ensembles to arrive at the thermodynamic relations. I also learned how to construct and work with the partition functions of various classical and quantum systems, including Bose and Fermi gasses and black body radiation.",

            "comments": [
                "The class is well organized overall. One small piece of feedback is that lectures can be somewhat hard to understand. It sometimes feels like one long sequence of doing math without being sure what the important results are. More explanation of what equations are important would be beneficial.",
                "Strengths: there is a fair amount of derivation in the course. I think this should continue as such, but perhaps at some points there was too much of it unnecessarily. PSets were of an ideal length.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Read goes very fast. Tests were much harder than what we all expected, and we got no explicit practice for them. The final grading curve was not revealed during the entire semester. The textbook (Reif) is extremely dense, but I cannot recommend any other ones because apparently all stat mech textbooks are awful.",
                "This course is amazing; I mean, its really hard, because even though you know oh, I need to use the canonical distribution, it is still hard to come up with the right physical formulation.",
                "This course was one of the first times I felt that physics has given me direct insight into the world around me. Statistical mechanics enabled me to contemplate phenomena like vapor pressure, elasticity, and radiation in a way I had never understood it before. I felt that the strength of this course was the applicability of the material to describe these everyday phenomena. The place I think this course could be improved is the structure. It was not clear to me until midway through the second half of the semester that thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are considered to be independent topics. The textbook reflected this confusion, as it seemed to jump back and forth between statistical and thermal arguments in a way that made it confusing at times to follow. Personally, I think that this course would be easier to follow if it began with the canonical distribution and partition function, and then worked forward from there, presenting a unified framework.",
                "Lectures were very good and gave nuanced descriptions of the material. Problem sets were approachable and not as time consuming as other physics courses. However, exams were far more difficult and problem sets did not prepare students for the exams.",
                "Extremely challenging course, but felt very rewarding by the end. Statistical mechanics is a very interesting topic and I think this class did it justice. Really, really, really hard, though. Although the PSETs usually weren't unreasonably long.",
                "Lectures moved very fast but were interesting. Having more posted notes or recordings would have been hugely helpful. Prof. Read's notes were well written and insightful, but the course covered so much material that it was hard to grasp everything. Problem sets were manageable but exams felt more on the side of quirky than testing the skills we had learned (or in line with the problems we were assigned for homework).",
                "This was a very weak course, yet another example of how teaching is not prioritized in the Physics major's core classes. \r\nLectures are fast-paced, dense, and are generally unrelated to pset material. It would be better to skip class and read the textbook which contains the pset questions. \r\nExams were very difficult. Prof Read did not answer questions or give any useful indication of what would be on exams. \r\nGrading policies were never communicated, and direct questions about grading were answered with sarcasm or ambiguity by Prof Read. To date students don't know how exams will be curved or what grading of the overall course will look like. \r\nThe best parts of the course were when Prof Read talked about actual applications or real phenomena of thermodynamics, but this was rare. Most of class was rapid derivations that skipped most steps.",
                "course content was good",
                "Weaknesses: there was no access to a TA for office hours which is sometimes necessary when the way the professor explained things wasn't helpful or he was too intimidating, exam problems did not closely follow textbook problems and no review material was given, grades were not entered into canvas",
                "This course rightly has a reputation as the most difficult in the intensive major. I think one of the hardest things about this material is it doesn't build naturally from the other physics courses as much as something like E&M or QM. Extra care needs to be taken by the professor to make sure undergrads who are seeing the material for the first time are able to see the conceptual connections between this material and the rest of physics. The textbook for this course (Reif) is outdated but pretty good; I found reading the textbook to be the most helpful aspect of the course."

I have taken several graduate physics courses, including Advanced Classical Mechanics (PHYS 500) and Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS 508), and I found this course to be far more challenging than either of them. The beginning of the course was a bit rocky because the instructor was out sick for several weeks, and so I did not have a good indicator of whether I was keeping up or not. I felt confident on the homework assignments, but I was completely lost on the midterm. After this, I began coming to office hours regularly every week, and diligently studying my notes and reading through the textbook on my own in addition to class. Even so, I found it difficult to catch up, and I felt lost in lecture throughout most of the course. I really appreciate a challenging physics course, but I think there were structural reasons that this course was much more challenging than it had to be, to the point that it detracted from my ability to learn the material. For this reason, I would hesitate to recommend this course to a student who did not already have to take it for their major.",
                "Its a requirement of the major, but if Professor Read is teaching I would recommend waiting a year to take.",

I feel like when I was doing the problem sets and I was sitting in front of the book with all the equations in front of me, I could figure out most problems, but I do not think I had an intuitive sense of what was going on, even though I paid close attention in class. That's not to say that this wasn't covered in the class; it's very possible that this is a unique feeling and that other students had a strong sense of the intuition. I'm just not sure, and that was something I was struggling with even though I thought I was trying hard in class and on PSETs.",
                "no i wouldn't unless it was absolutely necessary which it's not unless you're doing the intensive physics major.",
                "Only if they're an intensive major and have to take it. And I would recommend it with the following caveat: DO NOT take this course with Nick Read. Wait for another professor. The material is interesting, but the course is very difficult, and if it's not applicable to your major, I don't see a reason to put yourself through it."
