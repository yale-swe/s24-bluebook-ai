                "Obviously, the Yiddish language. In L3 you are still finishing up some finer grammatical points, and Josh is careful to tailor that to what each unique class still needs to learn and review. You continue to build your vocabulary. By the end of L3 I could translate a few pages comfortably, mostly understand a video of spoken Chassidic Yiddish, and write a few paragraphs with a medium number of mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut this course is so much more than just the language. You learn how to be funny. You learn pedagogy. You learn about Jewish history, holidays and culture. You learn about editorial offices and newspaper culture. You learn about how to treat people. You learn about yourself. But you also learn to see outside yourself."

                "The course is well structured, immensely flexible, and a joy to attend. It is extremely successful at what it sets out to do  teach Yiddish (and more). From the pace of material to workload to instruction to personalization, you simply could not imagine a better class. Theres also a certain structure to the assignments and class itself that helps it be familiar (without being monotonous)! \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement  Josh tweaks the course every year to better match the cohort. So there used to be more games, and I personally think that would be good to bring back, including YidTok (an internal version of TikTok for Yiddish students of all levels). But its not like their absence detracted from the course overall. If theres a class without weaknesses, its this one."

                "Absolutely. Take Yiddish. TAKE YIDDISH! Even if you dont feel like a Yiddishist or youre not that interested in Yiddish culture or whatever. Although obviously this is L3 so you probably know the deal and by now. But I truly believe this course has something for everyone. If youre looking for community, absolutely. If youre looking for a language class that you can feel good about? Definitely choose this one. If youre interested in Jewish culture or history? This is a fantastic way to learn about it  and quickly gives you the language skills to access a whole lot of Jewish texts. But seriously. This course gave me a best friend. This course was a guiding star through the good and the bad of college. This course saved my life and Im only being a little bit hyperbolic. TAKE YIDDISH."
