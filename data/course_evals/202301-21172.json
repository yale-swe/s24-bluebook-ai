                "I thought that a major strength was the discussion section since it allowed us to interact with Professor Watts closely and have him answer our specific questions. I also think that another strength was that the lecture presentations were very comprehensive and easy to follow. I didn't think that this class had many major weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the course load was manageable and good. Professor Watts was very punctual about posting his lectures before he gives them so that students could follow along or go back and review. The organization of the slides was a bit confusing, it was more of a sit and listen lecture than take notes verbatim. I enjoyed this style, it helped students form their own political opinions of the topics we discussed. The discussion sections were very interesting, I enjoyed the ability to talk with Professor Watts directly outside of the lecture. I also highly enjoyed watching short documentaries and then having section discussions about the topics. I learned a lot through this model from the professor and my other classmates. \r\n\r\nAlthough the lectures dragged on a bit. Perhaps cutting the class time shorter would keep students engaged.",
                "More videos",
                "strengths: The class isn't all that difficult, but the topics are super interesting and important, and they are approached with a tremendous amount of care and attention to look at many perspectives on the issue! Prof Watts makes this class truly special; he cares so much about the animals he's teaching about as well as the people who share spaces with them, and he makes the class a really enjoyable and inspirational experience. I loved the discussion sections that he led himself, and hearing all the anecdotes from his own field work was really cool. The workload is very manageable, and the assignments are split up into small ones throughout the semester so that there's never a week where you're completely overloaded. Weaknesses: none.",
                "The lectures can be a bit boring, especially if you aren't interested in primates, specifically, but if you appreciate the conservation history and politics, you'll appreciate the course.",
                "The strengths were the variety of materials Professor Watts provided to aid our understanding of his lectures. Weakness: It was not engaging except in discussion sections.",
                "The course was very enjoyable, but I feel like it was hard to engage with some the content specific to monkeys. Perhaps a local zoo-keeper could bring in a monkey to show the class?",
                "Strengths: easy to follow and good professor",
                "Strengths: Professor Watts is very engaging and knowledgeable.",
                "I really loved this class. Professor Watts gives great lectures and is really passionate about the subject. I wouldn't change anything about the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Watts is so passionate about conservation and has so much knowledge to share. Section mainly focuses on watching videos and discussing them, which was a new (for me) and engaging way to interact with the course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Incorporating more discussion into the lecture times would make them more interactive.",

                "Great lectures and discussion section",
                "Very good course. Enjoyed Professor Watts as a lecturer and he had very interesting points in the section. Very nice, caring, flexible, and enjoyed hearing about his work in the field",
                "There are no weaknesses with the course. This course has the strength of promoting student engagement with the material through the different reading responses and discussion section.",
                "Rather than so many small assignments that were difficult to keep track of, I would have preferred fewer, longer papers or presentations.",

                "Yes, very interesting course to take for all majors.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about the complicity of conservation efforts and how the lines of morality can be hard to draw with an interconnected world. Professor watts was very understanding and easy-going. I always enjoyed going to lectures and discussion sections.",

                "Would you like an easier social science credit that might accidentally pique your interest in something you've never even thought of (particularly of the primate variety)? Take the class. The professor has a bit of a shell, but he is wonderfully engaging and insightful once you're through.",
                "Yes if they care about primate conservation or want a gut class.",
                "I would as a good 5th class. Reading and papers are interesting. Professor Watts is kind and knowledgeable.",
                "YES YES YES. This class changed how I viewed conservation!",

                "Yes. You will learn alot",
                "Yes, this course is interesting and a great way to get a social credit. The workload is low and the professor is very nice.",
                "Yes. It was a great course that brought to light a large scale problem and what efforts and being put into solving conservation issues.",
                "Yes. If you are looking for a more relaxed class that will expose you to issues of primate conservation and help bring light to the forces at play, this course is worth taking. Watts is a great professor and he shares some really interesting stories/perspectives on his time in the field.",
                "Yes! This class is amazing and will teach you more than just primate conservation.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to conservation biology.",
                "Definitely recommend, great opportunity to learn about conservation as a whole (trust me, Discovery Channel documentaries are nowhere near sufficient). You'll definitely get the most out of this course if you put your best into it. Professor Watts has great lectures and I suggest going to all of them; they are a great way to learn so many interesting things about primate conservation without having the stress of remembering every little detail in the lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in conservation, indigenous rights, or primates.  This course does teach you about these topics and you leave the course having a more well-rounded understanding of the challenges that face conservation worldwide, and how these challenges intersect with indigineous and local communities."
