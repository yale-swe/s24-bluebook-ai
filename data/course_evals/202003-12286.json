We learned how to import data from spreadsheets, to make scatterplots and histograms with error bar, to do curve-fitting, and to calculate quantities such as the chi^2. Especially for the early labs, we were given pretty much all of the code, so we just had to plug in our data.

            "comments": [
                "The strength include that the TF was amazing! Dr. Bhimani was one of the best TFs I had so far at Yale!\r\n\r\nThe iOLab (experimental kit used) was good and allowed us to make experiments but sometimes it was limited and the documentation available for it was inadequate (form the manufacturer). \r\n\r\nWorking on a group has also been great because I was able to learn so much from peers.",
                "One strength is that the course made it relatively easy to follow and learn the Python. They didn't try to teach us too many new commands at once, and the code we were given was extremely well commented. I'm not representative, though, because I have some previous coding experience (but not in Python). That being said, you could almost get by just by copying and pasting without really understanding everything.\r\n\r\nI think it would have been nice to have more guidance from the beginning on how to write lab reports. We weren't told very much about what to include, or how to format things. This was only a problem on the first few labs; they gave us clearer instructions and models after that. It would have been helpful to have those from the start. I was also surprised at how short the lab reports were: two pages, double-spaced. This just isn't a lot of space to discuss a lab, and it's much less than, for example, chem lab. On the other hand, I imagine that an in-person semester might have longer lab reports, since we could do more complex experiments.",
                "The lab sessions and jupyter notebooks were very well-organized and helpful in learning, especially given that this lab course was completely virtual. Feedback from the professor or the TF was also done in a timely manner, I really don't have anything negative to say about this course except maybe the time; they were unable to accommodate my time zone very well which ended up in me having to wake up at 7am to attend each three-hour section.",
                "The professor and TF were great. They were very helpful and adapted the course well to the online format. The main weakness of the course was, of course, that it was online, so our equipment was very limited. Despite this, the IOLabs were pretty cool and let us do a lot of experiments in our dorms.",
                "I thought the iOLab was a great idea, and many of the labs were fun to go through with your partner. In terms of weaknesses, a lot of the homework felt like busywork and didn't add much to my learning.",
                "The course was doen well for a virtual lab. However, it was difficult to conduct some experiments in the dorm room and sometimes the level of coding required was slightly above the level of someone with no coding experience.",
                "I felt the lectures that started every class were a bit rushed. I would have appreciated more time spent on those as they explained the physics concepts behind the experiments we were doing in class. \r\n\r\nI also think more time should have been given to explaining what we were doing in each experiment and what the goal was before starting the actual experiment. I found that a significant amount of time was spent at the beginning of our independent classwork time every week trying to determine how to do an experiment as opposed to just doing it.\r\n\r\nI also wish we spent more time in class going over the error propagation exercises we did and read about in HW. Im not sure I mastered the concepts and Im still not always clear when and how to apply the error analysis techniques that we learned.",
                "This course was great! I feel like the course load was manageable and I learned a lot about how to run experiments. It was nice to be able to still do data collection at home with the iOLabs. Plus, the final project offered us creative freedom and the ability to think on our own to really get to the heart of what experimentation is all about. Of course, it would have been nice to actually \"discover\" something, but this is a weakness of most teaching labs anyway the results are already known and there's none of that error limbo and attacking concepts from multiple angles (i.e. using multiple different experiments). That aspect might be nice to add for next time (do I get the same results if I try an independent experiment?). Also, some of the \"lecture\" portions went a little fast and I had to ask the TA to recap a lot. Overall, I was very happy with the way this course was run, though.",
                "The course's sporadic and surface level exposure to statistical concepts was meaningless at best and confusing at worst. Up until 3\/4 into the semester the statistical concepts were completely unrelated to the work being conducted in lab and made the homework seem like busy work. The confusion about the relevancy of the homework could be reduced if the lab write-ups included application of the concepts that directly tie to last week's homework.",
                "Strengths: Virtual labs are very hard to do, especially with something like physics which seems fairly hands-on. However, I think the instructors did a good job managing this by using the iOLabs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main weakness was a very brief introduction to Python. I have never coded before and this class definitely threw me in the deep end. Oftentimes, I didn't understand code presented to me and this made successfully completing assignments difficult.",
                "The design of this course was excellent. It progressed smoothly and at an appropriate pace, with each weekly activity building another skill we would ultimately apply in our final independent investigation. I know planning a remote lab class must have been difficult, but it went off excellently, and I felt engaged with all the activities. The introduction to Python and all the error analysis reading we did was also fantastic. If I had one suggestion, it would be maybe one more mini-lecture clarifying some of the error analysis concepts.",
                "The strengths of the course include the diverse array of topics, including subjects of interest for the final project, along with the easy-to-follow experiments. The biggest weakness is the lack of standards with regards to the lab write ups. There was no real rubric or guide to model our summaries after, which led to stress regarding what was left out or not. Furthermore, there should be some extra time set aside for programming help, as many students have not been previously exposed to it. Finally, the fact that this a physics lab should be emphasized more. Despite the reasonable focus on measurement and data analysis, the physics concepts themselves are also important for students taking the introductory course and should be considered accordingly.",
                "I think this course was pretty good. I did feel like we could have made better use of the IOlab, since we only used it for ~3 projects",
                "I thought the course was done well online, the level of engagement was strong, as most of the time was spent in break out rooms with lab partners.",
                "This course could have been improved by including a better explanation of the Python code we were using. I didn't truly understand why we were using the code we were using, and even then, I only understood the little that I did because I learned some Python a couple years ago. The group work was a strength of this course, because I learned a lot from how my peers approached the lab problems.",
                "I learned a lot about basic Python, and this course is a great introduction to application of code for someone who has never coded before. I didn't feel at a disadvantage to my peers who had taken computer science courses in the past, but I do think publicizing the TA office hours better (and sending all the TA's office hours to every student, not just their section's students) would be really helpful for the students who struggle with the code, especially at the beginning. Overall, Dr. Irons made the course really fun and engaging and I had a great time in the lab meetings, especially because of the small section size (there were only 4 people on my lab day).",
                "The course could have been more friendly to beginners at coding, offering maybe a little bit more of an introduction to using Python.",
                "The lab reports felt like there was not enough guidance.",
                "To improve tthis course, I would spend more of time used fo error analysis to also learn to implement these techniques in python. I also would have liked to use more of the range of sensors on the IOLab to explore a wider range of physical properties.",
                "Although it was harder online, I think the class was strong in terms of the labs we were given to do, and teaching us data analysis through python\/jupyter notebook."

                "The experiments were certainly different, and I assume they were less complicated than they would have been in an in-person semester. That said, the experiments with the iOlab were reasonable, and we were able to collect good data. The earlier weeks where we watched videos of experiments were less fun, but I don't think they were worse learning experiences.\r\n\r\nIt was very nice to have a class Slack, because it allowed me to communicate with the TAs and instructors. They tended to reply very quickly, which was awesome.\r\n\r\nAll of our data analysis in Python worked very well over Zoom. It wasn't much different than it would have been in person.",
                "The overall structure actually was decently well done. The jupyter notebooks served very well as informational tools, it's a shame that we weren't able to perform some experiments but we were given an iOLab which certainly increased the immersion of the class than just giving us raw data.",
                "The IOLabs were great. In my opinion, the 3 hours of lab on zoom were just too much, and I think class would have been much more productive if it was split into two sessions per week.",
                "I was satisfied with the virtual experiments, where we had to collect data from a video. \r\n\r\nI was also satisfied with the IOLab device. Although some measurements were hard to take since the IOLab is designed for learning and not industry, I still appreciated the opportunity to take measurements other than lengths.",
                "Sending home the iOLabs really made the course. It was so nice to be able to actually put my hands on something. And learning how breadboards work by actually using wires was really phenomenal (that was my favorite lab). The experiments at home were complex enough to be interesting but not so complicated that they became frustrating, which was great. Also, group work over zoom wasn't all that bad, and the way the TAs shuffled us into different groups each week let me get to know my classmates like we would have in real life. In terms of online learning (and not always looking at a screen), I give PHYS 205L an A.",

                "I think that the iOLab was a great idea for the online lab and it allowed students to experience at least a little bit of lab-based physics. Maybe one thing that could be improved is the introduction to Python, as most of the class is geared towards using the Jupityr notebooks.",
                "Somehow, this lab managed to be just as engaging online as I imagine it would be in-person. We still accomplished a large degree of collaborative group work, and because they shipped us the iOLabs, we were able to do hands-on activities for the majority of the course.",
                "The experiments were transferred online fairly well, as completing experiments was not difficult with proper technique and equipment. The group work was my saving grace in this course and it should be kept going forward for ease of experimentation.",
                "I think the practices in this course relating specifically to changes due to COVID were done well. The main hurdle seemed to be finding a way to remotely conduct experiments, but I thought this was done quite well through use of the iOLab.",
                "The group work surprisingly worked well over zoom. I don't think anything needs to be changed.",

Not only did it allow us to take our own data and be more engaged with the course, it also gave us more flexibility in the types of data we collected and when we collected it, allowing us to be more creative and use the best time we had for this class.",

                "Yes, if you need it for your major and it helps with 206L. The python part was also great because python coding skills are helpful many scientific areas in general.",
                "Yes, I would probably recommend this course. It provides a good basis in data analysis in Python, which is useful. It also provides some basic error analysis and experimental design training. The workload is very manageable.",
                "I would recommend this lab course to anyone interested in data science or learning to collect\/process data using code.",
                "I can't compare it to the in-person version, but if you are looking for an extra 0.5 credit, or need it for your major, I think it's still worth taking online.",
                "It was very clear that the students in my section loved physics. If that describes you, then I would recommend it.",
                "I hesitate to recommend any virtual lab, but if you need to take this course virtual then I would recommend it. The format was difficult even though I believed that this course was the best a virtual lab course could be.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. From what I've heard, it is much better now than it was in the past, and in COVID times, it was great to not have to look at a screen all the time. The instructional staff had a clear picture of what they were doing, and classes were pretty well organized. I feel like I learned a lot, and the workload was adjusted to be more in line with the half-credit this is worth, which was really nice. Plus, I got to know my classmates by working with them in shuffled groups.",
                "Only take this course if it is required. You do not learn much that sticks or is that you can't learn from reading a chapter in a textbook. The one redeeming quality was being able to develop and conduct your own physics experiment.",
                "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to another student not majoring in physics. However, since it is a requirement for physics majors, I would recommend taking this course. I say this because most of the class is irrelevant unless you plan to conduct physics research in the future.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Especially any prospective physics major who either knows they are interested in experimental physics or wants to see if they should look at pursuing research. I know some people like to skip straight to 206L, but I would recommend taking 205 first even if you think it's not advanced enough because I promise you'll learn more than you thought you would.",
                "Do NOT take this course if you don't have to. It it all about measurement and data analysis, but those topics can be covered in greater depth in actual courses not disguised as a lab. If you want to actually see the physics you're learning in class in action, for those in the 180 class, then take 165L instead. Despite the emphasis on measurement, the course is a nice introduction to programming in python. You don't have to actually code anything from scratch on your own that isn't rudimentary. However, beware of the tedious mistakes in your code, as they pile up in this course as in any other coding class. The atmosphere is also not that amiable, as you feel as if you're being judged most of the time. This is especially apparent in the final project ideas and public critique. Nonetheless, only take it if you have to. If you do, prepare yourself for a long semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student; it is a very good introduction to the basics of physics labs. It was also really cool to hear from distinguished professors!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, because I found the content useful and the class enjoyable. I think the skills developed in this class will continue to be useful for me.",
                "I think that this course would be enjoyed by someone who has a fair amount of coding and physics experience. Otherwise, you will not get as much out of this class.",
                "I would definitely think about waiting to take this lab in person. It was a great time online, however I imagine its much better otherwise.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you're worried that you don't know anything about coding, this course is a great place to start without actually taking a coding class. I am very glad I took this course instead of 165L because of the chance to learn about coding along with physics.",
                "Yes. While it may have been a bit challenging at first, it ultimately was a pretty fun class and I feel like it did a good job of introducing us to what some physics research may be like.",
                "Yes, the course was very fun. I liked doing my own project at the end.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who hopes to major in physics. It is a great way to begin exploring an interest in laboratory science, and the skills explored are invaluable for an eventual degree in physics.",
                "I would recommend if required by your major. it is a fun class, but does require a lot of work and engagement to get a good grade and understand."
