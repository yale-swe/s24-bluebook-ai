   "comments": [
    "In this course, I became more aware of what Victorian literature is as well as the historical and social implications of the works we read. We read everything from from Pre-Raphaelite poetry to pseudo \"sensation\" fiction to aestheticist theory, and all of it was interesting. I also received valuable feedback about essay writing.",
    "We learned about aestheticism and Walter Pater, the new woman, etc. The class was well-balanced: we discussed queer love and how it was encoded in Victorian England through Michael field and oscar Wilde. We also did a lot of poetry analysis.",
    "I was exposed to so much Victorian literature that I knew nothing about, so I feel like this course really rounded out my knowledge of the period.",
    "rigorous practice close reading, wide survey of Victorian poetry and prose, including colonial literature",
    "I learned so, so much about Victorian poetry and prose. I also feel that I gained skills in writing analytical papers.",
    "Victorian literature is so much fun! Seriously. This class discussed queerness, gender, and intersectionality in Victorian literature in a way that was so interesting and unexpected. Great survey of canonical works as well as more pulpy\/fun ones!",
    "I learned about the history of love and the different ways in which it was embodied and expressed during a different time period.",
    "This course provided me with an incredibly rich overview of love poetry and other forms of writing about love in the Victorian era, traversing generic and authorial ground. Women writers, queer writers, and writers of color are not ignored by this course, though I strongly feel there should have been some Black writers on the syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This course has an awesome syllabus. I also appreciate that we read female and non-Western writers. There were very engaging discussions that were extremely well facilitated by Professor Levine. Our conversations were always lively and interesting, and participating was a pleasure because the works themselves were, for the most part, completely enjoyable. I found myself forming connections between this class and other classes I'm taking, which always feels extremely rewarding. I liked having the focus of \"love and desire\" because it allowed us to consider how different theories play out across genres and across time periods. I especially loved the poetry. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of! Reading Hegel and Stendhal were a bit dense to get through at the very beginning of the course, but I completely understand why we read them and I appreciate their content nonetheless.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I dont have much to say that could have been improved, other than maybe a more structured approach to discussion. Sometimes I felt like wed all sit in silence for a moment but thats not necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed the poetry analysis which is something I dont typically gravitate toward and I enjoyed the deep exploration of one subject in one time period.",
    "Strengths - diverse and well-curated readings! I felt like this was a very carefully constructed syllabus, and all the authors built on each other in interesting ways. I also enjoyed the diverse conversation styles in this class (having everyone give a comment at the beginning, having people present in small groups, etc.) I truly can't think of a weakness!",
    "The discussion was really fun and the professor kept content relatable and interesting!",
    "strengths: well-organized, comprised mostly junior English majors (always nice to see some familiar faces and know the standard for discussion is pretty even), many texts included on syllabus\r\nweaknesses: would've preferred if two of the reading responses were due before midterm",
    "The prose selections could have been a little more engaging, but all of the poetry and nonfiction was fantastic.",
    "Professor Levine is extremely knowledgeable; class discussions, readings, and assignments were all organized very well. I can't think of many weaknesses.",
    "Strengths = the professor, the reading materials, the involvement of art and art history \r\nWeaknesses = none",
    "The syllabus of this course is a major strength. Class discussions were always lively, and the material we discussed always held my interest. Ample background on the lives of the writers we studied added additional layers of engagement and understanding to the class material. The only weakness I feel was that the comments on our class essays could have been a bit more critical. The class had a range of students from first-years to seniors, and as a senior I almost wanted even more rigorous engagement with my writing."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, English majors and non-English majors alike (if you can get in!). The class is challenging, but completely worth it to me. This was a wonderful introduction to Victorian literature and the theme \"love and desire\" makes for a focused approach at a vast subject. Professor Levine is wonderful to work with and the texts are charming, interesting, and extremely engaging to read. Taking this course often felt like a poetry\/book club rather than a class because everybody felt invested in the works. Class was also relaxing to be in!",
    "I would! Particularly if you like the romance genre or the Victorian era. But even if you dont, the class covers so much more than that and its fascinating to think about how ideas about love have changed and stayed the same.",
    "Yes! This is a great survey of some Victorian literature you may not have read before. The amount of reading is not overwhelming, but you'll get a lot out of it. I also highly recommend Professor Levine to anyone who is intimidated by poetry. She will help you to learn skills for talking\/writing about poetry, but it won't feel super introductory or basic.",
    "Yes! If youre an English Major, yes. If youre afraid of the stuffiness of Victorian lit, dont be! This class actually makes it very interesting and fun and humanizes some iconic writers. If youre interested in art history, too, this is a great intersection between literature and art history.",
    "YES! reading both pater and stendhal changed the trajectory of my english studies",
    "If a student was a fan of Victorian literature, I would tell them they must take this course.",
    "Yes! The syllabus, instructors, and discussions are worth it.",
    "Yes; the material was intriguing, the professor was amazing, and it was overall an incredible experience.",
    "Absolutely. Dr. Levine is an amazing professor, and students will leave the class with a profound understanding of Victorian love writing in all its forms.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in understanding the Victorian Era not only through the canonical works but through a range of literature that captures even the popular\/pulpy tastes at the time."
