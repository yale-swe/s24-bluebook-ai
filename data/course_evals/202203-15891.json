The concepts are arranged in such a way that each week builds on a previous one, and the instructors relate new concepts to familiar old ones. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Paced at a breakneck speed, but there's not really an easy way to slow down when there's so much to cover. I took the final yesterday and felt it was dramatically harder than either of the midterms, any of the psets, and any of the quizzes.",
                "The course was structured and predictable in its expectations (psets, pre-class videos), but could be improved through more practice resources.",
                "I think the course is very thorough in teaching every theorem and when to use it. The flow chart that connects all of the concepts we had been learning together through work and flux that we received at the end seemed like one of the most important concepts in the class and I wish I had received it earlier, so I could familiarize myself with it more before the final exam.",
                "Not taught well",
                "Lots of opportunities to practice problems",
                "The course was taught in a good order, and it felt as though each lesson built from the last, with a nice summary at the end. To improve, a more intuitive definition towards the start of the course could be given of what a line integral actually represents.",
                "I do not see many weaknesses of this course. The strengths of the course are that it was very interesting and my professor did a great job teaching it.",
                "The strength of the course lies in the large amount of supplementary resources available to students. Things like Ximera were very helpful during the course. The large number of peer tutor hours was also helpful. The course was not the most captivating in terms of material, but that's not the goal of the course. It's hard to improve a course that does its job of teaching computational methods.",
                "More problems in class, or supplementary worksheets would help. Review sessions often times didn't cover all the material.",
                "The lecture material moves quite quickly, due to the expectation of having watched the lecture videos beforehand.",
                "Strengths of this class are how there are plenty of peer and professor office hours to help with questions on the psets and the small class sizes. Weaknesses are not doing enough problems in the lectures. Rather, we just went over what the textbook said (even though we had read it before) and did not get to many examples.",
                "Like most mathematics and yale courses in general, I feel that the 120 course moves too fast. Well-prepared curriculums and subject matter suffer from a severe time crunch, which drives students' grades down, which in turn is compensated for by well-documented grade inflation. Overall, the quality of the learning goes down, and the current trends do not show this changing any time soon.",
                "Sometimes I felt like the classes were a little bit unhelpful, so I think this course could be improved by organizing the classes more effectively (eg. doing more practice problems)",
                "This class does a poor job of ensuring that all sections are learning the same thing at the same level.",
                "I thought a strength was the recorded modules because they helped in learning new things. A weakness was that the actual in-class sessions felt more like reviewing what was said in the videos and doing example problems. I think re-teaching the content would have been more helpful.",
