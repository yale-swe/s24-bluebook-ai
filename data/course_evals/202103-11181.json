                "While at the time I didn't feel like I was learning a lot, I definitely did! We focused on two major \"themes\": education and work/the workplace/the world of work. I acquired vocabulary to accurately discuss these topics and engage in higher level discussions about them. We also learned a lot about more complex grammatical structures, like using the accusative case and a verb to express various sentiments, or the differences in the nuances of meaning between two related verbs. A personal favorite was learning how to something \"is manifested\" as it really elevates the level of possible conversation. Overall, however, my confidence in speaking improved. This class is all about speaking aloud with your peers, with Irina, and in front of the class. If you're nervous to speak, you'll be speaking anyway, and you'll start to gain confidence in your Russian speaking skills!"

                "Lots of strengths but the one weakness is that we often did not have time to cover all material. I would also prefer if we spent more time practicing speaking skills in class.",
                "Irina is 100% a huge strength. She's a lovely instructor and extremely knowledgeable and kind. Weaknesses was homework got a bit lengthy and time to practice speaking was a bit limited during class.",
                "The course curriculum is highly effective. The instructor puts a lot of time and effort into building the course. This is one of the only language courses Ive ever taken where instead of just moving quickly through the assigned curriculum, the instructor regularly assesses where students are and makes sure that students have sufficient time in order to master the material before moving forward. Students who apply themselves will see an incredible improvement in their Russian language skills in all modalities (listening, speaking, reading, writing, etc). In my opinion, there are no weaknesses of the course, it is one of the most effective Russian language courses Ive ever participated it.",
                "I thought this course was wonderfully taught - I was able to further my vocabulary and strengthen my grammar.",
                "The course was great and improved my language skills significantly; however, I feel like we did linger too long on certain topics and could have progressed through more vocabulary.",
                "The course would have been much more effective had it been smaller or longer. The \"slovars\" were the strength of this course.",
                "The clear strength of this course was the feedback. Homework assignments were always reviewed very closely, and Professor Dolgova went line by line to iron out mistakes and offer advice. There were ample opportunities to practice speaking, reading, writing, and reading, and I feel that my fluency has improved since the course began. Professor Dolgova cares deeply about her students' success, and will often go above and beyond to offer students ways to practice Russian in ways that are directly relevant to their interests. She is adept at her profession.\r\n\r\nI think the primary areas for improvement revolve around the course's syllabus, quizzing, and homework. Setting more clear expectations about what content will be covered over the time period in which it will be covered would help students to better prepare for class. Class was usually insightful, but class material often did not correspond to homework material or to the textbook. I understand the advantage of deviating from the textbook from time to time, but I think in deviating from the textbook, a lot of the course's overall structure was muddied. I think this also contributed to the infrequency of testing and quizzing. Overall, I think this course would benefit from a more linear approach, in which there are clear expectations about what information will be quizzed and when it will be quizzed. \r\n\r\nThe main area for improvement is in the way homework is administered. Homework assignments were often very long, and did not always correspond to the material being covered in class. They would also often be published with just over 24 hours notice, effectively limiting the amount of time that we had to work on them. I think that this (perhaps counterintuitively) actually made studying more difficult, as I would spend a great deal of time completing homework that could have otherwise been spent memorizing vocabulary and reviewing grammar.",
                "Strengths: by the end of this course you will know time expressions and verbs related to studying very well\r\nWeaknesses: too much focus on grammar, not enough real world context",
                "Strengths: Irina Andreevna! I've had two Russian professors at Yale, and I can honestly say they are of the best language professors I've ever had. This department is such a gem, and Irina is no exception. Take this class to experience a classroom with her. You're always on your feet (metaphorically), speaking, and she clearly cares so much about teaching, in addition to Russian, Russian culture, Russian linguistics. We read actual news articles, comments on those articles/from other media, so we can really live the language as it is meant to be spoken, read, written, heard. The themes are also rather pertinent: higher education and work, so you'll be learning practical vocabulary.\r\nWeaknesses: while the topics are interesting, I feel like we were stuck discussing the same things over and over and over and over. for over half of the semester we discussed the pluses and minuses of higher education, jobs that don't require higher education, university campuses in America vs. Russia, etc. I think we could've spent a little more time discussing grammar in class, too, as a lot of the onus falls on our homework assignments. The homework assignments -- they are very long and often include questions or readings that have vocabulary I haven't mastered yet, so unfortunately it requires me to translate a lot to make sure I'm understanding everything, and while I'm definitely learning something, the translation is not something I've had to do in a previous Russian class until now."

                "This course is a must for any student wishing to improve their Russian language skills. The course is highly effective, and fun. Throughout the semester, various Russian films are introduced which offer a pleasant break from the textbook. Students will offer read one or two very short stories in Russian. The films and short stories were a big highlight of the semester and offer invaluable cultural insights.",
                "I recommend Russian! Definitely stick through L5, you learn more about culture and further your appreciation for the language.",
                "Yes, but this course is lot of work. It's still the amount of work of a 1.5 credit class but is only 1 credit. Be prepared for a lot of homework and mandatory outside of class meetings.",
                "Yes! If you have progressed to this point in the class you should definitely take this!",
                "Yes, if they want to improve their Russian.",

                "Yes! If anything, to take a class with Irina Andreevna is to witness and experience greatness. She is a master at her craft and to get to study with a master of the Russian language is a treat. She is also incredible accessible, by e-mail, by Zoom, after class, at Russian tables, and her kindness is unmatched. The content of this course is interesting and practical, relevant and intriguing. The vocabulary you acquire will serve you well in the future, to add on to your 3rd Year Russian vocabulary for sure. Irina is also a very forgiving grader; it's all about improvement for her. If you don't know something 100% on a test, if linguistically what you have written makes sense, you are golden. The assessments never trip you up, and she provides adequate review materials. The homework is interesting and helps you learn and build upon what you learned in class. Class is fun and genuinely enjoyable, and you'd be remiss not to enroll in this class. Truly a privilege to take it."
