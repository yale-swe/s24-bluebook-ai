I had to unlearn the skills Ive been taught my entire life, which made for such an intellectually challenging, yet engaging class. Ciru presented the course topics very clearly in typically a slideshow format. I learned and applied the following skills, which will stick with me throughout my academic career: engaging\/entering an academic conversation, stakes, motives, open-ended conclusions, the thesis is answering a problem\/question, close-readings, logical flow of sentence structure, and how arguments are not necessarily and do not have to be black and white (nuance). Oh, and how to accurate engage, represent, and finally weave credible academic sources of various kinds."

Would also recommend because it also helped with my knowledge of Twilight, Dracula, and the vampire worlds in addition to writing itself. Will definitely be going with friends to locations in the film for fun over winter break!"
