    "I learned how to speak Advanced Modern Chinese.",
    "I become so much more comfortable speaking Chinese and using the vocabulary over the semester. The structure of the class and the regular recordings and quizzes definitely aid in the process of becoming more comfortable with the language.",
    "In general, I developed a better understanding of Chinese grammar after taking this course as well as learned several new keywords.",
    "I learned new phrases and characters in Chinese regarding politics, food, relationships, and other topics. I strengthened my knowledge of the distinctions between similar Chinese phrases.",
    "So much Chinese! This class in particular taught me a lot of chengyu and how to use them. And continuing to learn how to write a lot of Chinese characters that I can use in speech but not in writing.",
    "I learned how to learn a lot of information very quickly",
    "Chinese reading, writing, and speaking.",
    "Chinese culture, character writing\/pronunciation",
    "Gained skills in Chinese language. Mostly improved reading and writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the assignments are not clearly specified and the rubrics, instructions, and expectations are not made clear. For example, the dubbing project did not have clear rules on what movies could be used or if it needed to be from the movie that we watched as a class. Homework due dates were also difficult to understand in the beginning when essays were first assigned because of the way homework was posted for us. The weekly and daily schedule is not a good way to post assignments.",
    "There are no major weaknesses of this course. However, it would be beneficial if the instructors posted practice question material more often (especially regarding grammar practice).",
    "The grading policies were confusing. It was hard to tell how well you were doing in the course at a given moment. Additionally, I feel like there was not really adequate preparation for the midterms and final. Specifically, there could have been more explicit practice with translating English sentences to Chinese. Some of the projects I felt did not really contribute to my learning, like the dubbing project. It could be changed to make it a more effective learning exercise.",
    "Strengths: Liu Laoshi is the best human being on earth. She is caring, sweet and kind. She is also a fabulous teacher, and really knows how to engage students. \r\nWeaknesses: The textbook was not extremely well-writtenit dealt with subjects that were kind of boring compared to 132\/142. Also, I wish we spent more class time on discussion and using the phrases\/grammar patterns we learned instead of rote drilling. Also, the video-dubbing project was really unclear and felt like it wasn't helpful to improving our Chinese.",
    "I wish there would be more opportunities to use the language we have learned wether that be in discussion or presentations.",
    "Very strong listening and writing emphasis. Could train more on reading diverse texts.",
    "weakness: not so great textbook, confusing format\r\nstrength: knowledgable instructors, lots of feedback",
    "Liu laoshi was a fantastic teacher, she's really engaging with all the students and always brings new perspectives to topics we think we know. She's very willing to meet with and talk to students outside of class. She's also a great story teller. \r\n\r\nThere wasn't a lot of speaking practice, mostly due to the size of the class, but I don't think I really improved much in that area.",
    "The online course work was frustrating and not very easy to use. Assignments were released without warning and due at 9:25 AM. Students should have at least till their section to complete homework or they should be released earlier"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Liu Lao Shi is the best! If she teaches this class again, try to take her section.",
    "Yes, this is a great class to improve your Chinese in a safe environment. When we have discussions in class, it feels safe to speak your thoughts and even if you were unsure how to use a certain phrase, the teacher was very helpful in prompting words or suggesting a better way to grammatically phrase your thoughts.",
    "I would recommend this course to students wanting to fulfill the language requirement in a semester. It's a fun course because of the people that take it with you.",
    "I honestly enjoyed 142 better for the heavier emphasis on discussion and the better textbook, but if you're learning Chinese and get placed into this level, take it and take it with Liu Laoshi.",
    "Yes. If you are set on improving your CHINESE, these courses are really helpful.",
    "Yes! Highly interactive class.",
    "Yes, especially with Liu Laoshi",
    "Yes, its a great way to improve your chinese"
