The only thing that could have been improved slightly is that I might have appreciated slightly more clarity early-on about deadlines, formats, etc.",

We didn't know the length requirement for our projects until several weeks into the term and the final deadline wasn't clarified for quite a while. A more concrete syllabus with requirements and deadlines would be very useful"

Writing a senior essay is a lot of work and it isn't for everyone, but if you want an opportunity to work on your academic writing with enormous amounts of professorial support and feedback, there's no better way to do it. This course gave me a taste of what it's like to really have ownership over a large project of my own, and taught me a lot about my writing and thinking habits. If you're thinking about graduate school, you should 100% do this. If you're not, it's still a really satisfying way to put a capstone on your English major.",
