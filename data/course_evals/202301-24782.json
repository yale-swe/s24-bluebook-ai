                "Great in concept, executed extremely poorly. The \"client\" relationship felt more like a Google Jigsaw representative entertaining us and us providing them unpaid labor of dubious value. Professor Brancati made it seem like she and Google were doing us a favor the entire time (seemingly by virtue of the \"innovation\" of it being a group-project-based class?), emphasizing how internships are normally rote data entry and we should be grateful for the opportunity.",
                "The fact we had a real client was crucial. It made everyone feel like they had skin in the game and I felt it ultimately made the projects higher quality than if they were simply done in class. Additionally, the client-based aspect increased how much people learned form this project because we were delivering a product or research that could have real-world implications. It really seems like the client-based approach made most groups go the extra mile and work harder on their projects because no one wants to embarrass themselves in front of Google. In fact, I would argue that this class, or a similar capstone-based class should be an alternative requirement for the senior essay for social science majors if Yale can continue to find clients. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this course would benefit from being larger, with more support from the university to help more students design research projects. I thought the readings were interesting and topical, but most of the time when we were in class I just wanted to work on our projects instead of discussing course readings.",
                "The strength is the interactive component of the course. YOU are designing and carrying out a study with your fellow peers. One weakness is that readings were not discussed in class.",
                "Strengths: unique client-based class, interesting content, cool project\r\nWeaknesses: Students' creativity may be hindered and agency in direction of group project is limited",
                "weakness is in dawn being sometimes mean for no reason whatsoever",
                "Strengths: cool concept, working with Google Jigsaw, had a collaborative and open group, interesting readings that span politics in the digital age \/ politics applied to our digital world\r\nWeaknesses: This class would benefit from being taught by a different professor. Brancati is so unpredictable both in how she will treat her students and just her general mood throughout the class. She also doesn't listen to student ideas (she started to toward the end of the class due to feedback)",
                "The project and the promise of presenting to Google is a big strength, but it did feel a bit rushed. It might be better to just design a project and present it to Google at the end of the semester. That way we would be able to be a bit more ambitious because we could assume that we have Google's resources at our disposal."

                "No. Professor Brancati seems to have the best intentions but she can be deeply inconsiderate to the point where she (hopefully unintentionally) brings harm and honestly trauma to those around her. She is a liability to this university.",
                "Absolutely. Reading research papers it's easy to overlook how much work goes into even short research papers. Building an experiment from the ground up to a final presentation with results was extremely gratifying. I felt I probably learned more about social science research and design in this course than any other course I have taken at Yale, and this really clarified to me what real-world client-facing research can actually be like.",
                "no- the course is poorly organized and Prof.Brancati in her own words said the class is closer to an \"employee\/boss\" relationship which is the strangest thing I've ever heard during my time at Yale. While the course is client-based, Prof.Brancati was overly reverent of the client and assumed her students have not done substantial private sector work before and was condescending many a time. Her feedback is often delivered abrasively. The concept is good but the execution is poor at best.",
                "No, unless it incorporates major changes. Brancati has been an emotional toll to take a class with and has been quite unkind to many people in the course",
                "I have mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, the concept of a class where you conduct research for Google (or a company like it) and present your research is awesome. The projects we made were really cool and might even influence the way that Google thinks about important political issues. Professor Brancati is also extremely hard working and clearly cares so much about the class being successful.\r\n\r\nThat said, there were several aspects of this class that made it a broadly very unpleasant experience. Primarily, the feedback that we received was harsh, inconsistent, and didn't always make sense. Over time, it became challenging to know what the expectations were and felt like we would never do anything right. I understand that the harsh and honest feedback is a necessary feature of a class where we are presenting to Google at the end of it, but the feedback was inconsistent, unclear, and sometimes felt personal. \r\n\r\nI think Professor Brancati's heart was in the right place throughout it all and if she took a slightly more laid-back approach it would be a great class, but it is hard to recommend it in its current form."
