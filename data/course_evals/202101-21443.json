                "The course taught us a lot of skills that are commonly used in biological research. The major strength of this course was that it walked us through the process of writing a scientific research paper step-by-step. I think this is very important for anyone going into STEM, and I feel better prepared because of it. The only weakness was that the work wasn't evenly distributed throughout the semester. Some weeks we wouldn't have much to do at all, and other weeks we had to do tons of research\/writing.",

We spent a lot of time in the beginning searching the literature, which did not leave very much time to explore the BioInformatics tools at the end.",

Even though labs were long on Zoom, Prof. Moreno made sure to give us breaks when we needed them and tried her best to keep us all engaged.",
