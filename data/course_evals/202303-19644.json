                "Strengths: The asynchronous friday work was really engaging and also relieved a little of mental strain on the class I think. Daily language practice in the same format has a real risk of leading to burnout for some people. At least in my experience, I found the asynchronous work on Fridays hugely rewarding. Also important to this class I think was classroom culture. Luckily I had a group of friendly students, and our teacher was a really good facilitator of our learning. I can't imagine feeling as successful as I do without that. \r\nThe only weakness of these classes is that you get out what you put in. The group projects involved can become stressful if you're paired with someone who doesn't do as much work as you.",
                "This course is very well organized, but it is also extremely fast-paced and I forgot some of the material we covered not long ago. The daily assignments can become overwhelming at times and it's easy to fall behind if you don't work on them in advance. The listening and speaking tests can be very challenging, but the tutoring is helpful and overall this course is extremely rewarding as you can see yourself progressing day by day.",
                "It was pretty fast paced which is great for learning a lot in a short period of time but made it pretty difficult to catch up after being sick.",
                "Strength: asynchronous work once a week on Friday -- able to use Chinese in an engaging way outside of class but still connected to what we were currently learning about. I really enjoyed this asynchronous arrangement, even though working on the assignment took more time than normal class time, and I believe it helped me learn the material.",
                "I enjoyed the 4 +1 asynchronous day because it allowed me to work at my own pace as well as learn with the rest of the class",
                "Strengths: Small class sizes, interactive classes, engaging, not too much homework, focus on student engagement. \r\nWeaknesses: can't think of anything"

                "Learning Mandarin is not for the feint of heart, but I think more people should view it as a worthwhile pursuit. There's a lot of merit, I think, for an english speaker to step out of the bounds of languages related to their own. It teaches you how to see the world through a different set of eyes. It teaches you how to be more compassionate. Therefor if you are motivated, taking 130 chinese makes so much sense.",
                "YES! How many courses do you finish a semester and think \"what did I actually learn?\" This will not be one of those courses.",

                "Absolutely! Chinese L3 is amazing and Liang Laoshi is the best. I'm taking L4 with her because I loved her so much and a lot of students in my class are too. There's a dip in workload from levels 1 and 2, so don't be intimidated."
