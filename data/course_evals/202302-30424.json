I had little to zero knowledge in music theory but now I can count a songs time signature by just listening to a song, I understand different parts of a song like a build-up, beat drop, etc. I want to further these interest in my next couple of years at Yale."

                "Absolutely no complaints. I loved how there were different options for the final project. Only wish I had taken the class during the school year, five weeks went by too quickly.",
                "This course was extremely well-planned and well-taught.  I think the AbletonLive demonstrations were somewhat useful, but probably could have been done by us students on our own time - the course was great overall and could have benefitted from more history of the genres discussed (the cultural context in which they developed, influences on each genre from outside of EDM would have been really cool - I've been reading up on this since the course ended and enjoyed it a lot)",
                "I really like the breadth of topics the course covered. I wish there was more theory about overall song structure and composition. I would have also loved to see more class projects/presentations. Working on my own music productions was the most fun part of the class and where I learned the most.",
                "I think the course assignments are very clear and understandable.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more participation.",
                "Strengths: The subject matter is interesting and fun. Getting the opportunity to make a song or to analyze one of your favorite tracks for a final project is super unique compared to my other courses. Professor Alexander also really cares about student learning and is willing to spend extra time to make sure you are understanding everything.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The majority of the assignments felt like busy work. Most of them were fill-in-the-blank that were 1-to-1 with lecture notes (I suppose to make sure you saw what was covered in lecture) which felt a bit silly to me.",
                "Strengths of the course include the dummied down version of explaining music theory. The course made no assumptions on the levels of exposure to music theory and truly taught the course from the bottom up. Focusing on broader topics in the beginning of the course and as the course developed it slowly focused into the finer details of music theory. \r\nWeakness of the course include equipment available for even further understanding. There are many types of equipment that will be required when practically applying the knowledge in the studio, equipment that is standard and would help bring everything together especially for newbies like myself. \r\nIf the course had any type of hybrid aspect like classes being taught online for the academic portion and then in person at one of the many recording studios on campus, that would be extremely beneficial."

                "I highly recommend this course! The material is engaging and homework assignments were straightforward. It's assumed that most people who take the class have no experience with music, so there are lectures dedicated to basic music theory. And by the end you'll be able to make some music using a DAW which is very cool.",
                "Absolutely.  The course is really accessible to musicians and non-musicians alike, and there's so much to learn about a genre of music that's so popular today.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone who has a modicum of interest in music theory, music production, or modern EDM music in general should take this course.",
                "For students looking to learn the basics of Ableton, I would recommend it.",
                "For sure. This course was not particularly challenging (probably the easiest I've taken at Yale) and it was pretty fun. I got to show my friends the EDM track I made for my final project and they were impressed."

The goal is to make songs casually by producing a beat, collaborating with students for vocals, and making songs that can be enjoyed by the entire student body. Yale is a liberal arts college and i want to make producing your own music a culture at Yale."
