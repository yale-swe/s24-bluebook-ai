I'm concerned about the fact that the leading voices in this discipline have such outdated perspectives and I'm really hoping that younger clinicians are facilitating the diversification of the field as well as incorporating disability justice perspectives into their practices. I'm grateful for the clinical internship, which allowed for a really unique style of academic and intellectual engagement that is particularly rare in a lot of courses.",

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of this course is the clinical rotation portion. Having the opportunity to connect with direct clinical work is incredibly valuable for students hoping to take a patient-oriented path in psychology rather than a research-oriented one. \r\nPerhaps I could structure my weakness as a strength; this class teaches you everything wrong with the present state of clinical psychological care. We have many lecturers come in who are well-versed in their respective practices, but they have been doing these practices for a very long time. That results in outdated perspectives on clinical care that are dehumanizing, eugenicist, ableist, and ignorant regarding race, ethnicity, gender, and orientation. I felt sick to my stomach multiple times throughout this semester as a disabled student of color because of the ways that lecturers and even our own professors spoke about conditions that I have lived with as well as the fact that I don't think that people of color were ever even considered in these conversations. The information is from such a purely clinical perspective that does not have any self-awareness regarding how the subjects of these conversations are experiencing this care. There is absolutely no input from the perspectives of individuals who have the discussed conditions. It's incredibly unclear at times how this is supposed to be a developmental psychopathology course because it often just feels like a poorly articulated abnormal psychology class.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professors and guest speakers who had a wealth of information to share with each and every student. No weaknesses.",
                "I loved the placements in this course. I got way more out of my placement than the actual class.  The course was very very open and there wasn't any structure that kept people engaging with the content. For example, there was a required textbook and readings posted. But, there was not a single assignment, quiz, paper or test that interacted with any textbook content.",
                "Strengths: super chill, I loved that the final paper was on a topic of your interest, interesting guest speakers, the best part was the clinical placement opportunity \r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Lectures varied in quality but they were all delivered by experts in their field who cared deeply about the material",
                "The strengths of the course were the professors and guest lectures. I felt that I was able to learn a lot more about the various fields in child psychology and  was exposed to various fields that I had not known much about before. I also felt that the professors were very understanding of the students' circumstances, especially for observations and assignments, which relieved stress and helped us to stay more engaged with the course material. One weakness of the course is that we are not exactly sure of our grade throughout the semester. There is no concrete way to determine if we need to improve, which is slightly worrying. My hope is that if we complete the assignments with clear effort, we will receive full marks, but once again, this is unknown to us. As such, I think a great way to improve the course is to provide students with grades and feedback after they turn in assignments just so they know where they stand gradewise.",
                "I think that it'd be nice to have some sort of weekly assignment, like a response to that week's lectures or something of the like.",
                "Strengths: Good lectures by a variety of professionals\r\nWeakness: The slides were not usually uploaded after",
                "I think that there could have been more student engagement in the course and more discussions. The class was too big and was more like a lecture than a seminar.",
                "strengths\r\n-covered a variety of topics\r\n-guest speakers that are professionals/specialists for each mental illness topic\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n-often boring\r\n-lecture heavy when advertised as a leminar\r\n-didn't feel like I received an in-depth understanding of topics",
                "The placements were really great and I felt I learned a lot about a lot of different topics important for my future work. But I think that there was some level of engagement I didnt really feel in the actual classes, partly because we really didnt have any assignments or feedback on how we were doing, and partly because it was often a different lecturer."

                "I think that the connections you receive through this course in regard to the clinical rotation are really valuable and might be why this course is worthwhile to take at all. However, you have to sit through a lot of really frustrating lectures if you want those connections. I don't feel like I gained much through this course and I just ended up incredibly frustrated by the lack of disability justice-informed rhetoric as well as a lack of critical self-reflection about the discipline of psychology. The textbook was written by the professors of this course and it was a nightmare to try to read; the book is dense and incredibly difficult to read as a consequence of its format (the pages are riddled with small point font with horrendous spacing and the pacing of the content feels like it's without rhyme or reason). This is a really low-risk class and the assignments aren't geared to actually have you learn something in the course. I don't feel like I was held accountable for any of the information in the course and I feel like any of the information in the course could have been found through an abnormal psychology class.",
                "Yes! I think it was very interesting thought slightly disorganized at times",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in learning about development through many different lenses, this is a perfect course for you.",
                "Yes, only if you are able to succeed with zero structure or accountability. If you want to do the readings, that's entirely up to you, but there isn't a single checkpoint that would motivate you to do them.",
                "This class was not what I expected  the professors are very nice and its cool to have so many guest lecturers, but it felt pretty disjointed at times because it consists of many discrete lectures. We also received no feedback on assignments, so it was not totally clear what we should be taking away and presenting.",
                "Yes! I don't know how it will be without Dr. Volkmar since he added so much to the class, but I think it's a very chill class on an interesting/important topic. The best part is arguably the clinical placement, so I'd also recommend taking it if that's something that interests you!",
                "If you want a relaxed credit where you get to meet a bunch of experts in different psychopathologies, this is the course for you",
                "Not particularly. The class offers a very surface-level introduction to some of the main disorders of childhood, including autism and anxiety. The lectures were not engaging, although the lecturers themselves were obviously very intelligent. There were no assignments in the course, so if you are looking to simply absorb some lecture content without doing much else, then this might be a good fifth credit. There's a final research paper in the course, so just beware of that. Otherwise, nothing too insightful came from this class and I would not recommend taking it.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The instructors are clearly passionate about the course and take into account student feedback. The professors provide a course that exposes students to various areas of the field of developmental psychopathology, which is quite diverse. I was glad to have the opportunity to take this course and expand my knowledge about psychology and even psychiatry. I felt that this course helped improve myself as a psychology student and researcher, especially since I conduct research in developmental psychopathology.",
                "Only if they were strongly motivated themselves.",
                "Yes, if you would also like to do a mandatory volunteer placement for a couple hours per week (at Benhaven, Chapel Haven, etc). Experiences were mixed; personally I was clearly not needed but it was an interesting learning/shadowing experience. Some of the lectures were quite interesting and memorable, especially Dr. Robert King's.",
                "If you are interested in developmental psychopathology, yes.",
                "Yes absolutely if you are interested in this topic. The professors are amazing and clearly very passionate about developmental psychopathology.",
                "Good course for light work-load. Very little feedback or direction on assignments",
