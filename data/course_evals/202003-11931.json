                "One of the greatest strengths of the course was the workshops and time we spend critiquing each other's work. The weekly workshops leading up to the final critique for a project allowed me to refine my work and understand where I could improve. Furthermore, the final critiques were helpful in getting broad feedback from students. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I appreciated how much time we spent looking at professional and past student work. It served as an effective context for what was achievable. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I found was that the guest lectures often ran long. I felt like I learned more through the guest critiques than their presentations. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would love is if we spent time learning about the techniques students used to create their videos. Since everyone enters the class with varying levels of expertise with After Effects, there were some people who employed much more advanced techniques than I did. I would have loved to learn how they accomplished the things they did."

                "Near the beginning of the semester, we concluded as a class that watching videos over screen share was not a good idea due to the buffer. As a result, Professor Pullman had us watch videos individually and discuss altogether. This was really helpful in keeping me engaged. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Professor Pullman gave us a lot of flexibility during workshops - we just had to arrive at our allotted time. This kept me from feeling Zoom fatigue, and I could be fully engaged when it was my turn to present."
