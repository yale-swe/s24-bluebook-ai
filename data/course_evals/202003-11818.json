Not only did I learn how to read texts closely and in context with other works, I also learned a lot about my writing style, and how to improve it. Each class professor Quint engaged us extremely well, and made  each class intellectually challenging, fun, and insightful.",

I enjoyed all of the works we read this semester, and I found that the seminar discussions enhanced my understanding of the text and helped me to consider aspects of it that I hadn't upon first reading. The skill of mine that experienced the greatest improvement was my ability to analyze literature. After each successive seminar, I found that I was getting better and quicker at identifying key themes, ideas, and details that I otherwise would have overlooked. I think my writing also improved, albeit marginally, but I did become much more comfortable with the essay writing process. Having entered college without ever having written a five-page paper, I was able to develop a system of preparation and outlining that ensured consistent success.",

                "The course was engaging and intense, and I appreciated the ability to participate in seminar-style discussions.",
                "I do not think that this course has any weaknesses except for the fact that we had to take it online. Professor Quint was an excellent teacher who cared about his students and taught the material in an effective, engaging manner.",
                "Prof. Quint is one of the biggest strengths of this course. If you have the chance please take this course with him. He is a top scholar in his field and you learn so much just by chatting with him. His lectures are fabulous (although sometimes he talks quite a lot and goes overtime). He also takes time to really engage with his students during office hours. The only weakness is due to the nature of the DS program. Compressing the first half of the western canon in a single semester is just impossible. The time we spent on each work was only enough to give us a scratch of its richness. Sometimes we read an entire epic only to discuss two small episodes in it. There's, frankly, nothing anyone can do about this and I don't think this should be a reason anyone chooses not to take DS.",
                "The syllabus is a strength of the course. Although it is a significant reading load (more so than my other two DS sections), I thought all the texts were worth reading, and I was motivated to do so by a desire to better be able to contribute during the seminar discussions. The only weakness I can identify is that some of the recorded lectures were less illuminating on others, depending on the professor and the material covered.",
                "Strengths: Structure of seminars, amount of material covered, engagement with material.\r\nWeaknesses: More student collaboration outside of professor input, time for material covered (ex: Aeneid, Inferno, too short).",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the teaching. Professor Quint is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and gives incredible feedback. The primary weakness is the pacing. With so many texts on the syllabus, we never truly got to explore any of them to their fullest extent."

Of course so much is missing without the in-person engagement and I don't really feel a community as tight as some DS alums describe. But in terms of getting the students to learn the materials and the skills virtual DS has been largely successful.",

                "Since I can't recommend DS Lit alone, I would recommend the entire DS program to everyone with the knowledge that some people would enjoy it more than others. Even though we're only halfway through the \"western canon\" (whatever this phrase means), I can feel that I don't really care about the specifics of any works as much as I care about the skills I learned in the class. That being said, some degree of interest in the western tradition is still necessary for anyone to fully engage in the class and learn anything out of it. But as long as you can get yourself to start reading and thinking about these texts and to engage with your professors and classmates, DS would be an invaluable experience. As to DS Lit with Prof. Quint specifically, I think this is probably one of the strongest DS sessions and I highly recommend taking classes with him. He will tell you your writing is bad if your writing is bad, but that's how you learn to improve it. He might appears harsh at first but he truly cares about his students. If you get to know him after a while it even becomes extremely fun to chat with him about literature and whatnot. In conclusion, DS is worth trying and you might get to learn with someone as brilliant as Prof. Quint!",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in or enjoys literature. In high school, I felt that being forced to analyze a book ruined my enjoyment of it. However, I've come to realize that when done under the tutelage of a knowledgeable professor, analyzing literature helps you to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the work that can actually enhance your enjoyment of it, rather than diminishing it.",
