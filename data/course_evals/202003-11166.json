Everyone can make something totally unique with the same basis.",

Also the office hours were well done in the sense that there were plenty of hours to ask for help and the ULAs often stayed past when they were supposed to in order to ensure all students got help. Also, Professor Long did a good job of assisting students personally through email.",

                "Honestly, one of the best courses I've taken as a mechanical engineer. Prof. Long went very in-depth with his lessons and provided extremely useful examples during lecture. Sad to see him go. Yale lost a great one."

                "I would not recommend this class.\r\n\r\nThis class isn't mentally taxing. Working on the assignments does not require full focus. However, the class is extremely time consuming. The problem sets start off easy and then ramp up in difficulty very quickly and stay very challenging the rest of the course. Some assignments would take three hours. Others would take fifteen hours. Expect some long nights.\r\n\r\nThe TAs are super useful and SolidWorks is a very fun program to learn. The design process can be satisfying and I definitely designed stuff out of class for fun. Marshall Long is a boring but very good and extremely nice professor.\r\n\r\nThe reason I do not recommend this class is it is useful if you are dead set on going into industry. Don't take it unless you are certain you want to design things. I found I didn't so this class wasn't for me. Yale prides itself in its liberal arts curriculum and this is probably one of the most pre-professional courses taught at the school.\r\n\r\nHonestly you could just teach yourself CAD in like a week. It truly is not that hard. Most engineers do exactly that. If you want a hard but interesting elective and would rather spare your brain by taking a time-sink class, do this. If not, don't. Seriously CAD is extremely easy to teach yourself.",

SolidWorks and CAD in general is an industry necessity and will greatly help you in any other project you may work on. Even if you don't use CAD or plan to use it, learning CAD gives you a better physical understanding of how machines and assemblies of parts come together and function.",
                "This course is amazing, probably my favorite course at Yale so far. It teaches so many useful skills in Solidworks and I felt like I learned a ton each lecture. It gives a great overview of Solidworks and also allows you to dive a little deeper into some aspects of the software too.",
                "I would recommend! It is a great elective for any engineering student in my opinion, and overall I felt the homeworks were reasonable and the workload was not bad at all until the final project, which I spent MANY hours on.",
