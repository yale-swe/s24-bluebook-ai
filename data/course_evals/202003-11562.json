Also, I feel much more comfortable giving feedback to my classmates--including critical comments. I had a rather light reading load this semester (this was my only reading-involved class) so I enjoyed the opportunity to go through each piece at a deeper level rather than just for content. Plus: Verlyn Klinkenborg's book (required by Shirkhani) is AMAZING and I loved reading about sentences as the basis for all writing.",
                "I learned the nuances in writing and strategies employed by writers to create certain effect. I also learned to see these in almost any piece I read, regardless of genre of essay. I became more critical of my own writing with the class.",

In particular, one important insight was a focus on writing at the sentence-level. Through different units, I learned about various strategies for writing in different essay genres. The most important resource in the class was our close reading of great essays by different writers, which we analyzed and discussed together from many different angles before writing and revising our own pieces. This class definitely helped to develop my skills as a writer, reader, and editor, but also as a speaker due to the discussion-centered format."

                "Strengths: Professor Shirkhani! She encourages students to guide the discussion with their insights\/reflection while nudging the discussion toward certain strategies\/topics if need be. I really loved this seminar style; I never felt pressured to speak, but I always wanted to! Also, it's amazing to hear your classmates' thoughts (everybody seems so insightful and intelligent). This class is very much shaped by the class dynamic. I'm thankful that Professor Shirkhani fosters an environment where people are loving, supportive, and hilarious while all feeling comfortable enough to critique and workshop each other's pieces. Workshopping each other's pieces is SO fun and it's such a good feeling to get multiple sets of eyes on your paper. The support from your classmates, Professor Shirkhani, and potentially other sources (i.e. writing tutors) won't ever let you fall through the cracks if you reach out when you're struggling. ---- \r\nWeaknesses: some units have consistently longer pieces that aren't quite as spaced out. This really isn't a big issue (the longest pieces are typically by David Foster Wallace and are ~20 pages) but the satire unit really blows every other unit out of the water. To all future students: the satire pieces are so much shorter and it is so refreshing! Almost wish that the satire unit was earlier in the semester to serve as a sort of break. Grading transparency is also a bit of a problem (this is a problem across all my classes this semester though) since we received letter grades (ex: B+\/A-) and it's hard to average without numbers. Even if I didn't really know what grade I had in the class though, this was by FAR my favorite course this semester. Strengths outweigh weaknesses by a landslide. Take this course if you have the chance!!",
                "The grading was in a way a weakness. It was not very clear how grades worked with the essays, it  could be clarified because at times I found it difficult to see what specifically was making my essay worse, and what I could do to make my essay better. \r\n\r\nStrengths were the content of the essays, insightful discussions and workshops, and I also found the pace to be fair.",
                "This was such an incredible class. All of the readings were so well chosen, I was always excited to do the readings for class which is pretty rare. Discussions were intentionally and effectively lead, and I felt like we really talked about a broad range of writing tools that will help me a lot inn the future. If anything, I would maybe appreciate a 15 minute brainstorming session before the first draft of each essay is due so we can help get started with our ideas, but other than that, this class is just incredible and I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: great energy, very detailed and helpful comments on writings, wonderful selection of reading material\r\nPotential improvements: more classtime discussing writing techniques may be beneficial",
                "Weaknesses: Sometimes we would not be able to discuss all the essays assigned for a given week due to lack of time. I can't think of any major weaknesses. Strengths: The discussion based format of the course was really helpful and facilitated interesting conversations on what makes good writing.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings and good questions asked by professor to keep discussion moving along.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had trouble keeping my attention on class in the virtual seminar format. Class WAY too political. Sometimes I had trouble following along with the writing lessons of the day.",
                "Strengths: strong sense of community, lots of feedback from the professor, a good number of assignments with adequate time for revision, good selection of works, not too much reading or writing (a balanced workload)\r\nWeaknesses: We often read pieces that we did not have time to discuss in class. I feel this is sort of a necessary evil because spending a good amount of time on each essay is what allowed us to delve deep into that piece, but I would perhaps recommend planning beforehand which pieces we really want to go over that day and budgeting a specific amount of time for that piece.",
                "One great strength of this course was its focus on student discussion. The seminar style, with the teacher stepping back and allowing students to work through their ideas, helped keep the class active and engaged. The prioritization of learning through reading and analysis rather than rules, guidelines, or lecture-type information was also very helpful. This made students absorb knowledge and use it creatively in their writing, instead of just memorizing or repeating lessons. A potential weakness of the course is the limited amount of writing activities; time is mostly divided between reading and talking about example essays and writing essays of one's own. More activities involving student writing could be helpful in practicing and applying skills learned at a smaller scale."

                "This class translated well over Zoom, although I'm sure it would've been even better in person. The small class size allows for everybody to fit on one Zoom screen (no toggling back and forth!) and I felt a lot closer to my classmates at the end of the course. There were some struggles with trying to figure out times to schedule draft meetings\/alternate meeting dates based around major events (ie Election Day). Screensharing is a handy feature on Zoom for office hours though! We didn't use the \"Raise Hand\" feature, but I'm not sure if I'd recommend that either. Prof. Shirkhani did a good job assigning speaking order if multiple people wanted to speak at once.",
                "With my peers our dialogue was very engaging so we didnt have a problem with the self-directed teaching style of the course. But with a less engaged group, that could be a problem.\r\n\r\nI felt very engaged in the topics and discussions and my own essay writing process.",

Our discussions worked just as well as they would have in person, and especially the use of the chat in our class worked really well for creating a cohesive classroom environment where discussion came naturally. We also had a few one-on-one calls with our professor to talk about our essays which worked well.",

                "Though slightly awkward at the beginning, the Zoom seminar format worked well for this course and I enjoyed it. I also appreciated that Professor Shirkhani set up Zoom draft meetings with us as well so we could gain more feedback on our writing.",
                "This course made great use of Zoom to enhance the learning environment, with features such as breakout rooms, and white-boarding. Additional virtual resources included google docs, which was used for draft editing and other collaborative activities. These tools were very helpful in making classwork engaging and interesting. Another Zoom feature that was often used in class was the virtual chat room. Although it was very useful in allowing for more class participation (and also made the class atmosphere much more fun and relaxed), occasionally it could become a source of distraction. To improve this feature, having set guidelines and times when the chat should or should not be used might be helpful."

                "YES!! Couldn't recommend this course enough, and take it with Professor Shirkhani if you get the chance. I have a hard time listing out specific things that I've learned, but the Yale English Department knows what it's doing. Without a specific way of articulating it, I feel like a much stronger reader and writer. I'd originally come into ENGL 120 fearing that I should've taken ENGL 114 for the sake of sharpening my academic writing. Glad to say I have zero regrets! If anyone's in the same dilemma (choosing between 114 and 120), don't hesitate to take 120!",
                "Yes! With a class full of other students engaged in discussion you can learn a lot about what makes an essay great. There is a lot of support if you need it with your own writing, and as long as youre interested and willing to put in the time to better your writing, its worth it. If you dont like writing though and reading essays to analyze literary techniques used to make a certain point, this isnt for you.",
                "Absolutely! I think every Yale student should take this class. Readings were interesting and often hilarious, discussions were engaging and dynamic, and the writing approaches and tools we learned really helped change me as a writer. As someone who really stresses out about writing, this class was a blessing.",

I'm not sure how long virtual classes will be going on, but I would almost recommend waiting to take this in person, because I have a feeling the sense of community would be really great.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys reading and writing and is interested in further developing their skills in a welcoming environment. The class readings were excellent, and enjoyable even outside of their educational value, and the class discussions about them were always exciting and intriguing. Writing, receiving and giving feedback was a great experience, as you are made to think in different ways about putting words on the page as well as also about yourself and the world around you. At the end of the course you will have produced pieces that you are proud of, and will have internalized knowledge about reading and writing that will be helpful in almost every field. It is definitely a course where you get out of it what you put into it, so students should expect a decent commitment and dedication to engaging in classwork, essay writing, and discussions."
