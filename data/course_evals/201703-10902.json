    "This was a lovely class, and I feel like it was a good representation of what classes will be like in graduate school. Taking this course gave me a better sense of where I want to go in the future, and gave me great practice with self-directed study and presentation skills.",
    "Learned a lot about different models and theory about learning\/information transmission\/rationality\/social learning\/networks.",
    "I developed more knowledge and insights than anything else.  The major takeaways from the papers\/presentations that illuminate human behavior are interesting enough to merit remembering on their own.  I didn't have any game theory background but managed the course just fine, even if my participation in discussions was stymied.  I learned a great deal about game theory, about mathematical proofs, and about economic papers and thinkers, and if that's the goal of the course, then I'd say well done.",
    "I learned to think more critically about asymmetrical information in Microeconomic Theory research, I learned about the general fields related to this, and about what kinds of seminal papers have advanced the field.",
    "How to read microeconomic theory papers, how to analyze all sorts of theoretical models."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You really get out of this course whatever you put in. I think that was both its core strength and its core weakness - it can be really rewarding if you choose papers and topics that genuinely interest you, but you won't be required to put in a lot of effort if you don't.",
    "Strengths: was really great to learn how to read dense literature and understanding the economic models and how they were proved. Mira was super super helpful and just a FANTASTIC teacher.\r\n\r\nWeakness: you could get by with not reading the papers you didn't present.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. Papers were all interesting. Workload not overwhelming at all. Mira is incredible.",
    "The format of the course went a long way to ensuring that students of all backgrounds were on even footing, but at the same time, opened the door to a level of disengagement.  It was also unclear how comfortable students were expected to be with the mathematical proofs and explaining them.",
    "The course isn't meant to be inaccessible -- that's the simpler way of saying that the workload and the academic rigor weren't necessarily very high. However, each student could determine their own level of engagement with the papers, and Mira did an excellent job guiding students' understandings and being there.",
    "Strengths - Mira made reading pretty theoretical papers doable, and was great at explaining any unclear concepts.\r\n\r\nImprovements - I felt like we could've gotten better feedback on our first presentations so we could improve for the second. Grading was harder the second time around, but we didn't know what we did wrong from the first.\r\n\r\nAlso, I feel like since there was no exam or cumulative check of knowledge, some of the class tuned out after they gave their presentation. Maybe some kind of written response to a presentation would have made that better."

    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It was an interesting, fun senior seminar with a lot of flexibility in terms of workload. If you put in the work, you'll come out of this course with a much better understanding of game theory and information economics, and a much stronger familiarity with theoretical papers and real economics research. The entire workload of this class was participation, two presentations, and a final project (for which you can either do a literature survey, or original research of your own). The course will be a really rewarding experience if you make sure your workload aligns with your interests.",
    "YES YES YES!!! be sure you are somewhat good at math though or you will struggle with the models lol",
    "Absolutely take this class if youre an Econ major. Mira is incredible and the papers are all very interesting. Highly recommend.",
    "If you're thinking about a 2nd semester thesis, doing grad school, or just like this aspect of Economics, find a way to take this class, particularly with Mira.",
    "GEM: I would most definitely recommend this course to any and all interested in: information Dynamics, game theory, a well taught economics course. Prof. Frick is a brain!!! She is has designed a course that encourages you to engage with the material without the typical needless confusion of stress of typical Yale economics courses. The class is straight forward and the professors reasonable. It is made up of two presentations on papers you select from a list, a term paper with a great degree of freedom\/flexibility, and class participation. The class will not kill you, but engaging with it critically will be well worth it.",
    "Would for sure recommend. A class that can help shape the way you look at issues in economics and the world more broadly. I learned a lot of things that I found cool and I find myself referring to a lot in several different contexts. Don't be intimated by the math, because you don't need any prior knowledge to understand the material of the course. And if at any point you feel like you want to understand better (because you're curious but not because you MUST) Mira is super open and happy to help. I love econ because i think it gives you a lens through which to look at the world and the issues you wish to solve, and this class adds to that exactly. Loved it, incredibly chill vibe, and overall enjoyable and fun.",
    "Fantastic course! Not too much work, super interesting material, and Prof. Frick was an endless source of insight and knowledge."
