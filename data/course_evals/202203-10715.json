                "Ive become way more comfortable with Spanish grammar. This class has taken a lot of the guess work out of speaking Spanish correctly. It took me from being able to communicate an idea to being able to actually say things in a normal way.",
                "deeper understanding of verbal tenses and moods, important themes of syntax and comprehension as well. more experience of gaining fluidity with language.",
                "I learned about grammatical conventions of Spanish, improved conversation skills by talking with a student from Ecuador, and improved my writing skills.",
                "particulars of grammar, go over basically everything with more detail (ser vs estar, preterite vs imperfect, pluscuamperfecto, verbs like gustar, direct and indirect complements, expressions of time, subjunctive, expressions of emotion, if clauses, reflexive pronouns, relative clauses, por vs para, adverbial clauses, reflexive verbs, passive voice, order and placement of adjectives, etc.)\r\n- also vocab and different ways of saying to ask, to become, to take, but, etc.",
                "I got much better at some basic fundamentals, such as using pronouns and knowing when to use the subjunctive. Learning sentence structures for everyday use was really helpful. As a Spanish course, it's also just helpful having to practice Spanish.",
                "My reading skills in particular grew significantly during this course. Before this course I had almost never read more than a paragraph at a time in Spanish, and now I am able to read stories and writings pretty quickly. I learned how to write much faster under timed conditions, and more importantly I learned how to be flexible when writing and look for different ways to express ideas when I didn't know a specific word. Additionally, this course really taught me how to manage my time out of class, as there were many different assignments given per week all with different due dates."

            "comments": [
                "Because there are a lot of assignments, I was practicing Spanish grammar almost everyday. There were a lot of assignments but they were never too hard or lengthy, so it felt very manageable, and the fact that I was thinking about Spanish so frequently ended up being really beneficial. While this was extremely helpful for my grammar, we did not need to speak that much in the actual classroom. A lot of the speaking was done with people in other countries over zoom, and that was great practice, but there was not much feedback and it was only once a week. However I understand that was not the main objective of the class and it made me feel more prepared to take another class that would help my speaking ability. It was a little frustrating when the class ran a couple minutes overtime, but Sra. Reymundi is impossible to dislike. I also never was able to find the slides on canvas - not sure if theyre actually there but it would have been really helpful because she went through them quickly during class.",
                "strength was consistent practice and supportive classroom environment, weakness is heavy course load that at times felt overwhelming even if some exercises were helpful",
                "This class is very difficult. I'm not sure there's much you can do to avoid the difficulty level, that's just the nature of the class. The speaking exercises were a huge strength to this class. I loved doing lingua meet again and talking with my speaking partner in Ecuador. That was my favorite part of the class. I think sometimes we were overwhelmed by the amount of assignments due in one night though. There were a LOT of assignments in this class. Too many in my opinion.",
                "Strengths: the teacher, the amount of practice, will learn a lot, the classroom environment.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there is so much work that you take shortcuts and learn less than if you had less work if that makes sense, and the weekly office hours are at an inconvenient time.",
                "Class size is a plus. All of the homework led to me cutting corners and not getting as much out of each assignment as I could have had there been less work to complete in relatively short amounts of time.",
                "The strengths of this course is definitely the huge growth I experienced in such a short amount of time. There are many different formats of homework, whether worksheets, writings, textbook work, online quizzes etc, that all encouraged me to learn the material inside and out as well as review and stay fresh on all my past subjects.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the inflexibility of the due dates of the online quizzes. And although it was all helpful, there was quite a lot of work at times."

You will gain the ability to express so much more, sound a lot smarter when you speak and write, and understand other people more easily. It is a really well structured class so you will become a lot more comfortable with the language.",
                "yes to really drill in conventions and technical skills. it felt tough which was not always enjoyable but worth it to see improvements in skill",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to improve Spanish fluency, particularly if you want to do the Spanish Certificate. If you just need an L5 class, take an easier one. This class is very very hard, but if you work at it your fluency will improve significantly.",
                "Yes, the professor is great and you will learn a lot about Spanish. The only thing is that this class does have a good amount of work associated with it. You will get out what you put into it.",
                "Yes, it's a good class to take. It's just a lot of work.",
                "Yes. In terms of sole grammatical improvement, anyone who is looking for it is guaranteed to find it. But to me personally, the far more important part of the course was its exposure to the unique storytelling style of Spanish culture. I learned so much about Latin America and Spain's unique cultures, their reactions to the tumultuous periods of their histories, and the different means of expressing their ideas and opinions through stories."
