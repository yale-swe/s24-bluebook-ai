                "I developed skills to read research papers at a decent level as I had no prior research experience. I was introduced to many foundational concepts of cancer and exposed to the history and development of cancer research. I gained critical thinking skills to discuss potential treatments for future cancer developments.",
                "So much knowledge. A lot of material covered quickly but the organization of the class made it easily attainable.",
                "I learnt a lot about cancer, carcinogenesis and the various therapies that can cure cancer,",
                "A survey course, we covered all of the key topics related to cancer including pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.",
                "This course effectively provided a big-picture view of cancer and its biological mechanisms. I am more knowledgeable about how different cancers develop and behave. This course also focused on the skill of reading and understanding scientific papers along with presenting papers to the class. Designing creative and accurate biological experiments is another major takeaway from the course. Finally, the writing assignments in this course aim to improve our ability to write effective, scientific papers.",
                "I learned so much about not just the current state of our understanding of cancer, but how we refined our knowledge over time through observations and experiments. I also learned how to read scientific papers more efficiently, present more clearly, and write a grant proposal.",
                "I learned a lot of cancer biology, how to read scientific literature, interpret graphs, interpret data, interrogate methodologies, and write my own grant proposal (which meant writing up an abstract, hypothesis, experiment, alt. strategies, and expected results) from scratch.",
                "I definitely improved in reading scientific papers and just becoming more familiar with the scientific\/experimental methods that are often used in medical research. I definitely learned a lot about collaborating in a scientific setting and doing discussions about research papers.",
                "This first year seminar is a great introduction to the biology of cancer, including several genes that play important roles in cancer and the overall scope of cancer treatment and prevention. The class is organized in a way that encourages group work, asking questions, and coming up with new ideas. The papers discussed in the class are very helpful for developing skills in reading scientific papers, and the final grant proposal is an excellent opportunity to improving scientific writing skills."

                "I was assigned to a group that I worked with on a weekly basis to complete the PSets. The class is also very tight knit and cooperative, which allowed students to learn from each other as we all had different backgrounds and experiences in research and cancer knowledge. The class has a steep initial learning curve; however, it is very eye-opening because we worked with content that have direct applications to our lives. The return in investment is also huge in that you learn a lot in a short period of time. Feedback on assignments was also very clear.",
                "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt a little discouraged by just how smart my classmates were but that is my own fault.",
                "The course is structured well.",
                "I enjoyed the structure of the course where one lecture a week is dedicated to learning material and the other lecture was spent on paper presentations which enhanced the lecture material. This structure is a strength as students can see the course material appear in real-world scientific findings. I found the Pset structure to be another strength. Group collaboration was encouraged and necessary to tackle these Psets. There are no notable weaknesses to this course. Course structure, content, and grading were all fair.",
                "Dean Chang is an extremely engaging teacher and is able to teach from experience for many of the topics such as his research on telomeres. I also think it is great how he brings in topics that are newer to the field and discusses the potential impact, such as with CRIPSR. He would also always encourage out-of-the-box thinking during class discussions and on psets, which really helps me not just learn the material, but actually apply it. I really can't think of a weakness!",
                "Strengths: class size, camaraderie, NYC trip!!!, the people, the PSETs are group-based so it's very collaborative, the teaching (Dean Chang is an incredible lecturer and his genuine love for oncology shines through), the cadence (very consistent class structure). Weaknesses: steep learning curve at first, you must put in good effort, might be a bit overwhelming in the beginning but it gets much better once you get the hang of it. It is also fun because we get to do a lot of fun group-based activities like jeopardy and presentations.",
                "I can only think about strengths for this course. This class had a very strong sense of community and the curriculum was structured perfectly. I loved Dean Chang's teaching and his lectures were always so intriguing. I can really tell he wants his students to succeed and thrive. The course material was so interesting and was perfect in its level of depth.",
                "In this course, you learn a lot, but it is a LOT of work, so be prepared for that. It's definitely something that breaks you down to build you back up. But if you've got the mental capacity for that, it'll be massive advantage for anyone hoping to go into anything biology related."

                "This course is a challenge, but I would definitely recommend to those who have an interest in biology and\/or any other sciences areas of study. This was the most engaging and intellectually enjoyable class that I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes anyone interested in medicine.",
                "Yes, this was the type of class where the time flies by because you have so much fun and are so engrossed in the material.",
                "Yes! This course is difficult and stressful at times, but the material is all interesting, especially for pre-med students or students wishing to go into biology or research. You do develop a broad range of skills. Expect to spend a large part of your weekends working with group members on the problem sets as they take a lot of time and effort. Additionally, Dean Chang does an excellent job of facilitating a community within the seminar offering many fun opportunities for class bonding. For first-year students seeking a summer fellowship, this course is definitely one to consider as Dean Chang provides much help and guidance.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students if they are interested in life sciences or research. It was definitely a lot of work, but it was also very enjoyable and rewarding work. I learned a lot of knowledge of cancer and skills useful in research like reading papers, presenting, and writing a grant proposal. Dean Chang always made the lectures engaging with interesting discussions and jeopardy test reviews. These discussions made this class one that I always looked forward to every week. Dean Chang is also extremely approachable and is always willing to talk after class to go over the material or other academic topics. We also took a class trip that was a very good class-bonding experience and was very fun overall.",
                "100% would recommend if you are lucky enough to get a spot! I didn't realize how little I knew about engaging with scientific literature until I began taking this class and I will never look at scientific literature the same. The content is fascinating but I would recommend that a strong biology background (AP Bio) is a good foundation to have before taking this class. If you are looking to have an intimate STEM first-year seminar, this has got to be the one. The teaching is incredible (idk how Dean Chang knows so much stuff) and there will definitely be a lot of friends made through this class. You will, however, need to be willing to get out of your comfort zone in terms of being extroverted enough to participate and engage in the class (asking questions, answering question) but the lectures are very rich so this should come easily!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in doing research or interested in the pre-med track. This class was such a great introduction to the field of cancer biology and medical research in general.",
                "I would, but with some caution. It's extremely interesting, and you'll learn a ton of biology, both theory and experimental practicals. Learning to read research papers is also a huge plus. However, the work can be absolutely debilitating at times, so I'd recommend this if someone has a ton of free time, or is taking easier classes alongside.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, absolutely! I will recommend this class to any student that is interested in biology or medicine at all. It is an excellent class that will help you learn so much, not just about cancer biology, but also about reading and writing scientific texts. Dean Chang has a great sense of humor and is willing to help you with questions on biology or medical school. The class trip to NYC was also a highlight of the semester. The class is quite challenging, though  you will need a relatively robust background in biology and you will have to put in the effort to really understand what youre learning and ask lots of questions. But as long as you and your group work together and seek help from each other or Dean Chang when you encounter problems, this class is insanely rewarding!"
