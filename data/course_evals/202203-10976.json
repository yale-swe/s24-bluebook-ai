It felt like a workshop class where you brought in projects and ideas to showcase which then were discussed in the classroom. So, much of the knowledge was also from the insight of my classmates. In all, a fair range from technical knowledge (DAWs, etc.) and analysis (terminology/vocabulary, etc.) to more conceptual and emotional expression.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the sound design profession and the techniques involved, gained really cool skills in the kind of technical and artistic close-listening that a sound designer has to do, and insights into the many different ways of thinking about and making sound through lectures, sound studies readings, and hands-on projects.",

                "Some strengths include: the format of the classroom--it feels very collaborative and discussion based, the workload, Nathan's discussion and instruction, the assignments were really cool, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we get caught up in discussing material/homework and we can fall behind schedule--Nathan had planned for this but we still fell even beyond his estimation, we didn't get to work with larger speaker systems than standard stereo systems, none of it actually takes place in the theater.\r\n\r\nOther note: Due to the format of the class, how exciting the class experience is is almost entirely dependent on the engagement of everybody.\r\n\r\nto be improved: I think the more collaborative assignments the better because a great asset of the class is the knowledge and experience that other students bring to the table and if there were more collaboration it'd be easier to exchange that knowledge, I also think some of the readings can be a little more relevant to the assignments--the readings felt relevant just not applicable in that very moment.",
                "This is an amazing and fun course, with tons of opportunities to share your own musical work and bring topics to discussion/workshop. I felt like the course gave me a much clearer grasp of the\r\nart, science, and business of sound designing and composing. The class, as the name \"conceptual sound design\" indicates, doesn't go much into engineering, and although I do wish that we had spent more time on engineering concepts in the theater space, I think the ultimate solution would be for there to be a sister class focused on sound engineering. Besides that point, I gained a ton from the class and thought that  the round-table format and the emphasis  on workshopping as a vehicle to naturally bring us to important topics were special strengths of the course and should be replicated in more creative music classes!",
                "Lots of different assignments, where one is able to develop many different aspects of their work.",
                "Strengths: Projects meant lots of opportunities to gain practical experience/skills. Always got tons of feedback on work. Weaknesses: More doing than showing how to do, people with preexisting skillsets had a big advantage, and 4 hours per week could sometimes feel too long."

                "For sure! It's a class where you get the opportunity to make material and I think that's a great opportunity. I found the assignments exciting to me, so I rarely felt like I was doing boring work.\r\n\r\nIt's surprisingly emotion-based, that is to say we try to put a finger to and/or express more abstract notions/ideas and emotions. I think this is a great asset.\r\n\r\nDon't take the class as a gut, the class size is so small and that disinterest can really be seen and felt.",
                "If you're a creative person, you have a lot  to gain from this course. Nathan gears a lot of the content to the sound designer role/profession, so you'll be well-prepared to go into the Yale Theater world and design a show, but I also gained a lot as someone interested in sound and composing more generally. If you're looking for a practical crash course in sound *engineering* this is not the right class, unfortunately, \r\nbut the class did demystify fundamentals like speaker placement and microphone techniques for me.",
                "Yes. It is absolutely useful for anyone in the arts  dance, theater, music, etc. It is applicable for all mediums and challenges you to explore new avenues.",
                "If you are interested in developing skills as a composer or sound designer, definitely. There was a big range in experience in this class which sometimes made it pretty overwhelming (some people were really really good at this!!), but I feel like I was able to grow. You really do need to have some sort of passion, though. If composing and designing does not come naturally, it can be difficult to pull a lot of these projects out of thin air."
