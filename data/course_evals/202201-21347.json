(I will continue to learn about rhythm, but from a musician rather than academic perspective). In light of this, I probably would recommend my past self to take a different class. This said, I think my ability to perceive and generate rhythm has improved. If I had unlimited time/classes, I would at least shop Music 416 (advanced version of this class, also with Professor Cohn); since my classes are limited, I almost certainly will not.\r\nOther people might have different takeaways, and perhaps even now are writing about how excited they are to take Music 416."
