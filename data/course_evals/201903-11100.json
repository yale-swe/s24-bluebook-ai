   "comments": [
    "Through this course, I learned how to documents relating to medicine and the slave trade from that era in world history. As someone who came into this class with little knowledge about the course material, Professor Robert's class taught me so much about the ways that the slave trade was justified using medical reasoning, and the ways in which African medicine was appropriated by Europeans.",
    "How to read historical scholarly work critically, how to synthesize primary source evidence in writing, how to conduct historical research ethically and thoughtfully",
    "I developed a new set of analytical skills for thinking about writing histories of the marginalized. I found that in this class, we often went beyond discussing the readings; because of the time period and topic, we often ended up delving into historiography, which I haven't found in other Yale history courses.",
    "Dr. Roberts is amazing and so knowledgeable and thoughtful, and the students provide great insights as well.",
    "This is the best course I've taken in my entire time at Yale. Not only did I learn about what It means to be in a healthy seminar environment where the focus is on inquiry, but we also learned so much about a deeply important topic. We delved into the slave trade and learned about the role of historians in dealing with trauma and then learned about the trauma of the slave trade itself. This course is important and deeply wonderful.",
    "Thinking about medicine through a lens that does not focus primarily on the European and white findings and discoveries, but rather on minorities and those that truly have brought different forms of knowledge to the medical fields. I learned to appreciate narratives, especially those that are often silenced or put in the back seat when studying primary sources.",
    "learned about how race was conceived during the early modern period, medical challenges in the middle passage, how to structure historical arguments, what is politically at stake in how we engage with the archive on slavery, how to focus on the voices of the enslaved when using the often very problematic primarysources",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale. I learned so much about meanings of race and healing not only in this time period, but also the reverberations from the slave trade that still very much affect those meanings today. It is an essential course for anyone who wants to do anything remotely related to medicine. I am not a history major, but I even appreciated the discussions we had in class about how to write history. This class made me think more interdisplinarily in a way that no other course has challenged me to do."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus for the course was incredible--Professor Roberts included readings that were meant to be criticized and readings that were meant to contextualize, allowing us to discuss both in the classroom. She did a great job of balancing her \"mini-lectures,\" designed to increase our understanding of the topics, while also making sure that we were all heard from in class. She truly cares about her students and what they have to say, and this was absolutely clear throughout the course.",
    "The major strength is Professor Roberts, who made for such a welcoming class atmosphere. The readings were thoughtfully assigned and organized in an intentional way from week to week. The assignments built upon each other really well--the primary source analysis (and the amazing feedback we received on it) helped us carry out our research for our final research papers.\r\n\r\nHonestly, no weaknesses.",
    "This course's biggest strength is most definitely Professor Roberts. She is simply a joy to learn from! She maintained an excellent balance between offering contextual information for the readings and listening intently to the questions, concerns, and insights of students. She holds high standards for her students while being generous with positive, encouraging, and SPECIFIC feedback. Lastly, the care and passion that she brings to the course is very inspiring! Professor Roberts is also devoted to teaching her students how to write well, which I really appreciated. This course really stood out in that Professor Roberts included many helpful resources to aid students with the assignments. The reading load was also manageable! Lastly, I found the weekly reading responses very helpful in engaging with the sometimes difficult material.",
    "Strength: Dr. Roberts is an absolutely fantastic instructor. Even though the material was difficult, she spent a great deal of time making sure we could understand it. \r\nWeakness: sometimes it felt like class discussions were going in circles. Because of the seminar format, the discussion is very student led but I sometimes wished Dr. Roberts provided more of a framework for what we should be discussing.",
    "Dr. Roberts is THE BEST",
    "There is literally not a single weakness to this course. Professor Roberts is so wonderful in facilitating the discussion. She spends time with her students and gives detailed and helpful feedback. All of the assignments feel fair and important, and nothing is busy work. The material is dealt with so respectful and deeply to facilitate learning and growth. AMAZING class.",
    "The best professor I have ever had the privilege and honor of learning from. Also, the material is well chosen and strongly supports what we talk about in class.",
    "strength is professor roberts who is so knowledgable on issues of race and medicine within the early modern period and after, shes also incredibly kind and juts a great person to learn from. very manageable amount of readings",
    "Strengths: excellent mix of primary and secondary sources as readings, a challenging, but fulfilling set of assignments, excellent facilitation of discussions"

    "Absolutely take this course if you can. Professor Roberts is the best professor that I have ever had at Yale, and any class with her is bound to be incredible. Her engagement with the course material is incredibly clear, and her desire for the course to be conducive to student learning is also evident. Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer and seminar leader, and I am so grateful that I have been able to take this course.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You learn an incredible amount about medicine and slave trade, but also so much about writing, primary source analysis, and historical scholarship that will undoubtedly be applicable in the future especially if you aim  to go into this kind of work. Discussions were so deep and it was so  incredible to see the way everyone thought in a slightly different way. The class was so diverse in academic background, which really made for wonderful discussion.",
    "yes! professor roberts is incredible! what a great opportunity",
    "Yes! Absolutely! If you engage with the material and pick a research topic that you're passionate about, you will probably get a lot out of this course! MORE YALE HISTORY COURSES NEED TO BE TAUGHT LIKE THIS.",
    "Yes, Dr. Roberts is THE BEST.",
    "I would 100%. Professor Roberts is the best professor at Yale.",
    "YES YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS! Its truly the best class I've taken in my time at Yale. Professor Roberts is incredible and the material is vital to learn and grapple with. It's truly an amazing experience.",
    "Yes. Anything with Professor Roberts is guaranteed to be amazing.",
    "yes absolutely. professor roberts is incredible. interesting readings. even if you arent in the major, interesting to critically engage with historical sources from the early modern period.",
    "Absolutely. If you can get into this class, you should take it. Professor Roberts cares so deeply about her students and their learning that is impossible to not come away with an immense about personal and academic growth.  The class discussions were some of the best I've had at Yale. The material made me rethink historical narratives and current conceptualizations of medicine. This is a NECESSARY course for anyone who wants to go into medicine."
