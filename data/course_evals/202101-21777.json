                "I learned how to compare representations of the underworld across cultures and time periods, pulling out those characteristics of the underworld that reflect universal human values. I realized that representations of the underworld are often metaphorical rather than literal in nature. I learned how to engage with the moral and philosophical questions surrounding death.",
                "I learned discussion skills, including both leading and participating in discussions. I also improved analysis of interesting literature, and my writing skills through a midterm and final essay.",
                "In addition to learning the specific material and details about the views of various cultures, I was able to place them in conversation and follow certain threads throughout history. We covered topics ranging from minor details to broad philosophical ideologies and engaged deeply with all of them. Throughout the course, my writing skills improved as well as my ability to converse with my peers in a zoom format in a productive and interesting way. The conversations I had in this class were some of the best in my time at Yale, and I deeply valued my interactions with the other students and the professor, and cared about our analysis of the texts in front of us.",
                "Although this course had a heavy discussion focus, I also found writing the midterm, post-discussion, and final papers to be a unique and instructive experience, given I had never before been asked to write essays with my own voice instead of a dry, academic tone. I've come out of the course with a grasp on how to write a paper that interweaves textual analysis with relating personal feelings, thoughts, and histories. I also appreciated getting to lead a discussion in an open seminar format, and coordinating with a discussion partner on crafting questions that could address the whole of a long and complicated work. \r\nI also gained a much better understanding of how different cultures, across different times, in very different circumstances treated the subject of death in their plays, their novels, their poetry, and so on. It was refreshing to get non-Western perspectives from Tibet and Japan, and chilling (but deeply necessary for us to reckon with, especially in today's cultural-political climate) narratives of slaves' encounters with death and its lingering consequences generations later. It's also fascinating to see how plays about death, from Persians to Our Town and Everybody, have evolved over time. Seeing how stories about death change shape based on medium and genre was also a valuable learning experience.",
                "This course offers the opportunity to explore different depictions of the Underworld spanning wide geographic and chronological limits. Professor Dorfman taught this course on a very human level. We engaged with the texts on an artistic, emotional, and rational level. I was able to think about my own experience as a human in this class while improving my analysis abilities. Papers were critiqued for their depth above all."

                "The strengths of this course were the frequent guest speakers and a diverse and engaging selection of materials in multiple different forms of media. The course stands out from other seminar courses in that it covers a single theme throughout human history instead of a specific time period and location. The chronological ordering of the course materials helped me develop an understanding of how representations of the underworld evolved over time. The workload was very manageable and the essays were open-ended and exploratory. The syllabus could benefit from a greater time allotted to non-Western representations of the underworld, which we only spent 1 week discussing.",
                "This class was amazing. The topics were all so fascinating, and even though each literature was tied to the concept of the underworld, each story taught me so much new stuff and it never got boring. I also loved the casual discussion format of each class!",
                "This class prompted deeply engaging and valuable conversations. Despite the early mornings, I was struck by how continually impactful and thoughtful group discussions were. I genuinely can't think of a weakness of the course that is not simply a function of zoom classes and early Monday mornings.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Insightful, broad range of texts (including film, nonfiction, and theater)\r\n- Wonderful discussions; contributions from art students and guest speakers were brilliant. I have no complaints at all with the course format\r\n- Engaging assignments; unique essay format (and I think it is incredibly useful for students to learn how to write academic papers that aren't in a dry, academic style. It broadens writing capabilities; and, if you're interested in writing about serious subjects using serious analysis for an audience that isn't a bunch of fellow academics, it's vital to develop a writing style that can reach out to a general audience)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- no hadestown (I'm sorry, I just heard that the last year of students got to go see Hadestown as a field trip and I became very jealous. Hadestown is a fantastic and brilliant musical and I love how it expresses the underworld as an industrial hellscape! What a poignant and moving retelling of the Orpheus tale, of which I have seen many. Hadestown stands out as the best of them all)."

The museum visit was fascinating and more successful than anticipated, as we got to speak to experts on the artwork and see it in great detail with a high quality camera. I think generally 2 hour seminars are difficult over Zoom, but the five minute breaks helped with breaking up the time.",

I don't know why we had to register for these meetings?\r\n- Meetings were listed not only for Mondays when we actually had classes but also for Fridays",
