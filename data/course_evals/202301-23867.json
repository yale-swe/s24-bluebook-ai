I also learned to apply themes from DS literature texts to modern-day problems and ideas.",

One aspect for improvement is that I wish we could have spent some more time with certain texts. Some texts we only had about a day or so of class time to cover (as opposed to the usual two days), and not only did the lack of time make review for the exam more difficult, but it also made our engagement with the texts feel less fulfilling.",

                "The strength of this course is its reading list: I firmly believe that everybody at Yale should read some if not all of the books on the reading list, and I certainly have discovered multiple classic novels and literature which will forever remain on my bookshelf. Additionally, the seminar format promoted discussion and various interpretations or focuses on different aspects of the text. However (and this is a general problem with all of DS), the extremely fast pace of DS prevents the sort of in-depth conversation and analysis of a text that I believe each text warrants, but this is a problem inherent with the nature of Directed Studies as a survey course."

The reading list for spring semester DS literature is really stellar, and it explores a wide expanse of themes and perspectives. Professor Spitz was really welcoming and made our class feel like a family, encouraging us to share our personal experiences and connecting them to the literature that we read.",

However, I would stress that students should be very interested in the subject matter and have the time and commitment to make the most out of this class, as it is certainly not an easy courseload."
