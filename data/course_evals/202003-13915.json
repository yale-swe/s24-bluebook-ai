                "Seeing as it was all through zoom, it was difficult to grasp the concepts.  Weaknesses are that each week we would learn something new and the quiz due for that week would be about material learned the week before, which kind of messes with one's head. Absolutely loved the mastery based grading but some HAMs were judged harshly without any explanation.",
                "The professor of this class was kind of confusing and I feel like I could have gained much more with a different set up of the class. Though the mastery based grading made the class easier, it felt like I wasn't really learning, more just doing assignments to meet the masteries. And I felt like the lectures in the class did not correlate with the content of the psets and the HAMS and I usually did not do good on the HAMS when others would with similar work. I jsut felt like lecture did not help me really at all in class.",
                "I actually like the way the class was run. I think the quizzes every week along with the HAMS were good ways to assess mastery throughout the semester",
                "My professor was very nice and accommodating. I wouldnt say he had any weaknesses.",
                "The system in which this course worked was quite beneficial in my opinion, with videos to watch with a small pre-class assignment before having the lecture which enabled us to understand and be exposed to new topics before going into class. This system gives us the opportunity to ask all questions we have about new topics to our professor and to our peers in the class. The mastery-based grading system works pretty well too as it makes the course less stressful and relies less on exams and we have multiple chances to do well on the different topics of the course. However, this grading system is relatively difficult to understand at first and some students were confused as to how they would be graded until the end of the course. However, once if you carefully read the whole syllabus and introduction to the course you should be able to understand how the course works and if you pay a minimum of attention and complete all the assignments you will do well in the course.",
                "I had no clue who the teaching fellows were and never made contact with a single one, the course instructors seemed lost the entire semester and as though they had just as many questions as the students did, there was zero engagement in my classes",
                "In-class instruction is very strong. My teacher explained how to do every type of problem. I would say it was not the most engaging class, however.",

                "The weekly study halls were a huge help however, learning through zoom was not the same as online and uncomfortable because it was basically a lecture. Professors went really fast.",
                "I wish we had a different structure for lecture. We did not really learn how to do lots of stuff on the psets and the pre class assignments did not align with the content of lecture that day. We watched one Khan academy video for a pre class assignment instead of one of the professor made ones, and I felt like that was the most I had understood a topic.",
                "Allowing the professor to write out the notes and problem solve in class was helpful, however breakout rooms were often silent and awkward. It would have been better if we could have stayed in the main room",

                "I don't think there was an area I could have improved in the context of Covid-19. The use of breakout rooms in lectures were quite efficient but I think it would be better to enforce cameras on (except for people who really can't of course).",
                "The virtual lectures were uninteresting and I rarely found myself able to pay attention. The pre-class assignments were a joke and never once learned anything from the 20 second snippet and follow up questions. The only grading in the course was based off a two question HAM (problem set like assignment) and a two question quiz due at the end of each week. Nothing really worked very well and I did not learn much.",

The mastery based grading system also lets you keep track of what topics you still need to master over the course of the semester and you have many opportunities to do so. As long as a you pay a bit of attention in class and complete assignments, you should be able to do well in the course without too much difficulty.",
