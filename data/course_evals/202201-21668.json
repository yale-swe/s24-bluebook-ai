The downside to that is that it felt like everything was sandwiched into one semester, so it was hard to relate the importance of most of what was taught to the rest of the education we have received."

He is incredibly kind and understanding, but also has a lot of valuable industry insight that is somewhat lacking in the ChemE courses. The problem sets and midterms were more than fair. The course material moved very quickly and could be hard to grasp, but the project highlighted the important parts of the material. The project was interesting, and Dr. Khalil gave ample feedback throughout the process. He really wants everyone in the course to enjoy it and do well.",
