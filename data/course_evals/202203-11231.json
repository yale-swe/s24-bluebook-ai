            "comments": [
                "strengths: professor Nilay really cared and tried to get to know us\r\nweaknesses: grading is odd with being always compared to each other",
                "the material is not organized in a manner that makes much sense. some of the topics jump around and it's confusing why we are taught in the order that we are now. with that being said, i think the material we learn is useful and gives us a good general idea of chemistry.",
                "The strengths were that the lectures were recorded and notes were posted after class, so if you didn't understand something that was said in lecture, you could go back and review it later when preparing for the midterms. The weakness of the course was that sometimes things were not explained very clearly, and the pace was very fast, so we could not really take a moment and have the professor re-explain something that was said in lecture. Instead, we always had to ask the TFs or peer tutors after class, which was fine, but the class could be improved by having a few moments each lecture to slow down and have questions answered.",
                "strengths: lectures posted online, lots of opportunities to practice problems, lots of resources like office hours and assignments to help you, generous curve, good level of challenge\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures aren't posted on canvas until friday so easy to get behind on material, lectures boring at times",
                "Strengths: overall ok,\r\nWeaknesses: big lecture, relatively stale content, psets were composed of many questions that were exactly the same, only with different numbers.\r\n\r\nALSO DONT MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR THE PLATFORM THEY NEED TO SUBMIT THEIR HOMEWORK!",
                "The lectures were generally good, but they could be better. While Professor Hazari is a wonderful teacher and a great human being, I found the lecture format difficult to follow. Rather than writing out all of the notes in real time, the instructor could come with pre-made slides and clarify them by speaking or answering questions. This would also make it easier to understand things in some of the more visual/3D aspects of chemistry. Definitely attend office hours (for your TF and for Prof Hazari) if you can!",
                "Some of the questions on the problem sets were not covered in class. I think that it would help if the instructor made it clear what things we are supposed to know so that we could prepare adequately for any problem sets.",
                "Strengths: I mean, Nilay was good at providing the concepts that we had to know briefly through the notes. There were practice exams that were basically a similar layout to the actual midterms. \r\nWeaknesses: Most of the weaknesses can be inferred from my previous response. You don't really learn chem. You'll have to dedicate a lot of time to self-learning and studying. Be on top of your time management and always go the extra mile when preparing for exams.",
                "The way that information was conveyed was helpful especially because it was also posted in notes in case you missed something in class/missed class. Sometimes topics were confusing though and because of the format of the lecture there was not always time to explain/clarify it.",
                "Strength: Nilay is a very sociable and approachable chemistry professor, you will learn this from the first day of the lecture. There is a lot of ways to get extra help.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures were engaging however sometimes went too fast. The review sessions for this course were a hit or miss. Some were very helpful (Sadie's were the best) but others were complicated because they would not be helpful as.",
                "The professor was amazing. His teaching style was both engaging and informative. Given that it is a lecture, students at the front tend to engage more with the professor but that is ultimately based on the individual student's decisions.",
                "Nilay was an excellent teacher and made class entertaining and insightful. At times, it felt like we went too in depth for a first-year gen chem class and were expected to know too much. (This sentiment was shared by TFs.)",
                "Strengths: psets were forgiving. Weakness: 3 midterm system",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot of material and the TFs are very good. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes (especially with things that you have to memorize), students are not given much guidance about what to memorize and what to not focus on.",
                "Overall, it's a difficult class because of how much content there is and the fast pace, however with the three exams, final, and homework, the grade is balanced (although heavily relies on tests, at least there is multiple opportunities to improve)",
                "Nilay tries his best to make dry material interesting and offers surprise perks for showing up to lecture. Grading is fair with the significant curve, but don't expect to feel confident on the exams. It often takes significant individual effort to learn the material that will be tested given that some concepts are discussed very briefly in lecture.",
                "Strengths - The way Nilay teaches is really straight forward and even if you don't understand something in class, you will understand it through the PSETs. Weaknesses - Why is there a midterm a week before the final ?? :( Also, some of the exams have unnecessarily tricky questions.",
                "Strength-- good foundations of chemistry; nilay did a good job of engaging the class despite the content often being basic\r\n\r\nWeakness-- n/a",
                "There is sooooo much chem to learn, and a whole lot of it happens in Gen Chem 161. At the end, I felt like I was running out of storage space to retain the dump of information that I learned. \r\nI think there could be more ways to practice the equations beyond Achieve. I didnt find the additional questions from the textbook incredibly helpful, so maybe some other source would help.",
                "I really appreciated that the lectures were recorded and the notes were available online. I don't think much could be done to improve the class.",
                "The strengths of this course are its passionate teaching staff. The weaknesses of the course are its fast pace and large class size. This course could be improved by creating smaller lecture sizes.",
                "I think it was overall very good.",
                "Some weaknesses of this course is the lack of online resources to study or relearn material outside of class. Overall though it was a good course.",
                "I thought the course was great! I enjoyed lectures and problem sets.",
                "This course was very well organized, had a lot of support, and a lot of resources. I didnt have any major qualms with the class! For a Gen chem pre req, it was probably the best you could get. The exams were a little brutal, sometimes, though",
                "Achieve was a very helpful tool, very helpful TAs\r\n\r\nPractice exams were not completely reflective of actual exams although we were told they would be",
                "I personally found the handwritten notes to not be very helpful. I found that I had to look to outside resources to explain the material properly.",
                "Very engaging material. Good use of demonstration",
                "Professor Hazari was an engaging lecturer and always made sure to try and bring our class topics into practical life.  I would have liked more practice problems outside of class and problem sets.",
                "strengths: there are many resources for review, there is a lot of support from peer tutors, TAs, and Nilay Hazari, the lecturer, \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it moves very fast so we learn content that won't be on the midterm before it has passed and it is easy to get behind, pretty challenging class regardless of your background in chemistry",
                "The strengths of this class is that it teaches what you need to know about Chemistry. The weakness is the level of the midterm compared to  the practice midterms and finals.",
                "Strengths: the course was very well-organized, moderate work-load, and there were several support systems (peer-tutoring, TA office hours, professor office hours) in place to ask for help. Problem sets were reasonable in difficulty and helped to reinforce information taught in class. \r\nWeaknesses: the course was fast-paced at times.",
                "Definitely learned chemistry, however it was very fast paced as someone who did not take AP chemistry",
                "The strength was that it was taught by a very knowledgeable professor. The weakness was that it was a very large lecture.",
                "This course is very good at providing students with a strong foundation in chemistry. Helpful feedback is provided for every question of the P-Sets, and good support is provided to students through TF office hours and additional practice problems with answer keys. I felt that the course was taught in a peculiar order, for acid-base and redox reactions were covered before we had learned the structure of and interactions between the molecules involved in these reactions, but all worked out in the end.",
                "This course moved really fast, which I think could be improved with classes being held for a little bit longer.",
                "I wish the class was twice a week of a longer lecture than three times a week or a shorter lecture.",
                "Nilay writes all of the notes in OneNote, so you are able to listen to the material during lecture and do your studying after lectures. Expectations were set out clearly at the beginning of the semester. All of the TFs are really helpful. \r\n\r\nIt can be hard to realize in a lecture so large that others are also struggling, so go to office hours and ask for help when you need it.",
                "weakness: hazari",
                "This course was taught extremely well, with high engagement for a lecture class. However, the tests could have been crafted more carefully. Additionally, there were many times when content was briefly mentioned and not well elaborated on making it hard to understand and build off of.",
                "One major strength was the balance of note-taking and demonstrations; it was a balance of work and play. \r\n\r\nI dont really see many weaknesses, besides the homework platform we had to use. It had a lot of errors that did not match the material we learned it class.",
                "I really loved the real-world applications the Professor gave us during each topic. However, I felt the class was too fast paced.",
                "Some strengths of the votes were that the professor was very passionate and approachable, especially for a very large lecture. However, one weakness is that even though this is the lowest level chemistry course offered at Yale and is said to be accessible for students with no chemistry experience, this class moves very quickly and honestly you do kind of need somewhat of a background in chemistry to well in the course. I also feel like a weakness of this course is that so much of students experiences depends on their discussion sections, and the quality/helpfulness of the TAs varies greatly.",
                "Strength: The professor is very engaging and goes out of his way to make this class entertaining for students. He posts online lectures and copies of his notes, which we can review if needed. The psets are forgiving and challenging in a way that allows for a better understanding of concepts.",
                "I really appreciated Professor Hazaris commitment to the well being of the students as well as the support and consistent hard work of the team of TAs for this course. \r\nThe first midterm seemed to be generally too lengthy for the time allocation we were given, which made my first midterm experience stressful.",
                "The strengths are that the professor provides several resources that made it possible to better understand the course material. However, some of the problem sets and exams did not align, and this is one weakness that stood out to me.",
                "Even though this course is advertised as an introduction to chemistry, l believe the class was taught with an expectancy level of AP chemistry.",
                "Strengths include how the notes were uploaded online. Weaknesses were how we could never expect what trick questions would arise on the test.",
                "I think that some weaknesses were present in the format of the lecture and the exams. For example, we were not given enough time for the first exam. However, Nilay and the entire teaching team were very good at adapting to our needs, as was reflected in the following exams. I felt like the lectures were not entirely engaging at times, but I understand that it was necessary to ensure we covered all the needed material. I really liked having discussion sections, and the way they were set up with the worksheets increased my level of engagement with the material before I had to do the homework or be tested on it. I felt like there were a lot of resources available for help, from peer tutors to the TAs to Nilay himself.",
                "Strengths: so much support from TAS and the professor\r\n- professor was extremely engaging, every Friday there was an experiment \r\n- notes poster online on Canvas for further review\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes, textbook use would have been more preferred \r\n\r\nImprovements: maybe providing textbook pages that relate to the topic in class so if we dont fully understand lesson based content we can look at it from the textbook angle",
                "No strengths. All weaknesses.",
                "I thought this course was taught wonderfully.",
                "Strength is how the lectures and notes are recorded and posted online. Weakness is the low student engagement",
                "Strengths: The class was taught well. Although the past was a bit fast, it was understandable because there is a lot of content to learn. Plus, it is nice to look back at the end of the semester and see all that you have learned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like this class went too far in terms of knowledge we were expected to learn. For instance, recognizing functional groups is a topic I would expect to first encounter in an organic chemistry class, not inorganic. I understand that presenting us this information and testing us on it is preparation for those looking to advance in chemistry or take organic chemistry, but it was frustrating at times, because of the assumptions made that since the majority of the class is pre-med, they should be tested on concepts that will be relevant to them later.",
                "The course is well taught. The teaching team was responsive to students' problems and requests and the course passing was reasonable. As a fundamental chemistry course, the course should brief students on \"the road ahead\" in chemistry, such as more advanced classes, possible career choices, possible majors and applications of the course and sequential courses. The course can be improved by incorporating discussion on these topics.",
                "Despite the lecture style course, CHEM 161 was a very engaging class. There were many opportunities to seek support including the TAs and Peer Tutors. The strength of this class was the teaching support and the sequential curriculum that built upon each topic. I cannot think of any weaknesses for the course.",
                "The course covered a lot of content yet provided so many ways for you to keep up.",
                "The course moves quickly, but there are many options when looking for help. If I was ever lost, I always knew where to look.",
                "Nilay's lectures were very engaging and helpful. Nilay tries his best to make chemistry as interesting as possible.",
                "There was a lot of support and clarity when it came to exams, which was very nice. The lectures were also often enjoyable. Sometimes the more difficult concepts were skimmed over in lecture even though they were important to the course. In general, it moved quite fast.",
                "I think this course was fantastic. Nilay and my TA Ryan both did a great job in explaining the course material. I don't think there were any negatives.",
                "I can't think of many weaknesses, but there were many strengths. Most of the TAs were extremely helpful. Nilay created a very comfortable relationship with his class (even insisting on a first-name-basis), and was always available for any questions. The midterms were always preceded by one or two practice midterms, additional practice was given for each chapter of material, etc. A plethora of resources was made available for us.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- lot of resources such as office hours, TAs, Discussion sections, practice problems, etc\r\n- I love that we can go back to the notes\r\n- Nilay is the goat. Hes very approachable and really positive\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the curve made the class stressful ( I saw it more as I need to do better than my peers than I need to do well for myself)\r\n- discouraged cooperation between student\r\n- we rushed over confusing concepts at times (MO theory for example)",
                "Strengths - the workload was reasonable.\r\nWeakness - the lecture was often not helpful because we were expected to know some concepts before hand.",
                "It is quite a lot of work, and I wish that we went into some more of the conceptual side of things, but generally it was a very good class!",
                "Fine introductory course, a basic but standard curriculum. Not much flexibility in terms of how this course can be taught. Average prerequisite.",
                "Sometimes it felt that a lot of the material was being rushed and that the exams were not representative of the level of knowledge that was expected in the psets or through lecture.",
                "One strength is that the faculty is very involved in our learning process. One weakness is that I wish there were more practice resources to practice our skills.",
                "Strengths of this course included Nilay and the inclusive classroom environment he created. It was extremely evident that Nilay is committed to the success of his students. Throughout the course, Nilay ensured that his students were comfortable in the lecture hall by addressing privacy concerns and any other problems as soon as he could. Nilays lecture style was engaging because of the supplemental lecture material he provided through videos and his humor that he interspersed throughout his lectures. Nilays course struggled with one-on-one student engagement. However this is a common fault of large intro lecture classes. Nilay sought to overcome this issue by providing multiple lunch dates for students to get to know him in a less crowded setting.",
                "The strengths of this course was definitely the engagement that Professor Hazari presented. I loved listening to his lectures about chemistry and why it is essential. The parts of chemistry that were dull to learn were made incredibly interesting. Some of the concepts could have been explained more clear, however.",
                "Can be flexible with you schedule.",
                "I think this is a good course for learning the basics of chemistry especially with a background in some chemistry. However I found myself teaching myself a lot of the material towards the more difficult chapters as some of the lectures were hard to follow.",
                "The content felt like it was taught in a weird order at times, where we revisited topics after theyd come up already. I thought the lecture notes were very clear and helpful. The psets were good.",
                "One strength is the support system of my TA for discussion section. One thing to improve may be including more practice tests",
                "Nothing",
                "Strengths: Nilay! He truly cares about his students: he is energetic, upbeat, and extremely approachable, always willing to personally help students out when they are struggling, despite the massive size of the class. He plays music at the start of every class, dresses up and does special demos for Halloween, and hosts lunches with his students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Being an introductory course with lots of material to cover, lectures can move at quite a fast pace and be information-dense. However, there are plenty of resources available if you find that things are moving too fast, and Nilay and the TFs were all very helpful.",
                "Strengths were that the professor for the course was very engaging and gave plenty of examples of how chemistry is applied in the real world. Also, the instructor tries to connect chemistry to Taylor swift. However, I would say a greater amount of time could be spent on doing harder or more analytical chemistry problems to prepare for exams.",
                "I wish the deadlines had been clearer and more instructions for the midterms had been present.",
                "Weaknesses: Teaching format was not great. Nilay would write down what he was saying verbatim on his Ipad and there was not much awareness about the peer tutors. Not enough practice questions provided. \r\nStrengths: Provided review sessions before exams",
                "There could be more support for students' learning",
                "The strengths of this course was the fact that the lectures were engaging and Prof. Hazari tried to make the classes as eye-catching and relevant. The mix between showing videos and providing demonstrations while also lecturing was a good balance that made it much easier to focus in class. The strength of this course also includes the idea that Professor Hazari had a relatively close relationship with as many students in the large lecture as he could. The weakness of this course includes the idea that there could have been a little more individualized help, however these are means difficult to accomplish in a larger lecture.",
                "One weakness of this course was the discrepancies between the teaching assistants. Some of the teaching assistants were helpful and organized whereas others only were there because they had to be. Strengths-wise, I found the peer tutoring to be extremely helpful.",
                "This course is very manageable in workload and content. I found that the way the course was structured, in lectures, problem sets, and tests, made it very easy to learn and practice the content.\r\nI thought the discussion sections were not super helpful. Often times we didn't finish the worksheet for the section. Rather, the discussion section was really only helpful to me when I had specific questions about content before the test.",
                "I enjoyed the simple and organized structure of the course, although I think it would be just as helpful for students to have more take-home quizzes/assignments as a resource for practice problems and improving ones chemistry skills and greater knowledge, as well as expanding some of the grading distribution.",
                "I really liked my professorhe was very engaging and tried his best to show the real-world applications of his information. However, I wish we could have more practice problems done in class, which would help me absorb the material better.",
                "could be improved by making the office hours more accessible",
                "Strengths:\r\nLectures closely following the book material\r\nAccess to TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNot enough examples of difficult caliber during the lectures",
                "This course was fast-paced, however, the support system of teaching assistants made it manageable.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professors enthusiasm and the high level of involvement of the teacher assistants. Lectures were always well-organized and demonstrations were fun and engaging for the class. The professor was also very diligent about posting information in a timely manner as well as all the discussion worksheets, exam answer keys, and any other resources that they thought would be helpful. Some weaknesses of this course were that, at times, the vast array of resources felt overwhelming. There were some twenty different office hours from both the TAs and the peer tutors on top of the professors office hours. It was difficult to understand the differences between them and choose which to attend. Another weakness was that there was no check-for-understanding during lectures. Many times, the professor would begin talking about a new topic and some aspects would be confusing, leading all the students to be very confused for the remainder of the lecture and the entire unit. If there was some sort of checking question, either visually or with a short not-for-credit quiz, this would mitigate this problem. Finally, office hours with the professor were intense, unwelcoming, and stressful. You always had to bring questions to discuss and sometimes you felt that your questions were silly or a waste of time. This would require a significant change in attitude when answering student questions during office hours.",
                "It was very difficult to understand the concepts and lessons at first. Better explanation of concepts on a broader scope.",
                "The classes were very intriguing and applicable to real life, but the classes were short and met too often.",
                "I thought this course was well-organized and did a good job accommodating students with all chem backgrounds",
                "I liked the structure of the course",
                "The strength of this course was the manner in which it was taught. The professor made every lecture entertaining.",
                "The teacher is very encouraging and genuinely wants everyone to learn. I think the exams could have been formatted a little better though with some of the questions being phrased in a way that is easier to understand.",
                "Strengths - Nilay is an incredible professor and he definitely changed my view of the subject of chemistry in a positive way. He is always encouraging and kind, and a 10/10 professor overall!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Exam questions were at times misleading and discussion sessions were also at times a bit redundant.",
                "Like most lectures, this class was slightly impersonal and I felt like I had to self-study much of the content. But the professor Nilay Hazari was amazing in showing us students that Yale professors do have personalities. He sincerely tried to make the content relatable to our daily lives and was intentional in making jokes. He also had chemical demonstrations done in the class nearly every week. This class was both my most rigorous and one of my most exiting.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the way that problem sets were set up. I appreciated that we could do them online, that the questions felt relevant and very much applicable, and that we were able to utilize a \"hint\" function on Achieve learning. A weakness of this course was the lecture format. Frequently, I felt like I was not absorbing a single thing in lecture. Concepts were explained very quickly, one example at most was provided, and I was often too focused on jotting all the notes down. I felt that I did most of my learning OUTSIDE of lecture rather than during, which was often frustrating.",
                "I ready liked the way Nilay taught this course, it was very concise and to the point with little fluff",
                "Strength: Nilay was an awesome professor. The TAs were super helpful and there were a lot of office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: the discussion sections (meant to help us learn how to do problems on the psets) were sometimes scheduled after the pset was already due. This made the work much harder on people whose sections fell after the due date, which could be changed easily.",
                "I feel that all the material was covered well but I also felt that the speed of the course was a lot and there wasn't much time to sit and think on any information given during class time to ask questions.",
                "One weakness of this course is that we need to pay for using Achieve. It would be better if we can do our homework on Canvas.",
                "The strengths of the course are the manageable workload in terms of weekly homework and the professor. The weakness is the fact that there are three midterms.",
                "The lectures were not that helpful, but the psets were instrumental to my understanding.",
                "Weakness would be to make sure all classes were recorded. Strengths are that this professor was the best one for the course and the TAs were both helpful and efficient.",
                "The main strength of the course was the amount of material we covered.  It was very informative and gave me a solid chemistry background.  The main weakness was that with this amount of material, we were unable to do many examples.  It was a lot of learning on your own time.",
                "One of the main strengths was the large number of TAs which provided solid resources to get any extra needed help. One main weakness was that the discussion sections didnt add much help in understanding the content. The sections consisted mostly of worksheets, but I think it would have been more useful to spend more of the time on talking through problem sets and going over lecture notes.",
                "Strengths: The class was very organized, did not feel like there was a lot of busy work, I felt like I knew how to prepare for exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At time I felt like the lectures were unclear, progressed very quickly, and he wasnt open to clarifying or repeating certain information",
                "Strengths are of instructor commitment and effort into class.\r\nWeaknesses are of sometimes a lack of one on one support, outside of office hours.",
                "Strengths: a lot of content was covered in a relatively systematic, timely manner. The TAs were always willing to help students, and Nilay was incredibly supportive.\r\nWeaknesses: the vast quantity of content covered sometimes eclipsed the quality of the learning. I interacted with many classmates who lost their passion for chemistry and began to complete assignments robotically just for the exam, and not with any genuine interest in the subject.\r\nSuggestions for improvement: While Nilay did offer remarks before and during each unit about its significance to science and the world at large, this innate passion felt sometimes to be dampened during lectures. Maybe facilitating space for more questions during lecture would help individuals in such a large lecture feel more connected to the content?",
                "I found the course to go a bit too fast. There was a lot of information that came at me very quickly especially as it was my first semester and I was adjusting to how college works in general. I found that I needed time to figure out how to learn in a lecture style class that I didn't get because there was a lot of complicated information being thrown at me very quickly.",
                "The strengths of this course was that there were a lot of assistance provided to you. I had peer tutors, discussion sections, and also Professor Hazari himself to go to when I had questions. The review sessions and practice material were also very helpful.",
                "This course presented the subject matter very clearly and the psets were good at solidifying the concepts.",
                "The strengths of the course was the teaching and the help available to students. The weaknesses with the course is just how fast paced the material starts being covered as the semester goes on.",

                "It's a good gen chem class and with Nilay it was made more fun but it wouldn't be my first class for an intellectually curious student.",
                "I think I would recommend this course if you need a review on high school chemistry concepts, because it is a pretty good basic chemistry course if you need it as a requirement as a non-chemistry major. If I had not had a background in chemistry or had taken AP Chemistry in high school, however, this course would have been very difficult for me, so I would not really recommend it for someone looking for an easy science credit.",
                "Yes, if you need it to fulfill prerequisites. If you don't, don't take it because there are much more interesting science classes available.",
                "No, unless you have to. It is not very intellectually gripping.",
                "Yes, especially if Professor Hazari is still teaching! (Also, unrelated, but I'll warn you now: the first midterm is way harder than you'll expect it to be.)",
                "I would recommend this class to any student who is looking for an introductory Chemistry class.",
                "If you're premed, you will have to take the course. If you think you're premed, this course will determine whether you want to go down that route. Just don't go into the class with the feeling that the class will be easy, it won't. It'll require a lot of dedication and work. In the end, it'll pay off if you get it right.",
                "Yes, this was a good intro to chemistry course that gave me the base that I needed.",
                "If it is a prereq, yes. Seek help early and stay consistent with the workload.",
                "Yes, it was useful and necessary for certain majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is good preparation for pre-med and any STEM major.",
                "Only if you are pre-med or need it as a pre-req",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting.",
                "If required for major yes! Otherwise no, if you want a basic understanding of chemistry this is not the class to take, it's a lot of work!",
                "I would recommend this course if you need it for a prerequisite, are pre-med, or are interested in pursuing science at Yale. If you just need a science credit, look elsewhere. This course consists of three 50-minute lectures (in-person or recorded) and a weekly discussion section (separate from the lab CHEM 134L, which is an additional weekly commitment if you need to take lab). The graded material consists of a weekly online problem set, 3 midterms, and a final exam. Review sessions of varying helpfulness are offered before each exam. The averages can range between 70-84% on the midterms; this grade becomes an A, so complete mastery is not necessarily expected. The graduate student TA's play a large role in the course: leading the discussion sections, grading the exams, and holding review sessions.",
                "Yes if you a) need to take it or b) enjoy chemistry. You can definitely get easier science credits though. But it's not too bad and I liked the class.",
                "Yes",
                "If you want to do anything in STEM, yes.",
                "Yes, it moves fast but it is a good start to learning chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but would encourage them to study chemistry prior to entering this class. Despite its advertisement, I don't consider this course an intro course.",
                "Do not take it unless you need it",
                "Yes I would but if you have little or no chemistry background, it will be a lot more difficult.",
                "Yes I would. It is a great opportunity to learn the foundations of biology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "Yes! If Gen chem is required for you, taking it with Nilay is your best bet.",
                "Yeah but as a foundational class",
                "Yes, I believe the learning environment was so healthy and encouraged me to show up to class everyday",
                "Yes. Good starting point for chemistry",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes, I would, especially because it is a prerequisite for many STEM majors and a required pre-med class. Also, there are so many resources if you feel like it might be especially challenging.",
                "If the student does not have a lot of workload then the person will be able to balance the workload of General chemistry.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to major in a scientific discipline. It provides a strong foundation that is applicable to other fields of science, especially biology. The course has a reasonable workload, is doable, and you learn a lot.",
                "I would. It's very engaging for a lecture course and a good introduction to the lecture-discussion section style at Yale with lots of outside support if needed.",
                "If they love chemistry yes. If they are only trying to take a science credit. probably not",
                "Yes, it was a class that helped me explore my interests.",
                "Its a course most take for the prerequisites, but I found it intellectually challenging in great ways. With no chemistry background, my TA was very helpful. I recommend, and dont skip lectures. It is recorded but to stay engaged and learn the lecture is necessary, especially if you dont have a strong background.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It provides helpful information on the basics of chemistry and is well taught (particularly if Nilay Hazari is the instructor). It is helpful to have some background in chemistry beforehand, but if one has never studied chemistry before the class is still very doable (they will just need to put in a little extra effort to further practice the concepts). I also recommend this class for any student searching for a science course that is more conceptually and computationally based rather than a course that is based solely on memorization (there is definitely some memorization, but primarily in the first unit and it is not a ton).",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who is very invested in chemistry.",
                "Yes, it gives student an entry into pursuing any major in STEM and provides a foundation for all science.",
                "Yes",
                "This class is not only for pre-med students, etc. If you are interested in learning chemistry, this is not too difficult of a class. The workload is very manageable.",
                "eh take at ur own risk",
                "Yes. This course is good for getting a basic foundation in chemistry that can help in all science fields.",
                "Yes, because my experience with this course was more about learning (both material and about my learning habits) rather than just having to actively recall information for tests.",
                "Although the course seems fast paced, it's a very rewarding learning experience, which I recommend.",
                "I would only recommend it if you need it as a prereq or premed requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is a prerequisite for many other STEM classes, and a pre-med requirement. It is a good course, but I would definitely recommend it for students who have prior chen experience.",
                "Yes, it allows for a rudimentary understanding for chemistry and covers a lot of the gaps that were potentially missed from high school AP Chemistry, which allows for a better foundation for future chemistry courses.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is a good introduction into what college level STEM classes are like as a step up from high school courses.",
                "I would only to the extent that this person sees Chemistry as a means to developing their interest in a career particularly in STEM.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you have some chemistry background or know how to study well and effectively.",
                "Yes, it is an intro course for so many majors",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with little experience to no with chemistry. It is also a good course to take if you have taken classes like AP Chemistry before but either did not do well or took it over two years ago and don't remember anything. It's definitely a self-motivated class because I feel like if you just do the bare minimum, you won't really learn and be prepared for the exams.",
                "Yes, and not just to those on the pre med track. The satisfaction of being able to explain chemistry better to your peers, the study skills, and the overall lesson content is something I cant wait to experience more.",
                "No because it was disorganized.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like it was easy to succeed as long as you put the work in.",
                "Yes because its a good way to learn the intro to chemistry",
                "Yes! I know most people are taking it for a pre-requisite, but even then, under the instruction of Nilay, this pre-requisite is not as bad as it could have been.",
                "Yes. This course is very well taught as an introduction to chemistry. It has difficult parts but plenty of resources for students to understand concepts and do well on assessments. I recommend this course to those finding a Sci distributional credit or those interested in chemistry.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in establishing a strong groundwork for their chemistry studies. The course is engaging and there are many opportunities to seek further support.",
                "I would recommend this course because I feel like I learned so much throughout the semester.",
                "I think this course is very important in providing foundational knowledge for many other sciences",
                "Yes, if you need science credit or want to learn about chemistry.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this course, especially with Nilay.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. My professor and TA were both great teachers and I found the material being taught very interesting.",
                "Cautiously, yes. The material is not easy to understand, and there is a lot of material. There isn't much homework; just the weekly pset that can probably be done in 2-3 hours of focused work. Because of this, it is easy to knock out the pset in a day and then forget about the course for a couple of days while you focus on your other courses. Apart from this small detail, the amount of material you learn is absolutely worth the investment.",
                "I would recommend this class to premed/chem majors. Though, realize this class will be quite cut throat.",
                "I think its nessesary, but its a lot of time and energy.",
                "Sure. If you're interested in Chem you will have to take it and if you're a stem major you likely will too. It's an above average prerequisite in my opinion.",
                "I would only recommend this course if its a requirement.",
                "Yes, especially because it is an introductory course to chemistry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is a fantastic introduction to chemistry and STEM at Yale and Professor Hazari is an incredible professor.",
                "I think the material of the course is interesting and necessary for a lot of science majors. However I would say theres a fair amount of work on your own in order to succeed.",
                "Yes - it would be possible to take even without a background in Chem. Nice way to get into chemistry if you dont have experience",
                "Yes, because I believe it is well taught and there is a good support system",
                "Yes",
                "For students who have already taken chemistry or AP Chemistry in high school, it is important to note that this class covers similar material in much greater depth. Much of the material is quite abstract and can be challenging even for students who have some high school chemistry experience. If you are not interested in chemistry or if this class is not necessary for your schedule, I would not recommend taking this class. That said, for students who have never taken chemistry before, do not panic! Nilay has made this class about as accessible and welcoming as it can be.",
                "Yes. If you are anticipating a major in STEM, this course is a good introduction.",
                "No, not if you dont have to. You really need previous chemistry experience to keep up, the advertising for this class should be edited to include that. Not much support and grades are only based off four tests.",
                "Yes. They teacher did a great job of making the class engaging",
                "This is not a course to take if you are not going to pursue a STEM major, but if you are then it is a good foundational course of chemistry",
                "I would recommend this course to another student even if the student is not premed or a chemistry major. The material taught in the class is a good foundation and basis going into any STEM major or field in the future. The course is equipped to teach a lot of material, but there are enough TAs and professor office hours where the information can be further explained in more detail. The problem sets are not too much work and the reward of information that is obtained from this class is substantial.",
                "Yes, if they are going into a STEM field. If they did not like chem in high school, I doubt they'll like it here. However, I think that the people really bond together over the course.",
                "Yes, I think for a basic chemistry course the is a good class to tae. It helps set you up for higher learning, is easy to follow, and Nilay makes it a fun class to be in.",
                "Yes; this course challenged in ways that perhaps other classes may not have been able to challenge me. It has been a work in progress, but it has shown me how I can learn from it not just as a stem student but as a student in general.",
                "Yes, especially with this professor! Even though I learned chemistry in the past, Nilays engagement and continued support, as well as that of all the TAs, really helped me understand the information without being overwhelmed.",
                "yes i feel like i learned a lot",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I found the material useful, engaging, and at a higher level than expected.",
                "yes if you want a good intro to gen chem that'll cover all the basic skills & knowledge. that being said, I do think this course would be more difficult for students who didn't take chem in high school at a high level. even though it's an intro course, it moves fast ,and there are some topics explained super quickly (ex: vsepr molecular geometries) that are overwhelming to memorize.",
                "Yes, if a student is pre-medicine or interested in any STEM field, this class would be greatly helpful.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student who needs to take chemistry as a prerequisite for their major. It is both time and energy intensive and requires a great deal of patience and dedication to succeed in this course. As someone who took AP Chemistry in high school, I only felt that I knew about 50% of the material and I had to attend several hours of office hours to understand the rest of the material. Be aware that the vast majority of students in this class have already taken some amount of chemistry and feel comfortable with the basics. I highly recommend brushing up on the fundamentals if it has been a long time since you studied chemistry. Although the course is designed for anyone, including those without a background in chemistry, I believe it would be extremely difficult to jump into this course without some level of prior understanding. The curriculum moves fast and I would not have survived without the immense help of the peer tutors and teacher assistants. At the same time, I have heard that this is less work than the more advanced chemistry class and I definitely feel more confident in my chemistry abilities after taking the course.",
                "Yes as it's necessary for most STEM classes.",
                "Yes, not only were the topics fundamental they were also easy to learn with the help of Nilay and all the teaching faculty.",
                "Yes, this was a good chem course.",
                "I would if it's a prerec to something they are interested in because I think it provides good foundations",
                "I would recommend this course. Chemistry is a great subject to have basic knowledge on and the manner in which the course is taught makes it a joy to learn. No reasons to avoid Chem 161.",
                "Yes, but only if they need it or are genuinely interested in Chemistry.",
                "Of course! CHEM 161 provides the perfect introduction to the beautiful subject of chemistry and it is a must-do course in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course to another Yale student because I believe it will teach the study and cooperative skills necessary to be successful in college. It is unadvised to try to tackle a lecture-style class individually, so taking a class like this will shows students how cooperative they have to be to be successful here.",
                "This class is challenging for sure!! It was no cake walk!! That being said, if chemistry is required for one's academic major/trajectory, then of course it is necessary to take it. General Chemistry I isn't necessarily a class that I would take \"just for fun,\" because it is very vigorous, but that being said, I'm glad I had the opportunity to take it.",
                "Yes I think this is a fundamental class for most science related majors",
                "Yes, if you need to take it for a major. Dont be intimidated by it if you have to take it. But its not a fun class, although you can get a lot out of it.",
                "I would but with fair warning that the class is somewhat difficult.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. There is a lot of support from the professor, teaching fellows, and outside resources from the department to help students succeed in this course.",
                "If you need to take this class as a pre requisite, take it.",
                "Yes, I think it was a course that taught me important chemistry basics while also developing me as a student.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in chemistry.  It is a tough class that wouldn't benefit anyone other than those committed to chemistry or other STEM majors.  It was an interesting class, but it was very difficult.",
                "Yes, I think it is very doable to succeed in this course as long as one puts in the work.",
                "Only if they need it as a prerequisite.",
                "Though this course was extremely challenging for me, I would recommend it to students who are absolutely certain in their love of chemistry. The content is thorough and systematic, and I came away from the class with much more knowledge than I walked in with. However, if the course is being taken just to tick a box, it has the potential to be a pretty unenjoyable experience.",
                "I would because I think overall the course was interesting and useful despite the fact that it took me some time to get used to how the course worked/",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that wants a good, solid intro to chemistry.",
                "It is a great foundational class that serves as valuable preparation for students interested in diving into deeper topics in biology, physics, or chemistry. The breadth of the material is captivating and also gets students interested in at least one topic of focus.",
                "Yes, this is a very good introductory chemistry course.",
                "I would recommend this course student because of how beginner friendly it is. As someone who had little to no chemistry experience before, it was a manageable course that came with enjoyable experiences.",
