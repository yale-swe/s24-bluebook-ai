I was also enlightened on the beauties of so many different styles of music and artists I did not know about before. loved this course!",

Watched plenty of documentaries and listened to a lot of cool music. The final project was a creative project, which was a nice change of pace from the traditional paper (people made art, podcasts, etc.)."

                "Strengths: Professor Conway is incredibly supportive, encouraging, and just wants us to enjoy learning! So much of the class experience is about building a community. We all got to know each other and support each other through this difficult semester and it was really a highlight for me. Weaknesses: It might be nice if Professor Conway posted the suggested songs and film for the week on Canvas because most of the communication happened through our class's GroupMe and sometimes I couldn't find what we were supposed to have watched/listened to for the week.",
                "No weaknesses, strengths are that Nick is the best teacher Ive ever had, so understanding, helps everyone get close, music video competitions, and everyone gets to show a creative side",

                "The strength of the class rests on the engagement of the students, I think. It was easy to take a backseat, and you really get out of the class what you put into it. Nick is a great discussion leader and genuinely takes interest in his students, which makes class an absolute joy, even though it was on Friday afternoons."
