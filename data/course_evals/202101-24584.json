I was also enlightened on the beauties of so many different styles of music and artists I did not know about before. loved this course!",

Watched plenty of documentaries and listened to a lot of cool music. The final project was a creative project, which was a nice change of pace from the traditional paper (people made art, podcasts, etc.)."

                "Strengths: Professor Conway is incredibly supportive, encouraging, and just wants us to enjoy learning! So much of the class experience is about building a community. We all got to know each other and support each other through this difficult semester and it was really a highlight for me. Weaknesses: It might be nice if Professor Conway posted the suggested songs and film for the week on Canvas because most of the communication happened through our class's GroupMe and sometimes I couldn't find what we were supposed to have watched/listened to for the week.",

                "The strength of the class rests on the engagement of the students, I think. It was easy to take a backseat, and you really get out of the class what you put into it. Nick is a great discussion leader and genuinely takes interest in his students, which makes class an absolute joy, even though it was on Friday afternoons."
