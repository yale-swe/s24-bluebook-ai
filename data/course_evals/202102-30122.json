                "I learned about many aspects of neuroscience through a molecular lens. We explored many topics from plasticity, to visual input, to muscles, etc. All of these topics gave me a broad view and representation of the biology that accompanies the nervous system and CNS which I can apply to the real world and later courses.",
                "Great tool kit to understand key concepts of neurobiology",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Interesting material; thorough handouts for reviewing; well-written tests; Haig struck a good balance between providing details and big picture ideas.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture format! Haig frequently switched between documents he'd share on zoom, and would often draw out diagrams live during lecture to explain the concepts. I found it sometimes difficult to keep track of the overarching organization of the lectures as a result. Using slides instead would've provided a smoother, more cohesive, and more efficient experience, in my opinion (our pace was a little behind the syllabus, and I'm guessing some details had to be cut as a result). \r\nAlso, I feel like the handouts, while helpful, were a little too text heavy, and could have been improved with more diagrams and figures. \r\nLastly, I felt like Haig occasionally dwelled on topics more than necessary - the history of neurobiology is interesting, yes, but probably not as important as the material itself.",
                "I personally found no weaknesses, and I really enjoyed every aspect of this course. If I had to choose one strength, it would be that the structure of the course and the order in which we learned the material were perfect. The topics intertwined very well, and I felt that I had a good grasp of the material throughout the course due to the organization.",
                "-The material was a lot. I had to work quite hard to keep up and on my toes in this class",
                "The strength of this course was that Prof. Keshishian did a good job presenting the material and giving us plenty of other readings to better solidify our understanding. In addition, the exam questions were fair and nicely represented what we had learned. However, the weakness was that lots of information was covered all at once, and lectures were very long.",
                "This course could be improved if we were provided with more materials to study from (powerpoint slides, diagrams, visual images). As a visual learner, I found it challenging to study for the class since we were given mostly handouts and the textbook. It would have been helpful if we had more practice problems to prepare for the exams. I would have also preferred to have problem sets which could be factored into our grade rather than having grades being determined by 2 quizzes and the final exam.",
                "Overall the course was very helpful. The only way it could be improved is by providing a ppt presentation with the basic concepts of each lecture",
                "Strengths - a lot of the material was covered in-depth, prompt grading and answer keys\r\nWeaknesses - not many practice materials, material goes very fast, so it's difficult to know how well you understand the material, had to self-teach sections. Also no slides, so only had dense text handouts to guide what material we needed to know.",
                "The course was taught in the span of five weeks and that time really is extremely tight for the amount of material that the course covers. Even though Professor Keshishian is a very knowledgeable and clearly excited instructor, the lack of visual material, such as slides, to accompany his lecture sometimes make the lecture hard to follow. This is exacerbated by the summer session course format which requires the course sessions to run for 2+ hours. The lack of visual guidance and clear segmentation and highlighting of the main ideas that are to be covered in each session prevent students to fully follow and take away from the lectures everything that is taught. The handouts are extremely comprehensive and that helps a lot when it comes to recapitulating the concepts that are covered during lecture. Nonetheless, they are very densely written and sometimes hard to follow as well. If I were to make any suggestions in terms of things that can change for this course to convey the material more effectively those would definitely entail making slides with colored pictures and clear diagrams a priority and organizing the lectures in a way that presents the main ideas and key takeaway points clearly and succinctly. Overall, I feel that students have a lot to learn from Professor Keshishian and I truly hope that the course can get to improve from an organizational perspective as that would much better allow students to take away everything that Professor Keshishian has to offer.",
                "The material was pretty difficult, but it was manageable day to day. Sometimes, it was a bit hard to stay engaged/focused in class because it was a lot to sit through for 2+ hours, three days a week. Professor Keshishian, however, is a good professor and is very understanding. He makes sure to answer questions fully and is always offering to set up extra meetings to further explain topics. The exams could be difficult and were long: he gave extra time to handle formatting and submission, but it felt impossible to complete the exam without using this time to continue to work on the exam itself. That said,  he generally doesn't ask trick questions. More practice problems and P-Sets would've been appreciated and gone a long way, as we somewhat felt like we were left out to dry after the first two weeks, at which point the practice problems and P-Sets stopped. (They were only available for the first two weeks of the course, which is the material on the first exam.)"

                "I would recommend it, with the caveat that you should be interested in the material coming in. The lectures delivery style is somewhat dry, but seeing the incredible properties of our nervous system emerge from the molecular level on up is rather remarkable, in my opinion. Additionally, the workload is relatively low, with just two quizzes and a final (all open note). I found the quizzes to be well-written and fair, and I imagine the final will be too.",
                "Yes! This course was extremely engaging and allowed students to utilize both a retrospective and introspective view of the course material to better understand the human body and the mechanisms for which neuroscience is governed.",
                "Yes, It a great course to get done during the summer and free up your fall schuedule",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the brain (definitely take Human Brain before this class because that helps a lot). It's a lot of information, but the stuff you learn is really interesting and Prof. Keshishian is very kind/willing to help his students. Especially over the summer, it can feel overwhelming, but as long as you keep up with the handout readings, it's very doable.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it fulfills a requirement.",
                "This is an excellent introductory course to neurobiology and even neuroscience. The professor explained the material clearly and in an understandable way",
                "I think if you're taking this over the summer it's helpful not to have a lot of other things you are working on. We had a quiz (basically a midterm) on a Saturday, an extra class during the final week, and class on the 5th of July after the 4th was a Sunday, so most jobs and classes had the day off. There isn't a high workload day to day, but preparing for the two quizzes and exam was very difficult, especially without practice problems or example problem sets for the last two.",
                "Hesitantly, yes. It was a difficult course to take, but a good one; it definitely deserves its high workload rating on CourseTable. The material was interesting, and you will likely have learned at least some of it before, albeit in less detail. I did not take The Human Brain before this course, whereas most of my classmates did, and that seemed to greatly help them, so although that course is not a prerequisite for this one and would be extra for someone like me who is not a neuroscience major (I'm MCDB, neuro track), I would recommend considering taking that class first, as I felt a bit like a fish out of water at times. This is also not a class to take as a first-year or maybe even sophomore. I'd recommend waiting until junior or senior year (or the summer before one of these)."
