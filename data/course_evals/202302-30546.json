The course also integrates short films and readings from South America that provide good practice and add a lot of depth to the curriculum.",

I do think fewer full classes could be spent on the films we watched to improve time management and the amount we learned. I liked the use of VHL and the textbook, and watching and listening to the final oral presentations.",
