                "I really like the lectures when we went over case studies like the Mercedes-Benz stadium, I wish we looked at more interesting structures/buildings like that in lecture throughout the semester and how they carry load.",
                "STRENGTHS: I enjoyed the small group setting of the class and the review sessions led by the TFs. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I felt that the lectures focused too much on concepts rather than practice. Sometimes, when we got a homework assignment, it felt like we were being asked to do something that I had no idea where to start, because the question was more practical than slides.",
                "Strengths: The teaching team was responsive to questions about assignments! The course material, in general, never felt too abstract or difficult to understand. I especially enjoyed the pasta bridge lab, it was very interesting calculating yield stress via hands-on learning.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes tests and quizzes asked us to use the formulas from class in ways we had not yet applied them. There were a few times towards the end of the semester when we would take a quiz without going over the correct answers from the week's problem set-- other students including myself felt that we were kind of left in the dark on how to approach the questions. I think this could be improved with more ungraded practice problems (with an answer key) so that we could feel more comfortable applying concepts and equations from class, especially since lectures often did not include much practice (mainly introductory slides about whichever structural element we focused on for the week).  Additionally, these ungraded practice problems could be introduced at the weekly TA session where normally we'd only cover problems from the week's problem set.",
                "Strengths are that I feel like I learned a lot and can apply what I learned to the real world! The TA sections were great for actually understanding the content we were learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that I feel like the actual method of teaching in class was poor. It felt like a lecture class even though the class was small enough to engage in small group activities and learning. Another weakness is the amount of different assignments. It was a lot to keep track of, especially towards the end of the semester.",
                "This course is very difficult at first and then gets easier as the semester goes on.  The grading is inconsistent, and I wish it had been less strict at the outset of the course.",
                "I think the strength of this course is that the content is quite heavy the beginning and it slowly lightens as the semester goes on. The work load was heavier  towards the end of the semester but that was because of some changes in due dates."

The class material wasn't necessarily fascinating and I didn't feel like I learned as much as I could've in a semester-long class. However, Professor Hatfield was very kind and the Pasta Bridge Assignment was a blast!",
                "I think so! Especially to students who feel comfortable working with conceptual physics and algebra derived from calculus. Architecture majors might benefit more from this course (how often do we get to see a structural engineer's perspective?)",
                "Yes, anyone with an interest in architecture and a background in at least a bit of math should take this class! It gave a great overview of structures in architecture and helped my understand buildings more despite not being an architecture major.",
                "Yes, but it was quite a challenge as someone who had never taken physics before.  Ultimately, I quite enjoyed it, though.",
                "I would totally recommend this class to anyone majoring in architecture. I found that the course was not easy but manageable, even as someone who has never taken a physics class."
