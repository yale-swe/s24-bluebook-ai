For example, we learned about the innerworkings of the GPS system, which was especially insightful and taught us about something that we use on a daily basis. Additionally, we learned about how science intersects with other fields, such as space law.",

In high school, I took one physics class where the teacher did almost nothing; he had us learn physics through a homeschooling website (while we were physically at school). Suffice it to say, I came in worried. But this was one of the most accessible and compelling classes I've ever taken at Yale. The workload isn't a lot (especially if you're working with a group), and you take away a lot of awesome things from this course that could apply to any major. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone who doesn't think they have any interest in astrophysics. I promise you'll change your mind. Seriously.",

                "Very structured, which makes it easier to do well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is so enthusiastic and fun. I loved the structure of the class, and thought it was organized well.",
                "This class was good. It is for non-science students, which I appreciate so very much. I do wish we had more labs and hands-on learning.",
                "I like how this course truly facilitated learning for students without science experience. As someone who has traditionally struggled with natural sciences, I think the material was interesting and digestable.",
                "A strength of this course was the problem sets, they were engaging and mildly difficult, yet not impossible or too time-consuming. They were a good check that I was absorbing information from class.",
                "The first half of the course was great, but after the midterm project, I became extremely disengaged. I thought that the rocket science portion was very engaging and I looked forward to class every day, but once we got into black holes, I was bored. My analysis of the situation, which could be wrong, is that the topics in rocket science are more easily simplified for a class of this level (i.e. Kepler and Rocket Eq.), wheras the content in black holes was not easily simplifiable (i.e. spacetime, gravity waves). Secondarily, I wish the course was less math-phobic; it seems reasonable to expect that a Yale student should not be afraid of natural logs or square roots.",
                "best taught course at yale, by far the best science credit for non-science majors. no weaknesses",
                "I think this course didn't need to be three 50 minute lectures a week. The Friday 'activity' always seemed irrelevant and I really think the class could be better served as a two 1.25 hour lecture course. Strength is the professor! She was super knowledgeable and engaging and she knew how to explain hard astrophysics concepts to people who come with no background.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is great. TAs were super helpful and kind. Content was interesting and fun to learn about. Class was very much catered to helping students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs didn't have the most accessible hours. Felt confused on later content.",
                "This course's strengths included the professor's ability to keep the students engaged. This included projects and group work. It was not just a lecture--it was an engaging class where all students were actively learning. \r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness was the disconnect between what was being taught in class and what was on the problem sets. This caused grave stress to the students, who had to self-teach themselves astrophysics concepts at times because we did not cover the topics in the lecture.",
                "Strengths: Lots of resources to succeed in this course and the TA's were all very nice people. The professor ade really complex problems seem very simple.  Weaknesses: None! You will get an A or A-",
                "No weaknesses, this course and the professor are both amazing!",
                "I really enjoyed learning about the social and legal parts of astrophysics. However, I think the course could cover more of these issues for comprehensively throughout the course and not just in the first half. There are numerous issues to consider including the ethics in the field of how to ethically produce satellites produced and where to put them ethically.",
                "I think the size of the class was definitely improved from last year. I also really enjoyed Professor Geha's lecture style. She was always very engaging and clearly passionate about what she was teaching.",
                "Strengths: weekly psets, office hours, lectures that were engaging and interesting, weekly quizzes to keep students engaged, Friday activities, and interesting topic papers. Feedback comments on PSETS and papers were useful and clear through the ed discussions interface. The workload was manageable and structured in a way that I felt like I could really learn the material but not get stressed out about tests. Weaknesses: sometimes I and some other student didn't fully understand the wording of the quiz questions. Would help if some of them were clearer.",
                "Strengths: Great instruction & teaching fellows, well-organized to facilitate student learning. Lecture quizzes motivate attendance. I also enjoyed the use of class time for office hours on Fridays.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would've appreciated slightly more feedback on the topic projects.",
                "It's an excellent survey course, providing the big ideas without getting bogged down in the minutia",
                "Strengths: very engaging content and also the structure was very manageable and flexible depending on what level of commitment people could give to the class. Amazing lectures and a fun class overall. Professor Geha is amazing and super kind to everyone. She is an expert in her field, yet is still able to communicate to a diverse audience from a variety of backgrounds.",
                "Coming from someone without any STEM experience or capabilities, Professor Geha was a HUGE strength in this course. I have taken classes where the concepts are compelling, but the teacher is hard to engage with. I've also taken classes where the concepts aren't super engaging, but the teacher helps us to understand what we're learning (which is slightly better, but still frustrating). Professor Geha is a teacher who is approachable, engaging, and passionate about what she does. And it shows in the way she organizes slides, homework, and facilitates class discussion. I made sure to come to the optional class field trips because I just wanted to learn more from her. As for the teaching assistants, it was awesome to see Geha encourage them to engage with us. The teaching assistants were usually helpful when questions arose, but if you really are struggling with a certain concept, turn to Geha. She's the best part of this class.",
                "This is an excellent introductory course for non-STEM students. Professor Geha and the TAs do a great job making the class interactive and engaging.",
                "Strength: Projects were well-designed and forced you to actually engage with the course content.",
                "This course is an accessible introduction to two topics in astrophysics. The main strength is Prof. Geha's engaging lecture style and the organization of the course. I can't think of any major weakness.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is amazing. She knows her audience (largely humanities majors) and she made the material interesting and accessible. The only weakness I can think of is that the second half of the course (the section on black holes) was very conceptual and sometimes hard to follow.",
                "I did not like the interactive aspect of the course. Wish it was one session of interaction, and other two sections were lecturing by the professor to cover more content .",
                "This course was really well taught. As a humanities major through and through I was worried the science would be over my head, but Professor Geha simplified everything in a way that made it all really accessible (without oversimplifying, which is something I think other stem courses for humanities majors struggle with). Not many improvements to suggest... would definitely recommend this class!",
                "Amazing professor and love the layout of the classroom of working in groups. The problem sets weren't difficult and the projects were fun.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lecture, great TAs, interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: Friday lectures; add more activities",
                "- Strengths: Professor Geha is amazing. She's incredibly engaging and makes challenging content\/concepts into understandable information for non-science majors.\r\n- Weaknesses: I wish office hours had been more spread out through the week.",
                "everything, just don't ask questions and take this class. So fun, and really no weaknesses.",
                "The course is great! All of the assignments (quizzes, projects, and psets) struck the correct balance between being approachable to non-STEM majors and not being a complete joke. The one thing that could potentially be improved is the schedule and the classroom. Personally, I did not love the interactive lecture format with activities on Friday. I particularly disliked the Hillhouse interactive classroom.",
                "Lectures are interesting and the problem sets \/ quizzes are pretty easy if you go to class or read the lecture slides.",
                "strengths: very manageable content and not too much complexity, which is helpful for the audience it caters to",
                "Strengths: Interesting lecture, amazing professor, good office hours, manageable work load \r\nWeakness: Meets at 10:30 am on Fridays",
                "Strengths were that it was low workload and Professor Geha did a good job at covering information that would be relevant to non-STEM citizens of the world. Weaknesses were that the grading of the projects was much harsher than any other assignments in the class, so it's easy to be fooled into thinking you don't have to put as much effort into those as you actually need to.",
                "Strengths: lots of opportunities to engage with the material and creative projects as opposed to exams \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work but it is definitely manageable.",
                "Everything is a strength except its location (it was sometimes hard to see the project in the HLH house we are in). However, all the slides are posted online, and the psets are super easy. Only 2 big assignments and they're also incredibly fair. Prof Geha is amazing.",
                "Strengths: accessible to non-STEM students, passionate professor, excellent group of TAs"

The students in teh course aren't there because of a true love or interest of the material and it shows.

However, I don't necessarily think it's a complete \"gut.\" There are weekly quizzes and two topic projects, in addition to weekly Problem Sets. While the difficulty of the quizzes and PSets are not high, they can get tedious and it is very easy to fall behind if you stop showing up to class (the quizzes were more like attendance quizzes). I think the first Topic Project (video project) took a lot of time. TL;DR: this class isn't the guttiest of them all. You still have to put in effort.",

I think this engagement was motivated in part by genuine curiosity, because the topics we cover are quite interesting.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course.",
                "Absolutely. Great science credit",
                "Yes, 100%. It's truly the only gut SCI\/QR that I've actually enjoyed and have not been stressed about. Yet, I still learned quite a bit. Professor Geha is incredible, and it's great to have a chill class, where you're still learning about the topic and staying engaged. It was easy to get behind, but also not completely necessary to get caught back up because there are no exams.",
                "My non-STEM friends  TAKE THIS CLASS. I promise it'll be worth it. Its workload is not heavy, the professor is phenomenal, and you will most likely learn things from this class that you might not be able to learn someplace else. There was one class where we spoke about space debris in low earth orbit that's beginning to prove as a challenge for satellites (more likelihood for collisions). Two weeks later, a news article about the very same subject appeared, and turns out, I already knew and understood everything presented in that article. It was a moment where I felt like I actually took away something that could apply to life outside of Yale. Even though I'm not going to pursue any career NEAR STEM, I am thankful for the chance to learn something totally new.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in gaining a working understanding of Astrophysics, particularly as it relates to rocket science and black holes, then this is the class for you.",
                "If you're looking for an easy science class with interesting content, then yes. Probably not the best for those who are already interested in astronomy.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to fulfill the science or QR requirement. The workload is very manageable and the topics are pretty interesting.",
                "Yes I would. This is actually a very interesting course, as far as an intro science goes. The grading is gutty, only if you put in the work. Both Topic projects are tough and actually require engagement with the course material to do well on. That being said, totally doable for a hums major to get an A in this course.",
                "YES! If you are a humanities major and you need a QR or Science credit, this is it. You won't find a better professor or a better class. I learned a good amount of interesting information without the stress of tests or a large workload.",
                "Yes definitely! The topic is interesting and well taught and the work load is super manageable. Great class for distributional requirements.",
                "YES!! One of the easier courses I have taken at Yale and the material is actually super interesting.",
                "Absolutely! This is a great class for hums major especially.",
                "Definitely! I learned a lot about astrophysics in an understandable, intellectually engaging way. While most of the class didn't study science, we all got to talk with one another and think through various topics. Professor Geha also made various connections and applications in the science content to other majors, which I found helpful.",
                "Yes. Just take it.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you don't need a science credit this is a great fourth of fifth course to round out a schedule.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, definitely. A gut and a great class to take especially to fulfill a science credit.",
                "Yes! It can be a good introduction to basic astrophysics, and stress-free science\/qr credit if you're willing to show up and participate. If not, you might fall behind with the more technical information and have trouble with the topic projects.",
                "Yes if they need a science credit and are interested in astrophysics at a basic level! Truly no advanced math is needed.",
                "Definitely! This is a great class to cover the science requirement while learning a lot + attending a great lecture with an excellent professor.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to non-STEM people looking for a science credit. The information is super interesting and the projects are designed to be fun, and it is very low workload.",
                "Definitely. It is a great science course and introduction to astronomy and astrophysics.",
                "Absolutely. If you have the change to take it and need a SC, do it.",
                "Absolutely. This is a great course for any non-STEM student looking for an interesting science credit."
