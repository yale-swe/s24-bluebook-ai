Overall, it was an emotionally challenging but wonderful experience.",

                "This course was highly engaging, and it's small seminar style meant that all students had to actively participate. The guest speakers were diverse and insightful, which was a nice addition. Jenna did a good job of leading the conversation with both the speakers and the students. This course could have been improved by a little bit more time with just the Professor and the students (instead of always having guest speakers). Given Jenna's background as a journalist, I was hoping to learn more about journalist best practices for writing engaging narratives and interviewing victims, witnesses, and experts effectively. While Jenna was always willing to give advice when prompted, it would have been helpful if she had spent some time with us to discuss best practices for interviewing and writing.",
                "The best class I have taken a Yale thus far. There was a a lot of freedom to steer the project the way the group wished and while it was hard at times it really made the course amazing. Every week we interviewed some really interesting people and we were able to connect to the topic on a deeper level on the capstone trip."

                "The Capstone is a double-edged sword. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to try to help a real client solve real problems. In our case, the client and the problem were incredibly difficult yet simultaneously interesting. I learned more than I ever have in a course and am proud of the work we produced. However, I do have some frustrations about the Capstone. First, the Jackson School does not do a good job of communicating with Capstone students about deadlines, expectations, or processes. For example, getting reimbursement for travel was a very frustrating experience that could have been made much simpler with clear communication from the start about what was and was not reimbursable. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the other students will work hard, and in most cases everyone receives the same grade. As a result, it comes down to how much you care - in my case, I cared a lot, so I ended up having to compensate for students that didn't care as much. I'm not sure what the solution for this is, but it is a frustrating part of the Capstone that I was not expecting.",
                "Absolutely, Jenna Krajeski is easily the best capstone instructor with the most meaningful projects."
