            "comments": [
                "One of the greatest CS courses I've taken at Yale - the content was incredibly interesting, and the problem sets were as well. Some of the later problem sets  were less to do with programming and more to do with guessing and trying the correct parameters, which I didn't enjoy as much, but the rest actually were fulfilling to do, unlike most CS psets.",
                "Lectures were unnecessary for the psets, often the material in lecture was hard to follow with the way it was explained. However, psets were very fun to do and pretty chill compared to other CS classes. Highly recommend if you have any interest in game AI.",
                "Strengths: covers a comprehensive, broad list of topics. Weaknesses: there is very little depth for any topic, especially the later ones. Exams are also written so as to expand minor errors into major loss of points, which is bad.",
                "takes a while to get grades back",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures and assignments, helpful professor and ULAs\r\nWeaknesses: some confusing feedback (/deductions) on homework, end of semester was busy with assignment, exam, and final project all after thanksgiving\r\nHow could it be improved: zoo system was kind of confusing",
                "Professor Glenn has very clear notes and the course is well-organized. I have no meaningful complaints.",
                "The strengths of this course are the interesting course material and assignments. The weaknesses of this course include the lack of engagement during class (most people seemed to rather watch the recordings) and gotchas on the exams that could only be solved by seeing a particular subset of a lecture.",
                "the written notes are really unorganized (they only make sense if you combine them with what Glenn is saying, there are just random marks everywhere)",
                "I think Prof Glenn is a huge strength of this course. He is very understanding and always super prepared for class; he knows and loves the material, and it shows. The course's problem sets are very well suited to understanding and applying the material, and the content covers pretty much anything you'd want/need to know. One weakness of the course might be that it felt somewhat disorganized at the beginning, just because we were so quickly jumping through different games as case studies that I got kind of lost -- but towards the end of the semester that went away and I just looooved this course.",
                "Great course with fun assignments and a nice range of topics covered. Wish more attention was given to video game playing and stuff like that, but that might be grounds for another course.",
                "The course is good in that most topics of interest in the field of computational intelligence for games is covered. However, lectures are often very math heavy and students who are not the most mathematically inclined may easily get lost in all the complex mathematical notations. The problem sets are well designed, but are very difficult. Midterm exam 1 was much harder than midterm exam 2.",
                "I think the biggest improvement could be cutting out the first part of the class that focuses on kales and nims. I don't think I'll remember much about that and it doesn't feel applicable to anything I'd every do. I get it could be interesting if games are your focus, but it seems like AI is a broad enough subject that kales and nims could be reserved for a more specific, higher level class. Instead I would have vastly preferred to learn more about neural networks which we never got a pset on and was put at the end of the class.\r\nOverall though, really enjoyed the material and how it was presented. Just would have found neural networks more useful.",
                "Lectures were confusing to follow",
                "It would have been nice to have an assignment on deep NNs, since they seem really neat but we only talked about the theory behind them. \r\n\r\nThe written notes from OneNote were always super unclear and hard to parse.",
                "Strengths: recording in-person lectures was SUPER helpful for learning and reviewing the material at my own pace; the problem sets were interesting and enjoyable for the most part; the scope of course material strikes the right balance of breadth vs. depth; Prof. Glenn spends class time discussing the assignments and makes it clear what we need to do. Weaknesses: some of the later problem sets felt too focused on hyperparameter tuning; while the course material builds on itself, at times (particularly in the beginning of the course), I was unsure how the topics related to one another, and I think it would have been nice to have more of a \"roadmap\" early on in the course to orient the topics more in the context of each other and the field; there was a lot of work for this course at the end of the semester (assignment 5, final project, second quiz), and it would have been nice to space it out a bit more.",
                "I wish the last two PSETS would be graded slightly less on performance because a lot of it is searching for good hyperparameters",
                "Sometimes the content is not well organized and it's hard to tell how each part of content is used in implementation.",
                "The strengths of this course were the thorough survey of computational game theory and many topics within it, the clear and insightful lectures, the engaging and approachable problem sets, and the reasonable exams. I came into the class knowing nothing about game theory, yet, by the end of the course, I was able to understand a variety of academic research papers and lectures about many different topics in the field. The lectures always kept me engaged and interested, and the hybrid format was great for a busy student like me who preferred to watch on my own schedule. Similarly, I enjoyed almost all the problem sets, which were challenging but not insanely time-consuming like many of the other worthwhile CS courses. Finally, the exams were difficult but very reasonable, and reviewing for them really reinforced all the concepts from lectures and programming assignments. While the problem sets were well-structured overall, one of the main weaknesses of the course was the later focus on tuning problem set parameters along with vague and delayed grading overall. There were very few test cases or testing options on later assignments, and it was often unclear in what way our grades would depend on the speed or accuracy of our implementations, which often depended heavily on magic number parameters. This could be improved by having the speed and accuracy benchmarks defined more clearly in the specs, as well as by more test cases. The grading delays were probably inevitable given the large class and lack of teaching assistants, so more staff probably would have been helpful. Additionally, there could be a bit more room for experimentation in the assignments, maybe with the option to use different approaches or techniques on problem sets rather than on just the final project. The final few weeks of the course definitely felt crunched, as we had a problem set, a final exam, and a final project all within two weeks of each other, while covering many different machine learning techniques in lecture; these were some of my favorite weeks of the course, and I would love to give them a bit more time earlier in the semester.",
                "Strengths are the projects and weakness is the professor",
                "Great course! No weaknesses, except that maybe the earlier material could be covered quicker in order to cover more advanced/specialized material at the end.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, content is broadly applicable to many fields beyond games, psets were generally interesting, final project was really cool and fun\r\ncons: very long time to hear back for grades, little feedback generally, a lot of the more advanced/interesting techniques got only a high level explanation (which is understandable because they are complex enough to have full classes about them), sometimes lecture got confusing even though the material wasn't necessarily super difficult to understand",
                "Strengths: Most of the problem sets were a great tool for learning, they were not too long but did require learning the concepts well.  Weaknesses:  The last two problem sets were a bit of a shot in the dark for how well you could do- past a certain point you needed to guess at tuning parameters, without clearly knowing whether you would pass the tests at all.  While those problem sets were great to implement, somewhat clarified guidelines for what would pass/ what levels were good enough would have been very helpful.",
                "Interesting topic, lectures sometimes hard to follow but you could understand by rewatching/rereading notes normally have",
                "good",
                "The material was a joy to learn, and Professor Glenn made it very engaging and interesting. This is one of his favorite courses to teach, and it shows. The workload was not bad for an upper level CS elective, and there was a logical layout to the semesters material. No complaints.",
                "Very interesting and high degree of freedom of what to implement",
                "I liked the problem sets and the final project. The lectures were mostly ok too, but sometimes overly complicated explanations of certain games or too long passages of live-coding made them boring.",
                "The lectures are hard to follow.",
                "Overall good psets, interesting content in lectures, fair exams. Glenn is boring but there are worse things. I appreciate his thoroughness. Would've been nice if grades for pset 4 and 5 had been up earlier (like before the end of the semester) especially since the grading scale for those was (purposefully?) not made clear.",
                "It is a good course and the instructor is clearly very knowledgeable, but the assignments were pretty tough. Thankfully the TAs were very helpful. Connecting the theoretical stuff from class a bit more to the very technical assignments (which Glenn did more and more as the semester proceeded) would be a small improvement. Also, everything in the class is on the Zoo, which is not really covered; maybe some quick Zoo tutorials here and there would help",
                "Lecture can be more interesting",
                "Glenn has created one of the best classes in the CS department blending game AI, reinforcement learning, and game theory. The breadth of topics covered is great. The exams were fair and we had a decent amount of practice material. The assignments were also pretty fair and office hours were helpful. No major weaknesses.",
                "Strengths:\r\nReally interesting course content. Manageable PSETS.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNotes are sometimes difficult to understand."

                "Absolutely! This is a very fun CS elective if you are interested in learning about new algorithms without being held back by having to use C - most students do assignments in Python, allowing you to focus on the more interesting algorithmic part rather than the memory allocation, etc.",
                "I would recommend this course to CS majors as the content is decently interesting and not too difficult. You won't come out of it building world-class AIs but you'll certainly have a good sense of many different techniques.",
                "Yes, the content is interesting and it's a relatively light-workload upper level CS-elective. You will have to learn Python on your own for this class. The class is sort of organized as a series of about 5 case studies of games (each one corresponds to a project) and methods of solving them. By the end of the class you start to learn about AlphaGo and modern game agents, at which point I think the class drops off in quality a bit and becomes hard to follow. But most of the content is quite cool and do not require a ton of code. For me the projects required many hours of understanding what I was supposed to do, and then just a few hours of implementing it. For some people in this class the first part comes easily and the class is extremely light on work, but the learning curve is STEEP and many students spend a long time before they understand how to even begin the assignments.",

If you are in any way interested in games, AI, game theory (but specifically with respect to board/card/etc games), or just want to get more practice with Python, I think this class is phenomenal. There were times when I was deeply lost and confused, but in the end, I feel like I got so much out of this having never programmed tree search algorithms and machine learning programs before. This class made me truly realize how much I can do with CS!",

The problem sets are very challenging and takes upwards of 20 hours per problem set. It is also difficult to pass all private test cases unless you are thoroughly confident with the logic of your code.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially if you want to gain a survey to artificial intelligence/machine learning and have not seen the material so far! This is probably my favorite class that I have taken so far at Yale. I think it was the perfect blend of interesting, practical, but not busy work like some CS classes may be. Glenn is great at simplifying complicated topics and the problem sets were fun. They are doable (~10 hours every 2 weeks). I took this class alongside CPSC 323 and thought it was a fantastic decision (the more practical and higher-level nature of this class mostly in Python) was good to balance out the low-level nitty gritty details of 323. PSET 1 was brute forcing a recursive backtracking solution, PSET 2 was dynamic programming a Markov decision making process, PSET 3 was linear programming an optimal solution, PSET 4 was Monte Carlo Tree Search, and PSET 5 was Q-Learning. Apart from these topics, we covered value and policy iteration, various search methods, neural networks, machine learning, genetic algorithms, etc.",
                "yes, it's fun",
                "A must take CS elective! Course content was very interesting, but lectures were a bit dry.",
                "I definitely would. Especially if you have any interest in games. (if you don't, not sure why you're cs major). I would also recommend you take OOP (CS 327) especially if you don't have much prior python experiencing coming out of 223. Might be helpful to have taken OOP before this.",
                "Soft yes, if you like Glenns style of teaching",
                "It's a decent CS elective.",
                "Yes! It's definitely one of the better CS electives and feels like less of a survey course compared to other AI electives. The assignments are enjoyable and and Prof Glenn cares a lot about students!",
                "Yes, if content is interesting to you. You can get away with not showing up to lectures (which I actually recommend), then catching up on them a few days before the PSET is due, and then working with friends to finish them.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who loves to play and talk about games and has a decent computer science background with an interest in mathematical and logical thinking. Regardless of your background in game theory, you will probably still learn a lot, and the programming practice is both fun and insightful. Even with limited interest in games, there are many applications of the topics from this course, as it also serves as an good investigation into many statistics and machine learning techniques; however, everything is framed through the idea of games, in particular board games, so you should be at least vaguely interested in them to take the class.",
                "I wouldn't for the professor",
                "Absolutely! The lecture style is clear and engaging, the problem sets are fun but not too challenging, and the final project allows a lot of flexibility and creativity.",
                "For anyone interested in games or AI techniques more generally, absolutely - I took the class because specifically I wanted to know more about the AI techniques used to make chess AI and I learned enough to make a simple one for my final project - for anyone who has similar interests in games its definitely a great class to take",
                "good",
                "I would recommend this to any student studying mathematics, computer science, or economics, who is interested in thinking critically about competition in the context of games.",
                "Yes definitely. Very fun and learned a lot",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course. If you have taken any other artificial intelligence classes, you will revisit many concepts but applying these algorithms to games is still entertaining.",
                "Yes, I thought it was enjoyable and I learned a fair amount without stress. Take if you like games! If you've taken 223 you'll find the psets straightforward.",
                "I would recommend to students interested in AI and game solving. I really enjoyed the material. The assignments are tough especially if you don't have good Python experience and/or computer science background but it's worth it I'd say",
                "The course is well-organized. I especially like the design of the assignments which will definitely help you understand many algorithms.",
                "Yes, useful content",
                "Yes! Great CS elective  the assignments are fun, the topics are interesting, and just a well-designed class in general.",
                "A really good course if you're interested in computational intelligence. This is by far the most interesting class I've taken in the CS department and I would highly recommend it to other students."
