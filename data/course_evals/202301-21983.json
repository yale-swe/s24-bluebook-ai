I feel like I had never heard of or read so many of the texts and had also never really thought about how Black Americans had used, refashioned, and utilized Christianity as a powerful form of resistance or rhetorical device. I think this course gave me space to examine African American texts, theology, rhetoric, and very intriguing texts in a great way.",
                "I've learned a lot about 19th century writing and how the genre of apocalypse can be considered a type or escape for oppressed minorities. There is a lot of freedom in writing under a genre that is meant to be outlandish and extreme, so I've learned mostly about how big an influence changing the conceptual context of writing can have on community mindset. The instructor helped me develop skills of close-reading, connecting sources, and weighing texts against each other for common themes.",

African American apocalypse litas well as about the apocalyptic genre more broadly, the intersection of theology, literature, and justice, and the best ways of reading primary and secondary literary sources.",

                "Strengths:  Jeong Yeon really fostered classroom community with questions of the day (maybe at times those could be shorter but also it was so fun and meaningful) while also making sure to hit important parts about readings. I think that his flexibility and ensuring we had space to be human meant a lot but I think maybe also emphasizing the importance of giving these texts the respect they deserve could be good so that our discussions can still feel meaningful. I also appreciated that the texts even though they were dense were often spaced out to not be too much reading on one day and that he guided conversations and provided context without really taking over. Our conversations actually felt interesting. Weaknesses: I think that personally I appreciated his transparency on grades but feel that talking about that too much (at the beginning mainly) takes away from other reasons people might want to take or engage with this course and also makes it feel more transactional at times? uncertain but really not a huge deal.",
                "This course is strong when it comes to honing skills of analyzing texts for academic discussion and engaging with a wide range of literature under the apocalypse category. It does a great job of accentuating the work of black writers over the centuries and drawing connections between them. The course format is so much more individual-based, however, that a student who isn't very interested in the material may neglect to see any consequence in not reading or analyzing the texts, so some may not be motivated to participate, but that is more a weakness in the individual than the course format in my opinion.",
                "Very relaxed atmosphere.",
                "n\/a",
                "This course has a fascinating thesis which it develops very proficiently and richly throughout the semester. Jeong Yeon did a fantastic job of bringing everyone into the fold and facilitating dialogue that was engaging, accessible, and challenging all at once. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this class succeeded in fostering a uniquely warm seminar environment in which I truly felt I was getting to know my classmates through both casual classroom patter and our meatier discussions. I always looked forward to attending class because the tone was so friendly and lively.",
                "this course was wild in the best way. our check in questions did take up a bit of class time, but the professor always switched us on-topic with enough time to go over the big ideas that we needed to cover that day. the fiction readings were wild and strange in an interesting way, and then then the nonfiction readings were a piece of history that i think should be included in regular history curriculum. really helped my understanding of a time that is sort of glossed over, we were able to go very deep into a particular way that Black Americans expressed their thinking."

                "Yeah! Jeong Yeon is very very knowledgeable on this subject, has amazing secondary source recommendations and facilitates a great environment. I think the first class was actually the most boring class we had. I think that these texts and conversations mixing diff ideas are unique and often not taught about. If you have no background on christianity, he is very understanding and doesn't expect you to but you also might be like wtf does all of this mean why would people believe this",
                "I would. I can't say I know what it will be like while being taught by another professor, but overall the content was very engaging. The course was a success mostly because of the professor keeping us engaged and allowing us to work\/read at our own pace and by our own means. Its style was very free, but focused, and was conducted in a way that was interesting without being stressful. It isn't terribly time-consuming and is easy to find a working rhythm for as well, so it was an enjoyable experience.",

                "would highly reccomend not only as an 18th\/19th \/ junior sem, but also just as a course. it was genuinely a great time with wonderful discussion, on topic or off topic. you get to read really wild literature and come to class and everyone's like \"yeah that was crazy, anyways, we think it's working like this\" professor is also awesome"
