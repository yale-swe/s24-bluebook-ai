    "Fundamentals of composition, some musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, and a lot of random but fascinating musical tidbits from Nate.",
    "Learned more about classical compositions and music history",
    "Composition, theory, counterpoint",
    "In this course the species and counterpoint method for composing was introduced and this helped me learn the basics of composing. By learning this method, and studying many other classical compositions, we were able to begin composing our own music following that model. Another interesting thing that we were able to realize by studying the diverse pieces of music that we did was how subjective music is in how it's composed and how it's appreciated.",
    "Figured bass, counterpoint basics, learning to write for multiple instruments, how to write variations and minuets.",
    "I gained knowlede of figured bass, roman numeral analysis, and 18th century counterpoint. I gained practice composing and analyzing scores of music.",
    "I learned the basics of analyzing and composing baroque music. I learned about the features of counterpoint melodies, typical chord progressions, and typical song structures used in this period of music.",
    "My knowledge of 18th century music theory and composition was much increased.",
    "Greater comfort in my knowledge of the rules of music theory, and greater confidence in breaking them.",
    "Musical composition, ability to identify and utilize minuet idiom, increased musical technicality, better understanding of music theory"

   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot about music theory, composition, and if you have Nate, music in general. A low workload but you still learn a lot.",
    "Good class, lots of learning and feedback from the professor",
    "Strength: Prof. Adam.",
    "Enjoyable, interesting lectures, and a good introduction to music theory. I almost wish there was a little more homework to have given me more practice with figured bass and reduction. With almost no music theory background, I thought this was a very easy course.",
    "This course was very good overall. It was an interesting, engaging class, and it was taught in a very hands-on way. I learned a lot, but the class also never became super intense or stressful. There isn't anything I would change about it.",
    "The course was incredibly interactive and professor Adam was very open to questions and would reply outside of class incredibly quickly and informatively.",
    "Strengths: Engaging, interesting homework that wasn't too difficult, fun topics\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A"

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you have Nate it's incredible. This was such a huge stress reliever for me - Nate does such a good job of making things not stressful, engaging, and really fun.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes yes yes yes",
    "If you want a minimal workload course that provides some music theory basics, then sure.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was both very engaging and not super time-consuming. The perfect class for someone interested in music composition and analysis but with a busy schedule apart from this course.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Oh of course. It's a super fun course that gives you a broader understanding of music theory."
