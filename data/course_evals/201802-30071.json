    "I learned a lot about the Cold War.",
    "An overview of the cold war\r\nCompare and read the literature",
    "Learn lots of Cold War related knowledge, and the basic structure of the world politics.\r\nDeveloping my reading and writing skills.\r\nHave a deeper insight of view on the international relationship and countries foreign policies.",
    "study first-hand resources and archives",
    "The English reading and discussion skills",
    "I learned a lot of insights of Cold War, making me realize the importance of the political science.",
    "I acquired all the knowledge to analize and undestand the development of the cold war, as well as its causes and repercusions.",
    "I used to be unfamiliar with what USA did to Latin America. Now I know that better",
    "I learned a very comprehensive history of the Cold War, including US domestic policy & culture during the Cold War, the Korean War, China's relations in the Cold War, Latin American history during the cold war, anticolonial protests, detente, the end of the Cold War, and perspectives\/philosophy from the Cold War. I developed a lot of insights into how people from all over the world viewed the Cold War, including counterculture in different countries. I learned about different ways to think about the Cold War. Most importantly, I used how to use the Beinecke to do archival research, which was super helpful!",
    "Basically speaking I now have an initial understanding of a framework of Karl Marx and Max Weber, and also some theories of other methodologists. Reading from 100 to 200 pages a day my reading skills have been improved a lot. And hopefully it gets me ready for the college.",
    "- Gained broad knowledge of events, key figures, geopolitical trends of the Cold War\r\n- Learned to utilize library collection resources\r\n- Gained an appreciation for Cold War-era cinema of many national origins",
    "Knowledge about the cold war and many interesting topics are brought up during the discussion period. I got to know different insights from different students."

   "comments": [
    "It felt disorganized and jumped around which was very confusing. It was, however, such a compressed summer course that I understand to some extent why it was felt so choppy, but I felt it could've been more efficient.",
    "Strengths:The teacher will adjust the teaching method according to the Suggestions of the students. A visit to libraries for archives is a very impressive experience.",
    "Strength: Discussion section can let people really get involved and the screenings are nice. (Dr. Strangelove Yeahhhhhh)\r\nWeakness: No PPT or other way to remind students the key point, so that sometimes it's hard to catch up.",
    "the instructor  is very kind; readings are illuminating and thought-provoking, present history from different perspectives.\r\nbut it would be better if the content of lecture could be sent to us before the class, and in the class the instructor could focus on some important or interesting points instead of just reading the manuscript word by word.",
    "Strength:it really helps me a lot with all the reading and discussion that I am more interested in this history and learn a lot \r\nWeakness:the lectures are kind of boring",
    "The course is a little compacted in a month.",
    "I would say that the main weakness of the course is its lenght. If we had had another week or two we could have covered the cold war during the 80s a bit further. We only had one class left for that topic.",
    "There may no a coherent logic between each events, so it is quite confused about why we are talking about such kind of things.",
    "I really appreciated the broad scope of the course in terms of the different geographic areas and perspectives that we covered. The lectures were a bit hard to follow, unfortunately, because there was so much information to learn. I would recommend having (minimal) powerpoint slides or writing all the key terms on the board before lecture. Alternatively, it would be helpful to have handouts with the outline of the lecture and key terms to make the lectures easier to follow.\r\nAlso, there was an incredible amount of reading, and it would be great if we could focus in on a few readings.",
    "Overall it is good... The professor is charismatic and his teaching is fascinating. He is perfect.",
    "The course is very lecture-heavy. This is clearly the correct way to teach an information-heavy history class, but the lectures were at times hard to follow due to a lack of visual accompaniment.",
    "Movie selection could improve..."

   "comments": [
    "not unless you want a hist\/poli sci credit",
    "Yes.This course enables students to grasp the whole history of cold war.Course assignments are moderate.The teaching assistants and teachers are patient in answering questions",
    "Yes, it presents the Cold War in multiple angles, and can help you have a basic understanding of today's international political structure. (especially in US, Russia and many third world countries involved in the Cold War.)\r\nYou can access to a huge amount of Cold War materials (protesting poster\/ brochure \/ first hand materials \/ screening) in the Yale library and get help by the professor and the Liberians.",
    "Its really fun if u are interested in hostory and will gain a lot if reading the materials before each class and participate in the class.\r\nWhile it will be a little boring if u are not interested in history",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Wonderful professors! Incredible course material! Great lectures! Fun but informative midterm! I had such a wonderful time!",
    "Yes. Because this course is very insightful and students can gain a lot of unique experience by taking it.",
    "Yes, it includes a lot of reading and it enriches your knowledge with these. At the end of the course the knowledge one has is increased greatly.",
    "No. I think taking this course is a waste of time. Almost all of the knowledge I get in this course is from the reading. The lecture is worthless to take. I cannot figure out the reason to spend so much money only for reading the materials which I could have found on the Internet.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You're bound to learn something you didn't know before! Also, the archives brochure project is awesome.",
    "Yes. I myself become a Marxist after taking this course... and I have determined to keep on learning Marx after this session. Others probably may be interested in Marx as well.",
    "Totally. While it won't leave you an expert, this course balances the cultural, political, and historical Cold Wars very well and is therefore a good introduction to the topic.",
    "Yes! Because I like the Cold War, and the brochure assignment is fun."
