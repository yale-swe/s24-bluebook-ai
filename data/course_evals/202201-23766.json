                "I learned about the fundamental themes and historical events that have led to the study of ethnicity, race, and migration. I gained insight on terms such as race and ethnicity that are far more complex than the very definition itself. The course made me question the history I had been told my whole life.",

                "I enjoyed the section discussions and most of the readings from this course as I found they were really engaging. Although I enjoyed lecture, I sometimes found it difficult to follow because we hopped around from theme to theme quite a bit and I didn't feel like I really got a good introduction to where we were moving next at the start of each class. I also wish there had been more of a visible thread from topic to topic.",
                "I think the course should aim to dive a little deeper into some of the topics. I understand that it's an introductory course, but I think that it can remain a broad, intro course while still diving deeper into a slightly smaller number of examples and ideas.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the guest lecturers that were brought in. They were all very knowledgeable and engaging, and it was super interesting to hear what they had to say.",
                "Professor Camacho was extremely thoughtful, caring, and knowledgeable about all the topics discussed throughout the course. Her intuitive understanding of the course material provided all of us with a great insight into the course materials. However, I hope in the future that she placed more information on the class presentations, and that she felt more free to not use the standard script for presenting.",
                "Not sure tbh but my level of engagement could've been higher",
                "The readings for this course are very good. Though some weeks I was unable to find the time to work through the readings, in weeks in which I did I always came away with interesting insights. The lectures were always well-prepared, though I sometimes found the delivery to drag a bit. The sections felt a little inconsistent/disorganized, perhaps as a result of a lack of guidance given to the TFs on how section should be conducted. The class was not a lot of work - the few assignments we had were quite painless, and in some cases enjoyable and reflective to do. However, as a result of the ease of the course, students in the class tended to phone it in; during lectures, hardly any students beyond the first couple of rows were paying any attention, making participation during lectures and sections feel awkward and forced. I got the impression that plenty of students were there not to learn but to get an easy credit, which I found discouraging.",
                "One thing I think could be done to improve the course is to make the key concepts more explicitly written out on Canvas or on lecture guides. Sometimes during exam periods I felt like I was searching to ensure that I included all the key terms. Section was definitely a strength of this course and Katy Maldonado Dominguez was awesome.",
                "I thought a strength were the assignments, readings, and class discussions. I thought a weakness was that lectures went a bit slowly and there weren't enough slides.",
                "Strengths: Extremely low workload. Fascinating and well-chosen readings. Amazing lectures from both Camacho and the numerous guest lecturers (other ER&M professors). Camacho and all the TFs are so caring and understanding. Weaknesses: Honestly can't think of any. This isn't really a weakness, but for those who don't do the readings, you can still get by easily in the class; you'll just be missing out on stuff that's important not for this class but just important in general.",
                "Strengths: Guest lecturers were often invited. It was nice to see the insights each lecturer brought.\r\nWeaknesses: Slides arent very informative and they are hard to read (ex. black words on brown background).",
                "Strengths: guest lectures, interesting material\r\nAreas of improvement: more engaging lectures or shorter lecture time",
                "Lectures were boring and sometimes it was hard to follow since the powerpoints werent posted and were mostly quotes or pictures.",
                "A strength is that the course is very interesting in content and has a very manageable workload. However, the only weakness is the lecture itself, which can be very dense and hard to follow.",
                "The lectures not being recorded and lecture attendance being such a high percentage of the grade was not the most conducive to accessibility, especially as everyone tried to navigate COVID-19 this semesteralthough, we were never penalized for illness related absences in section, this could not be well communicated for lecture. I really enjoyed the guest lecturers, and I feel that Professor Camacho chose an interesting and valuable variety of speakers to come impart their specific wisdoms and guidance.",
                "Guest lecturers were great. Readings were really good. I found Professor Camacho's lectures boring and wished they covered more content or expounded more on the readings.",
                "A strength was the amount of guest lecturers we had. Those were the most engaging days. A weakness was a lack of niche topics/conversation. Since it was an intro course, we hopped around a lot rather than spending a longer period of time on subjects that deserve it.",
                "The readings for the course were very interesting but lectures dragged on for a while and I never became engaged in them. I think the guest lecturers were interesting as well.",
                "Strengths: A large variety of topics were covered and the guest lecturers were amazing. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings were too long for an introductory course and felt very heavy. These reading sometimes felt disconnected from class as well as it wasn't always tied in to lecture. The lecture portion of this course also felt very detached as we were often talked at for long periods of time with no engaging powerpoint to accompany the talk that made it hard to follow along.",
                "The readings are extremely interesting and you learn so much from them. There arent many things that count toward the grade which can be both good and bad.",
                "All of the content was very interesting, and I thought all the assignments were fun and very fair. But I did think that lectures and sections could feel a bit slow sometimes.",
                "Strengths: You learn the foundations of ER&M studies, including racism, slavery, human rights, genocide, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you are a person of color, you most likely are already aware of and have been directly affected by the issues taught in this course.",
                "It covered so many topic and brought in many guest speakers (which I really really enjoyed). Weaknesses were that the first half of the semester just seemed like very basic stuff, histories of slavery, race, indigenous thought, and didn't frame these concepts in a new way which made the class pretty redundant and boring. If there was a way to introduce these concepts in a more engaging way that is not always a lecture, such as how the second half of the semester was conducted with analyzing music and art, that would be more interesting. It would also be interesting to focus on specific indigenous communities and their values, but also emphasize the contrast of values within indigenous communities.",
                "The strengths are the readings which were so enriching and amazing, such so that I never missed a reading. A weakness is that it was organized in an odd way.",
                "This course is a great introduction into the field. The only improvement I could suggest is to make the lectures more compelling and tie in the readings more. The lectures are great but could use more energy.",
                "Lots of different topics in the syllabus",
                "This course needs to have more timely feedback and more engagement with the material",
                "Strengths: discussion sections are required for students to gain a greater and in-depth understanding of the content, without it one would be lost; guest lecturers are often invited to share their expertise\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can feel long",
                "I think the course could be improved a lot with more visually engaging lectures. Professor Camacho has a lot of really meaningful, interesting things to say, but it is really difficult to pay attention without consistent visual engagement. I also did not think the global playlists assignment was that meaningful.",
                "strengths: the content is absolutely great, i think the syllabus is very strong and this is aided by the TAs and the guest speakers\r\nweaknesses: the lecturing style is extremely lackluster, there is pretty much no engagement at all by the peers sitting around me, many not even attending most of the time.",
                "The course looks at a large range of topics, which is great for a survey class. But this also means that sometimes it felt like discussions and lectures lacked focus/continuity. Otherwise, the lectures, activities, and sections were all organized well to optimize learning.",
                "The content is great, and so is Professor Camacho",
                "strengths: Professor Camacho is very kind and understanding, TAs are very supportive, lecture topics and readings are really thought-provoking and important for students to read, assignments are relatively straightforward, guest speakers all bring interesting perspectives Weaknesses: it takes a while to get feedback back, you need to be intrinsically motivated to follow along lectures and listen closely",
                "strength: interesting course content\r\n\r\nweakness: lectures were not engaging",
                "Weakness: engaging course readings did not align with less engaging lectures, topics like gay liberation were not covered",
                "The content was great, but I wasnt always fond of Professor Camachos speech/TED-talk-like teaching method. It was hard to distinguish relevant information from fluff.",
                "this course (especially the first half of it) seemed designed more for white people since it covered very basics that people of color would already know from their experiences with opression",
                "Strength: variety of materials we engaged with, such as film, photography, music, art, poetry, etc. The guest speakers were also fantastic!\r\n\r\nWeakness: low engagement with the class and nearly no participation",
                "The strengths of this course are the overall content covered and the ways they are presented. The course could be improved by being more engaging.",

                "If you're certain about taking the ER&M major, I would recommend taking the class later in your college career. It sounds counter-intuitive, but I think taking this class after you already have a few ER&M classes under your belt will help you make the most of this class. Otherwise, if you're not planning on taking the ER&M major, then this class is a perfect introduction and survey to the themes of the major!",
                "Yes, it is a good course to take if youre interested fin race or applying it to another subject",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Especially for STEM majors, this course is useful exposure to thinking about and discussing several important topics. The professor and TAs were all super nice and understanding, and they made it a joy to take the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student because it certainly challenges you to rethink common perceptions of the world and its history. We also learn about topics like Chinese exclusion and discrimination, the migrant workers' movement, U.S. imperialism, etc. that are typically glossed over or left out of a regular high school curriculum, so it definitely fills in the gap and provides a dissenting perspective to the history typically taught in schools.",
                "Its required",
                "Probably not. I think the format and level of engagement is not equivalent with other ER&M courses offered here",
                "Yes, everyone should take this course. I cant think of a single person who wouldnt benefit from it.",
                "yes",
                "very interesting topics but the course is not super engaging. prof camacho's lectures often feel like a podcast where i don't need to be 100% engaged, but can still grasp most of the material. discussion sections weren't the most helpful, might benefit from more interactive activities / opportunities to talk in smaller groups within the section. pretty low workload, but",
                "No - I took it because it was required for ER&M. Its not engaging and you can probably get more out of a similar er&m class, especially a smaller and more engaging seminar-style class.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student wanting to know more about ER&M as a field of study or to a student who plans to major in ER&M."
