                "stop answering questions mid class",
                "Ron is a phenomenal professor and is clearly very passionate about teaching.\r\n\r\nPace could be improved. The tangents were interesting but also often unnecessary, and we didn't end up getting through all the content that we were supposed to get through.",
                "Strengths: Professor Breaker is a great lecturer and takes the time to explain things very clearly. TAs are also very helpful and straightforward about how to prepare for the exam. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did not get through as much of the content as I would have hoped and it was a bit rushed through the end of the course.",
                "I would attend peer tutor hours instead of the TF led teaching fellows. Breaker was an engaging lecturer.",
                "Strengths: great content, lectures were extremely informative and well-explained, often medical relevance was explained for topics which was engaging\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there were too many minute details crammed into lectures, which made it hard to know what to prioritize for studying for exams; sections were not as helpful as I would have hoped (I generally engaged more with TAs via asking questions over email because sections were often a lot more general/just kind of skimmed over the entirety of the lecture at a high level); no homework which was hard because our entire grade was determined by exam performance and there was very little provided for practice questions",
                "I think if recordings were posted/there were other assignments other than exam it would have been beneficial.",
                "A strength is the amount of diagrams and images that helped me visualize the concepts in the slides. A weakness is the level of detail that some of the slides went into because it made it hard to track which information was very important to know and what details were less relevant.",
                "strength: very organized and you know exactly what will be showing up on the exam. The TFs are great and VERY generous graders. weakness: Having four exams can be a lot but honestly, not having a final is GREAT. And the exams are not bad at all if you prepare enough and go to lecture.",
                "Strengths: I actually appreciated the 4 exam structure, not sure if that's a popular opinion. I appreciated that Breaker taught the entire class, that he didn't go through the material too quickly, that there was no homework or quizzes, the review sessions. the first part of the course (not metabolism) was well structured and the first exam especially was very fair. no cumulative final is a HUGE strength\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: with the practice exams being the only material given to prepare us for the exams, there should have been an answer key given out to guide our review. I think exam study guides would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't think this class facilitated student learning, but maybe that's an unfair assessment. you would study so much for each exam, and there was so much material, that you would end up forgetting almost everything immediately after the next exam. \r\n\r\nthe course was very memorization heavy. breaker says that you don't need to memorize material, but that's not true. you will not do well in this class if you don't memorize literally everything he says in class. the second part of the course (metabolism) could have been better taught\r\n\r\nthe slides were very busy, not very conducive to learning. \r\n\r\nbefore the last exam, we didn't get through all the material, and he said we would have to learn it on our own. thankfully it wasn't tested, but it was unfair that he expected us to learn the material on our own as if it were our own fault that we didn't get to it.\r\n\r\nhard to know what was going to be on the exam versus what was not going to be on the exam. the second half of the course was so detailed and you were told you wouldn't have to memorize specific mechanisms, but then you were.",
                "Great class",
                "No recorded lectures for review/study. Lecturing is slow. No study materials (old exams but no practice. No answer key to review either).",
                "This course is well set up. The content on the lecture slides is what ends up on the midterms, no arbitrary content from the textbook. It is always very clear what you need to know for the exams.",
                "The class was taught so well. I thought there should be more of a chance to improve your score, as the first exam early in the semester already counts as a fourth of the grade. (Like dropping one test)",
                "Strengths: non cumulative exams, Breaker is good at explaining the material, review sessions before each exam, felt like I actually learned a lot, low workload besides exams \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNo recordings for a 9 am lecture- even if I didnt miss a class, Breaker talks so fast and adds so much information to the slides. It was often difficult to write everything down and catch all the information that typically ended up on the exams. I thought it was silly that Breaker keeps the recordings. It would be extremely helpful if we could go back and rewatch the lectures before the exams. Also, if you dont have a friend in the class to get the notes from, you have to go through the trouble of getting the recording from Breaker. Dont understand the logic of keeping the recordings from everyone. \r\nThe exams were fair in the sense that the material could be found on the slides, but it was always SOOO much material to study and remember at once. I always felt overwhelmed for each exam and felt like the material was excessively dense.",
                "Strengths: Professor Breaker was great. He was engaging, thorough, and I felt as though I gained a lot from his instruction. \r\nWeaknesses: The constant exams were a bit stressful but manageable. Grading took a long time to get back. Also, we had to teach ourselves half of a powerpoint for the final.",
                "I liked the independent aspect of the course. Sometimes it can be overwhelming though.",
                "strength: I liked just having exams \r\n\r\nweakness: inconsistent pacing",
                "It is based only on four exams and not all of the content gets covered in lecture. While all of the test material is from lecture slides, it is not all from in-person lecture content. Some questions came from future lectures which I had not looked at. While it was clear what main ideas and content we were to grasp from the first few lectures, the last lectures were packed with many slides and mechanisms which made it hard to know what main concepts were being taught. Given that there were many mechanisms involved in the lectures after glycolysis, it was unclear what parts we had to study for exams so it was a bit difficult to know how to study for the last two exams.",
                "Professor Breaker is a great lecturer!",
                "Theres just a lot of content. I think the course desperately needs to add more grades. I also think answer keys are important for fairness with grading. Theres also no help for studying/guide o how to do it. I also thought I was weird that sections took so long to finalize because schedules were already set by then and I couldnt make any of the available times.",
                "Weaknesses - lots of co tent to learn and lack of consistency with tests",
                "Maybe its just me, but I liked having no problem sets. It forced me to sit with the content for longer as opposed to just learning enough to complete the pset. Prof Breaker is very approachable and the TFs were great too! The one thing I didnt appreciate was how we kept learning new content two days before an exam (though that might have been because we got behind at the beginning of the semester).",
                "I enjoy how the course is mostly exam based because it forces me to try and understand/learn the material in class and through outside studying without the pressure of weekly homeworks. However, I would love to have more practice problems available for when test time comes, so that I am able to do practice questions that I would have seen on a pset.",
                "STRENGTHS: you learn a lot without too much stress - Professor Breaker is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate, and the exams are fair. You get a good base understanding of biochemistry and patterns without putting in an overwhelming amount of intellectual and emotional labor. Breaker is encouraging and it is clear that he cares about student learning. WEAKNESSES: I would have loved more clarity on expectations for knowledge of mechanisms and processes for the third and fourth exams. It was unclear in how much depth you should know a process - it was unclear when you had to know names, specific mechanisms, numbers of molecules produced and when a general conceptual understanding was good enough preparation for the exam.",
                "Strengths: Professor Breaker delivered the course material in a way that made it readily comprehendible and spent some extra amount of time explaining the more challenging concepts of a given topic. We covered a lot of information in the course, and I feel the exams weren't overly demanding by requiring us to know relatively obscure topics of lecture. Identifying the extra information on the slides was also helpful to reduce the amount of time spent preparing for an exam.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The timing of the lectures could be improved. For example, we ran out of time to cover all of the intended information before the last exam, and were made to review some of this information on our own. Further, I stopped going to the optional discussion sections as I found it more worthwhile for my time and understanding to review individually and then just asking the professor for clarifying information after class.",
                "I thought this course was very well structured and the way the professor taught the lectures was very descriptive and easy to grasp.",
                "The class was clearly streamlined and practiced; it was great to have access to past exams exactly like those that would be given to us. However, it would have been nice to have more opportunities to check your knowledge than the four exams (e.g weekly homework) and a more rigorous system for outside lecture help (namely making sections mandatory- there were several times where my section was canceled because no one showed up).",
                "I really like how the class consists of just four exams and none are cumulative. I do think they should have required sections or perhaps other opportunities to engage with the material such as optional journal clubs with Professor Breaker.",
                "Strengths: Professor Breaker!!! What an incredible human being. Also, Seth Lyon, the head TF. Oftentimes, what makes STEM courses accessible for me is the community and care I feel in that space, and I can tell that they both (and all of the TFs that I only met with briefly!) really care about biochemistry and how to teach it well. Incredibly taught STEM course. I feel very grateful for the teaching. Communication was great. The timing of the exams was also great. 4 exams that were not cumulative (for the most part) helped me integrate the knowledge I learned throughout the semester. The course was accessible to all students, with Zoom options and lecture recordings readily available.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had an EdDiscussion so I could know what questions other students were asking and what they needed help with. A centralized way to get questions answered would be a good idea, I think. It might even alleviate a bit of the stress from individual instructors (I know I sent Professor Breaker one too many questions over email, haha).",
                "The lectures were very clear, teaching style was great and you felt like you were learning a lot and understanding complex topics during lecture.",
                "strengths: exams were fair, Seth was an amazing TA (very available and open to meet with students, answers all questions and emails very quickly), Professor Breaker was very excited about teaching the material, and made the material digestible and understable\r\nweaknesses: recordings were not made available so it was difficult to review material that was covered too quickly, or was difficult to understand",
                "Good class with good lecture style. Professor Breaker really made this class engaging and incredible and was a large strength for the class. No big weaknesses",
                "The connectivity of information that we learned was kind of limited. Additionally, I wish there were different things that could have contributed to a final grade besides the 4 exams.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Breaker is realy knowledgeable and his study sessions and office hours are incredibly helpful for the exam \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The 4 exams constituting the whole grade can be a little stressful. I think having access to the recordings would help ease some of the stress when studying.",
                "Workload is not that intensive but final grade is just made up of the four exams--maybe offering optional p-sets throughout the semester as a way to facilitate learning throughout the semester",
                "Strengths: I thought Professor Breaker was a clear lecturer, and I appreciated how he often paused for questions and took time to delve deeply into the material. Exams were fair. Weaknesses: Difficult to estimate what exams would look like because we only got one practice test for each exam (some pointers as to what to focus on and how in depth to go would be great). Also would have appreciated if review sessions were scheduled further in advance instead of the day before.",
                "4 exams gets a lot of pressure",
                "pacing of lectures was slow at times, and rushed over the harder to understand parts",
                "A more moderate pace could help the course as well as possibly more detailed explanations on what concepts are more important than others as the content is very heavy.",
                "I thought that a lot of the content was very interesting, and that there was good pacing for the material throughout the course. We were a bit rushed at the end, but that is a minor issue. Overall I thought it was a good course.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that it only has four exams. I think that courses in science-related subjects should provide grade opportunities such as homework or small reading exercises to supplement tests (personally, I think tests are not indicative of mastery of a subject at all, but rather reflect how well someone can memorize and repeat information). Homework allows students to work through their reasoning more steadily, and gives students time to think about the biology involved. Additionally, having many homework throughout the semester could help boost engagement as well, since students would actively have to participate and think about the topic, and not just rush through exam review one week before exams like I know most students did.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: class content was not recorded/distributed, making it difficult to review content; lecture slides were often non-comprehensive and had mixed utility as a study resource; a lack of any problem sets or way to learn the material made it hard to conceptualize topics before the exams.",
                "I think this course was taught very well and the slides were composed in a way that was very easy to understand. There was also a lot of support from the professor and TFs with office hours and review sessions. This course also did not have a lot of homework which was nice because it allowed for more time to be spent on studying for exams. In terms of weaknesses, it would have been nice to have some sort of regular assignments (even if they are very short) to test our knowledge each week and make sure we are practicing the material before exams.",
                "The course is great in terms of content and the professor makes it very easy to understand as long as you attend lecture. A weakness is that although we were not able to cover all the anticipated content.",
                "The strengths included the TF supports and the thorough lectures that Professor Breaker delivered. The weakness however was that these lectures were not readily available as recordings and so when it came time for exams, it was hard to review content that was explicitly covered or talked about more by the professor than in the readings or lecture slides.",
                "Good course.",
                "I think that the lectures themselves were engaging. \r\n\r\nI do not like the 4 exam being our grade policy. I have test anxiety, and if it were not for my friends in the class, I would have suffered a bit more. I also found the lecture slides a bit overwhelming at times, and it was unclear about whether or not certain things would be covered in the exam.",
                "I really enjoyed how the class was taught, and I, specifically, loved Breaker's lecturing style. You can tell he's super passionate about the topic, and his main goal is to ensure that the class understands the biochemical processes he's explaining. I didn't love that there was never an answer key posted to the practice exams, but I had a great TA that would go over all the practice exams with us during the section before the exam. Personally, I actually loved the class and looked forward to attending lecture."

                "take it if u have to",
                "Absolutely, super interested",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who wants an overview of biochemistry that covers the various metabolic processes without going extremely in depth to the point of needed lots of memorization.",
                "I would recommend this course, the exams were stressful but the content is really interesting.",
                "Yes I absolutely would. It's my favorite STEM course I have taken here and reaffirmed by choice of major and career direction. I learned a lot and even though I spent a TON of time studying for exams, I felt that the hard work payed off in a way that isn't always true for STEM courses here.",
                "Yes - good basis for biochemistry concepts",
                "I would recommend this course over the other biochemistry course. I'm sure if you're taking it, it's probably to fulfill a requirement. you just gotta push through it, start studying for the exams about a week in advance, it'll all be okay and over before you know it.",
                "Yes - for premed.",
                "If interested or necessary.",
                "Yes, absolutely, with Professor Breaker. He makes the material so enjoyable.",
                "If you need it for your major or premed",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in both biology and chemistry. It was a great class.",
                "I would recommend this course to premed students.",
                "Yes! Great way to synthesize knowledge from bio and orgo - I really felt everything coming together for the first time.",
                "Yes, Professor Breaker is a great lecture!",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "Yes, it was great if you want to delve deeper into chemistry",
                "As a med school requirement, I anticipated that I would enjoy the course far less than I actually did. There was certainly a lot of rote memorization, and I don't regard reaction mechanisms as the most interesting topic of instruction. That said, the application of this information to the broader scope of biological processes made it more digestible than organic chemistry, and I think I learned a lot of information that I will actually take away from the course. Because your grade is comprised only of 4 exams, the workload is relatively low on non-testing weeks, but you'll need to allocate a decent amount of time for review prior to tests because a lot of information is covered in each module. I feel that the exams were graded fairly and you'll come out doing well if you understand the most important topics of a lecture at a medium level of resolution.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student of similar majors, or interests. Because of the level of difficulty and understanding, I believe not everyone should take this course.",
                "Only for the premed pre-req",
                "Yes! Professor Breaker is so passionate about the subject matter and his passion really translates and makes students engaged and excited. It was nice to tie together concepts from both introductory biology and organic chemistry.",
                "Absolutely, and if you are interested in the material even more so. With Professor Breaker and the rest of the teaching staff, any material becomes accessible.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course if Breaker is teaching it. His exams are very fair and he makes learning the material manageable, and does not just run through the slides like other professors.",
                "Yes this was a really good class! Breaker really made Biochemistry interesting. I especially appreciated how he focused more on the concepts of biochemistry rather than making it a pure route memorization class. I really enjoyed this class and learning biochem and would fully recommend it!",
                "Yes- one of the better taught STEM courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that needs it as well as anyone that is curious to learn more about the underlying chemical mechanisms of how biology and biological processes work.",
                "If you enjoyed organic chemistry I'm sure you'll enjoy this class but if you're not really a science person I wouldn't necessarily recommend.",
                "More likely than not you're taking this as a premed requirement. I went in with low expectations but ultimately was pleased with the clarity of the lectures and the fairness of the exams. Also, the workload was fairly low except for a week before each exam. All in all, I enjoyed this class much more than I expected.",
                "Only if its a major requirement",
                "Yes, if there is a strong desire to understand biology and chemistry in a way that interconnects the two heavily.",
                "This is a very interesting course I would recommend. The professor is very excited and passionate about his subject, and the course covers a lot of cool material. This course also covers some of the more technical sides of biology at the microscopic and molecular levels, which I feel most courses overlook. If you take this course in conjunction with MCDB 290 (Microbiology) these two courses supplement each other well.",
                "Only if you have toit's a solid biochem class, especially for premeds, but I would have loved some more infrastructure to support my learning. Most of it was independent",
                "Yes, I would definitley recommend this course as a good starting point to get foundational knowledge in biochemistry that can be applied to many different higher level subjects. It also includes a lot of medically relevant topics and so is very engaging for pre-med students.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if you are premed or interested in biology and chemistry.",
                "Yes.",
                "Maybe.  If they think that p-sets help facilitate learning, I would opt for the MB&B 300 version. If not, I think this would be a good fit. Breaker is a good professor.",
                "You're probably taking this as a prereq, but I actually would recommend it to those that enjoyed the beginning of orgo 1 (and less so the synthesis portion). I loved making orgo connections when looking at the different reactions and mechanisms Breaker taught."
