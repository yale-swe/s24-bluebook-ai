                "Complex Italian grammar such as the subjunctive tense. We also practiced a lot of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. For our particular section there was an emphasis on Italian films and culture because our professor is an expert in the field.",
                "I deepened my knowledge of Italian language and learnt Italian culture",
                "This course serves as an excellent continuation of L1 fall Italian. Comparatively, you can expect to focus on more advanced reading comprehension and speaking conversationally while the rigorous grammar and vocabulary learning continues. The course helps you digest harder texts in Italian and really pushes you towards a more fluent level in the language. Furthermore, as an Italian native, my instructor gave interesting cultural insights throughout the course and invited us to many department events where we could learn so much more about the country and opportunities surrounding it.",

                "Strengths: lots of engagement throughout the class that was helpful for tests and practiced a lot of speaking \r\nWeaknesses: expected us to learn the grammar topics on our own which ended up being a bit tough. Wish we slowed down and walked through parts in English at times.",
                "Strengths: very engaging in the sense that we do speak Italian in class and therefore are immersed into the language during class. The intensity of the course also allows for students to actually learn the language, rather than simply getting by.",
                "I think the course was pretty structured and liked how the professor provided a lot of support in many different aspects when needed.",
                "Could be more engaging",
                "Lots of opportunities to engage in informal discussions, give class presentations, read interesting stories, keep up with Italian news, and watch classical films in Italian.",
                "Strengths are that the course layout is very organized. A weakness would be that the difficulty of the reading comprehension portion of the final was significantly higher than that of previous exams",
                "The weaknesses are the workload is a lot with tests every other weekend. Strengths are that you learn Italian quick.",
                "A lot of interaction with Italy through reading news articles and watching movies. The feedback was also clear and I was able to ask questions whenever I had them. Some potential weaknesses are that it's a lot of content in a short amount of time.",
                "Strength - asynchronous days",
                "The strength of this course is that it's really what you make of it and malleable for teachers in a good sense. The syllabus is well structured and tries very hard to find a balance of learning all skills in the language. The small department is really such a close community- they're so open and friendly. You can go to many events to support your Italian learning experience and they make everyone welcome. From having multiple instructors across my sequence, I can say that the grading is holistically very lenient but you still are pushed to succeed in the language. Moreover, I like the oral exam and freedom of asynchronous activities (as well as the asynchronous day generally). Weaknesses: the in-class exams can seem overbearing at times. They are definitely an important commitment mechanism and progress tracker, however, combined with the compositions, it can seem hard to focus on studying. The textbook also is expensive; however, this is uniform for most languages and it serves you for a full sequence (L1+2).",

                "I would recommend this class to other students if they were interested in learning Italian and were actually serious about it. While it is not the easiest course offered at Yale, or even amongst the different language departments, I feel the intensity of the course and the exam schedule is what helps you learn. It holds you accountable and since all the material is building on top of each other, what you learned previously is constantly being practiced.",
