   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about Colonial India and the British Raj, which I previously knew almost nothing about. I also think I became a better reader and analyzer, especially of primary documents. I learned how to think in different ways to understand this part of India's history.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Professor De does a really good job of providing you with a diverse set of sources for you to read and I feel my ability to dissect a variety of sources really improved. I also feel that through looking at so many perspectives really gave a good view of the historical period we were looking at.",
    "I learned a huge amount about British rule in India, and the consequences of colonialism. I specifically learned about different symbols of British rule in India, and the development from the East India Company Rule to British Empire rule.  Learning about Ghandi, Swadeshi, and other internal Indian conflicts was fascinating as well.",
    "This course traces the history of India from the Mughal empire to the East India Company to the British Raj and partition\/independence. While I certainly learned history in this course, the most valuable skill I gained was learning how to dissect and understand primary source documents on my own. Professor De uses mostly primary source documents on his syllabus, teaching you how to understand history on your own rather than merely through secondary sources\/papers.",
    "Prior to this course, I had only taken one history lecture at Yale, and no seminars. Besides the primary object of the course  teaching the history of Britain's colonial rule in India  I learned how to sharpen historical thinking and how to conduct historical research.",
    "I learned a lot about pre-Partition India; this is a good general overview course that both provides a rough outline of the history and highlights particular concern (such as caste, certain events like the 1857 Mutiny, etc.).",
    "Professor De taught me not only about the history of India, but also how to study history in general: to think critically about primary and secondary sources, to scrutinize broad narratives about good and evil in historiography, and to understand underlying motives and biases in authors of historical documents. The course was truly fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone, history major or not.",
    "I learnt to question and critically reflect on historical narrative and the perspectives through which they are told. I also learnt to not solely rely on non fiction text as a medium of learning history.",
    "Explores the rise of colonial rule in India and the development of the colonial relationship. Special emphasis on themes like resistance, the evolution of legal institutions and Indian nationalism. Large based on reading primary sources and in-class discussion.",
    "Before beginning this class, I had no background in Indian history. I think this course helped fill a gap in my studies through that lens, but it also taught me to think critically about the homogenization process in scholarship, and the way cultural plurality can be erased and formatted through legal codification, becoming something like an organ of the state. I feel like I've learned a lot in this course from both he professor and the other students."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Its strengths are the comprehensive readings and the discussions. While I have no major criticisms, I sometimes felt like each class was separate from the others, and it was hard to understand exactly how they fit together. I wish we had spent a little more time in class making these ties, rather than just focusing on the topic of that day. But this is minor, and overall I was impressed and happy with the course.",
    "The discussions and seminars are very interesting a well-led. I really felt like a gained new knowledge from each seminar and the students get a really good opportunity to talk and share their ideas. The main flaw in the class is that in can be difficult to get a sense of how you are doing in terms of grades as there isn't a lot of graded feedback on performance. If grades do not concern you though the seminars and discussions are really some of the best.",
    "Strengths: Professor De is really good at leading a seminar and guiding a discussion. It always feels pointed, as if you're being led towards a goal as opposed to just saying things to say things in seminar. There are a lot of readings, but they all feel purposefully selected. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You don't get a lot of background information in this course, class is spent discussing the readings. You get a lot from the Metcalf & Metcalf textbook (which gives background info), but you do come out of this course with more of a general understanding than a specific one.",
    "strengths: \r\nReadings and primary sources that you will read. Prof. De is an artist when it comes to reading\/primary-source selection. The sources range from biographies, memoirs, satire to court documents. It is simply eye-opening and fascinating, and they work so well together as to complement the topics we are learning. Another strength is the class in Sterling. We got access to boxes of old photos and written sources-- it will definitely be one of my most memorable moments in class at Yale.",
    "This class was paced very well and did a great job covering broad material without sacrificing detail. The only weakness that comes to mind is that feedback for assignments sometimes came later than originally planned, although never too late to incorporate that feedback. Of course, I also used extensions for more than one assignment, so maybe it's only fair we had to wait for feedback sometimes.",
    "I think this course is well-organized, and the assignments, readings, etc. are tailored well to the course.",
    "The course was very well-constructed and well-planned, offering students a deep understanding of Indian history through an examination of texts, paintings, movies, and more. The seminar conversations were always really engaging. My only criticism is that Professor De should give grades throughout the semester because even though we received feedback, it would have been helpful to gage how well we were doing in the course.",
    "Weaknesses - the only weakness was that there was seldom reference to a timeline of events and so Im still unsure of the chronology of events that occurred.",
    "The class was well-structured, allowing for detailed in-class discussions and careful examination of the most important political and social effects of colonial rule. Visits to the YCBA were very fun and productive.Professor De chooses great readings and does a great job steering in-class discussions. I wouldn't change anything.",
    "I appreciated the way Professor De structured discussion, as he would ask us to consider incisive questions while also staging creative debates\/simulations and document analysis exercises. Our readings were excellent, although sometimes a little too heavy on primary sources (which could be difficult to really appreciate without sufficient historical context). While there was an assigned student presenter every week, student presentations occurred pretty inconsistently and it was often unclear what exactly was expected of us. Despite some confusion, Professor De made himself very accessible to us and provided excellent feedback\/advice on our final paper proposals.",
    "I think this class had really excellent discussions, and I loved all the readings, especially the primary source material. I think the course could be improved by more explicit guidelines for things like assignments and due dates."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially to another student who knows little about this topic before the course starts, it's a challenging, interesting and important introduction to Indian history.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in this time period you will learn so much and Professor De is very engaging to talk to outside of class as well.",
    "I would, and I would also recommend any course with professor De, who was spectacular.",
    "If you're interested in South Asian history and have some background in it, take this course! Professor De is an excellent professor. He is absolutely brilliant in terms of sheer knowledge, and pushes you to think critically. He's also really dedicated to his students, and cares deeply about the topic. Honestly, he makes the course worth taking!",
    "I would recommend this course to most students. It probably is not well-suited to most first-years, but it is a junior seminar, so all the usual warnings apply.",
    "Yes. I would certainly recommend it. If you want to learn about India or about how to become a better student of history in general, take this course! Just be aware of the heavy reading load and the high expectations in seminar to contribute meaningfully to the conversation.",
    "Yes I would. This course is phenomenons land Professor De does a great job at teaching students using archival materials.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in South Asian history or just looking for a great history seminar.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as I learned so much about the history of the subcontinent and about British colonialism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in ethnic studies and government studies."
