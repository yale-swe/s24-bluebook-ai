            "comments": [
                "Professor Near was a great lecturer and included many interesting examples in his lectures to help really cement the key concepts. The Ed discussions were also very helpful and the professors \/ peer tutors responded pretty quickly to our questions on that forum. I also appreciated that the pset questions prepared us for the exams which is a lesson that a lot of other Yale STEM courses could learn from.",
                "Strengths: The discussion section papers were fairly interesting. It was nice to pick your own topic for the writing assignment. Weakness: There is very little ecology. Learning the phylogenetic relationships seemed kind of pointless at times, as it wasn't very well explained what we were supposed to be taking away from all of the phylogeny. I think focusing more heavily on the evolution of traits would have helped, as the brief descriptions of trait evolution we did get were some of the best parts of the lecture.",
                "I found the problem sets and writing assignments very useful; the problem sets helped to solidify foundational concepts, and the writing assignments offered a level of personalization that allowed me to apply course content in a way that was enjoyable. The papers discussed in our weekly discussion sections were also interesting and entertaining.  \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by reducing by providing lecture outlines to emphasize the key concepts in each lecture; it was difficult at times to distinguish between primary and secondary course material. It would also be helpful to provide more practice exams.",
                "I thought the lectures were very clear and well-done. I also thought the papers chosen for the course were helpful in clarifying and expanding on topics brought up in class. No suggestions for improvement",
                "The professor said in the first lecture that course evaluations always complain about the amount of memorization required, but that he deems it necessary and has the right to include it as the lecturer for the course. Given that, there's not much for me to say here- I don't see the value of painstakingly memorizing phylogenetic trees that will always be a Google search away, but I doubt student feedback will change that.",
                "Lecture content was clear and concise. Lectures could be a bit shorter in duration.",
                "strengths - Prof. Near is amazing and makes concepts very clear and easy to memorize. Lectures are divided into shorter sections so you never feel like you're biting off more than what you can chew. Professors and TA's were very available for any questions I had. I appreciated the flow of assignments and the breaks between seminars, overall much more well-paced and manageable than BIOL 103.",
                "I feel that there is a lot of memorization and scientific jargon in this course that is not always clear. I had to study a lot for this final because I was asked about facts. I attended Enrichment with Professor Hartman, and it was great. For this class, I definitely needed to hear the information twice to fully understand.",
                "The professor was much a strength, he was always encouraging.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were structured very well, and Professor Near is an excellent lecturer. The content was very interesting, and I thought the course did especially well with virtual learning.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Nitpicking here--it would have been nice to have more practice problems. The second half of homework assignments were primarily concerned with writing review papers. While helpful, it would have been nice to have practice problems of the more application-based concepts in the second half of the course.",
                "could have had more live lectures but the teaching was great and the discussion sections were very well designed",
                "I dont think there was any weakness. Professor Nears excitement for the subject paired with the supremely structured progression of the class made learning not only easy, but fun too. I was genuinely sad this class came to an end since this was probably one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale, and I am not even in this major.",
                "This course has very interesting content. I'd say, though, that the way this content is presented on the slides is somewhat cryptic. In general, the slides were not a user-friendly experience and were often difficult to study off of.",
                "I thought that the professor lectured well, but I thought that the peer review sessions and discussion sections were very weak. During the peer review sessions and discussion sections, the leaders seemed very under prepared and unsure of how to answer students' questions. During peer review sessions I was given wrong information multiple times. During one study session we were told that whales were not mammals, even after the students in the section tried to correct the people leading the session. It was a little strange, and I was surprised that that happened. In discussion section I thought that the leader seemed very under prepared, and she would often have to pause for a long time to read the slide over and interpret graphs before describing them to us, as if she had not looked at the powerpoint before the section. In terms of the class itself, I felt that I had seen all the information before, so everything was really just review. This class was on-par with my AP Bio class.",
                "The lectures were interesting but more detailed learning objectives would have been useful",
                "Lectures were very detailed and useful \r\nWeakness - exam questions were phrased extremely vaguely at times",
                "The strengths of this course are that its more nicely graded than all the other bio sequence classes, but also the material is a little different in that it doesnt focus on experimental methods.",
                "This course was great!",
                "It was quite easy to lose focus with the virtual format of the course, which will be resolved by next semester.",
                "All the material we learned was interesting, and professor Nears lectures were easy to follow and engaging.",
                "strengths: lectures were reasonably well-delivered, peer tutors were helpful\r\n\r\nweakness: the second writing assignment for BIOL 104, in particular, was very difficult because it required responses to a very specific set of questions that was difficult to answer for the clade I chose (I assume other people had a similar issue). It would be nice if there could be an amendment to the assignment to answer a certain number of each subset of questions, perhaps. Also, I still think that discussion section slides should be publicly available to students to allow them to go over the information presented in the discussion section afterwards.",

                "very interesting topics",
                "Pretty strong overall, grading was timely and very considerate, content was very engaging. Honestly the content was a little basic, has a lot of time to incorporate some more advanced ecology\/phylogenetics\/fossils material for our edification.",
                "Strengths- the teaching staff is amazing and the course material is super interesting!! Weaknesses-none",
                "Strengths: Very lowkey workload, Prof Near is a complete sweetheart, my TA was FABULOUS, the topics were interesting and not overly complex (almost gut level), chill well-written midterms\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Much more focused on specific case studies (all very interesting) than overarching topics so sometimes it's hard to understand the specific reason behind the learning (i.e. \"how am I supposed to apply this knowledge?\"\/\"What topic does this knowledge fit into?\").",
                "The lectures are interesting and the material is engaging. Professor Near is a really great lecturer. There is quite a bit of memorization involved, which is unavoidable, and sometimes it's hard to discern what is important for exams and what isn't. The writing assignment was interesting, but could be tough to research depending on your topic.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- fair workload\r\n- Prof. Near \r\n- recorded lectures made it flexible\r\n- Prof. Hartman, available enrichment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none as of now",
                "The course was generally taught very well - the structure was very conducive to learning it",

                "Strength- enrichment",
                "The content is very interesting, engaging and well organized. Weaknesses: I wish the lectures were live sothat we can ask questions during the lectures.",
                "the test questions are worded in an extremely unnecessary manner, purposely causing confusion",
                "I think the strengths were mainly the teaching team because they did a very good job of conveying the material in an interesting and engaging way. A weakness was that there was only two psets that let us practice our knowledge of the material and the rest of the homework was just doing research. I think we would have benefited from more psets or at least some more practice problems.",
                "Very intriguing content that covers a wide range of examples without diving too far into unnecessary details. Provided an excellent overview of EE&B.",
                "The course was set up very well with an engaging instructor that maximized the opportunities for an online learning setting",
                "I thought that the pace and workload of the course was very manageable, and that the course was very well adapted to remote learning. I do think that maybe posting the live virtual sessions would have been beneficial for those who were unable to attend, as I noticed that the latter sessions were not on canvas.",
                "I think the lectures were very comprehensive and provided many interesting examples of topics being discussed. I liked the discussion sections where we discussed papers, but I wish the time weren't so regimented and that we could discuss our thoughts on the paper more freely.",
                "I liked the synchronous discussion sections and the asynchronous lecture combination",
                "I felt as if this course was overall very manageable. At times I will say that it felt as if there was too much material to learn in a single week and that the papers for section were a little too difficult but were always explained during section itself.",
                "The content was interesting but the guidelines to the papers were a bit vague.",
                "It was easy to learn and get help. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "I really thought that Professor Near did a good job of explaining and going over the content on the exam. I think it would've been helpful to practice more exam-style questions on problem sets or optional proactices throughout the semester."

                "The amount and quality of resources was amazing for this class and because of that I never felt alone or like I couldn't ask for help. Also the two earlier psets were incredibly helpful for understanding the earlier mathematical-based concepts.",
                "I think for this class, the pre-recorded lectures worked very well. Switching to smaller discussion sections also helped a lot.",
                "A pre-recorded lecture format allows students to move through the course material at their own pace, and a live discussion section format enhances student engagement; combining these models provided a balanced learning experience. In fact, I think the course would have benefitted from additional discussion sections.",
                "I found the combination of recorded lectures and live discussions to be very effective for my learning.",
                "The recorded lectures worked well- the professor was a good lecturer, and it was very convenient to be able to speed up and slow down the lectures as necessary.",
                "Pre recorded lectures were good!",
                "Definitely creating shorter lectures was a smart move on the part of the teaching team, it was very manageable. The workload and content in and of itself was also a lot easier to go through with the pandemic and my other commitments.",
                "I feel that virtual pre-recorded lectures were great. I could rewatch parts that were confusing and that helped me learn.",
                "I thought that the lectures were very engaging, and the discussion sections were planned very well. Overall, this course went beyond my expectations for virtual learning.",
                "could have done more live virtual lectures to be more engaging but the ones that were provided were great and the recorded lectures were still very well done",
                "Overall the lectures worked well recorded. I thought that the discussion sections did not work well at all. Maybe only 5 people in the whole section participated or spoke in breakout rooms. It was frustrating.",
                "I like that the recorded lectures allowed me to work through the material at my own pace.",
                "Perhaps live lectures to allow for questions but everything else was fine",
                "Enrichment is amazing",
                "I enjoyed all aspects of this course",
                "Even though the virtual lectures allowed the students to easily lose focus, it was nice to be able to re-watch portions of the lecture which were challenging.",
                "remote lectures were honestly pretty well delivered and informative; however, I think the writing assignments were rather complicated and perhaps could have been made more manageable if the professor had made videos going over the assignments.",
                "none",
                "Recorded lectures should be used even in a regular year, discussion sections should have a virtual option even in a regular year; all great!",
                "The Ed posts were nice for engagement and was often something I found myself wishing my other classes had.",
                "recorded lectures increased flexibility, closed note tests within a half-semester course in the pandemic were burdensome and led to cramming",
                "I feel like it could have benefitted if there were collaborative pset sessions and a bit more guidance for the final paper",
                "Only one interactive session. Not enough",
                "The interactive hours were good, unfortunately, they were during my class and someone forgot to record them.",
                "Recorded lectures definitely got a bit long.",
                "Engagement",
                "The continuous support provided by Professor Hartman was absolutely essential in my opinion.",
                "The course was very unmotivating and uninteresting because all lectures were pre recorded. There was little personal interaction and I never even had the chance to speak to the professor because he was only reachable through email. Lectures could be improved and clarified  by focusing on clear concise concepts that students should know and memorize for the exams, rather than mentioning 50% of what we should know and investing the other 50% in random information that \"may\" interest some, further causing confusion on what material should and shouldnt be studied.",
                "I think everything succeeded because everything was explained in quite a bit of detail so it was not an issue when we could not ask questions.",
                "Recorded lectures were very well organized and informative, and they were presented in a very digestible fashion (not too long). Engagement was difficult though due to covid.",
                "It was very helpful that the professor had an open session on Wednesdays to help with student engagement.",
                "I found that treating the class and its recorded lectures, although asynchronous, as a normal course and adapting to the environment was very helpful. I feel that sometimes classes may be very overwhelming as the professors are unable to accurately gauge the stress and anxiety facing students when everything is remote. However, this class did an amazing job, such as reducing the workload around the time of midterms and finals to allow us to focus on studying, as these little things greatly helped me get through remote learning.",
                "The recorded lectures delivered the material effectively, but I would have loved a live lecture where we could ask questions and interact more with the professors.",
                "I thought that this course did a wonderful job at getting the information across in a virtual format! I really appreciated the asynchronous nature and thought that the psets in the beginning of the course really helped solidify the content! I think that at times that videos were too long or there were too many of them though.",
                "I think Enrichment sections were very helpful."

                "You're probably taking it for a requirement but yes I would! Personally it was my favorite module of the series and on the easier side compared to 102 and 103. One difference is that this course focuses on memorization more than the other modules, so be prepared for a lot more details!",
                "Absolutely! This was probably my favorite intro bio sequence course and was a great way to wrap up the year.",
                "Yes! The course material was interesting, the assignments were rather enjoyable, and the course is well-organized.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, particularly to any students interested in biology or evolution more specifically.",
                "NOTE: MB&B majors do not need to take BIOL 104 (or 103) if you email the DUS!\r\nI'd recommend this course to someone with a legitimate interest in the material, as it was well-taught. That said, the memorization will not be enjoyable if you don't really care about the material.",
                "Yes for students interested in biology!",
                "Even if you're not interested in E&EB, this is an interesting course to take!",
                "Yes! I learned a lot of interesting information about the development of different species.",
                "Yes, Near is very encouraging and the topics are very good.",
                "Yes. This course really helps round out the whole intro bio sequence. The lectures were taught very well, and Prof. Near is a very passionate, clear lecturer. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject material.",
                "Yes!! Super interesting and the perfect way to wrap up the bio sequence. Absolutely loved 104",
                "absolutely, amazing instructor and very fun to learn about",
                "Absolutely, take it even if you have no interest because I guarantee you will come out with at least a little more insight about the natural world around us and you will have fun doing it.",
                "Only if it's a necessary pre-req for them.",
                "If someone wanted a overview of ecology and evolutionary biology, sure. I think it is good background for other more in-depth classes.",
                "Yes, it taught me a lot and will be very valuable to have under my belt when I take higher level Biology classes.",
                "Yes. The lectures are generally well-organized and clearly presented and the assessments are fair. The quality of the discussion section depends heavily on the TF.",
                "Yes, take this course if necessary for pre med.",
                "Yes its part of the bio sequence",
                "Yes I would, especially if you're premed",
                "Yes, good foundation course for E&EB",
                "if you are interested in any major that requires the intro bio sequence or are thinking of going pre-med, then yes, I would definitely recommend this course! As a caveat, I will say that this was possibly my least favorite of the four intro bio modules (except for maybe BIOL 102 due to its difficulty level, but not sure about that), but that probably has more to do with my own individual interests than the way the course was delivered. However, I still thought the course overall was decent and there were some parts of it I found interesting.",
                "Yes if required or interested in the subject.",
                "this was one of the most interesting courses I have taken",
                "I would- I enjoyed the subject and the way the professor taught",
                "Yes, pretty strong overall, grading was timely and very considerate, content was very engaging. Honestly the content was a little basic, has a lot of time to incorporate some more advanced ecology\/phylogenetics\/fossils material for our edification. Pretty unfair that our class year wasnt able to test out of any modulesbasically discrediting those that are already knowledgeable enough to pass the exam solely on the basis of the pandemic, not actual brainpower",
                "Yes! Workload is not too heavy at all and material is very interesting, super fair exams as well!",
                "Definitely would recommend this class. It's enjoyable, easy, interesting, and the professor is wonderful.",
                "yes, it was interesting and gave me a better understanding of evolutionary biology and ecology",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class, especially if you're looking to complete the biology sequence. I'm not a biology major, just interested in biology, and I'm glad I took this course because I felt that I learned a lot.",
                "If you have to take it.",
                "Because it is part of the bio sequence, I would tell students needing to take the bio sequence that it is a highlight of the bio sequence. But, given it is only a half-credit course, I wouldn't recommend this as a science credit to other students.",
                "Yes, take this course if you need the prerequisite or are interested in the subject",
                "Yes, most people don't think about ecology and evolution when they think MCDB or MBB, but it's very interesting and relevant stuff.",
                "This course is a great introduction to EEB. Professor Nears teaching style is easy to follow, and hes quite passionate about the subject. Also, having Prof Hartman lead all four classes in the intro bio sequence has made adapting to different teaching styles so much easier.",
                "Yes. you need it",
                "Yes, I think even beyond wanting to learn biology this course is super interesting and I recommend that all majors take it.",

                "Yes",

                "I would recommend this course to anybody who has an interest in biology but does not want to deal with learning the very intricate experiments that led to our understanding of the concepts.",
                "Yes! Great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes, the professor was engaging and I received a clear understanding of the material.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in biology! The content was very interesting in this part of the biology sequence! I would say that it might be too much work for a class that one is taking for fun but may be worth it if you're also looking to fulfill a requirement!",
                "Yes a foundational course, applicable in different areas that was done in an interesting manner.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in STEM.",
