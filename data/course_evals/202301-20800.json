                "Overall nice. The assignment can be better designed",
                "Strengths: got a pretty in-depth introduction to NLP and learned about the state of the field almost up to present day. Also a strength - Drago :( Afterwards, the CS DUS came in to talk to us about how they were going to proceed with the course etc and I appreciated that he did so and the way that he explained the changes. Also appreciated Arman coming in halfway through the course and picking up the content that was left. Weaknesses: kinda hard to pay attention in class/the slides did not feel like they were setting us up for success. I would have appreciated having the slides posted before class to follow along during lecture, and also having a clearer roadmap of why we were talking about certain topics and how different slides related to each other. Sometimes it felt like we totally just jumped from one topic to another.",
                "The strengths of this course include the introduction of many concepts related to NLP.\r\nThe weakness of this course is that there isn't much technical coding content in the lectures, while the assignments were mainly based on high-level coding.",
                "The course material is, for the most part, very interesting. The course spends a lot of time on models that are not used very often anymore, but that's sort of an unavoidable issue with such a rapidly evolving field - it's also still very enlightening to learn a bit about models like BERT. There were plenty of organizational foibles - grades take a very long time, for instance - but that is more than forgivable considering the timing of Drago's unfortunate passing.",
                "The strength of this course is how it started with easy-to-understand concepts and later dived deeper. Extra adapting time was required as the first and second half of this course have drastically different styles of how the materials are delivered but I understand it was inevitable. It would be helpful if, for each coding assignment, there can be a session that provides general guidance instead of just the office hours where each student asks respective questions.",
                "Pretty well designed course other than the final, which was chaotic to prepare for given that we were kept completely in the dark about what we should expect on it. The least they could have done was give us a review session but they explicitly refused to do that saying they \"didn't think it was necessary\" even when they simultaneously admitted the exam was completely new and they couldn't provide previous tests to prepare based on.",
                "So far so good.",
                "The course was well structured and I feel using exams was appropriate in this context given that implementing or using LLMs is not that feasible in a classroom setting.",

                "The course is mainly taught via powerpoints, but I enjoyed the format because it provides a really nice visual way to grasp different architectures and representations of concepts like Word2Vec. The PSETs (espec coding ones) were on the challenging side, but the lectures did a good job introducing what concepts would be important for them. Class discussions occurred through a website called piazza but the the TAs were really helpful and came in clutch with quick response times!! Overall, the structure was really good given the unfortunate hurdles thrown at NLP this year (change of professor mid way through).",

                "We had a unique situation with our professor passing through the semester. I imagine this course will look different in the future. One thing I will recommend is having some background in ML before the class. Itll allow you to engage better because youll be learning about those techniques being applied to linguistics, instead of also having to simultaneously learn the techniques. Its not a hard requirement but I think itll allow you to have a better experience. Without any linear algebra or ML, I struggled to engage with a class that is generally easy to disengage in (this is unfortunately true for many cs classes because of the ability to just address assignments and exams ad hoc instead of paying attention all semester)",
                "I would because students can really learn a lot from this class.",
                "Yes! I think the class covers more breadth than depth in relation to NLP topics (if you have a lot of prior experience) but given most students are taking it with very little exposure to NLP prior, it really helps open your understanding of the different settings that NLP could be used in. We covered everything from the linguistic side to the mathematical side to the architecture side of various models, and the psets had very applicable NLP problems.",
