                "English 120 really helped to reinspire a passion for r/w that I haven't had in a longggg time. The class is structured in such a way that readings are interesting, essays are short with a focus on revision, and there is ample space to get very creative with style.",
                "I learned to write with specificity. I started thinking about each sentence, and I learned how to read for both craft and content. I learned to dig deep on a small topic (such as a place, an experience), and to not rush to move on.",
                "I learned how to better extract styles and ideas from other writers and apply it to my own stories. From this class, I have learned how to articulate and express myself better.",
                "Confidence in my own writing and artistic ideas, learning about various approaches to writing nonfiction essays, giving and receiving helpful advice from peers, and generally a renewed appreciation for short-form literature.",
                "I learned how to write personal essays, how to write with specificity, and generally improved my writing. It was the perfect course to boost my confidence in my own writing. I also learned how to read and analyze other essays. Take this with RKN! She really cares for each person in the class, and ensures that people don't struggle.",
                "I learned so much about not just creative writing but expressing myself more clearly, talking about issues close to my heart, being specific in my writing, and editing non-fiction texts.",
                "My writing improved so so so much during thus course! I improved from the sentence and word level to the flow of my entire essay. I enjoy writing so much more now as well because I have much more depth as a writer than I did before.",
                "- how to approach essay writing from a non-academic lens \r\n- writing at the sentence level",
                "This course taught me to think critically about writing. I had anticipated learning most about the content of my writing, analyzing texts for their deeper meaning. Instead, we focused on the surface level, structural aspects of writing. I was surprised, but learned so much about clear, quality writing this way. All choices when writing are deliberate. Thinking so critically about the exact syntax I used to put my thoughts on a page allowed me writing to develop to a much deeper level than I had anticipated.",
                "My writing benefited in nearly every way because of this course. I learned how to write with clarity, with creativity, with personality, and with purpose. I was taught how to critically and actively analyze writing, approaching it as a craft composed of deliberate choices rather than a static image. We did this with both our own writing and the wide array of pieces we read in class. I also became much more comfortable with receiving criticism about my writing. Before this class, I was always reticent when it came to sharing my writing, especially when it was personal in nature. The peer workshops, in all their forms, showed me the value of feedback, even when it may be uncomfortable at first. I had always thought writing had to be serious, but I learned that I shined most when my writing was playful and colorful. I would like to believe that growth in writing is reflected in my personal growth, too.",
                "English 120 allowed me to develop my writing skills as well as my understanding of my place in the world around me. This course pushed me to think more about the structure of my essays and consider how my words impact those who read them.",
                "The intensity of practicing to write often and reading different styles of writing expanded my appreciation for writing. I learned about the importance of writing through implication and using short sentences. I learned that a big portion of writing is off the paper and in the form of reflection. Valuing what you have to say and trusting that the reader is following your thoughts is essential to writing a great piece.",
                "Through the act of writing essays nearly every week and reading many fantastic pieces, I vastly improved my writing and developed a voice in my essays."

            "comments": [
                "The strength is definitely the focus on revision. I haven't ever in my educational history spent so much time learning not just how to write, but also to rewrite. I can't think of any major weaknesses.",
                "I was very impressed by the level of engagement from students in the class. Rachel deftly moderated the discussion in each class and they were central to improving my reading skills.",
                "I think a great strength is the size and the continuity. In our weekly Tuesday/Thursday meetings, we built a small community where we could play off of a mixture of learning, discussing, and workshopping.",
                "Strengths: Many writing prompts, just giving many opportunities to get the creative juices flowing and to practice writing about personal experiences.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, RKN does a great job about offering help and prompting discussion during class. She also gives great feedback. Her feedback clearly stated what parts of my essays seemed off and what I could expand on and delete.",
                "The class was incredibly well organized, with the instructor being very involved with all of our personal writing processes and development as creative writers. The peer workshops worked really well; even more of them could have been involved throughout the curriculum. Even more brainstorming and author visits would have been great too. But overall, the strengths of the class came from the wonderful environment that the instructor was able to produce; everybody gave each other feedback very constructively, and every single class was very engaging.",
                "strengths: lots of practice, diverse readings, great teacher, great feedback\r\nweaknesses: this course format (5 essays) might not work for everyone but it worked for me!",
                "The readings were well selected and everyone in the class participated nearly daily out of interest, not requirement of participation. I think that doing more peer editing would have been helpful, because the one unit we did peer editing on was one of the best pieces I wrote in the course. Having another student read my work and talk through it with me was exceptionally helpful in my revision process.",
                "The overall approach to writing is a standout strength of this course. In particular, the revision process is highly conducive to improving writing. You turn in a draft one week, receive feedback, then have the opportunity to make edits and improve your piece before turning it in for a grade. This process removed a lot of the pressure I felt with writing, and it is very conducive to taking risks, which I believe is an invaluable aspect of improving your writing. I also thought the collection of pieces we read was a strength. They all felt very distinct and had different qualities to chew on. The class discussions about those pieces were also never dull. Finally, the actual class time was augmented with many writing exercises that were great for generating and playing with ideas, even if I never used them.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses :)",
                "This course is already very well structured. I enjoy working with peers to review drafts and I also love how there are two drafts for every paper.",
                "Strengths: a lot of practice writing, you receive a lot of feedback from the professor and from your peers, you read an array of pieces (all essential to understanding the unit topic you will be writing about.\r\nWeaknesses: feedback is not focused on grammar mostly on content so if you have challenges with grammar you have to do work outside of class (perhaps at the writing center).",
                "No real weaknesses, perhaps more ability to do peer review with other students. I got a lot of helpful feedback when I did my workshop with the class, and it would be nice to get that experience for more than just one essay."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if it will be one of a few English/writing classes you'll be taking at Yale. It is well-created for writers at every level, so regardless of where you are, you will learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading and writing. The course readings were enjoyable and didn't feel like a chore. The essays allowed me to write about topics that I was interested in. It's been a great experience!",
                "I would highly recommend this class to another student! I really loved the opportunity that English 120 provides for reflection and self-expression. My professor did a great job of constantly supporting me as I tried out new styles and helping me discover what works and what doesn't work in my writing.",
                "Yes! You get to basically just read and talk about a bunch of interesting essays with a small group of people, and just have to write 4-5 essays which will make you think back on your life and experiences. This is a sweet, rewarding class, and if you take it seriously it can reveal interesting things about yourself.",
                "Yes! Take it with RKN, she's such a sweet, kind, caring person that wants people to improve their writing. I was also able to reflect on many of my personal experiences and come to terms with many things in my life. I really think this class is one of the best ones offered at Yale, especially with RKN.",
                "Yes, totally. This course challenges you to question what you know about writing and the ways in which we are accustomed to writing our Yale compositions. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive guide to giving and receiving feedback, thinking carefully about the craft of writing, and engaging with non-fiction works on a very fundamental level.",
                "Absolutely-- course was incredibly accessible to me as a student with interest in creative writing but little background in the subject. Course was refreshingly accessible and I wish there were more English courses like this at Yale which are intimate seminars that are rigorous but not exclusive.",
                "Yes, I would 100%. This class didn't even feel like work to me. I loved working on all of my pieces. My writing improved so much!",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to students wishing to expand on their writing skill and receive personalized constructive feedback.",
                "Yes. Take this course, no matter what your major is. I'm an engineering student, but the same opinion has been held by my friends who study English and the humanities. You will learn so much about the basics of writing well that will elevate your work to new levels. I loved writing before I took this class, and considered myself to be a very good writer. Regardless of this, I received so much feedback on all of my writing that  made me realize there's so much more to love about English and word play than I had known before.",
                "I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student (and I already have many times!). I think English 120 is a course every Yale student should take, not just to fulfill a writing distributional credit but to grow as a student across all disciplines. I would love to take this course again if I had the opportunity.",
                "Yes! I honestly think that every student should take English 120it was such a wonderful way to reflect on my life and it also helped me better my academic writing.",
                "Of course, I had not written personal essays since the college application process and I realized how much I miss it and love it. We often do not do self reflection on our own lives and opinions and this class pushes you to do so. The skills you learn in this class about reflection, analysis, writing with clarity, and more are skills that are applicable everywhere.",
                "Yes take this course! You will read a lot of great essays and produce some pieces that you will be proud of."
