                "You learn a lot about the intricacies of popular music. Pop music gets a bad rep from a lot of \"elitists\" or \"experts\" who claim music have been going \"downhill\", but if you sit down and take the time to actually analyze the music, there is actually a lot of interesting things to analyze and learn! Definitely learned more about modes, harmony, timbre, some pop music history, and modern analytical techniques.",
                "After learning some basic theory (MUSI 210), this course really expands your understanding of music by exploring multiple different avenues of examining and analyzing popular music, beyond the strict confines of what is considered \"classical\" music theory. It's rewarding to apply the skills we learned in class (roman numeral analysis on chord movements, production, instrumentation, pitch qualities, etc) on a variety of popular music genres in refreshing and unique ways that are immediately practical to popular music rather than trying to square them with some prior understanding of Western art music.",
                "I gained insight on how variable different styles of music and types of musical analysis can be, and an appreciation for and greater understanding of pop music. I learned how to analyze pop through its own lens rather than just broadly applying a more classical lens. I also got practice with basic music theory skills (key signature, roman numeral analysis, ...), although the focus of the class was not to learn these skills but to apply them. I also have become more comfortable and familiar with discussing what I hear in music.",
                "I learned about various ways to analyze and describe popular music. Although I learned more about some standard musical elements (like song structure, chord progressions, tonality, etc.), this course really helped open my mind to different aspects of music that I hadn't considered previously. I thought a lot more about how songs can convey different messages and\/or feelings, and while it might be difficult to pinpoint how exactly a pop artist went about composing their song, a lot of this music can hint at its greater context in history\/life in general.",
                "I learned a lot about pop music analysis, in particular about common structures in pop music and how they are used by various artists.",
                "I learned about how to analyze a popular music song. This includes noting the harmonic structure, rhythmic density, and melodic characteristics. We discussed the differences between chromatic\/diatonic and modal\/tonal pieces. I developed an greater ability to transcribe a pop song.",

                "The class has a lot of strengths. Nate is very receptive to your ideas and typically incorporates the idea to a bigger picture. The discussions and readings are engaging, and no matter what your music tastes are, you can present it to class and use the same analytical techniques you learn in class on it too.",
                "Nate and Bronwen's teaching are both phenomenal. After basic terminology and concepts particular to pop are introduced, there's an immediate sense of freedom as we shift to independently exploring and analyzing pieces of music that interest us before presenting them to the class. Since pop music theory is a relatively new field, it makes sense that the class becomes more open-ended, but that's to our benefit, especially since we then learn so much from what we all looked into.",
                "A strength of this course was the focus on student engagement and input. I felt really empowered to talk about what I was interested in, and I really appreciated that we were able to bring our own thoughts and interests to the table and the class was really reflective of what everyone wanted from it. Another strength was Nate and Bronwen's passion for music, both of them were really engaging because they were excited about what they were bringing to us. I really like pop music but it is often seen as less worthy of analysis than other forms of music. I really appreciated the way that Nate and Bronwen taught us to value pop music analysis, having professors with this more open minded perspective gave me the chance to actually learn about and investigate the music I like. A weakness of this course is that we didn't focus too much on technical music theory because it was assumed as prior knowledge, but sometimes I wasn't as familiar with a topic as most people and felt a little confused in the general discussion. I think it might be helpful if there was a little more review of the more technical stuff. Also, the way that we were being assessed was a little unclear. This might be due to covid\/ this being a new class, but I think I would have benefitted from a more detailed explanation of how grades are going to be assigned.",
                "The students and professors in this class were all very insightful and made me think about things in new ways (and introduced me to a lot of new music!). I liked that Nate spent a lot of time sharing examples and allowing us to naturally contribute to the discussion. I also really liked that Bronwen added unique perspectives with her experience in music cognition. Questions were always welcome throughout the class and on the discussion board, and we were given a lot of freedom to bring our own interests to the discussion through assignments. The readings were also diverse and fun to reference alongside our discussions and assignments. I believe this was a new course this year, so there wasn't a strict plan to follow, but it could be useful to have some brief summary notes posted before\/after each class to solidify any basic topics\/terminology. However, we seemed to emphasize that there wasn't any \"code\" or list of specific rules to follow in much of pop music, so it makes sense that we didn't spend as much time drilling concepts as might be expected in a general music theory course. Another potential improvement could be brief written comments at the end of each assignment to keep in mind for future assignments, although we generally went over student assignments in class the next week anyway, and the assignments were pretty open (there wasn't necessarily a \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer), so this wasn't a big issue either.",
                "The course was incredibly flexible and allowed students to steer the direction of the course, which I think was possible given that it was the first time the course was offered. Although MUSI 207 was my first music theory course at Yale, I would imagine it is significantly easier compared to other music theory courses and offers an introduction to pop music theory without the worries of grades and intensive assignments.",
                "I thought it was mostly very good, although some of the discussion was hampered by the course not being in person.",
                "The course was well taught and organized. I enjoyed the discussion style to this class. I appreciated the aspect of being able to bring in and analyze student-chosen pieces. This broadened my perspective into genres which I would have not have otherwise listened to.",
                "All around a very solid course. The class content was always super interesting, and it was explained well. My only minor complaints are that sometimes the readings were a bit technical and we didn't discuss them in a ton of detail, and sometimes assignments were mentioned in class but the specifics of the assignment weren't on canvas (e.g. the final paper)."

While it would have been wonderful to take this class in person, I still did feel like we were able to have interesting, engaging discussions over zoom. I don't think I got as much from the discussion forum on canvas because it was a less direct interaction, and not everyone was really using it, but it was interesting to see some people's thoughts.",
                "I think this course being an interactive seminar allowed for greater engagement than a pre-recorded lecture class. It also was helpful to utilize the discussion board to share ideas outside of class time. I thought actively listening to music together and contributing comments either by voice or through the chat also helped keep us engaged in each class.",

                "Yes! Most definitely. If you have perfect pitch and have taken MUSI 210 & 211, then this class would be even better haha. Despite not having taken those classes and not having perfect pitch, I think the class is very accessible to people with different musical backgrounds. This actually became the strength of the class, since we had people who were amazing at theory who helped with the raw analysis portions and people with rock band and EDM backgrounds who gave us their input when those types of songs were being analyzed. The diversity of students in the class really helped shape the discussions, and the students shed light on aspects of the songs that I never considered. I definitely recommend the class to anyone, even to those people who are not that interested in popular music (like me haha). I think this class gave me a greater appreciation for popular music like those of Ariana Grande and Beyonce.",

                "Yes I definitely would. This class expanded the way that I think about music theory, and about what kinds of music we tend to value. I really enjoy pop music but I always thought that classical music was \"more advanced\" or somehow more worthy of analysis, and this class showed me that this was not true. It was really great being able to analyze the music that I like, and I learned so much about pop music, plus got exposed to a lot more pop music in the process. Nate and Bronwen are both super helpful, interesting, kind, and flexible, and they really focused the class on what we wanted to learn. If you are more interested in practicing technical theory, like an extension of what is covered in 110, I would not recommend the course because we didn't focus too much on that. But if you are interested in more broadly studying pop music and how it functions, I would suggest taking it!",
                "Yes! This course was definitely a highlight of my semester! The atmosphere was welcoming and calm, and I really looked forward to listening to new songs each class. Everyone comes with different backgrounds, so it's really cool to hear other's thoughts\/interpretations. I definitely have a much more open mind when listening to music now, and I look forward to thinking more abstractly about musical affect\/interpretation in future theory courses. The assignments were fun to explore and not at all overwhelming, and Nate and Bronwen brought slightly different perspectives to the class. Each class felt like a relatively relaxed discussion of music with (very knowledgeable) friends!",
                "For anyone interested in the music theory of today's pop music, I would recommend this course. You do need to have some basic understanding of keys, chords, and cadences. Being able to hear the chords in a song is a great plus, but not necessary.",
                "Yes, it was fun and interesting.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student.
