    "I had never taken an anthropology class before, so I learned how to think in the perspective of an anthropologist. We covered a lot of veins of anthropology, like cultural, social, biological, physical, philosophical, and linguistic (which was probably my favorite).",
    "This course helped me think more deeply about what it means to inhabit a world and ways of imagining worlds different from our own. The course also served as an introduction to anthropology for me. Analyzing literary and linguistic worlds was the most interesting to me, especially the readings on possible world semantics and design features of language."

   "comments": [
    "There was a ton of reading, which I think was mainly a strength (even though it was a bit difficult to get through sometimes, especially with other commitments outside of class) -- we covered so much material, and I feel like I have a pretty solid base at least in the fundamentals of many veins of anthropology. The class was a seminar-style class, with fewer than 20 people, so a lot of class periods were discussion-based, which was nice. I think it would have helped me if we had had a clearer syllabus\/outline of the topics we'd cover throughout the class, and then a more structured plan for each individual class period. Sometimes I felt a little scattered and unsure of where anthropology, or indeed possible worlds, came in to our readings and discussions, and I think an outline would have helped me.",
    "I love the class style of a combination of both lectures and discussions. All the readings are amazing too!",
    "The seminar format of the course was definitely a strong point, and regular participation in deep discussion of the readings was very much appreciated. The material covered during the course, while demanding, was nonetheless always appropriate."

   "comments": [
    "I would probably recommend this course to another student. I found the materials very interesting, and Professor Kockelman is clearly very knowledgeable on a variety of topics within the field of anthropology.",
    "Yes, I think the topic is so broad that any student could contribute something to it, yet so fundamental that taking the class gives you a whole new perspective on the idea of possible worlds and worlding.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in literature, anthropology, linguistics, ecology, and lots of other fields would find taking this course rewarding."
