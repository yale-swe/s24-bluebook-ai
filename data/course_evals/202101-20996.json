                "This course emphasized skills in reading economic materials - both formal and informal - while initiating a dialog about the ramifications of social and political problems.",
                "Evaluated the literature on a multitude of important social and economic issues facing the United States. Mostly covered economic mobility and opportunity, but also the current state of the climate change crisis, the criminal justice system, and equality, among other topics.",
                "We discussed many social issues much more deeply and from an empirical point of view.",
                "I learned about various social issues in America through an economic and data lens. This course opened my eyes to so many issues from equality of opportunity and housing to education and climate change in the U.S. I learned to critically think from different perspectives about not only the ways in which these issues have developed and affected society over time but also the impact of using data for policymaking.",
                "In this course, I received a (non-comprehensive) introduction to R and learned strategies for engaging critically with economics research and literature.",
                "I gained a very broad overview of different social issues in America and a much better sense of how economists approach researching such problem.",
                "This course was helpful in providing me with a better foundational understanding of data analysis techniques including R studio and what they can be used for. It is a great course for introducing yourself to economics research, especially if you're interested in recent research regarding issues impact the United States today. Great tools for anyone particularly interested in policy making.",

                "I developed knowledge and insights about how to use economics to evaluate and developed policy solutions for social issues in America such as housing, climate change, economic inequality, college access, healthcare, etc. I gained insights into the interdisciplinary application of various economic techniques and the potential that granular data has in the field of economics and sociology. I gained skills to better understand economic research and how to conduct experiments to evaluate various economic factors and effects on social issues.",

                "The class gave a nice general overview of how big data can drive economic research in a variety of fields. We went over a variety of topics from income inequality to climate change to health care where data-driven research has given us insight into specific research areas, such as the effect of childhood neighborhoods on adult income outcomes or whether cap-and-trade programs create pollution inequalities. Although the class doesn't delve in-depth in any specific topic, you learn a lot of tidbits about different fields in economics research."

                "I absolutely loved this seminar. It was extremely engaging and the professor encouraged us to always share our thoughts regarding the readings and studies.",
                "Strengths: The professor!! Professor Toseland is literally the kindest human being ever. This semester (being remote) was definitely tough for everyone, and she made such a great effort to make us all feel super supported, welcome, and engaged in the course. Also, the course material was presented so well and clearly -- it made for some great discussions! Weaknesses: honestly, I can't think of any!",
                "Strengths: The setup of the course is very engaging. The projects are something I have never experienced before and I loved the diversity. The freedom to pick topics for the final paper is wonderful. Professor Toseland is absolutely amazing! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the powerpoints that came along with the discussions would limit the places the discussion would go. It is definitely a hard balance though because very frequently the powerpoints would be wonderful to prospering discussions, but there were days when we ended up just talking about specific graphs instead of the problem we were discussing.",
                "Strengths: format of the whole course was great, excellent balance between professor instruction and student-led discussion, good work load; Weaknesses: only wish was that racial equality section included more discussion on a diverse array of minority groups (latinx, native americans, asian americans, etc.)",
                "I really enjoyed this class, one of my favorites this semester! Though I do wish we were able to cover more social issues",
                "Strengths: The themes of the course were incredibly diverse and important, including education, healthcare, criminal justice reform, etc. The coursework and readings per class were manageable as well. In-class discussions were extremely interactive, and the seminar format allowed everyone to participate. Weaknesses: I think we spent much more time on certain topics than others, which I felt we didn't have enough time to fully discuss. Also sometimes the same people 3-4 people would participate in class discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor Toseland is wonderful and incredibly helpful, the course topics and materials are well-organized, guest lectures are really engaging, seminar discussions can be, at times, super insightful and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally, I wished that we would touch more explicitly on economic theory and how that was represented in some of the research we were looking at.",
                "I think the strengths were how approachable the professor was and how specific the research we looked at was. I think the course could have included more background at the beginning in basic economics principles so that they could have been applied later in the course.",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is Prof. Toseland. She is engaging in class and is an extraordinary person to talk to in office hours - always willing to help. The readings were also a great part of this class as they never felt too long\/burdensome but I feel as if I learned a lot from them and they prepared me for the class discussion that was to follow; Prof. Toseland also provided guiding questions that helped you focus on the key takeaways from the readings. In-class discussion and the slides were also a strength as the structure helped assure that we covered the key points of the topic at hand. The guest lectures were also very interesting. As for weaknesses, there aren't any in particular that I can think of from the top of my head.",
                "This class is has very compelling readings and the Professor did a good job of selecting relevant, interesting material that engages the students. Perhaps the class could have some simple R side assignments to further the exploration of R.",
                "The class is incredibly well organized and the readings for each day are interesting and presented to you in a very digestible way.",
                "Strengths: seminar style allowed lots of opportunities for discussion, Professor Toseland was very helpful\/supportive in writing papers and having class discussions, the readings were very interesting.",
                "I thought the topics we looked into were interesting, and I liked that it was very discussion-based. Though sometimes I felt that we didnt get a chance to go very deep into the topics with our discussions.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is its discussion-based format, which makes class really fun and engaging and gives us a lot of room to discuss the readings in the class. The course readings are relatively light and easy to read (not burdensome at all) and you learn a lot of interesting things about a variety of socioeconomic research topics. However, you don't go in-depth in any specific area (excluding the topic you choose to focus on in your final project), which means that the knowledge you gain in this class is mostly general and\/or on a very specific research topic and not very wide-reaching in any general economics topic (like healthcare or education)."

                "I really thing everyone in the class did their best to be engaged in discussion which set up the environment to be student led talks most of the time",

                "Of all my virtual classes, this was probably the most engaging. I enjoyed the seminar  format and think that the lectures by Professor Toseland and guests helped to elevate our discussions.",
                "I think this course allowed for as much engagement as a virtual world allows for. One practice of the course that I thought was really cool was the use of Perusall for the readings, a website that allows one to make annotations that are visible to your classmates and to the professor. I thought that was one really cool way of being able to engage even though I found myself using it less often that I'd have hoped. The formation of study groups is another thing that I think was good as it allowed for some one-on-one interaction with other students. Though I'm not the biggest advocate for breakout rooms, I do think that they could have been used a tiny amount more just to encourage a little more mixing among students. Overall, the course was great at sustaining virtual engagement both on Zoom and outside of Zoom.",
                "Despite everything being online, this class was still very engaging and the discussions were strong. The Professor made sure to repeatedly encourage discussion by taking long pauses and simply waiting for someone to talk, which can sometimes lead to awkward silence on zoom. The Professor had a good approach to maneuvering the awkwardness in zoom discussions and was good at knowing when to wait for someone to respond and when to move on.",
                "Rebecca always made sure to keep the class discussion based, which kept us engaged and interested the whole time.",
                "I think the use of Perusall was very helpful and still forming study groups, even though virtual, was helpful. Classes, although on zoom were still very engaging, and the guest speaker lectures adapted on zoom were still very interesting.",
                "The virtual seminar format worked really well for this class. The group of people that took the class this semester were all really willing to engage in the material, and we had lively conversations about the papers that we had read, the conclusions that we drew from the papers and our own experiences with the topics presented to us. It made the class really fun and engaging."

                "Yes! This seminar was very insightful to the socioeconomic problems we face in the United States and addressed some of the ways we can use economics and big data to implement life-changing policies and programs. The professor was always supportive and kind.",
                "YES! This is an amazing course, regardless of what you are majoring in. You will learn about important issues in America that affect everyone. As a citizen and just a human being going to school in America, I think this course is super important. Also, the professor is the BEST.",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course. I think anyone interested in econ (and not interested in econ) should take this class.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Toseland really does an excellent job, and her extensive knowledge of the material not only helps bring a more nuanced and personal note to the discussion, but it also facilitates student engagement. Besides covering issues in the American political sphere, it is also a great class to learn more about statistics, economics, and coding. As someone who signed up for the course simply because I was interested in social policy, I got so much more out of this course than I initially hoped.",
                "Definitely. I've always known that housing, equality, and healthcare, etc. were pressing issues in America, but this course really allowed me to understand why. Through data and close readings of different economic journals and papers, we were able to learn about empirical studies and research that showed how and why these issues were prevalent. Anyone, regardless of whether they are interested in economics or not, should take this course.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in research in economics and the social sciences.",

                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student - especially anyone with an interest in policymaking and\/or general economics. I think the course is well-structured and engaging in a way that facilitates learning and in-class discussion. Professor Toseland is amazing. It is a great way to dip your toes in the water when it comes to data analysis and you will come away feeling much better about your ability to tackle large-scale policy recommendations or economics research.",
                "This course is great for students who have little background in economics but want to explore pressing topics like poverty, access to education, climate change, etc. It also is not assignment heavy. The class has very engaging readings and its small class size most likely allows students to make friends with common interests when held in person.",
                "Yes yes and yes! This class was a highlight of my semester. We learned a lot and Rebecca is great.",
                "Yes, this course does a really good job of highlighting the interdisciplinary application of economics in a wide variety of different social science and political fields.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in social issues and economics. Any level of economics knowledge, even none, would be fine for this course, so anyone wanting to try out economics should definitely try it out!",
                "Yes! You learn a lot of various tidbits about various socioeconomic policy topics and you have a lot of fun doing so. The professor is great and responsive, the class isn't very difficult, and the work isn't burdensome at all. However, we don't do any actual economics research in the class (so don't take this class if you want to do that) ; the final project is much more of a literature review than conducting your own data analysis."
