                "Strengths: The reading list is great, and the walking tours were amazing. I think the assignments were the best part of the course; the prompts were engaging and were unlike anything I had to do for other classes. I particularly liked writing about Yale buildings, as we could interact with the world around us. \r\nWeaknesses: there was barely any discussion during class time which made class less engaging than in could've been. I think it could be improved by having more guidance in terms of what we should be discussing each class period."

The instructor provides a ton of really helpful feedback on your writing, which I thought was incredibly valuable. Writing is also a nice lens through which one can develop one's understanding of architecture, and I felt that I gained an architectural \"voice\" by the end of the semester.",
