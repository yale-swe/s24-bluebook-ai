Learning Iranian culture and history an added bonus and improved vocabulary for speaking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work that was sometimes difficult to keep up with. At times feeling like not enough emphasis was being placed on speaking the language vs reading/writing.",
                "We can practice speaking more",
                "The course is wonderful in that you truly learn the language. But , expect for it to be a lot of work.",
                "The strength is that the professors insane amount of work will force you to become a good writer. The downside is that its an absurd amount of work for an L3 language. She often times assigns assignments that are 2 hours long at like 8pm the day proceeding, and therefore, youre left with no time to complete them. Also, there is no grade transparency. She is also a tough grader. You also wont really improve any elements of your speaking.",
                "Strengths are that we had constant exposure to new sources of Persian and the small class size helped each person participate. One major weakness was that my class was full of native speakers, so there were many times during class where I had no idea what was going on because I was surrounded by fluent conversation."

                "Yes. If you are interested in learning the Persian language, this is the way to go.",
                "Honestly I would not. I think there are more fun languages you can take here at Yale that have less work and are more rewarding. You dont get the chance to learn much about the beautiful parts of modern Persian culture because youre always learning about super old traditions and things that arent applicable to modern Iran. Also you wont really spend any time working on your speaking, which for me as a native speaker was very frustrating, as my goal was to improve my speaking for when I speak with family.",
                "If you'd like to learn Persian at Yale, you have no choice, but it may be better to take it online or in grad school if you have that option. At Yale there's a large chance you'll end up with a ton of native speakers, and if Persian if your principal concern perhaps that would be a help, but if you can't dedicate a ton of extra study it's a hindrance."
