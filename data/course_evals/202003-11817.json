                "This course was entirely strong. My only complaints are with the virtual seminar format, but I'm sure I would have very few complaints had it been in person.",
                "Strengths were definitely Katja facilitating discussions and all the resources she provides beforehand really have with understanding sometimes very complex and nuanced texts. She is super organized and structured. I think more feedback, like generally for the whole class would be helpful. We only did one writing workshop and I feel like we could have spent a bit more time focusing on how to better write papers than analyzing the texts. Maybe one more writing workshop would have been nice.",
                "The course moves too fast in general, and especially because we are online, a lot of the readings were not done by the students.",
                "strengths: Katja is a wonderful, attentive, and helpful professor, who is genuinely invested in the success of her students. Course has obviously been run before and is very smooth. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: reading & writing can be difficult to manage at the same time",
                "The strengths were the seminar format, the DS community, the material and incredible teaching. Professor Lindskog was always available to help us improve.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-curriculum is well-designed, material often overlapped with the other DS sections\r\n-class discussions were obviously deliberate and well-planned\r\n-Katja is great and did an excellent job making everyone feel welcome and included\r\n-Her office hours were an extremely helpful resource, I wish I had availed myself of them even more\r\n-Learned a great deal about classical literature as well as literature in general taking this course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-mostly due to limitations of Zoom (our section got on fine, but we fell slightly short of building the sense of community and warmth I experienced in another DS class; Katja was probably not at 100% considering it was 2am for her when our section met)\r\n-sometimes felt frustrated when we read entire works, only to discuss 2 passages in seminar (though this is a largely a function of the DS syllabus and the necessity of moving at a fast pace)",
                "Encouraging students to meet with one an another in person in a safe, socially distanced environment to discuss texts outside of class would have developed some really rich friendships that I feel like I missed out on, but this is only because it was such a non-traditional year for DS.",

Though our reading responses due each week gave some semblance of hearing our classmates ideas, we didn't really get to connect with each other that well. It was more like we attended class during a set time frame and that was that. There wasn't really a sense of community, but everything else like literature related was really good over zoom! Katja was really accommodating and caring about how we were literally going to school during a pandemic.",

The surface level understanding of the texts will not cut it. You really have dig down deep and have find connections, insights, backgrounds, motives, etc. and Katja will call you out on superficial stuff you say just for the sake of speaking. BUT if you were to take DS Lit, take Katja. She's amazing and really supports you as you learn to develop these critical thinking skills.",

This experience not only gave me insight into the cultures and behavioral norms of the past, but also allowed me to contemplate similarities with our present.",
                "Absolutely! To combine idioms, my two cents should be taken with a grain of salt (since I was a virtual student), but I would absolutely recommend DS literature as well as Katja's literature section (bear this in mind, anyone in DS with \"scheduling conflicts\"). Katja is a great person who is deeply committed to the mission of DS and who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her students.",
