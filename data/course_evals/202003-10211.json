                "Strengths: small class size, great professor, good reading material, and enjoyable atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Overtime with workshops so not every workshop got the same amount of time and attention.",
                "I wish each student could have two workshops or for the students not being workshopped to trade pieces and give some notes",
                "I think this course has very good feedback for all of the writing assignments, with most pieces usually receiving not only notes from the professor but also from fellow students. I think the reading selections could be a bit more varied but overall the course is absolutely amazing.",
                "Strengths: A lot of in-class discussions and a wide variety of texts. Workshop time and office hours with Prof. Spargo were very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we produced more pieces of work in short assignments in addition to the ample amount of reading we did.",
                "This course could be improved by allowing for more creativity in what students are writing throughout the units. This course had a great set up when it came to unit submissions and peer feedback, but there were some limitations in style and genre of writing that I had not expected going into the course. Being a creative writing course I expected to be allowed to write what ever type of fiction that I wanted, but there were some limitation on style based on the professors preferences. Although this was disappointing at first it did provide me with the opportunity to improve myself in other areas so overall the course was beneficial to me as a writer and it was worthwhile to take it.",
                "Strengths -- the reading materials on the syllabus were varied and engaging with everything ranging from short stories by Hemmingway to poems by Sylvia Plath to a play by Deb Margolin. The assignments were also geared toward improving student creative writing abilities with exciting prompts (such as create a whole story based solely on dialogue that emulates the style of Hemmingway's \"Hills Like White Elephants\" or an exercise where students were asked to incorporate seven or eight specific words into a free verse poem). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- this course does not offer a WR credit, however, I spent more time writing for this class than any other course I have taken during my time at Yale. With a writing assignment due at the end of every week and then one final unit submission due for each of the four units at the end of the month, I felt overwhelmed with work at times and not fairly compensated for the time I was putting in with the distirbutional credits I was receiving.",
                "This was a really great course. I really loved it. I think some of the readings couldve been improved, but a lot of the readings and the structure of the course was great.",
                "Strengths of this course are the feedback and the availability of my professor. The workshops on our writing pieces and reviewing our peer's work vastly helped me to improve my own work. A weakness of this course is the amount of readings. Although I agree that the amount of readings should be kept fairly high because the way students should learn is to read experts in the field, I would've liked some more practice of just some small exercises to be able to write more. I'm a little biased because my highlights in the course came from being able to provide feedback and I think using the discussion board on Canvas would be convenient for short 100-200 word thought exercises\/ writing prompts."

I really think that the interaction, even if not face to face, was priceless and even though it was modified to allow for students to engage with the authors, I'm glad that part was preserved. I think the practice that could be improved is the use of raising our hands over Zoom. I do not know if it would be easier to figure out who was raising their hand if we used the emoji and I'm not sure it would be more convenient, but if someone's lighting was poor it was at times hard to see whether someone had their hand up or not."

                "Absolutely! I learned a lot from this course in terms of how to write imaginatively. I think it was definitely challenging for me because Im a writer who usually needs to ground work in reality, but this was a really engaging course. The discussions were great, Professor Spargo was great, the readings were for the most part really good, and I made lots of new friends just by virtue of the class structure.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to almost any student. I think the intro level of the class suits it well and even though I am a STEM major and don't normally write, I noticed improvement in my writing over the course of the class. The exploration of styles is really interesting and I found myself liking writing poetry the most because I like how much can be said through such a concise medium and its musicality. Also, the short stories, poems, and theater pieces were very interesting to read over and I found myself wanting to read some of them because I could appreciate what they did well and learned from them. If the student had any doubts about their level of writing before the class, it wouldn't be a problem as the class starts with the easiest medium in terms of style in the short story and transitions well while allowing for feedback so that they may improve. In short, I would definitely recommend this class."
