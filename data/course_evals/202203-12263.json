                "I thought that the pacing of content was just right. You get to speak to the professor and to each other a lot during class, forming a sense of community while you hone your speaking and listening skills. No project or presentation has ever felt overly stressful beyond the usual nerves that come with public speaking. Deadlines for assignments can be unclear, despite the schedule the professor sends out every week. Sometimes you may have to hustle to get a presentation done, or you'll work on a presentation you'll never give. However, the professor is extremely flexible, lenient, and understanding. Sometimes, it can also be unclear what assignments actually contribute to your grade, so you might find yourself doing some busy work. Still, the class was overall very very fun and enjoyable.",
