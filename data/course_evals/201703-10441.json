    "We learned a lot about video editing and really spent a good amount of time talking about video as an art form itself and ways that different artists have been making innovative work with it.",
    "I learned how to work with the Adobe Creative Suite (more specifically Premiere, After Effects, and Photoshop). I also learned how to think more critically about how we interact with media such as digital video. Last but not least, I learned how to create digital art video !",
    "Learned how to use Photoshop, Premiere, and AfterEffects as well as other video equipment. Helped me develop my abilities in creating interesting, original content."

    "Great class overall!",
    "This course is the only course I found at Yale which gives students full freedom for creative expression. The assignments were designed in such a way that we could make them our own. This was extremely satisfying and liberating. It also fostered a new way of learning. When left with minimum guidelines, we started thinking for ourselves and reflecting deeply about what we really wanted to create.",
    "Good introduction to general concepts, although the grading and assessments could be made less subjective and more objective."

    "Absolutely take this class! It really opened my eyes to a whole new area that I am interested in!",
    "Yes ! Absolutely, if you are interested in media\/video\/art, you should take this class ! Not only does it give you exposure to really nice editing softwares, it also makes you think about how important media has become and how we can communicate through video. Last but not least, Justin is an amazing professor and artist who shares his deep passion for the medium with his students. He is very supportive and will help you grow artistically over the course of the semester. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Anyone interested in digital video as a medium, or simply in creating interesting, original art, should look into this course."
