Professor Ramalingam is also really great and helpful, and designs each session with activities/group exercises that make digesting the material a bit easier. The assignments were all reasonable and none of them seemed unnecessary. The major weakness of this class is that the material is sometimes extremely dry, which meant that discussions were sometimes really difficult to engage with.",
                "This is one of the best organized courses I have taken at Yale. The readings were excellent. Prof. Ramalingam facilitated discussions well to encourage coherence of the arguments we collectively formulated but also to allow a diversity of thoughts and opinions. The assignments were clear and helpful for working through the course content in more depth. I appreciated that Prof. Ramalingam consulted the class at multiple points in the semester about how the course was going, and took midterm feedback seriously. The feedback I received in class and on my assignments was very helpful, and Prof. Ramalingam was supportive of each of our ideas and interests."

The readings are excellent, Prof. Ramalingam is super knowledgeable and leads great discussions, and the content is varied and offers a ton of opportunity for further reflection and reading. Although the scope is in some sense narrow (the lab seems at the outset to be an oddly specific topic for an entire semester's worth of class), it turns out to be so much more complex than you at first imagine."
