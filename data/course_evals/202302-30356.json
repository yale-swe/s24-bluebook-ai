                "This was my first creative writing class at Yale and it taught me a lot about the writing process and how it is indeed a process. I learned techniques to develop an engaging lede and a noteworthy end. I learned from authors that came to our class about how much drafts can change up until the final piece and how publishing can impact what gets changed. I learned how to be gracious with my writing and pick out things that I like and dislike in other authors' writing. This was a really fulfilling process.",
                "I developed skills in creating and telling coherent, creative, and most importantly honest narratives which tell personal stories in a way that is accessible to an outsider.",
                "I gained an appreciation for creative nonfiction and for creative writing. I learned techniques and skills to develop my own writing, as well as knowledge about the role of family in people's lives.",

                "I learnt to write memoirs and essays on family as expected from the class. But I also learnt how to contextually analyze texts and memoirs. I learnt and also improved my writing skills due to the nature of the class which makes it easy for everyone to give input on each other's writing. I also learnt how to write for various audience.",

                "The strengths of the course is that it assume no previous knowledge and it uses so many great examples of writing to demonstrate the core concepts. I found the workshopping aspect super helpful as it forced me to write a draft and thoroughly read over other classmates' drafts. I enjoyed the set up of the small daily assignments and the breaks during the class which made the intense pace much easier to handle. It was absolutely great.",
                "This course is phenomenal. The course load is rich and comprehensive while being manageable, the structure of classes was organized, varied, and engaging, and the pacing was great, even in the shorter summer session. The only thing I would add or change is adding reminders about informal assignments. Since we uploaded informal writing responses on the discussion section of Canvas, there were no reminders as there are for assignments, and I often lost track of them amidst the other notices on the syllabus.",
                "Professor Hopper is a wonderful instructor, and I loved our class environment. Everything we read and watched in the course was interesting and gave me new contexts for thinking about writing, storytelling, and family. There are no weaknesses, and there is nothing I would change about the course.",
                "The class was amazing. I have no complaints whatsoever.",
                "I don't feel like there's any weaknesses. I got opportunity to give and receive feedback on their writing. I learn to provide constructive criticism and receive insights from peers and instructors to improve my work. Through writing and discussing family experiences,  I gain empathy and a deeper understanding of kinship and family relationships.",
                "There are no apparent weaknesses in this class but strength-wise, the class is very interactive and discussions are very common. This aspect makes it very easy for students to communicate their questions, concerns and need for advice. It also builds good relationships and nature within the class. The class also prioritize the students' opinion and thoughts and feelings. It is a class that can be considered as a safe space for the students.",

I think that personal creative writing is something that is slept on in academia generally but with access to such great writers, you're missing out if you don't take a class like this. It helps develop confidence in one's own writing and generally it's not too difficult to do. And the people in the class are equally as enthused to be there and will support you every step of the way.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to other students (and have already!). It is approachable for those who have never done any kind of creative or creative nonfiction writing, and it is challenging and encouraging for those who have. The classroom setting is unique in that our content and our writing is real and also creative, and my classmates and I were vulnerable and open in sharing with one another, and I think that comfortability and freedom to be real allowed us all to grow all the more in our writing.",
                "This is a phenomenal course. I'm very grateful to have taken it. Professor Hopper and my classmates are amazing, and I learned a lot from everything we read and watched. It's changed how I think about writing and about family.",
                "Absolutely, I would highly recommend the \"Writing about Family\" course to any student looking to delve into the realm of creative non-fiction and explore the complexities of family relationships. This transformative workshop offers a unique opportunity to develop essential writing skills, gain insights into ethical considerations of personal storytelling, and foster empathy through engaging with diverse family narratives. The supportive community and constructive feedback from both instructors and peers create a safe space for self-discovery and growth as a writer. With a diverse range of readings and guest writers, this course provides an enriching experience that not only enhances one's craft but also facilitates a deeper understanding of oneself and the intricacies of family life.",
                "Yes! Absolutely! The class is highly interactive and teaches you how to write and communicate your idea in a text. It is a class that I feel like will welcome all students and will definitely help you to improve your creative writing and contextual analysis",

One thing that Ive learned is that sometimes I get a little bit too carried away with nonessential information. Its a work in progress, but I will absolutely continue to write",
                "The knowledge and skills acquired during the \"Writing about Family\" course will significantly influence my future endeavors. The creative writing techniques and ethical considerations I learned will empower me to craft compelling narratives with sensitivity and respect when exploring personal experiences and family dynamics. The ability to conduct interviews and work with primary documents will enhance my research skills, enabling me to delve deeper into diverse subjects. Moreover, the course's emphasis on empathy and critical thinking will shape my approach to storytelling, fostering a deeper understanding of human relationships and societal norms. These valuable insights will undoubtedly enrich my writing pursuits and allow me to create meaningful, impactful work in various creative and professional contexts.",
