                "I learned how to perform integrals and derivatives with more than one variable and how to do scalar surface integrals and vector surface integrals. Additionally, I learned how to parametrize and mathematically define a great variety of surfaces. Many theorems were also taught that helped me with these operations. Lastly, this class really gave me a much greater understanding of three-dimensional space and the objects and surfaces within it.",

Finally, I developed the skill of initiating conversations and reaching out to classmates to make study groups or collaborate on project(s), which I would highly recommend for this course.",

I took Multi last year as an extra course at a local college so most of the material was not new to me but I learned lots of solving strategies and conceptual hints  from my professors this year.\r\nHow to approach college level problem sets.

                "I really liked the organization of the course where all the theory is done only within the context of 2D and 3D spaces so that every theorem and idea has a geometric interpretation\/visualization. The generalization to higher dimensions is left to other math courses. I think that in the course, there was a lot of overlap with the pre-recorded lectures and zoom lectures. It felt like they covered the same ideas, and there was not much gained from attending\/watching both.",
                "It was horrendous. The quizzes before lecture were unfair as they tested content we just learned. Additionally, the exams were not curved which made no sense since they were being compared to previous semesters. Different classes in different semesters should not be compared as we are different students.",
                "This class is a great class overall. I think the strengths were definitely the pre-lecture videos, involved professors, and interesting and applicable course material. I would not necessarily call it a weakness, but the class requires a lot of time outside of class to prepare and do problem sets.  The content of this course really makes it possible to look at real-world objects in a mathematical sense. You learn so much in just one semester of Math 120.",
                "The course was not very engaging, as class lectures were merely a repeat of the videos we had to watch before class. They had a few more examples, but they were examples to watch and not to do. Little effort was made to encourage cooperation between students during and outside of class, and apart from the problem sets there were very few opportunities to test your understanding. PSets were very specific, so understanding of the general concept without doing any examples meant that we were frequently underprepared and had to attend office hours.",
                "Strengths: The peer tutoring office hours are extremely helpful and the videos that are part of the weekly homework were very detailed, if a bit long sometimes. They were also very good on feedback for problem sets and exams so that you know what the correct answer is and could figure out where you went wrong. \r\nWeaknesses: It's kind of a lottery on which professor you get and that can greatly impact your experience with the course. I know people who have had complaints and that these difficulties impacted their ability to succeed in the class. The problem sets are also unnecessarily complicated, using integration skills that you definitely do not need and would otherwise use a calculator for. Also, the problem sets try to explore the depths of the concepts, but don't prepare you for the tests, which generally test the basics of the concepts, but under a time constraint. Overall, the problem sets took an extremely long time and were often incredibly difficult with very little payout as far as preparation and retention of the concepts. Because of the online format, they implemented a \"participation\" part of the grade, which was 5%, and didn't tell us how it would be calculated until December. Also, it varied depending on professor\/section, so once again that disparity is an issue.",
                "Sometimes class lectures didn't line up perfectly with John Hall's full course lectures, which made it confusing to either go back to a topic we covered previously or jump forward in the material.\r\nAdditionally, it would have been helpful to have the class notes in an additional pdf or typed format in addition to Prof Hall's videos\r\nStrengths: peer tutors were such a great resource and really helped to solidify my understanding of the course. Truly an invaluable resource while solving problem sets and studying for exams.",
                "This course moved at a good pace and allowed mistakes without much penalty.",
                "It is great to have small class sessions, it helps the students engage well with the professor, which facilitates learning.",
                "Strengths: Good pace, clear teaching, homework was a good level of difficulty (a little challenging, but always very doable).\r\n\r\nI cannot think of any real weaknesses."

                "Pre-recorded lectures were super helpful. The umbrella Canvas site was beautifully organized for online classes, and I wish that all my classes were as well put-together.",
                "I think the pre-lecture videos were a great way to learn the material before class without having to rely entirely on your comprehension of a textbook. This worked well because this material was reinforced in live class the next day. I thought the breakout rooms during lecture were a nice way to interact with other students.",
                "Pre-recorded lectures were useful because it was difficult to stay engaged during the virtual class, and they allowed you to learn the material despite the lack of engangement. Office hours could be improved, as peer tutors are good for solving psets but not for explaining concepts. More effort could be made to encourage participation during class, and sample problems during class would be a better use of our time than relearning what the videos covered.",
                "The live virtual lectures were generally okay, but my connection would sometimes cut out and I wouldn't be able to get all the notes\/hear what my professor said. It's not really their fault, but it would be nice if the notes were posted or if the recorded lectures were posted. Also, breakout rooms were not as successful as they could have been because most of the time, my classmates didn't really talk to each other and just did their own thing. I honestly think just staying in the main session and working on things on our own for a while works better when possible.",
                "Peer tutor hours worked well online\r\nJamboards were pretty conducive to solving problems together\r\nModifying the exam schedule was a blessing!! It was really smart to not have any exams at home and made a real difference in my performance on the exams. The new final project was a great additional exploration of multivariable concepts\r\nSometimes it seemed like the time allotted to spend in breakout rooms wasn't very well planned. We would be in the rooms for a long time and without a good idea of when we were supposed to return to the main room. Seemed kind of disorganized",

Although the class requires a lot of time and effort, you will emerge with a greater understanding of extremely useful topics. Problem sets can be tough, but professors and peer tutors offer a great deal of help with the questions if you attend extra help. The content of the course applies to so many different things in real life which helps make this course interesting in a way not every course can be. There were times where the course was tough, but it was very much worthwhile to keep practicing and learning. Practice is crucial in performing well in the course.",

The concepts learned here stand by themselves and don't have many obvious or useful applications; it would be more beneficial for a student to fulfill QR requirements with a statistics course or lower math so as to focus on what they like. I haven't really heard anyone say \"I love Math 120.\"",
                "I would, but not in a virtual setting. Online, it was a boring class. Even though the material itself was really interesting, the video\/ class combo was boring and hard to stay interested in. This made the long problem sets seem more tedious than they would be if we were actively engaged in class. Instead it felt like I was just going to class to get through class and doing the Psets just for the grade and not to actually learn.",
