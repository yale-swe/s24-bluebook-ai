External factors like race, socioeconomic factors and mental illnesses play a huge part in crime but not as large a one in sentencing (except perhaps for mental illness). I felt like this class opened my mind a lot to things I had never considered.",

                "During this course, I learned in-depth about the science on the minds of those with criminality problems. Genetic and environmental factors play a strong role in affecting human behavior, so strategies are needed to address these conditions. Our current crime-fighting tactics are ineffective because they do not address the actual root of the problems, so we must implement solutions that take psychological deficiencies into account.",

Building from that foundation, I learned about the psychological backgrounds of those who are frequently caught up in the criminal justice system as a result of a lack of resources and misunderstandings about their conditions. I learned about psych studies that aimed to determine the etiological sources that lead to externalizing and psychopathy, all sub-types of antisocial personality disorder.

I wrapped up this course having a whole new perspective on the misconceptions about criminal psychology and the diversity of the factors that can both shape individuals into ones that pursue antisocial behaviors and deter them from doing so. All in all, the course offered a comprehensive overview of criminal psychology concepts that brought together legal, psychological, biological, neuroscientific, and societal concepts.",

This class taught me about individuals with antisocial personality disorder, psychopathy, and types in-between, in both children and adults. We learned about environmental factors, structural and societal influences, the law, neuroscience, the police, and methods of addressing and\/or ameliorating issues with each. I learned how to engage critically with neuroscience material in a way that was not overbearing or overwhelming--the professor described everything extremely thoroughly with a plethora of examples, case-studies, and research to support and prove findings and assertions. I gained immense insight on the mind of the criminal as well as those who have disorders like ASPD and psychopathy who are not criminals.

We began with some environmental factors that influence crime and then we dove into Antisocial Personality Disorder and how that causes people to act out in different ways. We learned about psychopathy and debunked some of the myths of the disorder. For both disorders we learned biological and environmental causes, what goes on in a person's brain with these disorders and how that leads to crime.

            "comments": [
                "This course only has strengths! It was structured very well: we begin by looking at environmental influences and then transition to nitty gritty of the neurobiology of particular disorders (psychopathy and ASPD) that influence criminal behavior. The lectures are very understandable; you do not need to know anything about neuroscience or law for this class. Dr. Sommers structures the class to be readily accessible to everyone. All the lectures were engaging, with a mixture of video clips and poll questions (though towards the end, the lectures had less of those but they are still very interesting). The weekly quizzes are not stressful at all; the two exams were also straight forward, with ample support in the form of a study guide and a review session. I loved being able to read actual research articles about each topic every week (including Dr. Sommers' own research which is so cool); while reading technical research may seem daunting, Dr. Sommers makes it so you don't have to read the whole thing just the main points. I liked the structure of the first two essays being based on templates that prepare you for the last essay which is a much more traditional academic essay. There was also so much support in the class! There are so many office hours with TA's and ULA's and Dr. Sommers' herself; the use of Piazza was also very helpful for any general questions or help on essays, and Dr. Sommers would answer questions very quickly. Overall, this course is amazing and is extremely well taught!",
                "This course is well taught with a clear plan for each lecture. The material rarely feels overwhelming or too complex. The one time the material sometimes feels too complex is when discussing the different brain regions. I feel the course did a poor job of explaining the role of each brain region early on and rather expected students to figure it out on their own.",
                "Honestly one of the most well organized classes I've had at Yale, don't have any suggestions for improvement.",
                "This course was fantastic. We were given good feedback on our writing assignments and they were returned in a timely manner. For the exams, we were given the opportunity to do test corrections, which relieves the stress of grades a bit, but more importantly allowed us to learn from our mistakes and make sure we understood the material to progress in the course.",

It's low-pressure and low-stress; 3 essays that are pretty easy, one weekly open note quiz that's simple if you're paying attention, and 2 exams which she this term allowed you to correct for partial credit. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an excellent and interesting lecturer, cares about the students, and engages with questions. She uses Piazza to interact with students outside of class and has fantastic open communication. \r\nWeaknesses: None, as long as you're interested in the material. If you don't like the neuroscience\/experiment aspect, you may be bored for a good chunk of lectures.",
                "I thought that the twice a week live lectures were very engaging. The once a week quizzes were great way to keep people on top of the readings and watching the lectures. I do not have any suggestions for this course because I thought that it was very engaging, fairly graded and well organized.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized course format, weekly quizzes help with retention of information \r\nWeaknesses: not many!",
                "The course was very clear and concise. Engagement during class could be higher but not necessary.",
                "Strengths - Dr. Baskin-Sommers. Period. She is amazing, and if you have the opportunity to learn from her, take it. I understood every concept not because I am a genius psychology major, but because her lectures are so clear and to the point. She explains everything  so well a toddler could understand it. However, this is not to say the lecture are boring because they are not. \r\nWeaknesses - none.",
                "Prof. Baskin-Sommers is the biggest strength of this class. She's a great lecturer, and made the course easy to understand for everyone regardless of previous knowledge.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is a wonderful professor who clearly cares about her students. She is the biggest strength of this course. Additionally, lectures provided relevant information, and the tests never went outside the scope of this class, and the assignments were straightforward. There really are no weaknesses that I could see with this course, and only strengths across the board.",
                "I learned so much in this course due to the amazing Teaching team and Professor Baskin-Sommers. Everything was very clear, and there were myriad resources available to help us learn. Something that could make this course better is transitioning this class to two 50-minute lecture periods and a 50 minute discussion section. I have rarely had discussion sections in psychology classes at Yale and I often feel that having designated time to discuss the relevant material could help with understanding and engagement of the class. Especially with a class this interesting and with a subject matter full of nuances, a discussion time would be beneficial and outstandingly interesting.",
                "Strengths: content was very interesting, quizzes were straightforward, exams were reasonable. We had exam corrections. Lots of personalized feedback and individualized response which was very impressive, given that the class was HUGE. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, this was probs the best lecture class I've ever taken",
                "Strengths - fast feedback and Professor Baskin-Sommers is always willing to answer questions and is very well versed in psychology\r\nWeakness - Essays were a bit difficult as virtual learning made things a lot more self reliant",
                "i loved how the professor taught, she was very organized and engaging\r\nno weaknesses",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is definitely a strength of this course. The lectures can sometimes get a little bit dry, but every lecture has info that is eye-opening and at times, even life-changing!",
                "This class is brilliant and incredibly current. A must-take at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Great organization, REALLY interesting material\/lectures, easily accessible resources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's very little \"mandatory\" interaction to discuss information in class. I wish there were sections to discuss stuff",
                "I loved this course! There were not many weaknesses if any!\r\n\r\nThe professor was always on top of things and very responsive as were the TAs. This included emails AND piazza. Everyone was very helpful. The content was eye-opening and really interesting. The students were constantly asking questions and helping each other. Professer Baskin-Sommers did a great job with COVID stuff.",
                "It is a very large class but presents interesting material. Not much engagement with professor or faculty members due to the shear amount of people in the class.",
                "A weakness may perhaps be the limited office hours of the professor, as well as how the essays were graded - it seemed a bit arbitrary sometimes. I put more effort into one essay than another but the one with much less effort got a significantly higher grade. Because of the first essay grade, there is a little stress about the final essay. A strength is the lectures and how fair the quizzes\/exams were.",
                "Strengths- professor is incredible! In a 200+ person lecture, she would encourage students to meet with her, email her, and she would reply to piazza posts almost instantaneously. She is so understanding with deadlines and grades, and if you try in this class, she basically guarantees you an A (through earning points back on exams, dropping lowest quizzes, etc). She is a fascinating lecturer and you will feel like you learned a ton after each and every class. Essays are really fun and easy!\r\n\r\nWeakness- the readings are pointless because you are essentially just tested off of stuff presented in class. Just read the abstracts, if at all.",
                "Strengths were the lectures because they were very informative and lively so they were very engaging. I also think a strength was the constant availability of the instructor and all teaching fellows to making sure we understood what was going on. A weakness is the lectures sometimes went quickly and it was hard to keep up with taking notes sometimes.",
                "The lectures were very structured and easy to follow, but I wish we had spent more time analyzing case studies and understanding the minds of criminals as they are committing certain crimes instead of analyzing the criminal mind more generally with statistics.",
                "Weaknesses: Too many studies explaining the same information, tests were much more difficult and required more applied thinking than an intro class should. \r\n\r\nStrengths: interesting material for psych majors, piazza helped answer questions, lots of TFs for support if necessary",
                "This course was really interesting and well organized. I really liked how everything was set up and it was low stress which made me more excited to learn.  I don't think there were any weaknesses.",
                "I think the course is expertly laid out. The flow from lecture to lecture was very conducive to our learning. I think the first two paper assignments could have granted students a bit more leeway to discuss the course material; the third paper was exemplary of such an assignment.",
                "Really enjoyed lectures.",
                "This class has no weakness. Dr. Baskin-Sommers is the best professor I have ever had. She was so incredibly accessible, so organized, and SO helpful. She is really there to help all of her students succeed and it shows. She's also incredibly passionate about the subject and it definitely reflects in her lectures",
                "Really well organized and thought out",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses, but as for strengths: the class was always interesting, it wasn't a huge time commitment, and it was really facilitated so that students could just learn the most they could.",
                "The course was extremely structured, with a plethora of resources available to the student. Lectures were equal-parts engaging, informative, and thought-provoking, introducing questions about the criminal mind that I had never thought about. Weekly quizzes sound like a drag to complete at first, but most were straightforward and confirmed my understanding of certain topics.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Amazing Professor and TF's - experts in the subject and were incredibly passionate. They also were super quick to respond to emails and Piazza \r\n- The paper assignments - great ways to think about the course material and apply it\r\n- Fascinating material! Lots of shock factor, myths debunked... course introduces empathy as well for criminal offenders with mental illness or with other biological factors that might affect them \r\n- Was done as well as possible given the online formatting! -Easy to ask questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Sometimes the lectures went a bit quick at beginning of the course (but online formatting helped because lectures were recorded)",
                "Lectures were always very interesting. They were fast paced, but manageable and always kept me on my toes. The readings, though sometimes long or a little complex for my knowledge of neuroscience, were very interesting and all were very applicable to the course. I thought the essays were interesting to write, and the research involved definitely helped me broaden my understanding of the topics. Lectures and readings always prepared me very well for assessments, and the class was very clear in its expectations and teaching. The \"Ask the Expert\" class periods were always super interesting, getting to hear from other individuals in the field. I really can't complain about much with this class!",
                "Strengths include a wonderful professor who is extremely knowledgeable of the field, interesting subject material, and a manageable course load.\r\nWeaknesses include that sometimes the lectures can become disengaging and feel lengthy, times where we answered live questions as a class helped fight this.",
                "This class was really well organized and provided students with all the resources necessary to succeed.",
                "I thought this course was perfect how it is.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baskin-Sommers was amazing and super clear during her lectures. Workload was very manageable and just a great and informative class overall. I highly recommend to anyone who has the option to take this class to take it!\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths\r\nProfessor really knows what she is talking about\r\nLots of help and aid through piazza and office hours\r\nYou can tell their primary goal is for you to learn \r\nThey do not take points off for grammar and other such things on the essays \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nProf does talk fast sometimes, but it's not a very big deal because you have a recorded lecture and you can just go back",
                "This course is amazing!",
                "This course was genuinely really great",
                "The strengths of the course were most definitely the lectures. In those lectures, the professor explained everything so clearly and provided different examples like documentaries, shows, movies, etc. This along with the content kept me intrigued within the course. Not to mention that the essays assigned were very interesting and very applicable to the material that we were learning in class. There were also tons of resources to use, allowing nobody to be lost or not know what to do at a certain time during the semester. Overall, a really good course and I wouldn't change much about it!",
                "It was a very large class, but the TAs and ULAs were really helpful! Professor Baskin-Sommers was really knowledgable too.",
                "This course is fantastic for everyone, especially for non-psychology majors! I loved the content - Professor Baskin-Sommers is extremely engaging and cares a lot about the success of her students. I don't have have strong critiques.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is the best professor I had this semester, hands-down. Her quickness in replying, organization in lectures, and passion to do her best is truly inspiring, and I wish I had her diligence and control! Her lectures were very well organized with summary slides, clear topic structures, and her pace was very easy to follow. Any topic I had confusion on, she clarified at the end or in the next lecture, making me very confident in what I knew and the comparisons between all the topics we learned. Piazza gave me a space to ask questions outside of class, and I wish all classes used Piazza! It was extremely reliable because I would get an answer within the hour, and it would be in-depth. If I did not use Piazza, I would certainly have not done as well in tests or in my general understanding. I do wish that perhaps there were more outside of class optional discussion times to go deeper into the material or even analyze a Criminal Minds episode. While not vital to course material, I would love to know the TAs and the Professor's thoughts on these real-life representations, and it would just be a great way to bond as a class.",
                "strengths: very straightforward material, interesting readings, well taught\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the exam questions were very nitpicky\/specific and tried to trip students up, as opposed to genuinely assess their learning and knowledge.",
                "I am writing a rave review for this class. It literally cannot be improved. It's the perfect class in so many ways. Professor Baskin-Sommers is so, so organized. There's an easily accessible answer for any question you could even think of, but if you do need to ask, she'll answer your email or Piazza post so quickly. The TAs were also SO quick to help, even just before papers were due. They also gave such clear feedback. They were never like, \"looks like you're on the right track,\" or \"I would think of this differently.\" I'd literally get structured emails detailing what I would need to consider if I opted for one specific topic and what I would need to consider if I went a different route. I am a very easily stressed person at times and I was literally never stressed by this class because the expectations were so clear and you could find the info you needed anytime, very neatly organized into a Canvas folder.",
                "Strengths: Arielle is AMAZING. A-MAZ-ING. This class was very adept at having a virtual format and the assignments were very clear. The Piazza response time was super fast which made doing all the coursework much easier. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The course material is interesting and the weekly quizzes were helpful. The lectures seemed to reiterate a lot and I wish that more material had been covered. The special guest interviews seemed a bit too free form and I would have preferred it if they had come in with a slideshow.",
                "The strength was definitely the professor. Professor Baskin-Sommers is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Her lectures and explanations are crystal clear and she always makes sure to stop for questions. The grading in this course was extremely fair and the assignments were great in helping us retain the material we learned in lecture. I honestly can't think of a weakness in this course.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, engaging, great professors and teaching fellows; Weaknesses: only un-engaging part of the class was the guest lectures, other than that, no weaknesses observed",
                "This was a wonderful course!",
                "The strengths were that Dr. Baskin-Sommers was a really good lecturer--she keeps her students engaged. It was also very easy to reach out for help through Piazza--she would respond very quickly to our questions. You already receive a lot of guidance on essays.",
                "The professor is the best Ive had at Yale",
                "I've enjoyed all of the topics covered in this course, especially specific examples that help explain certain concepts, and I think the class assignments complement the course content very well.",
                "Overall great course. Liked the opportunity to learn from mistakes in exam",
                "Not many weaknesses in this course. Overall great knowledge evaluations, interesting lectures, and essays really help ensure you understand the topics.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baskin-Sommers is AMAZING. She is so knowledgeable on the subject matter and is able to convey it in a way that is easy to absorb. There are also so many different ways to ask questions and get feedback throughout the course even anonymously which was awesome. It is also clear that the goal of the class is for the students to understand the information and be able to apply it rather than just cram for tests and there are opportunities to get points back on exams if you can improve your answers. All in all- it was an amazing class with really relevant topics that I think everyone should take if they have the opportunity.",
                "The strengths of this class are that expectations and presentations are very clear from the beginning, the format is easy to follow and Professor Baskin-Sommers is fantastic. The material is engaging and the professor makes an effort to answer questions in a timely and precise manner and makes it very interesting. All of the material is also explained thoroughly, such that not prior knowledge is necessary, though an understanding of the basic brain regions and their functions is helpful.",
                "Strengths: really clear lectures and response to any feedback is so immediate and taken so well! i loved the inclusion of videos and polleverywhere's in the class; they were really fun and engaging. the class i found to be really engaging even without though. piazza response speed was so quick as well this semester - really impressive! Weaknesses: none!",
                "The weekly quizzes really helped to ensure that everyone was on track with the lecture materials and not falling behind. I liked how the course was structured, as we learned about the disorders first and then towards the end talked more about treatments and how to integrate all the information we learned together.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers ensured each student had the opportunity to ask questions and the class was very straightforward.",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures and engaging assignments!",
                "Clearly organized. Interesting.",
                "Strengths: the instructor, for sure. Weaknesses: The essays are worth a pretty large proportion of our grade, and sometimes it isn't too clear what the graders are looking for.",
                "It was a great class. I really don't have any complaints. Professor Baskin-Sommers did a great job of keeping the class engaging with short videos and clips along with diagrams and pictures that helped explain the material.",
                "Super clear instructions, amazingly organized lectures",
                "The strengths of this course definitely lie in the material as almost everything learned is extremely interesting and will keep students engaged and interested. Also, the teaching staff is great which makes the class very enjoyable. The weaknesses of the course would only be that the last third of the course is a lot of information and it would be nice to look into those a little more.",
                "The lectures were very well organized and easy to follow. Prof Baskin-Sommers is great!!!",
                "I really like the course as it is. The professor sets everything up so that students are prepared to do really well.",
                "-Teacher very knowledgeable and fun",
                "Strength: how interesting the topic is and how well taught it is\r\nWeakness: none",
                "I think that the strengths were how helpful the teacher was in guiding us and responding to our questions really fast.",
                "I think that the course is very strong as it is. Perhaps if I had to name one aspect that I wished to see more of in our assigned readings\/lectures is case studies. I think the course could benefit from even more real-life examples of how the presented knowledge applies to criminal behavior.",
                "Its a great course. I dont love weekly quizzes but they did ensure I knew the material well.",
                "Really well run in terms of clear lectures and feedback",
                "This class was so clearly driven by a desire for Prof Baskin-Sommers to make a difference in the lives of those that land themselves within the corruption of the criminal justice system. It was easy to be engaged when she was so passionate herself.",
                "Great course!!! Learned so much, low workload and low stress, and Professor Baskin-Sommers is a very clear, kind, attentive professor.",
                "The strengths are that the material is interesting, clips of videos shown sometimes break up the content nicely, and Professor Baskin-Sommers is very nice.",
                "The class had very active TAs and helpful review for the exams. The only improvement would be for tougher questions to practice in reviews.",
                "I cannot say enough good things about professor and TFs. The curriculum of this course is awesome too. The information I learned was super interesting and all new to me. It was by far my favorite class of the semester. There are no weaknesses in this course.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor who is both very engaging and supportive of her students; interesting material and easy workload; cohesive class with multiple mediums of conveying information\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the first 2-3 lectures may be a bit deceptive, the course mostly focuses on two specific aspects of the criminal mind (psychopathy and externalizing) and spends a very brief period of time exploring the social and environmental factors that cause crime.  I think the class could be made better if more focus was given to the social\/environmental factors that cause crime",
                "The essay grades varied greatly on who was grading them. On the first essay, I got a far worse grade than my roommate even though we agreed that my essay was better. On the second essay, I got a much better grade even though my second essay was of no better quality than my first. I'm not sure exactly how this could be repaired, but it seems clear to me that the grading process is imperfect.",
                "The material of the course was really engaging and I think the professor really made the most of the online format.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Baskin-Sommers and her TF team make a SIGNIFICANT effort to care for students and accommodate COVID challenges. The content is explained in a way that someone with no psych experience (me) could understand. A well of resources are also made available which allow us to refer back when stuck. The goal of the class was us to learn, not to be graded--which was made evident in the format of assignments. Dr. Baskin-Sommers also worked to engage us in other ways than just class (playlists, screenings, weekly emails, question board). We also got our grades almost instantly. And lastly, Dr. Baskin-Sommers really is patient with some of these question interruptions that wouldn't normally happen during a live lecture (you deserve your flowers ).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class had to end.",
                "I believe the course was extremely strong, our professor was extremely animated and engaging so it made the virtual aspect of it much better.",
                "N\/A",
                "I loved this course! I wish there was more room for involvement.",
                "Strengths - Arielle Baskin-Sommers is a brilliant lecturer, keeps you engaged and teaches fascinating material\r\nWeaknesses - I don't actually know that it has any",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers really tried to keep everyone engaged. She's really open to hearing feedback and then taking that feedback and implementing changes in the course! The lectures, even though there were a lot of students taking the class, felt incredibly engaging. Professor Baskin-Sommers is also an expert in this field and it's cool to be able to read her research!",
                "I dont have any complaints. Maybe the essays could have more detailed rubrics?",
                "Strength: The structure of the class gave a lot of freedom with how you took the class and when you decided to watch the lectures given that it was recorded. The weekly quizzes were really helpful in ensuring that you understood the key points of that week's lecture and were really easy to score a perfect score on (they were all open notebook and you always had more than enough time to finish). Weakness: Sometimes the lectures would get dry but that depends on the person. There is also a lot of information covered in each lecture.",
                "Strengths: Approachable and fantastic professor who is super knowledgeable about her topic and always willing to clarify thoughts if you ever get stuck; super super easy workload (I'm tempted to call this class a gut) BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T KILL TIME ON THE \"ASSIGNED\" READINGS (more on this in the weakness section); easy plus helpful weekly quizzes that keep you on top of the material; exams are very easy and doable if you understand the lectures; essays are very generously graded if you follow the rubric (a 100 or 99 is very possible); super interesting material; easy A\r\n\r\nWeakness: The readings are really unnecessary and should not be labelled as \"Required\".....they ended up killing a lot of my time during the first week of classes (until I realized that I didn't need them to understand the lectures and get a perfect on the exams\/essays).....they have interesting content but the Prof. should just label them as \"Optional\" readings instead of \"Required\"",
                "Strengths are definitely the professor, as she is super knowledgable and very transparent with students.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great lecturer and did a great job connecting psych to policy changes and modes of intervention. The assignments were straightforward and helped apply what we learned. I can't really think of any huge weaknesses.",
                "This was a phenomenal course. I think one of the biggest strengths is definitely Professor Baskin-Sommers. She is so knowledgable about the topic, and is a very engaging lecturer.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is an incredible lecturer and keeps the class engaged, even over zoom. The material was dense at times, but it was always explained and managable. Overall, I really enjoyed this course and learned a ton over a very short period of time.",
                "All good :)",
                "In my opinion, one of the biggest strengths of the course is that it is more learning-focused than grade focused, and assessments arent constructed to stump you",
                "An amazing professor who did a good job of making lectures engaging and interesting with videos. I think it was a very well thought out and scheduled class.",
                "This course is very organized and the teaching staff provides so much support for students' learning. Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing, knowledgeable, eloquent, and kind. No weaknesses.",
                "nothing to change",
                "This course is amazing. The course material is fascinating and Professor Baskin-Sommers is very engaging. The pace was just right, not too fast and not too slow. The exams and papers were very fair assessments of our knowledge. The \"ask the expert\" guest lecture series was also really cool. I loved getting to hear about the field from other perspectives and it was a really nice way to find a silver lining for virtual teaching. I'm not sure there were any weaknesses.",
                "Prof assumed previous knowledge when teaching complex concepts",
                "Really good lectures and well structured",
                "Instructor teaches very well.",
                "This course was very interesting and the professor is very willing to help. The average piazza response time from the prof was ~5 min, there was a massive amount of office hours each week, and it was very easy to meet with the prof. The TAs and professor were always on the same page, knowledgeable, and clear.\r\n\r\nSome of the grading weight choices didn't make much sense to me. Accounting for test corrections, missing a question on a quiz costs twice as much as missing a question on the tests. The quizzes weren't particularly tough, but that's still a lot for what's intended to just be a participation check.",
                "I really appreciated that we could earn a certain amount of points back on exams by going back and explaining what the correct answer was and why for each question that we got wrong. Not only did it help keep my grades up in the course, but I genuinely learned why the right answers were correct, which helped me have necessary knowledge for essays and later exams.",
                "I think both the course material and the methods of assessment were excellent. The material was always interesting and real examples were provided to increase understanding while the assessments were structured in a manner that encouraged us to go back to them and reinforce the work that we had learned.  I personally did not experience any issues with this course.",
                "The course is structured very well to facilitate learning, and I always knew how I was doing at any given moment. The professor and teaching fellows are very helpful and knowledgeable and the grading is fair and transparent.",
                "strengths: exam review sessions, clear expectations for essays",
                "This was a great class. The only reason that my engagement was not as high as I would have wanted it to be was because the class was online.",
                "The professor incorporated the readings into the lectures and provided resources on how to tackle the weekly readings. Piazza is a powerful tool to ask questions about the course outside of lectures and a great study reference. I would have enjoyed taking this course in person, but unfortunately, the conditions did not allow that.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is super understanding and structured the course in a really great format to enhance learning and retention as well as application of knowledge. 10\/10 class!",
                "There were many strengths in the course including the professor, content, TAs, and ULAs. All members of the teaching staff were kind and knowledgable. Professor Baskin-Sommers was very helpful and provided amazing insight into the content of the course. I do not believe there were any weaknesses.",
                "Conducive to virtual school -- lectures were very engaging. Only weakness was lack of discussion section.",
                "This course was incredibly well-structured for student success.  Prof. Baskin-Sommers made it clear she wanted her students to succeed and actually learn.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baskin-Sommers is hands down one of the most notable strengths for this course. She is incredibly knowledgeable and is a great lecturer! The course was organized very well, and the slides were very informative. There were plenty of office hours available.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Honestly, I can't think of any notable weakness of this course. If I absolutely had to choose something, I will say that a quick overview of the courses terminology at the beginning of the course could have served useful and cleared up some of my confusion during the first few lectures. Aside from this, it was a really solid class! The explanations of the experiments at times felt like a bit much and felt very neuroscience-y, but Professor Baskin-Sommers did a really good job of explaining them.",
                "Strengths: Prof Baskin-Sommers!! If nothing else, take this course just to take a class with her. Its clear how much she cares about her students and their success, and she made learning this material super fun and engaging. Also, the workload was extremely manageable and there was so much support to help you succeed. Weaknesses: honestly none",
                "This is a fantastic class, very engaging, very interesting material. It is well organized and covers a broad range of research concisely. The only weakness I can think of is that the opening lectures about the effect of race and our class structure on crime is not as intensely discussed, I think there could have been more engagement with that portion.",
                "the content is interesting, and the quizzes & exams are representative of the readings you're expected to do and the class content, some lectures can be a bit dry",
                "The course material is highly engaging without being overwhelming.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the professor and TA were extremely lenient and accommodating. They uploaded recordings of the lecture almost immediately after the lecture itself, and they recorded every review session for students. They also clearly communicated deadlines to students and promptly answered our questions on Piazza. Additionally, the professor made sure to review concepts that she would be building on in class during the classes (before she introduced a new concept) and while that would be repetitive at times, it was extremely helpful in the retention of those concepts. \r\n\r\nThere were no weaknesses in this course.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses, but the course itself I thought was structured in a well and engaging manner! Very accessible to all.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the professor, she's wonderful!",
                "The strength is the interesting material and the care of the professor. I don't know how but the professor would answer our questions thoughtfully and well in less than 10 minutes on piazza. I was stunned by her care and attention to the students and to the material.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the grading rubric. It always points out what's wrong with your essays, but never accounts for the good parts of your essay. Rather than just constructive criticism it would have been nice to know what I could do more of in the future. Another weakness of the course is that we don't get to engage too much with our peers. I wish there were more opportunities to either participate on either poll everywhere or go into breakout rooms to discuss topics in the course.",
                "I really enjoyed this course overall and would not make very many changes. I thought Prof. Baskin-Sommers made great slides and structured the course really thoughtfully. I liked the weekly quizzes, the \"Ask the Expert\" series, and the test format. I was a little unsure of having templated essays but it actually worked out really well. I wish that we had spent a little more time on the biology\/neuroscience\/anatomy part of the brain in the beginning so that when we explore the functions of relevant brain regions we would have had some understanding of the underlying mechanics.",
                "I loved this course. I've always been interested in criminal psychology, and this class made me so much more knowledgable about many common misconceptions that people have about criminals, mental illness, etc.",
                "I don't think this class had any weaknesses. It was very well organized and everything was laid out for us. The readings were easily accessible and the content was taught well.",
                "I really liked Professor Baskin-Sommers' lecturing style. She spoke slow enough for us to retain the material and uploaded all of the course slides and lectures that made reviewing easy (and we could type up notes beforehand which was a plus). I also think a strength of this course was the guests lecturers. Since we weren't tested on this material we could just listen and retain the material, which made the class more enjoyable. There were really no weaknesses during this course.",
                "Strengths: information is interesting and taught in a digestible manner. Weekly quizzes help you keep up with the material and the essays reinforce your understanding of the material. There aren't any significant weaknesses.",
                "Dr Baskin-Sommers is absolutely brilliant. She is engaging, easy to follow, deeply involved in the course material and scarily responsive to all students. She has crafted a well-structured and super engrossing class in The Criminal Mind.",
                "I liked how some lectures were guest lectures  it was interesting to get the perspective of a professional in the field we were learning about.",
                "Amazing!",
                "Very strong class, and professor. The professor was amazing, the workload was adequate, and encouraged learning.",
                "Strength: interesting, well-taught, well-organized\r\nWeakness: cant find one",
                "Strengths is the professor is great and not many weaknesses.",
                "So well organized! Professor Baskin-Sommers is an incredible lecturer! She organized lectures so well and made sure each lecture was connected to the prior. She also always left time for questions and was always willing to answer any questions. There were also many TAs there to help out when needed which was great.",
                "I really liked the weekly quizzes - helps keep everyone accountable. It might be easy points but is good for keeping everyone up to date on lectures.",
                "Strengths: Arielle's response time.. incredible!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE",
                "I thought the lectures were very engaging, and I liked how they often had videos and poll-everywhere questions to see how the information we were learning could be applied. The content was also really interesting and I learned so much.",
                "Good teacher",
                "I liked the workload and assignments (they were interesting and not too heavy).",
                "Overall, this course was structured amazingly to ensure that every student made the most out of it. The guidelines for each assignment were extremely clear, and even if there were some ambiguities or questions, Piazza was a phenomenal resource for students to ask questions and get answers. The Piazza site in this class was one of the most well structured ones I have seen in the courses I have taken at Yale. The weekly quizzes were a great way for the students to keep up with the material of the course. There were soooo many resources available to students to ensure that they did well in class, ranging from lecture transcripts, and the Piazza site to lecture slides that were extremely clear and office hours that were ample and extremely accessible.",
                "The class was organized very well and TA's were very helpful. The canvas page had everything organized by week and provided other resources for writing papers and studying for exams which were very helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the professor and the course material. The course material was great, and Professor Baskin-Sommers was so versed in the information. I really felt like I retained most of it in retrospect.",
                "The course's content is extremely interesting and engaging. I learned so much and loved how the final essay applied topics learned to real world policy.",
                "Because it was a big seminar class there was less direct interactions in class and student participation, but the content of the course was very interesting and very well explained",
                "*STRENGTHS:\r\n     - Fantastic professor--wonderful insight, prompt and thorough, answers every question asked thoroughly and insightfully, ensures students have every material necessary to succeed; lectures with precision and deep knowledge, provides examples and research in every case; extremely thoughtful and a wonderful person overall\r\n     - Extremely interesting course material that, although scientific at times, is made palatable and digestible via thorough examples and extensive professor knowledge; material is never too overwhelming or boring; there was always something to learn and engagement can be as little or as much as you'd like\r\n     - Tests, quizzes, and essays were all very fair and straightforward--they reinforce material, are not tricky, and all resources are available via the lecture slides, Piazza, readings, and recorded lectures; there was almost never a time when I couldn't find an answer to a question I had\r\n     - Class is flexible: readings are more or less optional, one quiz per week, two straightforward tests, three essays that are completely outlined by the professor; lecture attendance was optional and two per week at ~1hr each were digestible and understandable and far from overwhelming; you can participate as much as you'd like or sit back and enjoy the content\r\n\r\n*WEAKNESSES:\r\n     - Readings\/research were, at times, a bit difficult and scientific--lots of stats, research methods, neuroscience, etc.; these were not required, though, so they did not need to be read in full or in-depth all the time",
                "The course material is interesting, but I feel that the course title of \"The Criminal Mind\" is a little misleading. The major foci of the course are antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, but more general criminal behavior is only briefly discussed.",
                "This course is very easy to follow even without background in psychology or neuroscience. The quizzes, tests, and essays cover all the important concepts in class without being overly challenging.",
                "due to the fact that it was online, I think that I would have appreciated an in-person element, especially when it came to some of the lectures. But the lectures themselves were done really well and I appreciated the professor's use of various mediums.",
                "This course was great! I loved the lectures and learned so much. It would be awesome to have more interaction in smaller groups.",
                "Great content; you know it's a great class when you're learning about things you have never heard about or thought about before, and you leave the class thinking about these topics all the time. I would not change the way this course is taught. The professor is great.",
                "This course was the optimal classsuper low work, super high reward! No discussion sections, and very little reading material\/assignments, but somehow this class was the most rewarding and educational of my classes this semester. Professor Baskin-Sommers is very good at teachingher PowerPoints follow a very easy to follow and logical progression both within the slides and between each PowerPoint, and have a lot of interesting video clips and polls and activities that kept me engaged. All of the material is relatively simple to understand but with major social implications. The class is large but there are a lot of TF's, so any questions asked in the chat would be immediately answered by a TF and often also Professor Baskin-Sommers herself. She also has a very clear voice and diction which is really important to stay focused in Zoom classes. I don't think there were any weaknesses of this class, although I would have appreciated opportunities to connect with other students in social settings.",
                "Strengths: Uber-competent professor who is just invested in everyone knowing this important information. You learn about good practice in psychology, evaluating crime through a professional lens, from an expert, that you won't find in popular discourse, though it is so relevant. The professor and TF's arranged modules to explain every facet of the course - reading academic papers, doing research for papers, etc. The first two papers were templates to teach us how to write for psychology and how to mine important aspects of the course. The professor brought in speakers and provided reading that lent an incredible human aspect to the whole course. The professor responds to any and all questions about the material, exams, papers, etc., instantaneously, using compassion and wisdom to really teach. I really can't even cover all of the strengths - there are too many. \r\n\r\nWeakness: It's almost silly to mention this, because the professor is the rare educator who has no interest in tricking her students through trickily crafted questions, but the exams were a little bit annoying. We are used to trying to read really precisely and answer questions according to carefully memorized and applied information, but even the detailed questions on the exams in this class are more about realizing that the professor wants us to have certain major takeaways that are sort of the hot-take of this class, and then answering in that direction.",
                "strengths: \r\n- Engaging curriculum",
                "I thought this course was very well organized. Lecture slides were always posted, essays had clear templates\/instructions with rubrics, exams had study guides and details were reinforced in lectures prior to the exam days, and review sessions\/office hours were very easy to access.",
                "The professor made this class very easy to understand. Which such an array of information to study, she clearly identified what was imprints and not. A weakness was that because there was so much info, it was tough to understand at times.",
                "Professor Baskins-Sommers is very understanding (especially during election time) and also answers questions on Piazza very fast and thoroughly",
                "A strength of this course was simply the material for me. I don't know if its a personal thing, but for some reason I really enjoyed learning about it and it kept me engaged even though it was a lecture format. The biggest strength however was the availability of everyone. The professor and TA's were readily available in lecture and out of it and that made it really easy to get answers to questions. The only weakness of this course for me is super minor but I felt as if the music was kind of unnecessary, luckily the improvement I would suggest is already in place in that it is optional to listen to and that its only played before class starts."

                "Recording the lectures was extremely helpful because it is easy to get distracted during lectures when at home, with roommates, etc. Having the ability to rewatch the lectures to see what you may have missed was great.",
                "Dr. Sommers structured the class as an optional synchronous lecture, so people could watch recorded lectures without attending class live. I think this was a very successful policy as it allowed students more flexibility in choosing their schedules and reduced some of the stress of online learning. The Zoom movie nights were also very fun and helped with a bit of the more social engagement aspect of the course. The exams and quizzes were open-book which was very helpful, especially if you had a particularly tough week leading up to a quiz or exam. While this isn't specifically a practice specifically for COVID-19, I feel the poll everywhere questions could be used a bit more in the lectures, especially towards the end. It really makes the remote learning experience more engaging. Other than that, I think all the implemented changes were a success and made the course very accommodating and enjoyable in a remote setting.",
                "The lectures were successful in my opinion. Additionally, the essays and exams were reasonable given the COVID-19 circumstances.",
                "All of it succeeded  there was poll everywhere so you could be engaged if you wanted to, but you could also just watch back recorded lectures and not be at a disadvantage. Weekly quizzes forced you to keep up, but they weren't challenging (if you watched the lectures once you'd get 100% on all of them, and they're open note). The exams were a little tricker than quizzes, but also open note and you got half points back after if you submitted corrections. Essays were very clearly guided. Great class.",
                "I wish more courses would make recording their lectures a habitual practice even after the pandemic is over, as it increases schedule flexibility and makes taking notes easier for students with auditory processing issues who may otherwise have a difficult time keeping up in live lecture. Personally I like being able to go back and listen to any parts I may have missed or not understood completely. It's also easier to be more engaged during live lecture because I'm not so hyperfocused on not missing anything in my notes, that I can actually slow down and enjoy the lecture.",
                "Having the lectures posted to canvas was incredibly helpful because you could go back and watch things you didn't understand the first time around.",
                "Can't think of any that really need improved. Lectures, slides, readings, etc are all posted on Canvas for easy access. Great to have both live and recordings available.",
                "I thought having live polls take place during class was a great way to keep people engaged and interacting with the material. Professor Baskin-Sommers was also very responsive on piazza which helped facilitate discussion and answer student question in the  online format.",
                "The polls were very helpful!",
                "Open note exams were nice because they took away the stress of a huge exam, and I really appreciated being able to take it at any time on the test day. Piazza was also amazing, and Dr. Baskin-Sommers responds to any student questions in like 2 minutes, regardless of the time of day.",
                "Having asynchronous testing and more or less flexible deadlines and testing times were great strategies implemented in this course. Not much needed to be changed, the only suggestion I have would be to have students direct questions towards TF's in private chats during class, as sometimes it was very distracting when a group of 3-5 students would constantly pepper the professor with questions. She did a great job of going through lectures and the TF's were amazing and responding promptly, but it felt like students shouldn't have used lecture time for questions, and either waited after lecture or gone to office hours with their questions.",
                "I loved having live lectures as an attempt to mimic being in class, and having the lectures available for a later viewing was such a valuable resource. Overall, I have a very positive experience in this course considering the given situation.",
                "Succeeded: recorded lectures & captions. CAPTIONS WERE THE BEST\r\n\r\nCould be better: none",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful. Open-note exams also very nice because it took off so much stress, but I still studied and learned the material.",
                "Asking questions in the chat worked but sometimes slowed down lectures if getting too caught up and Piazza was very useful",
                "she handled it really well, was super considerate of students, no improvements needed here",
                "The use of Poll Everywhere, video clips, and music helped keep the classroom engaged on zoom.",
                "Honestly I am not sure what could be improved because I think this class did it all very very well. Allowing for a open notes tests really helped reduce anxiety for tests especially in a COVID time. I still studied a lot but it was a lot less stressful.",
                "The lectures were really good! Nothing much to improve.",

                "Professor Baskin-Sommers provided recorded lectures with subtitles and I was extremely pleased with her attention to detail and accommodation in doing so",
                "Because the lectures were online, they were recorded and could be accessed later for reviewing, which was very helpful.",
                "Recorded lectures helped, poll everywhere was a negative for me",
                "I loved how the lectures were recorded because it gave me the flexibility I needed during this semester.",

                "Worked:\r\n- Recorded lectures with search options - super helpful for preparing for exams! \r\n- Making the structure open-note (Fair playing field for all students)\r\n- Q\/A availability during the live session via the Zoom chat",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers did an amazing job watching the chat during lectures answering all students question that may have raised which made for a very good level of engagement.",
                "The virtual lectures were always recorded and were super accessible. It seemed like office hours were being held at a wide variety of times, and the class's Piazza platform was super helpful in aiding our learning as it was more difficult to get that one-on-one help in this semester. Overall, I think the class was adapted very well for the given times.",
                "The virtual questions were effective! As well as the encouragement to use of the chat box in which almost all questions were answered.",

                "I think the only thing that could have been improved would be the opportunity to engage with the professor in smaller, discussion settings. However, that's very difficult in a class of 400 people.",
                "Recorded lectures are probably the best thing to come out of the pandemic. I can pause whenever I need to as well as speed up concepts I already understand, making the course materials much more easily engaged with. Open note exams helped me more conceptualize and understand the material for myself instead of spending that time to cram or force myself to memorize useless facts. It also made me prepare more through all the course material and take better notes because I knew that I could use it when I needed to.",
                "I feel like this was answered above, but I think this class was perfect, even over Zoom.",
                "The recorded format helped me so much to be able to rewatch as I went to not miss any information. The weekly quizzes were also helpful to prevent me from falling behind on lectures.",

                "Excellent engagement overall: good use of video clips to apply concepts to certain case-studies, great use of in class polls, questions were always answered when typed into the chat, and even the weekly quizzes were a good, low-stress method for reviewing the content of the week",
                "Worked well!",
                "Dr. Baskin-Sommers was very attentive to student questions during lectures, which I really appreciated--she regularly checked the chat throughout her lectures. She and her team also had a lot of office hours which can be very useful, especially when writing essays.",

                "This class allows for asynchronous learning, which greatly helps accommodate time difference.",
                "The recorded lectures, movie nights, piazza page and review sessions were SO helpful. I honestly felt like there were no cons to having virtual learning this semester with this course other than not getting to interact with Professor Baskin-Sommers in person. There were so many ways to get help and feedback that I never felt like my learning was affected by being at home.",
                "I think that lectures were recorded and using Piazza was incredibly helpful. Similarly, the weekly quizzes on the lectures and Sunday announcements on what was coming up each week were very helpful as reminders, particularly as I was enrolled remotely. I think the course could have been somewhat more interactive, though an effort was made, whether in group office hours or through using poll everywhere more.",
                "zoom lectures were great, very clear to understand. the use of videos and polls worked really well with the virtual format",

                "I really appreciated that this class was recorded. I was able to replay lectures to clarify my notes and make sure I understood the concepts. Particularly in a pandemic when on any given students might have things in their personal lives that make it hard to focus on class, by recording the lectures it felt like Professor Baskin-Sommers really understood this and wanted to support her students.",
                "Successful in teaching us virtually",
                "I thought the open-book nature of the exams was very fair. It put everyone in the class on a level playing field by neutralizing for potential cheating.",
                "The recorded lectures were really helpful! Also, as I said before, the ability of Professor Baskin-Sommers to make the class engaging was helpful too.",
                "Zoom chat function",
                "I felt as if the lectures being recorded and than posted on Canvas really allowed me to keep up in the course because zoom can get very tiring it allowed me to watch back anything I missed if I were to space out at any point. The only thing that could be improved would be interactions between teachers and students, but office hours did partially cover this.",
                "I think having recorded lectures is a must for future classes, especially when in person. The recorded lectures may be the best support tool students have for studying on their own",

                "I think the virtual lectures were great.",
                "I enjoyed the live lecture format. Professor Baskin-Sommers was very receptive to questions asked in the chat. Additionally, the TFs did an amazing job giving long, detailed responses to questions that were not answered by Professor Baskin-Sommers.",
                "Professor was very responsive which was incredibly helpful, she was so kind and really made reaching out to her an enjoyable and not terrifying process.",
                "I liked how Professor Baskin-Sommers used polls in classes to increase engagement. Also, she was very on top of Piazza. I think Piazza is a great resource for virtual learning!",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers was an amazing lecturer and made incredible recordings. I cant think of how the virtual classroom could be improved.",
                "Having recorded lectures made the class a lot better.",
                "I thought that holding the lectures live and also recording them was very effective. The Yale media Library creating transcripts of the lectures was also very helpful.",
                "I thought that overall the structure of the course was great. I really appreciated that the lectures were recorded, as it made it possible to go back and rewatch parts of the lecture if necessary. I thought the exams and quizzes were great knowledge checks, and the essays were an opportunity to apply our knowledge to a situation.",
                "Quizzes, exams, and papers were all graded quickly which helped ensure quick feedback. Piazza was also incredibly helpful and Professor Baskin-Sommers and the other TAs were very quick to respond to questions and other clarifications.",
                "The lectures were recorded and the piazza page was very helpful for those who couldn't ask questions in live lecture or go to office hours.",
                "The class worked well with COVID. Lectures were live and recorded.",
                "Allowing students to ask questions in the chat was helpful. I think this was the best online course I took during COVID-19 -- it was very organized and well thought-out.",
                "recorded lectures were helpful for going back to the essays",
                "I really appreciated the fact that we had live lectures that were recorded and posted on Canvas later. It provided a space for us to ask questions in real time but also provided some structure to our days. Sometimes the chat feature was distracting\/annoying but I understand and appreciate the purpose of it.",
                "Weekly quizzes, open note exams and essays were all well suited for Covid-19 learning.",
                "The course worked very well with the virtual format.",
                "I appreciated that we had long windows to take quizzes and exams, so that people in different time zones had time to complete them before the deadline.",
                "I think that our weekly quizzes were very helpful as they encouraged us to keep up to date with the content of the course and the opportunity to regain some marks on our tests encouraged extra revision.",
                "Virtual recordings as well as virtual live lectures were helpful because I could go back and reference old lecture recordings.",
                "the course allowed flexible time management especially for different time zones",
                "Overall, this class worked pretty well virtually. The lectures were clear and easy to follow, and the pauses to answer questions in the chat\/the time at the end to answer those questions was helpful. The one problem was that Im a slow note-taker, so at the beginning of the term I would always get behind on note-taking during the lecture, but Professor Baskin-Sommers adjusted and slowed down her lecturing a bit to address that problem that some people were having.",
                "I think Piazza was a great online resource. Office hours were also easier to attend because they were conducted through Zoom. I appreciated we could review the recorded lectures on our own as well.",
                "The recorded lectures were especially helpful during the pandemic. I appreciated the extensive help provided by the teaching staff and the large amount of office hours.",
                "Amazing guest lectures were really engaging and Professor Baskin-Sommers always tried to include interactive polls and videos to keep students engaged which I appreciated!",
                "The search feature on panopto was incredibly helpful in reviewing course content.",
                "Lectures were hosted live, but live attendance was optional and they were posted after the fact. If attended live, Professor Baskin-Sommers often used live polls to help with engagement which was definitely nice.",
                "The live lectures on zoom worked well for this course, being able to ask questions in the chat was very helpful, but were still pretty much the same experience if you needed to watch them later. Piazza was also very helpful, as were the TA review sessions on zoom before exams. Because it is such a large course, I think it was a very similar to what the course was like in person.",
                "Though the lectures were synchronous, the option to view the lectures recorded was available which was incredibly helpful with scheduling issues and allowed more flexibility with time during the day. One of the major things I liked about the course was the Poll Everywhere use as it allowed the course to feel more interactive and engaging throughout these odd times.",
                "The professor and TAs had movie nights and such to promote engagement between students. In terms of virtual learning, the recording of the lectures and the inclusion of captions in the recordings were extremely helpful.",
                "Virtual lectures that were live succeeded--I wish every class did this instead of prerecorded lectures.",
                "The recorded lectures made it very convenient to catch up on course content",
                "I love the recordings and the ability to watch at 2x speed.\r\n\r\nThe professor was very involved on Piazza which was unbelievable and extremely helpful.",
                "I think this class worked really well online.",
                "Having all lectures and review sessions recorded was enormously helpful.",
                "The lectures were engaging, especially when Prof. Baskin-Sommers included polls throughout the class, as well as video clips relating to the topic being discussed. Additionally, the lectures were posted for later viewing, so I was able to watch them back if I missed a piece of information or if I couldn't make it to class that day.",
                "I think Professor Baskin-Somers did a very good job in being accommodating given the COVID pandemic. Her deadlines for the quizzes and work were consistent and spaced out enough that we had time to complete them. The recorded lectures allowed us to revisit information that was taught, and this was especially helpful.",
                "Professor sommers was very understanding and was willing to be flexible with due dates. She really wanted all of us to succeed and even reached out to me personally when I had missed a deadline even though this was a 300+ person class",
                "The weekly quizzes helped to keep me on top of the lectures, especially if I missed a lecture. Having all of the lectures be recorded was SO helpful, especially because I was able to cure my zoom-fatigue. Office hours were also really easy to schedule and were very accessible.",
                "Recorded lectures were beneficial in several ways: they were searchable, they were captioned, and they were saved online.",
                "The recording of lectures was extremely useful and the opportunity to take certain elements of the course asynchronously aided course load management a lot.",
                "I liked how the live lectures were recorded, as it allowed me to go back and review material that I was confused about.",
                "The polls throughout the lecture were a really nice addition that kept us engaged and made sure that we were understanding the material.",
                "Very succesful, both live and recorded lectures, readings. I was unable to attend many live lectures and was still able to learn and do well in this course.",
                "Although the course was fully virtual, the professor managed to make the course interesting and engaging! Very well taught!",
                "Live lectures were helpful and she kept lectures very engaging and interesting which was really good. I felt more engaged than in other classes.",
                "Despite the lectures being virtual, they were very engaging, with poll-everywhere, Q&As, and videos. There were also guest lectures which were very interesting.",
                "quizzes were asynchronous, that is very good. \r\nExams are also asynchronous, very very helpful!",
                "Live Zoom lectures worked out nicely, the recorded lectures with subtitles for easy search were really really helpful, and Piazza was a great platform for questions thanks to Prof. Baskin-Sommers and the TFs' quick responses",
                "I liked the format of the class and how everything was recorded so I could go back and look at concepts I didn't understand.",
                "The provision of the recordings of lectures and the transcript that was generated alongside them were both extremely helpful.",
                "Quizzes were great to keep students on track",
                "Having in person and recorded lectures were very helpful. I think also having questions on PollEverywhere asked during live lecture was also a good tool to make sure that students were following the material. I can't think of anything that could be improved.",
                "Any class virtually is super hard to work out. Professor Baskin-Sommers did an excellent job keeping the lectures really interesting and making sure we were up to date on the course material with weekly quizzes. I don't really have any complaints.",
                "SUCCESSES:\r\n     - Lectures recorded and posted afterwards helped immensely for those who could not or did not want to attend live during class time\r\n     - Lecture videos, lecture slides, notes, readings, research, and all other course materials were organized into a concise module in Canvas that can be accessed according to the day of the lecture (e.g. Class #1 had a module containing the lecture video, slides, readings, and relevant links all arranged and compiled together for easy access)\r\n     - Thorough syllabus with concrete deadlines and accessible links--nothing was up-in-the-air or unclear\r\n     - Quizzes were short, timed, and easily completed\r\n     - Piazza helped immensely with asking questions--response times from the professor were impressively low\r\n     - Weekly emails detailing the classes and assignments ahead kept us on track and informed\r\n     - One quiz dropped at end of semester, two tests with opportunity to fix answers and get more points added, three essays all outlined thoroughly, and all assignments had good timing, good difficulty, and enough resources; all assignments were open-book and all resources were available--there was nothing that needed to be looked up online as all info was presented beautifully by the course and the professor",
                "I really liked the ask-the-expert series and appreciated how the use of zoom was able to connect the students with multiple experts from the field.",
                "It was great!",
                "I appreciated the open-note exams and opportunities to earn back points. The professor was very understanding about the circumstances and gave us every chance to learn from our errors.",
                "Course was very well suited to remote learning",
                "This course fit the virtual format very well. Professor Baskin-Sommers' PowerPoints were very clear and well-made with lots of videos, polls, images, etc. that sustained my interest. The TF's were very responsive; any questions asked in the Zoom chat would be answered immediately and often also elaborated on by Professor Baskin-Sommers. Everything was also recorded, which helped with reviewing material or if you didn't catch everything in a lecture.",
                "The review sessions and many office hours opportunities were successful in my opinion. I also appreciated that we had 24 hours for the exams and Professor Baskin-Sommers was willing to provide extensions on submissions if issues arose. I believe the course was originally a lecture, so any potential concerns about disengagement might be related more to the format of lectures as opposed to an issue with the course itself.",
                "To be quite honest, I thought this class was very good and cant suggest anything of substance that could better improve it.",
                "This was one of the best-organized Zoom courses I have taken. The syllabus has the plans laid out but the necessary material can also be found in modules or in files on Canvas and the ease of access was very nice. The poll everywhere kept me engaged near the end of the lecture and were good for applying the concepts that we had learned to real life examples. Piazza was amazing as the TA's or professor answered all questions outside of lecture in a timely manner and the professor was open to being emailed about the material if you didn't want the question seen by everyone. Lectures also used chat wisely since it was a large lecture having us unmute would be confusing and the teacher would instead have us ask questions through chat that either the TA's would answer and if not periodically the professor would check to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Fantastic and I cannot think of improvements."

                "ABSOLUTELY! So interesting!",
                "I would 1000000% recommend this course to another student! Not only do you get to learn the actual science behind criminal behavior but you get to know Dr. Sommers, who is an amazing person. I learned so much from this course and it really taught me to evaluate my own preconceived notions about criminal justice, which is an extremely important topic as we see rampant police brutality and the demonization and criminalization of BIPOC communities. Dr. Sommers is the best! She is so kind and down-to-earth. She makes each lecture fun and interesting and you can tell she is really passionate about this subject. She makes Spotify playlists for every lecture (and they're really good!). She is also understanding and accommodating. During election week, she pushed back the deadline on one of our essays twice in recognition of the added stress we were all feeling. She works hard to give every student the chance to succeed in the class. If you do take this course, I would HIGHLY encourage you to go to her office hours. I had never been to an office hour before, and she was so welcoming and kind. It was so cool to get to know her and to learn from someone so knowledgeable about the criminal mind. The class is also very low stress and would be a perfect 4th or fifth class to lighten up a busy schedule. After taking this class, I am heavily considering becoming a neuroscience major. Take The Criminal Mind! You won't regret it!",
                "Absolutely. This course is not overwhelming for someone who has never taken a Cog-Sci course. The material is manageable and fascinating.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. If you want a professor who will respond to piazza comments at 11pm in a lecture with 300+ people and grade everyone's exams overnight so that you can get your corrections in before reading period, then you should take this class. You also learn a lot in a low effort way. If you do your work, you can get an A.",
                "Yes, prof really just cares that you learn the material. It's a very low-stress class online since quizzes and exams were open-note, but otherwise it would be a lot of memorization.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
                "Yes! Take it. It's low-pressure and interesting.",
                "Absolutely! This course is super informative and engaging without being too demanding work-wise. Professor Baskin-Sommers wants you to succeed and learn. She is not interested in blind-siding students with ridiculously difficult material or unclear instruction.",
                "Yes! This is a great class for students who aren't sure if they want to go into psychology. You can still learn a lot and be engaged even if you aren't psych oriented.",
                "YES!!!! Dr. Baskin-Sommers and her teaching team are excellent. I am not a psychology major, but still found this class amazing.",
                "If you have a chance to take this class, do it! Doesn't take a lot of work and the content is surprisingly interesting\/relevant to today.",
                "Yes! This course is amazing, and Dr. Baskin-Sommers is a wonderful person. There is a lot to be learned in the course, it's not a difficult course, and it is very interesting information. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology, or looking for a stimulating course with a lighter workload.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this class to any Psychology major or non-psychology major. This class is such an interesting subject matter about a subset of the population that is typically misunderstood and a mystery to many.",
                "Yes, a great 5th credit. Content was very interesting, learning the material was a joy and was easy, too.",
                "Yes, good 5th class and intro level psyc class",
                "Yes if you are interested in more of the neuroscience side of things instead of the criminal aspect of things because it was more science than I anticipated",
                "YES, she's an amazing professor, and the way she teaches is literally top tier",
                "Absolutely -- extremely engaging and interesting class, even over Zoom",
                "Yes! Most definitely! This course made me learn so so much. If you are looking for a class to start study psychopathology, this is the course for you!",
                "YES. Take a class with Prof. Baskin-Sommers",
                "YES I loved this course. I think the material was interesting and enlightening. I never realized just how much mental illness affected those in the criminal justice system. The course wasn't hard, but I still feel like I enjoyed a lot.",
                "Yes 100% !!! Absolutely loved this class so much and it was taught so well.",
                "If you are fascinated by this topic, or would simply like to learn what \"The Criminal Mind\" is all about, then I would highly recommend this course for you.",
                "Absolutely! The professor is great! The TAs are great! The content is so interesting and should be taught to EVERYONE!",
                "It is a relatively easy class, and what you get out of it depends on how much effort you want to put into it. Regardless, there's a lot of interesting materials and generally laid back.",
                "Yes, it's a good gut.",
                "Yes! It is so interesting.",
                "Yes! If you are at all curious about law, crime, or psychology, you will love this class! It is fun, interesting, and easy! I couldn't;t recommend it more, especially as a fifth class. The instructor is understanding, accessible, personable, and an expert in the field!",
                "Absolutely, this course was amazing. I learned so much and the assignments were interesting and the exams were very fair. The clear communication between students and teachers was really helpful.",
                "Yes, it was a great class with a great professor",
                "Yes I would, but I would suggest taking it credit\/d\/fail rather than for a letter grade. The TFs are very strict considering it is a fairly low\/early psych class, and the assignments and exams requires knowledge not taught in class.",
                "YES!! This course was so interesting and wasn't stressful at all. I learned so much without having to worry all the time about my grades or if I was caught up.",
                "I'd recommend this course to students interested in learning about the relationship between mental disorders, social structures, and the law.",
                "Definitely very interesting class.",
                "Absolutely, this is hands down my favorite course at Yale so far",
                "Yes! I loved the content and Professor Baskin-Sommers was a great lecturer",
                "Yes, if you get a chance to take this course, then you should absolutely do it. You will learn so many interesting things, and a lot of thoughts you have about criminal activity will be challenged and probably debunked. The class helped me understand crime so much better, and it wasn't a stressful class at all.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enough, even to those who have no interest in psychology, social justice, or biology. The subject of this class is extremely pertinent, and the information learned is vital to creating a better future, even if one has no intent on continuing learning about it. The lectures were incredibly engaging and well-taught, where all information taught was pertinent to the topic at hand. Professor Baskin-Sommers is so knowledgable and passionate about this field and it really translates to her teaching, even over zoom. She boiled down complex topics to easy-to-understand explanations masterfully, sometimes providing her own takes on some topics. Assignments felt necessary and important to complete simply for our understanding; nothing felt drawn out for the sake of the assignment. I am a computer science student, but the class really made me want to explore more of the psychology department, especially ones related to this course!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes!!! Take this class if its available!!",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It's very interesting and the instructors\/TFs care more that you're learning than your grades\/test scores.",
                "Absolutely!!!",
                "YES! YES! YES! This class was one of my favorite at Yale. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an amazing lecturer and did a really good job of keeping the lectures interesting.",
                "Yes! The content is super interesting, and it is taught in a very approachable manner. I loved this class.",
                "Absolutely if you're interested in psychology or even if you just want an introduction to the field - a very interesting class!",
                "Absolutely! This is such a fabulous course and Professor Baskin-Sommers is truly amazing. She is so dedicated to her work and helping students to understand the course material.",
                "Baskin-Sommers is the best. Very well organized and interesting material for this class. Youll learn a lot about the criminal mind",
                "Yes, it was a very fun insightful class. I absolutely loved it.",
                "Yes! Personally for me, having a brother who displays some CU-traits, it was really informative to know how I could better interact with him as a brother. But even if you don't have personal ties, this class clears up a lot of misconceptions of psychopathy and APSD, which is super informative!",
                "Yes! 100% take this course if you can. It's interesting, facilitates learning, and if you put in the effort, you are guaranteed a good grade.",
                "Yes, I loved everything about this course. There was consistent work but nothing extremely difficult and it was helpful overall once I got to the exams.",
                "YES. It'll teach you a lot -- not just about criminals, but about their psychology, police training, the law, etc. So important",
                "Yes, this course should be taken by students because this class is one of kind to me, at least. The exploring of individuals with psychopathy or externalizing was something truly unique and it furthers a student's knowledge of these individuals. This is probably a course that might appear once in a while, so if you have the opportunity, I would take it.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would - it was interesting from beginning to end and touched on many current social issues as well as teaching us basic neuroscience and psychology terms.",
                "Yes! Take it if you're at all interested in learning about why people commit criminal acts or looking for a chill class to add to your schedule.",
                "Yes! There are so many misconceptions in the world of criminal justice reform and even general knowledge about psychopaths or criminal minds, and it has definitely changed my viewpoint. It is also very interesting to be exposed to the cutting edge research of this field, and I loved seeing how experiments were formed and how the results were best analyzed. I would also say that you should just take any class with Professor Baskin-Sommers because it is truly a joy, and one you will not regret!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was very eye-opening for me, as the class teaches a lot about not only the psychology behind the criminal mind, but also the way the justice system and society function together and how they can impact mental health.",
                "yes! it's interesting content, professor baskin-sommers is a great lecturer and does her best to help students succeed in her class by giving them as many opportunities possible to do well! as long as you attend lecture, do the assignments\/exams + do some readings, you should do well in the class. I would say its a pretty good fifth class to take.",
                "I am going to tell everyone to take this but for most of my friends, it would probably be too late since it's not taught every year. I think everyone should take this just to understand how people's environments shape them and what growing up in poverty can do to you. Some of the things you learn in this class really make you want to write a letter to your Senator so I feel like it should be like, required. It's such a great class so if anyone I knew had the chance to take it I would really really be excited for them.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. It is so much fun and it is so cool. I feel like this is one of those Yale courses that everyone should try to take before they graduate.",
                "I would recommend this class to pretty much anyone, as it seems like the knowledge you take from this class is useful in everyday life for understanding our criminal justice system.",
                "YES! This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I came into this course knowing nothing about how the criminal mind operates and now I leave with a much greater understanding of the criminal mind. Professor Baskin-Sommers is also a gem and you won't regret taking a class with her. She is an exceptional scholar of psychology and her knowledge is unparalleled.",
                "I definitely recommend this course, especially if you are looking to get an SO requirement done. The class isn't difficult as long as you attend lecture and take decent notes, and I found the subject super engaging despite not being a psych major. It's obvious that Professor Baskin-Sommers is totally committed to helping all of her students succeed; her lectures are very clear and digestible, and she and the TAs were very on top of the almost comically active Piazza page, answering questions and making sure everyone was understanding the material.",
                "Absolutely. This class was easily the best course experience I've had yet at Yale. Not only is the professor engaging and thoughtful in her approach to learning (especially during the pandemic), but it somehow managed to be a unique combination of both a low-stress and high-learning environment. The open-note quizzes and exams, as well as the essay topics\/structures made it so that I never truly felt concerned about the workload; at the same time, though, somehow this style of learning made it so that I processed the information better than in many of my other classes. If you have the opportunity, definitely take this course.",
                "Yes! Prof. Baskin-Sommers is awesome, and the class is really engaging and covers important topics for better understanding of our concept of the \"criminal\"",
                "Yes! It was very interesting learning about the \"criminal\" mind and gave me opportunities to correct any misconceptions I had regarding antisocial\/psychotic behaviors. The course also really pushed me to think about ways in which we can transform the criminal justice system\/policing to better accommodate and treat these individuals.",
                "Yes. Best class Ive taken.",
                "Yes! All the topics are super interesting and the professor is also good at making the lectures engaging.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Fun and iteresting social science credit.",
                "100%! Professor Baskin-Sommers is AMAZING and so knowledgeable on the topics covered in class. This class is definitely not like the TV show at all but you will learn so much about topics that are actually really relevant. You will gain a deep understanding of different forms of mental illness and help you view people with these illnesses and even incarcerated individuals from a different lens. You get to learn about how people with these illnesses are more likely to come in contact with the police and what kind of reforms can be put in place to help this issue which is really relevant and important for anyone to know. Definitely take this class during your time at Yale not only for the amazing professor but also how much you will learn.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in economics",
                "Yes! This course is great for anyone interested in the differences in the brains of criminals and the general population. It is also interesting to analyze the population that is involved in the criminal justice system and the high prevalence of poverty and mental illness. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale and fascinating for Psychology\/Neuroscience majors.",
                "Yes.",
                "absolutely! whether you are simply interested in taking a psychology class or are interested in a study of criminality in society, this course so beautifully teaches content in an organized, engaging way. i think it was so amazing even online this semester and i would highly recommend taking it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about why criminal behave in the way they do and possible interventions that could be implemented to help such individuals. Overall, it was an easy course with relatively low workload and exams were not that hard. Essays were written following a template for the first two essays. It is a fun class to take without having to stress too much about!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to someone actually interested in the psychology of the justice system looking for a course with less work.",
                "Yes! Very enjoyable and lowkey.",
                "yes, I learned a lot. I enjoyed the class and it wasn't too much work.",
                "Yes! The course has well-defined objectives and is incredibly well organized.",
                "Yeah! I wouldn't say it's an absolute must take, but the material is interesting, and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is a clear speaker and more responsive than any other prof at Yale. It's a psych course that I wouldn't imagine taking at other points in my life or at other universities, so I'd recommend it if you're looking for an interesting fifth class",
                "I would because I thought the course content was very interesting",
                "Yes very interesting",
                "Take it! Very interesting & focuses more on learning than grading (not that hard to get an A as long as youre engaged)",
                "Yes, solid 5th credit!",
                "Yes! If you can, take this class. It's really interesting and Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great teacher.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is extremely interesting and the teaching staff is awesome. The workload is not too much, but also is enough to keep students engaged and learning a lot.",
                "Yes!! Criminal psychology is so interesting; I absolutely loved learning about it. Even enjoyed talking to my friends and family about some of the things I learned in class.",
                "Yes. Interesting content with a great professor and good grading",
                "absolutely, If you can if it in your schedule. I think everyone should take this course",
                "Yes I would if they are interested in crime. It's like taking a sneak peak behind the minds of individuals we would consider crazy",
                "One of the best courses at Yale - a must take.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot and the lectures were enjoyable to sit through",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in this topic. At times, the lectures that focus on the psychobiology of disorders may seem like a lot of theoretical information at a time. However, Professor Baskin-Sommers is dedicated to making sure that everyone understands the material and answers all questions thoroughly.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Definitely take this course! Youll learn SO much about the criminal mind and criminal justice system. It truly changed my perspective on criminals in a positive way",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course!! Prof Baskin-Sommers is sooo knowledgeable and passionate about the material of this course.",
                "Yes! Lots of funlow workload, readings are optional, no section, but you learn a lot of interesting and very timely material.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because the material is interesting and makes a lot of sense once you understand it, makes you more conscious of why some people may have less control over the criminal behavior they engage in from a biological level, and I would also recommend because Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great teacher.",
                "Yes, the class is very fun and informative to understanding mental illness overall.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. I would recommend this class to any student actually regardless of major or interest. I had never taken a psych course before but thought CM sounded interesting and it was truly an amazing class. Professor Baskin Sommers was so well informed and engaging during lecture. You could tell she was really passionate about her work. I also had never learned about the Criminal Justcie system through the eyes of psychologist. The suggestions of improvement she made were groundbreaking to me.",
                "The Criminal Mind is absolutely great. Though the workload is not significant, you'll come out with a nuanced perspective of the intersection of mental health and law, and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is caring and an amazing lecturer. It's great for the class too that some of the assigned research papers were made by her. Definitely a take.",
                "Yes, it is a very interesting and manageable course.  I think it offers new insight into the criminal mind and Professor Sommers is an amazing teacher.",
                "This was a great class. I am already recommending it to other students. Work demand was very low yet we learned so much. Lessons changed my perspective on many issues.",
                "yes! great class, super interesting and really geared towards learning.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Especially as a non-stem major, the course was taught in a way that all levels could understand.",
                "100%. It's fun, engaging, manageable workload, understanding, responsive to our needs, culturally competent, expands your mind and heart in our consideration of neurodiversity, and it provides a scientific underlining for abolitionist frameworks.",
                "Yes definitely. I believe this class was very unique and interesting and gives a lot of insight to some of the major issues in society right now.",
                "Yes because it is a good entry level psychology class",
                "Yes! This course is super fun and really interesting.",
                "Yes! This class is super interesting and the workload is totally manageable",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I took it because the subject material sounded interesting, and I was not disappointed. It was incredibly interesting to learn about the Criminal Mind, and we got to watch clips from movies and television. Additionally, the material changed a lot of my preconceived notions about the justice system.",
                "Of course, this course is a fascinating insight into criminals and how they come to be.",
                "Yes! An amazing course taught by an amazing professor. The work load is very manageable. I think I learned a lot about the criminal mind. If you have an opportunity to take it, please take advantage of the opportunity!",
                "Absolutely! If you like Psych and want to learn from a passionate and great professor, take this course! Even if you dont have any Psych background to be honest, its still interesting.",
                "Yes definitely! The course material about serial killers and psychopaths is pretty interesting and you don't need any understanding of psychology or neuroscience going in. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an amazing lecturer and she is very knowledgeable about this field and does a great job in explaining the concepts to inexperienced individuals as well as keeping it engaging for people with some pre-existing knowledge. The structure of the class made sure you don't fall behind easily as you had weekly quizzes (you should get a perfect as long as you watched the lecture) that covered the key concepts of each week's lecture. The essays were easy to score an A on as long as you followed the rubric closely. Templates were provided for essays 1 and 2 (they aren't traditional essays that you may expect. they are more evidence-based short answer responses) and you could easily do them in a few hours. Essay 3 was on the longer side but was by no means unreasonable (2-3 pages single spaced).",
                "100%!! Very interesting material; Easy easy A!",
                "Yes definitely take this course! Very low workload and very interesting material.",
                "Yes, it is a great fourth or fifth class. If you're interested in criminal policy it's great too because you'll learn about how to apply the psych we learned to potential policy changes. It was not a lot of work but I still feel like I learned a lot.",
                "Yes!!! Excellent professor and interesting material",
                "Absolutely!! This is a phenomenal course. The course material is extremely interesting, and Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing. The workload is also not overwhelming.",
                "Yes, it was very nice.",
                "Yes! Professor Baskin-Sommers is clearly very knowledgeable and a good lecturer. Also, even in a class of 200+ people, she takes time to respond to emails very in-depth and warmly",
                "Absolutely. Amazing professor and amazing class content especially for non neuro or psych majors.",
                "Yes I highly recommend this course to another student. Manageable workload and supportive teaching staff. Also very interesting material.",
                "yes, a very interesting course with a strong professor",
                "I 100% recommend this course to future students- psychology majors, people trying to get a social science, and people just taking it for fun. If it was this good online I can't imagine what it's like in person.",
                "I definitely would. Super interesting material, manageable workload and fair grading. I thoroughly enjoyed it",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in crimes and human behavior\/psychology.",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting, provides a useful perspective on what crime is, and is taught well.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The content is very interesting and Professor Baskin-Sommers did a great job of delivering it. It was probably my favourite course of the semester.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to everyone. If you are not interested in psychology, there is enough non-psychology information to make you interested (although I am sure you would find the psychology material interesting as well). The course is curated very well to facilitate learning no matter what your background is, and I urge students to take the class to understand the complexities and prejudices of the criminal justice system in the US.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely interested in psychology or crime\/the justice system and wants to take a class that covers a lot of material and teaches a lot, but has a relatively light workload. This is a course that you can kind of make into what you want it to be, because there are so many extra resources provided to deepen understanding.",
                "Yes! I think anyone interested in working in criminal justice, public policy, psychology, or neuroscience would find significant interest in the course.",
                "Yes! This is such a dope and interesting class and professor Baskin-Sommers is absolutely amazing! The skills and knowledge that you gain in this class is eye-opening and so engaging!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The content was fascinating and the instructor clearly explained the subject. She was very attentive on piazza and would respond to your emails rapidly. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The course gets into the scientific reasoning behind many different criminal traits without going so deep that it is unapproachable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This is one of the most rewarding classes that I have taken at Yale so far, and it has truly changed my outlook on what a \"psychopath\" actually is, and has had a tremendous impact on my understanding of and my perspective of the criminal justice system's intersection with mental illness. Definitely take this course if you can! I will say that at times, the explanation of experiments gets very detailed and neuroscience-y, but I think Professor Baskin-Sommers does a very good job at explaining them as best as possible!",
                "Yes, 100% yes!! Prof Baskin-Sommers is the best professor Ive had at Yale so far, and I would say if you have the chance to take a class with her, do it! This class was so interesting and the workload was extremely manageable.",
                "Yes, it's a very manageable course work-wise, and the material is very interesting and the class is incredibly enjoyable.",
                "yes, a great (easier) psych course that would make a good 5th class that also has interesting content, there were only 2 exams and 3 short essays that are doable & easy to raise your grade throughout the semester",
                "Yes, the course topic is very interesting and Professor Baskin-Sommers as well as the rest of the teaching staff did an excellent job of keeping the class engaging and efficiently learning through clear yet thorough feedback.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a fourth or fifth course in a topic that they may have not really considered (i.e.- STEM students) or a student who is very passionate about the topics covered in this course (i.e.- students in YUPP).",
                "Yes!! Definitely. Professor Baskin-Sommers did a wonderful job keeping the course engaging in a virtual format. I thought the tests were extremely fair, and the essays were the right level of challenge to make you think about the material but were not too difficult.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! A great class, a great professor, great material, and an excellent introduction to topics in psychology.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was very interesting and the Prof is excellent.",
                "Absolutely. The material is very interesting and Professor Baskin-Sommers is great!",
                "Yes, it was a great course. The material was engaging, clear, and greatly broadened my scope of understanding. The assignment and instructions were very clear which was greatly appreciated.",
                "I definitely would! It's not too hard of class, but it's still super interesting and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in psychology at all. The essays are very straightforward, and each lecture covers something new, so you learn a bunch of stuff throughout the course.",
                "YES definetely.",
                "I really do recommend this course. I thought that the course material was very interesting. If you are someone interested in the human mind, you should take this class.",
                "Yes.",
                "YES, TAKE IT! So interesting, you learn a lot, Arielle is amazing, and it's pretty easy work. You get a lot out of the work you put in (since you can really put in minimal work to do well and also learn).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It gives a great overview of some environmental and psychological factors that can contribute to acts of crime, but it also gives a great foundation for how the criminal justice system works and how it does and does not incorporate methods that take into account the mental conditions of criminals.",
                "Absolutely. Dr Baskin-Sommers is inspiring and engaging, and the course content is unique and fascinating.",
                "Yes, I would. I think the material was fascinating and the professor did an amazing job of explaining each concept.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a gem. Professor Baskin-Sommers is a gem. I'm so lucky that I was able to take it my final year at Yale. Great fifth class if anyone needs it. Workload isn't obnoxious\/excessive. It's all very interesting and worth the time you put into learning it all.",
                "Yes. Very much so, this class was both interesting, and helpful",
                "Yes! Its a great course if you need a SO credit. Very well taught, light workload, and so much fun!",
                "Yes, very interesting and not too much of a workload with a great and nice professor.",
                "YEs!",
                "Yes absolutely! Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing.",
                "100% take this class. Fairly interesting material, Arielle is super passionate, and we have plenty of resource's",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was super interesting and I learned so much.",
                "YES. Good material, good learning.",
                "Yes! This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale despite the huge lecture size. Prof. Baskin-Sommers is so knowledgeable and interesting. The lectures and materials are very organized, the assignments have explicit guidelines and are graded reasonably, and the course's transition to virtual learning was really smooth.",
                "Yes, this course was amazing.",
                "Absolutely! This has been one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale! It offers a very comprehensive overview of concepts in criminal psychology, and it really allows students to understand that criminals are people as well, and that there are so many systemic fallacies that can lead to crime and unjust treatment of peoples within the criminal justice system. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an angel and she goes above and beyond to make sure that every student makes the most out of the class. Overall, the material is extremely interesting and Professor Baskin-Sommers makes this a learning experience that is worthwhile!",
                "Yes, I think that this is a very intriguing course relating to psychology, neuroscience, and the legal system in ways that many people do not naturally think about. In addition to learning psychological concepts and disorders as well as neural circuitry, these concepts were clearly applied through examples in movies and real life. Students learned about the US justice system and how it approaches the concepts presented in class from psychopathy to juvenile offenders and offers some solutions and suggestions for the ways in which this system can be improved.",
                "Absolutely. There's so much useful information on current systemic injustices that we just don't understand especially on a neurological level. This class was so informative.",
                "Totally! It is a great psychology course and the workload was super manageable. You get to really focus on learning and enjoying the content.",
                "Yes, even if they aren't a psychology major this course is very interesting and the workload isn't overwhelming so you can actually enjoy the course without getting overly stressed out",
                "Yes, it's a very interesting class and you learn a lot about why criminals commit crimes.",
                "100%:\r\n    - Love Prof. Baskin-Sommers: a great lecturer, informed researcher, prompt and thorough teacher, and a wonderful person to learn from\r\n    - Straightforward tests, quizzes, and essays, all of which are open-book and all of which can be answered thoroughly using the course's resources\r\n    - Well-crafted lectures, interesting material, never too overwhelming, insightful, intriguing, and extremely, extremely useful\r\n    - Absolutely loved my time in this class, and cannot recommend it enough, especially as a class you can enjoy instead of stressing over",
                "I have heard that when taught in-person this is a very engaging course. I don't think it was so much when taught remotely.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it gave me a newfound appreciation of the complexity of criminal justice issues and the human psyche. The course material subverted my expectations about antisocial behavior and psychopathy in interesting ways. The large enrollment in the course also provides a passionate and supportive community of peers.",
                "no",
                "Absolutely! Learning about the psychology of criminality and the criminal justice system in America is extremely relevant today. I wish every American could take this course as it definitely opened my mind to the inherent prejudices that harm our society. Professor Baskin-Sommers is incredibly attentive and thoughtful even with the large class size and online format. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
                "Yes I would, especially if they are interested in psychology.",
                "Yes definitely! It was such an informative course that helped me learn about different behaviors and the scientific reasoning behind them.",
                "Absolutely. The course content is very interesting is always going to relevant. It teaches new perspectives to think about issues we hear about and that solutions are possible.",
                "Yes! This is a great intro-level psychology course. The topics were relevant and the class was well-structured for learning.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely!! This class is super low effort but super high reward. This class is designed in every way to make sure you can learn the material well and it's fundamentally changed the way I think about criminal justice.",
                "This class is incredible no matter your major, but Professor Baskin-Sommers is the real reason that you must take it if you are a psych major. The current practices we have surrounding prisons are the life sentence for a huge chunk of Americans from the time they are born, in a way that benefits no one but harms so many. This class helps you examine our system and contemplate how it could easily be changed in a way that feels like a real mandate for future psychologists, activists, politicians, etc.",
                "yes, it is a very interesting class which allows it to be easy to remain engaged",
                "Yes I definitely would. This material was interesting and engaging. Very unique course content and an incredible, intelligent instructor.",
                "Yes! This course was very clear, Professor Baskin-Sommers was very friendly and enthusiastic, and the course content is interesting and accessible to those that don't necessarily have a background in psychology\/neuroscience!",

                "YES",
                "yes, teacher is amazing",
                "Yes. The material was super interesting, the Zoom was well organized, no question was left unanswered even for such a large lecture. The professor keeps the material engaging and is very knowledgeable. Real life examples are frequently presented to make sure the disorders don't seem foreign and experts are brought in to discuss what they do."
