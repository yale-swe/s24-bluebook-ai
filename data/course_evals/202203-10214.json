Everyone in the class was super engaged and invested in learning how to write good poetry, and it made for a good group to work with! Weaknesses: I wish I'd gotten a bit more feedback on some of my pieces than I did. There were at least three poems that I wrote during the semester that the professor did not look at at all. Also the list of poets from whose work we were supposed to select a poem  for our weekly anthologies felt strangely limited.",
