Dr. Moreno's lab manual handouts were very well written and always gave me a comprehensive understanding of what we'd be doing in lab that day as well as its real world implications and importance. The class was also fairly structured with having only 4 lab reports throughout the semester. While each lab report took upwards of 10 hours, we had about 2 weeks to do each one, so Dr. Moreno was understanding of our time. Dr. Moreno also chose experiments that were very engaging and relevant to a lot of current research going on so I felt like almost everything I did and learned in lab could be useful for any personal research I will go no to conduct outside of lab. \r\nWeakness: Lab days were usually very long with most days lasting at least 3 hours, so I feel like to be more efficient with time there could have been slightly less pre-lab lecture. However, they were useful.",
