   "comments": [
    "I don't particularly enjoy music theory in general, at least not as it is presented in traditional settings, as it is very constrained and targeted towards a very specific audience. I think music should be much more freeform; there are \"rules\" (more like suggestions) in place for a reason, to help improve the motion of the piece and cadences and whatnot, but I think music theory as it is taught now is very limited. Centuries have passed since the work of all these dead white male composers; I think it is time to move away from this and focus more on the music of the present and the future (since there is very little of that going on now, if at all).",
    "Strength: covered a variety of topics, very interesting to learn\r\nweakness: sometimes the topics for each class seemed to have no connection with one another",
    "concepts can be taught with more examples.",
    "Several concerns came up during class itself -- regarding the applicability\/legacy of western Classical music today. Certainly the course could be improved by including a more diverse set of composers to choose from! Also -- for things like composition, it is often difficult to learn in a group setting and I think that learning would be greatly aided by more one-on-one interaction\/feedback with the instruction. \r\n\r\nAlso feedback, I'd say that sometimes instructions or concepts would not be clear in class: only by asking after class \/ going home and doing the readings and then asking, did things start to make sense. That is, since we did a lot of hands-on activities rather than \"lectures\" per se, there were times when knowledge would slip through the cracks and I wouldn't realize I didn't know something until much later. Perhaps this could be improved by striking a balance between activities and just concept building. \r\n\r\nThat said, the collaborative classroom environment (at least in Bronwen's section) was absolutely fantastic -- in fact one of the best class environments I have been in at Yale!",
    "Very rule focused, entirely based around the restrictions of the classical style.",
    "I developed a strong foundation in music theory, but I would've liked the curriculum to go beyond classical concepts and dive into a wider range of subjects as well.",
    "Strengths: Bronwen is incredible! She is truly one of the most caring, devoted instructors I have ever had. She was very generous with helpful feedback, but she also held the class accountable for producing quality work. I felt like I was learning in an encouraging, quite wholesome space. We also had a great balance of group work, lecturing, and in-class assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the course could have had more structure. It would have been nice to focus more on theory, as sometimes I felt that the class emphasized composition without giving students sufficient theoretical basis. I also felt that there was also too much group work toward the middle of the semester, which was not always a fulfilling learning experience.",
    "strengths: an amazing instructor!!!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: this course was very popular this semester so the small class size I expected was bigger than I thought and I wish there had been more one-on-one time with the instructor",
    "Strength: by applying the theory you learn in the class through weekly assignments, you will really get to familiarise yourself with the theory.\r\nWeakness: if you expect a similar workload to MUSI110, you will be surprised by the increase in workload."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for the most part. It's helpful reviewing chord functions (tonic, dominant, subdominant), cadences, and general melodic suggestions, and Bronwen was a great proponent of highlighting what music theory should be more of.",
    "Yes! Take it with Bronwen if you can!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if you would like to study classical music theory at a higher level. As someone that once played lots of music but since stopped after coming to Yale, I definitely feel music more engaged with music after taking this class. It provides a solid starting point on which to build! Nb: the work is generally ok; just before the big compositions it can get a bit much, so plan ahead!",
    "Yes, 100%. Especially if Bronwen is teaching it!",
    "Yes! Great introduction to theory and composition. But I would be careful about which instructor you choose, and shop multiple sections. Some will make the class engaging (like Bronwen!); others will not.",
    "Absolutely",
    "yes but only if you are truly interested in learning more music theory and receiving weekly coursework that will make you do so",
    "If you love studying music, then definitely. However, if you're looking for an easy humanities credit, then you will be surprised by the workload. It definitely isn't a gut, but if you love music, then you will enjoy the elements that you learn throughout the semester."
