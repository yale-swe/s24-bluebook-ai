   "comments": [
    "Very simple and straightforward statistics class. Not particularly challenging, but decent intro stats, small classroom size and low pressure environment.",
    "there was a lot of wasted time. Section constituted learning one line of stata and class sometimes covered very basic concepts very slowly. It would have been valuable to do more advanced stata and to check in with the class on whether they were comfortable with certain material so they could be a bit more advanced if possible. The testing and psets also didnt seem to test practical knowledge. I would have liked the psets to be longer and more relevant: project-based so as to give us some more concretely transferable skills. Similarly, I would like the final to be some sort of statistics project instead of a multiple-choice exam which didnt really teach us anything. \r\nThat said, professor Smangs is quite sweet and very funny. class became quite an enjoyable time even though I wish I had learnt more.",
    "Strengths: If it was not for Professor Smangs this course would not have been engaging. The material is pretty tedious and uninteresting--it's basic stats. Smangs, however, was very personable, caring, funny, etc making this straight 3 hours of stats (the class has a 50 min section right before the 2 hour seminar) enjoyable and move a lot faster than what would assume.",
    "The course is very well facilitated to student learning and guides the students effectively throughout the learning process. I think the class would benefit from being a two day per week lecture as opposed to once per week.",
    "Strengths: It was extremely well structured in a way that effectively taught us the basics of quantitative sociology\r\nWeakness: Stata was not well integrated into the course (other than having to use it for Psets) in part because the TA was exclusively in charge of running section where we learned Stata, and assigning and grading the Psets. In lecture and exams, however, we never touched upon Stata",
    "Level of stats knowledge covered acceptable and not of very advanced level\r\n\r\nDiscussion section and lecture classes can be better organized in terms of the the relevance and connection of the two"

   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for an easy, low effort statistics class, this is a very easy one to take. It's not particularly engaging because of the subject matter, but it's fun and easy.",
    "If you want a basic stats overview that is a low workload, sure. But I would rather take a course like s&ds 220\/230.",
    "If you are looking for an ultra gut QR and don't mind the 3 hours of class every week, do it. If you are a socy major, you have to anyways.",
    "I would. It is relatively easy, and very educational.",
    "Highly, highly recommend the course to any students who need a QR, but aren't good at math. Professor Smngs explained everything in a way that was very accessible, and he was kind and humorous. Furthermore, our class dynamic was really nice, since it was only 8 or so students who were pretty outgoing, though this may change depending on the semester.",
    "It would be a happy QR course"
