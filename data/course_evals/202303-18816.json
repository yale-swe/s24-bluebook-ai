Category theory; and 3. applications to algebraic number theory\/geometry. The class was quite intense, so I guess I learned a bunch of stuff in algebra.",

                "Very properly designed. It could be better if the notes can be published before the class -- but it is OK!",
                "Professor Losev is the main strength of this class since his notes are incredible and he is always willing to help by answering questions on the ed or at office hours. I think this class is extremely well structured and should be taught very similarly in the future. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
                "Biweekly homeworks and a take-home final were such a nice change of pace from other math classes, and more courses in the department should adopt this policy. Of course, this did make all of these a significant time investment, which prospective students should be aware of. I learned a whole ton in this course and, unlike in some other math classes, actually felt very comfortable and fluent in the material by the end of the course. Also, the professor posts detailed, organized lecture notes each day, which is incredibly helpful. He also asks for feedback every other week, which is really nice. It's due to this, for example, that the very vague and unhelpful feedback I got on my homeworks near the beginning of the year changed to more detailed feedback later on.",
                "Strengths: you see a lot of algebra, both in class and on the problem sets. I think I definitely learned a lot by osmosis, even if most of the time the dots didn't always connect. There are a lot of cool stuff that comes up, for example Dedekind domains and algebraic geometry are pretty cool. Prof Losev holds you to a high standard so it's kind of a you-are-forced-to-learn-a-lot kind of deal (at least for me). Prof Losev also collects a lot of feedback and adjusts his teaching, which I appreciated. Weaknesses: this class is pretty challenging (at least with prof Losev). The problem sets are long and hard, and so was the take home final. These aren't necessarily weaknesses per se, but it did drain a lot of time and energy from me. The class is also really abstract, and can get somewhat dry at times, especially in sections without that much motivation.",
                "This course was extremely challenging but Professor Losev did a phenomenal job providing support to students. The psets often illucidated content from class, and overall this course was phenomenal.",
                "The course moves very quickly and the psets take quite a bit of time. It's an incredible class and you will learn a lot if you have the time to put into it. One of its biggest strengths is the incredible lecture notes. The workload is quite significant, though, and definitely don't discount the take-home final; it took quite a bit of time."

                "Yes. Very good course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in algebra and\/or is looking to attend graduate school for pure math. This course is very time consuming and the material can be very complicated so I wouldn't recommend this to a student unless they really enjoyed working with the algebraic structures taught in MATH 350. This difficulty also builds significant background for students who are interested in doing math research and doing well shows mathematical maturity so I would recommend this to students who want to get into pure math research.",
                "If they love algebra and have enough time in their schedule for an extremely intense class, absolutely. Even more absolutely if they're taking it with friends, because these problems are much better when done with others (as with any math class). And if they're like me and would rather sink many, many hours into homeworks over sitting for exams, then also yes. Seriously, the biweekly homeworks and take-home final were such a nice change of pace from other math courses (at least for me, someone who hates synchronous exams). But if they didn't already like algebra, the material would probably just frustrate them; and if they already have a difficult schedule, I would also recommend waiting until a lighter semester to take this course.",
                "This course is cross listed as an undergrad\/grad course, so I found it pretty challenging. You learn a lot of algebra, which can be helpful if you want to study more algebra in the future, but otherwise I'm not sure how exciting most of this course is. It's mostly a toolkit with promises of being relevant in the future for other things, which I is fine, I just never found it that exciting. That said, algebra is quite important overall (or so I've heard), so it is a decent pick of course. (NOTE: if you're an undergrad who wants the grad credit, ENROLL IN THE VERSION OF THIS COURSE WITH THE GRAD NUMBER, for this iteration it is Math 500, NOT the undergrad number, for this iteration it is math 380.)",
                "This course was extremely challenging. Psets took 30 hours every other week, the content itself is super hard to grapple with, imagine Math 350 but on steroids. The content is super interesting, and the work feels really rewarding once you complete it, but be prepared to do a ton of work.\r\n\r\nProfessor Losev is phenomenal though.",
                "Yes, if you have the time to spend on it. The material is very dense and the class can be quite time consuming, but the content itself is incredible."
