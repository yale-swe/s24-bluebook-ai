We focused on political topics such as global warming, protests, and monument controversies, which I feel gave me a great vocabulary base for political conversations. We worked on tricky grammar rules and consistently used them in speaking practice.",

                "I think this is a great course. I really enjoyed the topics we discussed and the way Irina Andreevna brings in a lot of diverse, current materials to discuss-- I felt really plugged into current Russian discourses. I thought it's a good mix of troubleshooting grammar and pushing our vocabulary forward. I also am really happy to say that the amount of work felt \"just right\" this semester -- still a good chunk, but much more manageable than last semester.",
                "The course did an amazing job keeping every motivated and engaged in this era of online learning! I was so impressed with how Liana motivated us all through her own passion and patience. The only weakness to this class was the amount of homework. I definitely felt a bit worn out by the end of the semester, but that was likely more due to COVID and Zoom than the amount of homework.",
                "I was in Liana Battsaligova's section:\r\n\r\nThis is a fantastic course, there are lots of opportunities to speak, the topics are diverse and interesting, and the syllabus was very flexible according to student needs.  The choice of films was also very interesting and I enjoyed the discussions following them and the opportunity to write an analytical essay in Russian.  We also had very clear and in depth materials for review and received in depth feedback for every homework assignment.  The workload was also well distributed and I never felt like I was overwhelmed with tasks to complete or the need to do a ton of studying for tests as having done the homework assignments helped with the preparation.\r\nIt's difficult to find weaknesses in the course.",
                "The course is very strong as it is. Perhaps the one thing I would have liked to see more of would be more literature. Otherwise, every single assignment was very engaging and helpful.",
                "The biggest strength is Irina! She is compassionate and extremely responsive to student needs. She tailors the course according to what we needed to work on based off the assignments and exams. A weakness is perhaps that it is difficult to practice in class since we are virtual but that is largely unavoidable. That being said Irina went to great lengths to make sure we all spoke during class with break out rooms, in class discussion and so on",
                "The format of the course is great and Irina takes student interests into consideration. She is very focused on speaking practice which I feel is a strength to any language class. We learn a lot of vocabulary and often return to previous units' vocab lists. The grammar practice was always useful and Irina was always willing to answer questions and clarify. I don't think this course had any weaknesses that couldn't be attributed to the difficulties of distance learning.",
                "Strengths: Irina Andreevna is a wonderful teacher, and our classes were always engaging. I appreciated that we had the chance to study a wide range of topics and mediums, including authentic news articles, videos, films, and songs. Weaknesses: Sometimes the homework assignments were on the long side. But overall the workload is manageable and the material is very interesting.",
                "It is a reading focused class and reading skills improve a lot. I would have liked more listening material on top of the readings."

I felt like I improved both my written and spoken Russian.  I would recommend this course to students that are looking to engage with a variety of Russian language materials, especially news articles.
