   "comments": [
    "I learned a bunch about renaissance music. It was also a great chance to improve on sight reading.",
    "You'll be exposed to really cool early music and learn some of its history! If you're a singer, Grant is also good with teaching good singing technique.",
    "Ability to sing polyphony.",
    "I learned about early music! Had a great time learning the Beggar's Opera and other pieces from the early era.",
    "This class develops your sight-reading\/singing skills and introduces you to a very fun (and often quirky) body of early music. Youll focus on one particular era or type of early music each semester, e.g. British broadsides and ballads or German music of the Protestant Reformation.",
    "I learned how to play the harpsicord and more about early music",
    "I learned the history of broadside ballads and got to perform them with an ensemble of talented musicians.",
    "I became a much better sight reader and learned a lot about broadsides and ballads.",
    "Really enjoyed learning about the musical side of history in this course. A very enjoyable performance class as well that teaches you early musical styles, techniques, and more.",
    "I enjoyed this class because it introduced to me beautiful early music. As a singer, this course has allowed me to improve my singing by learning how to blend with other people's voices and understand more musical theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved if auditions were slightly more restrictive. Not dramatically so, but I think with a slightly smaller crew it would be easier to focus and learn more complex arrangements. I think a few more individual checkups towards the beginning to force more memorization of the music outside of class would also help get the ball rolling so that the class could move through the learning phase into the perfecting phase more quickly.",
    "I miss choral singing from high school and this definitely brought back a lot of the fun parts of that!",
    "Strengths: I looked forward to going to class since it was fun and the music was really cool. \r\nWeaknesses: Not many.",
    "This is honestly such a fantastic class. The composition of the class is fun and relaxed, the songs are chosen wonderfully, and Grant clearly knows his stuff and his passion for the music is inviting.",
    "Great course, sweet and musically intelligent professor.",
    "The course was too large this semester. I think it would be a better course if the total number of students were half those in the class in Spring 2018",
    "we can have more rehearsals before the concert",
    "This class was a blast!",
    "Strengths are the teacher.  Grant is amazing and inspiring, and class was always so much fun!"

    "Absolutely you wind up putting on some really high quality concerts in a style of music that is outside of most performer's experience.",
    "Yes definitely take it",
    "Yes, if you enjoy singing in larger ensembles.",
    "If you sing or play an instrument, I definitely recommend this course if you want a chill 5th or 6th credit. It's a fun class that's a good break from all your other stressful classes.",
    "Great class and Professor Grant Herreid is awesome. Take it if you have background in music",
    "I already have been recommending this class! It's such a relaxing break from the stresses of life to enjoy music in a large group and prepare a fun consortium while also learning musical history in the process.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, if you like classical music or choral singing this is the class for you!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It is a really fun way to be able to play\/sing some interesting music that you might have never heard of, as well as learn more about early music and music history. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",
    "I highly recommend this course! It is a light addition to your semester workload, and Grant Herreid makes class a total riot, but he is also a complete expert in early music and such a treasure trove of information. The concerts at the end of the semester are fun, too.",
    "yes definitely",
    "Yes!",
    "What a wonderful class! Would recommend to anyone who likes learning musical history and performing in a mid size ensemble.",
    "I love Collegium! Grant is an extremely talented and engaged professor, and I've learned a lot from him over the past two years.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a fun music course!",
    "I would recommend this course. It's low stress and a great credit for anyone interested in music and history.",
