                "Strength: Small size of group, felt as close to an actual in person discussion as possible. Made it possible to \"get-to-know\" other students and learn their backgrounds, personal interests and histories, points of view.\r\nStrength: Professor, who knew many of the students from other classes\/engagements, often encouraged students to bring their work and backgrounds from outside of class into class. This made discussions more honest and interesting.\r\nWeakness: This class would have been much more fun in person, but alas, the times. \r\nStrength: Cold calling to get the conversation started worked well, held us accountable to reading but then Professor found good balance of letting discussion flow organically \r\nStrength: diversity of readings and formats",
                "Strengths: discussion format, was especially nice that we talked about the readings from a broader perspective and made connections, rather than just summarizing the readings. Weaknesses: sometimes I felt like we went off on tangents, and I would have appreciated more background to the readings for some weeks (i.e. for the first week, Mordechai talked a little bit about the history, which framed the readings better)."

                "Yes! Mordechai is a fantastic professor, and is so willing to incorporate students' feedback (i.e. 5 minute break during our 2 hour Zoom seminar). Also, the discussion format really allows for you to get the most out of the readings, and I loved listening to my classmates' opinions. Reading amount varies by week, but is reasonable, and especially if you get a head start on it and actually do the readings, you'll be in a good place for the oral final."
