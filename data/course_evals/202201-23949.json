It was a particularly humbling experience to take a class that was neither at the focus of my study at Yale (I study literature and music) nor the periphery of those disciplines. I had to learn the content of the class as well as how to take the class, a very important skill particularly because it is always important to learn how to go about doing something entirely new. I could not go on autopilot in this class like I am able to for some weeks in other course because I  truly did not know what to expect. All this to say, I had an amazing time in this class and it will be one of the college courses I never forget. I can say this with complete confidence, and this is because of the instructor, Professor Harrington!",

                "this class is so fun. the workload was not inhibiting at all. lectures were fun, even if it was a phylogenetic tree evolution day. Weaknesses would be that the grades are not posted on canvas. The study sessions before exams are so helpful and I always go to listen to others' questions and write the information and study more about what was brought up later. Always ask \"is there anything you are surprised we haven't asked more about?\" it's a lifesaver",
                "It's a really fun course and I learned a lot. Going through the phylogeny step by step sometimes felt repetitive.",
                "No weaknesses that I can think of. Fantastic course!",
                "I think it covers a lot of material in a very entertaining way. No negatives",
                "Strengths: This course was the highlight of my week. Professor Harrington is simply fantastic. He's incredibly enthusiastic, relatable, doesn't take himself too seriously, and made every lecture a joy to attend. The material that was discussed was consistently interesting and presented really well (combining a scientific foundation of the material at hand with the professor's own thoughts and experiences). Videos of the different families/species being discussed made the material much easier to understand (and even more enjoyable to learn).  Admittedly, I came into the class with a pre-existing interest in fish, but imagine that the course would be just as easy to enjoy if you came into it with no prior knowledge and limited initial interest. Exams were fair, review sessions were helpful, and assignments were limited to those that would truly allow us to better understand the material (instead of assigning us work for the sake of assigning of us work). Professor Harrington was dedicated to students' success, making the environment of the class a very productive and enjoyable one to be a part of. Weaknesses: none",
                "Really enjoyed the structure of the course and how it progressed.",
                "It was a great class for anyone interested in the topic, and Professor Richard Harrington was excellent. The class is well taught and really focuses on the big picture of fish ecology while also giving enough detail to those who are curious to know more.",
                "I thought the class environment was great and the professor was very excited by the topic.",
                "Prof. Harrington is awesome, the material is fascinating, and not a lot of work",
                "I really liked this course. My only suggestion for the future would be to offer an optional fishing field trip to the lecture class - I really wanted to go fishing with Rich.",
                "Unclear of what grade I had going into final exam and no test exams to use as preparation",
                "Strengths: relatively easy science credit (but you do have to carefully take notes and know everything on the slides), Weaknesses: the last exam was much harder and specific than the others, it would have been useful to know how all the species/groups/orders fit together and what specific characteristics we had to know and which ones not",
                "Good lectures",
                "I loved this class. I was always excited to show up to lecture, and Professor Harrington was a very interesting and personable lecturer. I think that providing more options for engagement, such as a biweekly discussion post or something similar, would help to make students more engaged and have them study the material week-by-week as opposed to cramming before each exam. I also think that a more conceptual focus would be more helpful for future classes, as we spent a lot of time learning small facts about individual shark species that I feel were not as useful as some of the big concepts we learned, like adaptive radiation. However, overall I learned a lot, and I felt very comfortable asking questions.",
                "I don't think I would change it much. Lecture was really engaging and interesting with great integration of photos/videos (which are always good). Organization of the material was good. The one thing that I think could be improved just a bit would be making it a bit more clear what is needed to know for each group of fish when going through the taxonomy.",
                "This class rocked. I can't really nitpick it.",
                "Strengths: Rich Harrington as a professor is the greatest strength. He is super knowledgeable (and interested) in the subject, and is an incredibly interesting instructor. I would recommend taking this lecture course with the accompanying optional lab  being able to interact with the Peabody collections really makes a difference.",
                "Strengths, you learn a lot about fish.",
                "A lot of memorization, but that can't really be avoided--either a strength or a weakness, depending on who you are",
                "A strength of this course is that we manage to cover a huge amount of diversity over just one semester, so I left the class feeling like I have a great baseline understanding of fish as a group, and now have the necessary background to learn more about the specific groups I'm most interested in.",
                "Hes a great lecturer and such a dope guy",
                "By far the biggest strengths of the class are Professor Harrington and the recorded lectures. It was immensely helpful to be able to go back before tests and watch the lectures.",
                "The course organization was a bit weak - we talked about fish by their groups, but we didn't always follow the phylogeny (so fish came up out of order sometimes). When studying, I usually had to rearrange material to memorize it more effectively. That being said, the lectures were very interesting! The grading was also incredibly fair - all the exams had enough built-in extra credit that missing a couple of questions still left you with a solid A (which was helpful, since the exams were mostly short answer/multiple choice fish facts). All in all, if you have some basic exposure to E&EB and/or you're willing to study a few hours for each exam, you won't have trouble succeeding in the class.",
                "This course had an excellent lecture format, but I would've liked a bit more engagement with the professor.",
                "The format of this course is very strong. I would say that I sought out Professor Harrington in order to do well, but perhaps for a less outgoing non-EEB major in the future, a safety-net to remind those students that they can succeed in this class would be a good thing. Science can be very intimidating and Professor Harrington is super encouraging I would hope that if another Professor teaches that this remain an essential quality of the class.",
                "Strengths- Prof. Harrington!  So friendly and caring and all around just a wonderful professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Lectures can at times feel like way too much information at once so it can be hard to figure out what to actually study for on exams.  Luckily, this can be fixed by going to review sessions and identifying major themes.",
                "I found the lectures very enjoyable, I especially like the inclusion of videos",
                "- lectures were very interesting and informative\r\n- content was very broad and I learned about many different fish species\r\n- Providing a better idea of what will be on the tests would be great"

                "Take this class!!!!! I had so much fun in it!! I can't believe how many fish are out there and how different they can be! Professor Harrington made learning fun, even on Zoom for the first two weeks. He listened to the students, admitted when he didn't know something, put fun videos in the presentation, and would get on Zoom calls last minute to answer questions before exams. SUCH A GOOD CLASS W/ A GOOD PROFESSOR TOO!",
                "yes! I'm a freshman English major and this class is accessible and not intimidating to me at all. it fits wonderfully into my schedule where I had three other English courses. Learning about fish was so fun and interesting and if there was another semester where I was just able to continue learning like this? I'd 100% do that. Prof Harrington was wonderful and had great humor and anecdotes. I had a great time and I ended up just calling the course \"Fish Class\". I loved telling my friends and suitemates about the new fish I learned about and the cool functions of specialized body parts.",
                "Ichthyology is super fun. Professor Harrington is amazing, and the class the most interesting that I've taken at Yale",

                "100%! I love this course and Rich wants you to learn, enjoy and succeed.",
                "If you are interested in ecology, I would say yes. I took it for the sole reason of learning about fish and that goal was definitely accomplished.",
                "If you have some sort of interest in fish, absolutely. Professor Harrington is fantastic and the lectures were informative and enjoyable.",
                "Would highly recommend, even as a non-STEM major. It's a very fun class and approachable, even for beginners.",
                "Yes. Professor Harrington is an excellent professor and organismal level biology is always exciting!",
                "Yes, I would! Even if fish is not the first topic of learning to come to mind.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Harrington is GOATed and when else will you get to systematically learn about fish diversity?",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend fish class to another student if they have any interest in learning more about fish.",
                "YES!! I'm definitely biased as an E&EB major, but I have multiple friends outside the major who took this class and loved it as much as I did. The lectures didn't assume any prior knowledge, moved at a quick but good pace, and were kept engaging with a wealth of funny videos & stories from Rich. The (non-cumulative!) tests were spaced out perfectly so that you don't have to study too much material at once. This type of class is inherently fairly heavy on the memorization requirements, but thinking of the topics as narratives helped me learn them quickly. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes",
                "For people who don't have an interest in fish..might be best not to take this class. It is entirely focused on fish. With regard to gut-status: definitely harder to do well than the well-known gut classes, but definitely possible. Prof. Harrington is a great lecturer, and for people who are curious about fish, I'm sure this class would be super fun.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in fish or in general biology. The lectures are very engaging and the arc of the course material works very well. I would not recommend this class to someone looking for a science creditsuccess in this class relies on engaging with and taking interest in the lecture material",
                "Yes if you need a science credit go for it - but you need to learn a bunch of random fish facts and sometimes the slides are not super clear... Sometimes you get presented with a list of like 10-12 facts or characteristics of a given fish species or class and it'll be super specific (e.g. pectoral fin absent, premaxilla is flexible, etc.) and then you'll have to remember these for multiple different species/classes/orders, so it's easy to panic and I was never sure what we actually needed to know since it was overwhelming. I don't think anyone will walk out of this class with anything below an A- but it's still some work and you can't just chill the entire time. Definitely better than for instance biology, the world & us though and probably a safer good grade.",
                "Yes if interested in marine biology",
                "Yes! I loved this class and I looked forward to it every week. It is such a fun science class, but it's not just some gut that you'll never think about again. All of the concepts we learned are very important for E&EB students, but also for anyone interested in science. Professor Harrington is a wonderful professor and I would love to take a class with him again.",
                "If you have any interest in oceans/river/etc or animals, definitely. Great professor, great course.",
                "Absolutely. Take it even if you're only marginally interested in fish.",
                "This is an awesome class that encourages learning for the sake of learning. It encourages curiosity and fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in fishes or marine biology. It is also a great pathway to evolutionary biology, and you will definitely end the semester feeling like you learned a lot!",
                "Yes, but only if youre actually interested in fish.",
                "Yes! Fish is great for an easy science credit",
                "Yes absolutely. I recommend that every single yale student takes this class its amazing.",
                "Yes! It's a really fun class and you come away with really good baseline knowledge of fishes, one of the most diverse groups of vertebrates!!",
                "Absolutely, make sure you pay attention to the lectures as a lot of the information is on the exam",
                "You MUST take this course. Professor Harrington is amazing and you will learn so much about fish in a non-stressful environment. This class was a welcome break from the monotony of other classes.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course if you have the slightest interest in animal biology/ecology/evolution/behavior, fish or otherwise. It was fascinating material, without a huge time/intellectual commitment.",
                "Yes, as it is an interesting Science credit and I found it to be very engaging.",
                "Yes! it was so interesting and not something you learn about every day. For not EEB majors, makes for a lot of fun conversation points",
                "I definitely recommend this course to anyone, even if they don't think they would be interested in fish! The lectures are super interesting and every day we learned about all the cool species and behaviors around us. I now think fish are underappreciated by most people, including me prior to taking this course, and the course was a lot of fun. There is a bit of memorization involved with the taxonomic groups of fish, but it's manageable and shouldn't be a reason not to take this course.",
                "Absolutely. However I would suggest that they take the class only if they will come to every lecture engaged. That is certainly necessary for success in the course.",
                "Yes- especially if you love fish.  As a non-science major, be warned, this is not a total gut by any means.  I think if i didn't really like fish, I likely would have dropped it due to the difficulty of learning how E&EB exams work and things of that nature.
