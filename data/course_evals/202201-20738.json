                "In this second semester of ASL at Yale, learning continued to expand vocabulary but shifted to also focus on Deaf Culture and topics within that field, like the concept of DeafGain and DeafSpace, to name a couple. Finger-spelling speed was increased significantly from ASL I, and my ability to comprehend faster finger-spelling and faster signing improved by the end of the semester.",
                "I improved my ASL technical skills in both vocabulary and grammar. I also learned a lot about Deaf culture and Deaf issues.",

                "Strengths: hybrid schedule with class M-Th, F off. Highly active ASL community at Yale with abundant opportunities to practice signing and learning more about the Deaf community outside of class. Classes and lessons build directly towards the goal of being able to communicate better with ASL, so students can go out into the \"real world\" of events and signing tables, etc., and use what they have learned in class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Though many students might see this as a positive, I'd say the very lax attendance policy made it a little hard to have continuity across classes - there were very few days this semester where everyone in our class of size 6 was present, and the norm was for one or two students to be out. I was certainly guilty of skipping my fair share of days when work got tough and I had to study for exams, etc., and for that it was helpful, but in general maybe a slightly stronger expectation for students to come to class would help with continuity and less time getting people caught up \/ easier to expect what activities will work each day.",
                "This course is very well laid out to ensure adequate time to learn all the content while also moving through an immense amount of it. It also balances cultural knowledge with technical knowledge beautifully. The only weakness is that feedback on assignments comes very late.",
                "The strengths of the course are its highly engaging course structure, emphasis on service projects, and low-pressure classroom environment."

                "Totally - I strongly recommend learning ASL here at Yale. I don't know of other opportunities to learn this language as easily or in as fun a way, other than while you're in college. I'm taking ASL as my language requirement, but I would just as soon take it for fun even without the requirement. The department is vibrant and friendly, the activities and community on campus are awesome, and the language is really interesting and satisfying to learn. If you have any indication that you might want to try learning ASL, take it and run with it!",
                "Yes! This is an amazing course and overall experience that will make you feel more connected to a very important community right here at home.",
                "Yes, I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning ASL and experiencing the vibrancy of Yale's ASL community. This class has been my favorite class this semester because it has challenged me and helped me improve my ASL skills significantly."
