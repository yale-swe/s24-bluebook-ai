            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great Professor and TAs. Exams are relatively straightforward, and Professor Lazzaro makes it pretty clear what she wants you to study. The classes are highly interactive, and Professor Lazzaro finds a bunch of cool ways to keep the class invested in the lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: None, but you should probably have some level of interest in Psychology because the work will be tedious if you have no interest in it.",
                "Given that it is a lecture-style class, it is hard to be super interactive or engaging. The lectures were super engaging and well done. The interactive elements using Menti helped keep students engaged. I think that the essays were a little disconnected from the class. It was interesting to do our own research about subjects we were interested in, but limiting these essays to maybe 3 total and having each be a little bit more thoughtful and in-depth as opposed to 5 shorter ones would be better so that we can engage more with the material of each essay. Also, having some kind of further interaction between the essays and the class would help increase their relevancy (I know the class doesn't have sections, but maybe some kind of smaller group meetings 3 times per semester? Might be difficult logistically though).",
                "Prof. Lazzaro brought energy and enthusiasm to each lecture, which was a plus. Communication from her and the teaching fellows over the course of the semester was timely and efficient. The course is what it is  a broad survey of a lot of different topics. It's not a course where you deep dives into any topics, but I think it does a good job of taking care of what it is supposed to do. Personally, my engagement level with the course was low (I ended up taking the class Credit D), and once you get into that territory it can get worse; but that's a reflection on me and my engagement level, not on the course itself.",
                "Lectures were very intruiging and engaging. Loved the content, and Lazzaro is a great professor. Other than writing assignments, the only homework is readings that help to reinforce the content we learn in class, which I appreciated. Tests were strong and a good evaluation of the content.  Also the review sessions were extremely helpful and helped me a lot. However, some of the lectures, especially the ones focused on scientific content, were dense and hard to get through. Additionally, while the writing assignments aren't that difficult, there is quite a few of them so be prepared.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lazzaro is an incredible lecturer. She is passionate and excited about the material. The work was a lot, but assessing research and reading reviews are skills that I think I will take with me.\r\nWeaknesses: Tests are graded pretty harshly on open-ended questions, and there is just a lot of information that is hard to memorize. The essays were great and I gained a lot from them, but they took longer than they were worth point-wise. I recommend making them worth more and the tests less.",
                "Strengths included the organization of the lectures with the detailed but not too overwhelmingly detailed lecture slides. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses included that there was not enough feedback on the assignments. For instance many of the comments were about references but when I would make the correction for future assignments, I would get the same comment and same grade.  Another weakness was the structure of the exam. For instance, there is so much to cover and it was difficult to prepare for the exam covering multiple lectures on various concepts. Another weakness was the lack of feedback from the exam since they were not passed back.",
                "I believe it was well structured in regards to the consistency of work with paper assignments every few weeks, and exams in between. I however did not enjoy the research participation element as I thought it was disorganised and didn't contribute to my own education.",
                "It's a survey course, so I feel that most of its weaknesses came from that. The strengths came from that fact that, at least on my TA's side, the TAs and professor were very eager to see you succeed and did not leave you in the dark about material that would be on the midterms.",
                "Very interesting topics.",
                "Strengths: literally none\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nTF's and Professors that engage very little in students, don't care to answer questions and when they do, they answer with very little care for the students  redirecting them to the slides/recording of lectures \r\n\r\nHead TF, Katie, will openly make students feel stupid. I had a friend attend a review session, be brave enough to ask a question, just for her to be shut down completely.\r\n\r\nLittle understanding of placement in class and how to do better   seems like Prof. and TF make it hard on purpose to review mistakes on test, make reviewing exams either completely impossible or very inconvenient and confusing. \r\n\r\nMislead students  claim the test will be one thing, then put obscure/unimportant aspects of every slide of each lecture on test. \r\n\r\nThe class is more about memorization than actual understanding, very unrewarding in terms of actually learning anything of substance.",
                "The biggest strength is the lectures. Though they were fast paced, they were engaging and connected ideas well, and there were high quality recordings to be able to go back if something was missed.\r\n\r\nI found the communication between TAs and students to be poor, especially clarity regarding grading on exams and feedback on papers. There was significant work on research papers with little to show for it in final grades for the course (5 papers for 27% of the grade), and I felt the content on the exam was not properly conveyed. Though they emphasized broad ideas, the questions were usually very specific to certain slides and ideas.",
                "Lectures were fun but a bit disorganized. would be helpful to see more links between topics we talked about.",
                "Strengths: this is a crash course in psychology. You will learn a ton in a short amount of time. Weaknesses: it goes really fast. Each lecture the topic is completely different, and you have to follow the course really quickly. The exams are also 100% memorization, which could be good or bad for you depending on the type of learner you are.",
                "This class is excellent---Stephanie Lazzaro is easily the most engaging lecturer I've ever heard and I loved coming to class. It was like listening to an interesting TED Talk twice a week.",
                "strength: it has a really engaging, question-driven structure so that everything we learn in a class fits into a narrative which makes it into a whole chunk that's easier to be remembered and digested; the professor was more than helpful and understanding and explains the concepts with such clarity. there are also many interesting real-life examples given and an effort to incorporate humor into the class, which kept me engaged\r\n\r\nweakness: nothing particularly about the class, but because I have previously studied psychology a little bit on my own and some of the content becomes a little repetitive. i wonder whether there could be a different version of the intro-level class for students who have had some exposure to psychology",
                "I enjoyed this course very much. I think it could have covered slightly less material in favor of going a little bit deeper into certain topics.",
                "I loved the professor and her lectures were engaging and interesting! A weakness was not getting feedback on my midterms",
                "Strengths: the topics are independent per lecture, so there's no worry about getting behind. The sections are divided into three exams, which makes studying much easier. The biggest strength lies within the instructor, which I'll go over in more detail below. \r\nWeaknesses: NONE.",
                "The class is very fun and doesnt have a large workload. However, the test questions are particularly difficult and are graded harshly.",
                "The lectures are engaging but the tests are very application based. The concepts are gone over seemingly surface levels compared to the exams. Guest lecturers are not always engaging.",
                "The course is very engaging, incorporating interesting facts and class participation.",
                "The greatest weakness of this course was that your grading was dependent wholly on which TF you were assigned. Instead, assignments should be graded by grading teams to prevent this overwhelming impact due to your TF and to make grading more consistent for all students. Also, the writing assignments were not reflective of the material being learned in lecture. They felt completely separate and did not reinforce or support what was taught. The course also lacked continuity. Each lecture focused on a new question that was answered with results from psychological studies. This lack of continuity left me without a foundation in psychology to support or motivate further study.",
                "loved exam format, loved the content of lectures, ultimately I learned a lot of skills.",
                "less homework pls",
                "I think not getting our midterms back and being able to review them was a weakness. I also we could also get more feedback for the grading for our papers.",
                "the lectures were very interesting and i thoroughly enjoyed the format. each lecture was presented as a question instead of a topic in the textbook. the grading policy was anxiety-inducing, though, and the TFs were harsh with grading assignments. this took away from my enjoyment of the class.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures and how it the course was not structured from a book. However, since a portion of our grade is based on writing assignments/research proposals, I would have liked to learn more about this writing process in class and receive feedback on these papers.",
                "Course is overall strong - interesting, engaging lectures and assignments",
                "I think that the lectures were very well organized and coherent. However, I do not have much engagement with the instructor or teaching fellow. That being said, I appreciated that lecture recordings were always posted.",
                "The course is very well taught, with the lectures being very engaging and interesting. I always leave the lecture with an interesting piece of information learned that I could tell my friends about.",
                "A strength is that the lectures are recorded so if you are confused about a concept, you can rewatch the explanation on the video. A weakness is that there is more writing than I expected when initially enrolling in the course so be sure to check the syllabus.",
                "The strengths are that the material is very interesting and engaging, and Professor Lazzaro's Menti quizzes introduced an aspect of individual interaction that large lecture classes usually are not able to provide. Lectures were always very relaxed and enjoyable. Additionally, posting the lecture recordings on Canvas greatly helped those who could not make certain lectures.",
                "I think the course had a good structure and balance. An improvement could be giving students back their exams to let them review their mistakes and learn from them.",
                "I loved the questions used to pose and frame course content. I really enjoyed the interactive components with guest lecturers and visitors from the club of magicians.",
                "I think that this course was very interesting, but also the essay topics felt disconnected from class topics and most of my time on them was spent looking for sources because only sources that were completely directly related to the thesis were accepted and I could not use a somewhat related source and then explain the connection without getting points off.",
                "a great overview of psych. I loved all the lectures instructed by Stephanie. Katie's guest lecture was also good. but the other guest lectures were not so good.",
                "Loved the lectures. The tests functioned a bit like vocab quizzes, but Im not sure if there was a way to avoid that. Maybe more couldve been done to focus on case studies.",
                "The strength of this course is by far the professor. The material is fast, interesting, and mostly relevant to daily life so even if a person isn't planning on pursuing this field, they can personally use most of the information learned in the future. \r\n\r\nIt's a large lecture course, which is not ideal for me but it's an intro course so it makes sense. As far as weaknesses, I do think the course could be improved by lessening the requirements for study participation and including an alternative like study sessions with the TAs, etc. The five study participation credits are very time-consuming because most of them are broken down into 30 min intervals. So that's potentially 10 studies you have to find, adjust your schedule for, and then travel to/from. There is an alternative option (writing an extra paper). There are already five papers. There also didn't seem to be enough studies for people to complete the requirement. \r\n\r\nThe \"study sessions\" by the TF/TAs before the exams were usually held late and unlike any I've done before. They are recorded. I'm not convinced they were more helpful than just reviewing on my own.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Dr. Lazzaro was happy, insightful, and a joy to learn from\r\n- The essay topics were interesting and fun to write\r\n- Review sessions were helpful for exams\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I feel like the three sections of the course lack structure\r\n- The content on exams did not feel cohesive, so studying was a challenge",
                "Strengths: Variety of topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading System",
                "I thought this class was really fun to take. There was generally little homework outside of class, and I looked forward to going to lecture. The exams were not exceedingly difficult, so the workload was manageable. One suggestion for improvement in the course would be more active participation between the TFs and students, since there didn't seem to be a highly personal connection in the end. Another strength was having Ed Discussion, a useful tool in clearing confusion on main concepts. A main weakness for the course is that grading was harsh for the writing assignments. Sometimes, it was very unclear what I had lost points on, because there was a single sentence explanation for docking 5-6% off of an assignment, which made maintaining a high performance in the class difficult.",
                "I liked that there was the inclusion of guest lectures and several case study videos",
                "I really did not like this course. I learned very little new information besides new vocabulary to topics that are relatively intuitive. The assignments feel random and unrelated to the content.",
                "There are no weaknesses that i noticed",
                "Strengths: The lectures were well paced and had many case studies supporting the information. It was easier to understand concepts with these examples to support them. The exams were fair given the provided material that was expected on the tests. The ED discussion thread was also very helpful for asking questions and seeing other people's questions. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not cumulative and it felt very random when we jumped to new topics. Some information would overlap but it was not logically connected. The exams rely entirely on memorization of information rather than analysis and understanding.",
                "The exams require a lot of memorization, so quizlet or anki is your best friend for the course.  Going to lectures is 50% of the studying though. One thing I was really annoyed about was that even though they uploaded the exams on gradescope, you have to schedule a time with your TA to look at the exam results instead of viewing it yourself.  Not only that, they only let you look at the results for 10 minutes, which is not enough time to go over the entire exam. For the essays, they heavily emphasize APA citations, and will mark you off for each individual citation mistake that you do. On the rubric, it is not emphasized that much, so I was surprised to see that type of focus instead of the contents of the paper.  Sometimes, the TAs don't even tell you what points they mark you off for.  One time I got a few points off on an essay and the only comment was \"great job!\".",
                "Strengths include the lectures , weaknesses include test prep.",
                "The lectures are a definite strength! I enjoyed coming to class each time. \r\nThe review sessions were difficult to attend because they kept going overtime.",
                "The course material was pretty interesting and Professor Lazzaro teaches it well. There's a lot of content and she goes through the lectures really quickly but separate lectures tie together well which makes it easier to learn.",
                "The strengths are that the lectures are engaging, professor Lazzaro is an excellent lecturer and brings a different surprise to each lecture. The assignments are manageable and the exams are also manageable and the questions cover everything we've learned. The weaknesses are that I feel disconnected from the class at times. I didn't know many of my classmates, which discouraged me from going to the lectures at times. The instructions of the papers felt overwhelming at times and I didn't see how the assignment was related to the class. The research participation points was also hard to fulfill because SONA didn't always have time slots open.",
                "Professor Lazzaro was very engaging and the lectures were interactive.",
                "I think this course was well taught and very engaging.",
                "Very organized and interesting lectures that made going to class enjoyable; clear feedback for essays not always given",
                "No weaknesses. Great course. Professor Lazzaro is a fantastic lecturer. Very engaging classes. Recordings made reviewing material straightforward.",
                "Weaknesses: everything was on slideshow. I wish there were some textbook or notes you could follow instead of the slideshow. I really think my teacher assistant was biased of my work and graded me unfairly though. \r\n\r\nStrengths: great teacher, LOVED THE TEACHING ASSISTANTS OFFICE HOURS --> super helpful and no one really went so I always got my questions answered, which is very rare compared to any other course because office hours are usually super busy.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lazzaro loves engagement! Even though the class is very big, everyone is engaged with participation through an app called Menti (polls that aid in teaching and reinforcing the ideas that we're learning). The papers were linear and aided in helping us to design our own research proposal at the end of the course. The topics were always fun and it was not a textbook class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is very big, which means you don't get much interaction with your TF or with Prof. Lazzaro unless you go to office hours (there are no sections). We also don't see our tests unless we sign up for appointments to view them. There's a lot of information to be memorized, but I found using flashcards (and Prof. Lazzaro's study guides) pretty helpful.",
                "Strengths: This class was EXTREMELY well organized. The readings weren't bad at all and we were meant to do them after a lecture. Stephanie was engaging and the class was genuinely fun. Weaknesses: I felt like the TAs were purposefully trying to deflate the average grade for the first and second examsthe grading was extremely meticulous and nitpicky, to the point where if the exact wording of a definition was not used, points would be taken off. This created a culture where many tried simply to memorize the specific wording of definitions instead of learning the concepts and being able to rephrase accurately them in their own words.",
                "Strengths: Very detailed slides and loads of TF's to aid in assisting\r\nWeaknesses: Not much individual student engagement",
                "interesting",
                "Strengths: engaging material and lectures \r\nWeakness/improvement: More times for peer tutoring",
                "Well taught, lots of support, good feedback, exams are manageable\r\nEd discussion was a great platform",
                "interesting lectures",
                "Lectures were extremely engaging and never boring",
                "Strengths: very manageable workload, lectures were engaging and interesting, very clear what we needed to know\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a bit fast paced so it was hard to take proper notes",
                "Great course overall, lectures were great",
                "The material is presented in a clear and interesting way. 5 small essays did feel excessive, however.",
                "A big strength of the course is that the lectures are engaging, fun, and interactive. Information is presented in a way that is easily process-able and only includes the important things that we need to know. Each lecture focuses on a specific question that will be answered through our exploration of psychological concepts during that lecture  a format I havent seen before but is extremely effective in my opinion. \r\n\r\nDue dates are clear and you get concise feedback on your paperwork.",
                "Strengths: liked how all the lectures connected to bigger, real-world question; interactive aspects and quizzes; interesting papers that gave us a lot of freedom as to the topic\r\nWeaknesses: not super engaging at times",
                "The exams are unnecessarily specific for an introductory class.",
                "The concepts overall were very interesting. I appreciate that we we encouraged to participate in psychology studies as well as the firsthand experience was very beneficial. However, the course went really fast and was often hard to follow in lecture. This course is also very much based in memorization which does not allow for the strongest long term memory or understanding.",
                "This course gave a very good overview to the field of psychology, covering a wide range of topics. In addition, this course generally covered different topics each class, making it easy to compartmentalize the information. One weakness of the course was that the studies presented in class were presented very surface-level, making it at times feel like the information was merely memorized and not fully understood. One way to improve this would be to cover the studies more in-depth.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is a great lecturer, very engaging, smart, and kind. She chose interesting topics and encouraged us to think for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had way too much homework. One week, we had both an essay and a test due. I felt very frustrated by the sheer amount of readings/essays/tests/psych study participation that we needed to complete. Also, the class lectures did not prepare us at all to write the study reviews that were assigned. Also, the TFs cared way too much about APA formatting when grading our papers, especially given that they never demonstrated for us what to do (only sent us articles with instructions that were not always clear)."

            "comments": [
                "Sure, I can't say Psychology peaks my interest but there were definitely some interesting topics covered this semester, and you can tell that professor Lazzaro puts a lot of effort into her lectures. The workload is very manageable, and the exams are fair. If you really like Psychology, then I'm sure this class is for you because it covers a wide range of topics. I think there's a lot of progress to made in Psychology, and because it's a relatively new science, it's interesting to see how little is known about certain human behaviors and the struggles that come with surveying them.",
                "Yes! I think it's a great social science credit, the lectures are fairly engaging, and most students find the material interesting. The non-cumulative exams make studying much more manageable as well. The 5 essays felt fairly disconnected from the class, but they weren't a big part of my experience. Overall, as long as you go to lectures and put a little bit of studying in for the exams, you will learn a lot and do well in the class; I would recommend it!",
                "Either, you have to take this class, you want to take it because you're interested, or you want a low-workload credit. This class works for all three options. I ended up not being very engaged with the class, and I took it Credit D. I spent minimal time on the five assignments and did not study much at all for the exams. So, if you want to go that route, this class is certainly effective for it. However, if you are really engaged with the course, I think it can still be a good survey course to take, and a good introduction to the subject if someone wants to see if they're interested in psychology. So, yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but I think it's better if you go into the class with at least a somewhat good idea of what you want to get out of it.",
                "I would recommend this class because the content is very interesting and not too hard to comprehend. However, any student who takes this class in the future should be prepared for a lot of writing and having to manage outside research credits.",
                "Yes! Great teacher, really interesting course. Gives new outlook toward life and human interactions. Allows you to better understand yourself.",
                "Only if it is required for your major. There are more interesting social science credit classes you can take. This class is also more work than you'd think.",
                "Yes, it serves its purpose as an introductory psychology course.",
                "If you need to take it for an easy social science, I would say it's good. As a prereq for psych it's a little bit of a pain, but not horrible to go through!",
                "Yes. Very interesting. No textbook that is followed, therefore the professor discusses whatever she thinks is interesting, which is also interesting for student.",
                "Absolutely not, class is incredibly difficult as is, but on top of that, little support is given to compensate.",
                "Simply because of the content. I would warn them that the grading and exams are misleading, and that the papers are a lot of work for not a lot of feedback or payoff.",
                "Yes, if looking for a lecture course that is quite broad and exposes you to several aspects and areas of psychology without doing a super deep dive into any of them. Assignments are also manageable and exams reflect material taught in lecture well.",
                "This is a pre-req for pre-med and will give you a leg up for MCAT studying, so I definitely recommend it for that. Otherwise, this is not a gut for non-STEM or psychology majors. It's a lot of studying and memorizing for the exams.",
                "Yes! Into psych was an awesome class. I recommend for anyone, not just those interested in psychology. I think anyone would have a lot to gain from this class.",
                "I would recommend this class. The assignments seem tedious at times, but the content is interesting and the exams are fair.",
                "yes i would, for the abovementioned strengths. i believe it's a very fun and accessible way to get introduced to the field of psychology",
                "I would recommend this course. I don't plan on majoring in psych, but it was a fun class and I feel like I learned a lot of topics that are applicable to my day to day life.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend. Super interesting and great stuff to know for life",
                "Definitely! It's the best psychology class ever. You can apply the stuff you learned to your real-world interactions. Very cool stuff.",
                "Yes, its fascinating and the workload isnt too heavy.",
                "If you have an interest.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. It was engaging with minimal work. It was not a hard class if you paid attention.",
                "No. I would caution somebody looking for a solid introduction to the field of psychology against this course, as well as somebody with just a casual interest. I did not learn any psychology, it seemed more focused on memorizing results of studies. Also, the papers do not reflect or support lecture material. The expectations were often unclear, and the topics seemed unrelated to what we were studying.",
                "Absolutely. Stephanie was an excellent professor and the class gave such a good overview of psychological concepts",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and the workload is not heavy. Very easy to pass and feasible to get an A if you put in some effort.",
                "yes the topics in this class were interesting and relevant to our daily lives",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning about psychology on a broad scale.",
                "Yes! Very fun and interesting. More chill than other classes. I always looked forward to going to this class.",
                "Yes: it is a captivating introduction to the cognitive processing and thought sequences of humans.",
                "I think that previously PSYC 110 had a reputation of being a gut. It was definitely not a gutty course when I took it this past semester with Professor Lazzaro. However, already having some experience with psychology courses, I was generally more prepared than some of my friends. in general, I would not recommend this course if you are looking for a gutty class with low time commitment.",
                "Yes, I found this course to be very interesting and I leave the class a better student and individual than when I first entered.",
                "Yes, as all the topics covered are very relevant to everyday life, and not to mention interesting as well. It is a good class to take for furthering your own knowledge, even if your major is entirely unrelated.",
                "Yes, it was a good course to give insight into the psychology major.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course! It was very fun to learn Psychology from such a great professor!",
                "I would only recommend this class for people who have a major related to psychology, I felt like my time would have been better spent on a different class.",
                "hmm yes if you are looking for a gut psych course. the written assignments though are bit challenging/ quite a lot of work.",
                "Yes, its a good social science credit, though a bit tedious at times.",
                "The tests in this course were challenging. There are five research papers, a few of which aren't worth enough to impact the overall grade. If you don't grasp the research concepts or aren't interested in the data and minutiae of the research, you might not do too well. You'll have to spend a lot more time memorizing concepts for the exams. If I took this class over again, I'd skip the first couple of papers worth very little, drop 2.5 credits of the research studies requirement, do one of the alternate papers, and spend the time I save to study more for exams.",
                "Though this class is NOT A \"GUT\" COURSE, I would recommend taking it. I think about some of the principles we learned in class every day.",
                "Not really. The amount of stuff you learn is very surface level and doesn't justify the poor grading scale.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants a survey course into psychology. This class is a fun social science credit and not too difficult to fit into an otherwise busy schedule.",
                "No. Don't take it unless you have to. All of my friends who were taking this class not for a requirement ended up dropping it.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in surface-level psychology.",
                "Yes most definitely",

                "Yes, this course is really interesting and a good introduction to a lot of different topics in psychology. The essays due every other week are pretty short and the tests are totally manageable if you review the material.",
                "Yes -- if you've never taken a psychology course. I personally have taken AP Psychology but didn't meet the 5 requirement, but after taking this class, I felt as if it was a repeat of a bunch of information I've already previously learned. I was disappointed that this was a prereq to some of the majors I was considering.",
                "Yes! Loved this class!",
                "I would, because I felt that this was a very good example of what an intro class should be. The topics were well explained, the class was interesting, and the material was broad and encompassed a lot of the different fields within psychology.",
                "Yes! Awesome intro to psychology with interesting lectures and topics",
                "Yes. This was a phenomenal course. I gained valuable insight. Professor Lazzaro made the course engaging, interesting, and exciting.",
                "Yes, however I think your grade can change a lot based on how your teacher assistant grades, which is lowkey unfair.",
                "yes",
                "For sure! I think this was an awesome class for those even mildly interested in psychology and would definitely spark greater interest.",
                "Yes, even if they are not a psychology major. Though it's not a gut, the lessons you're taught in this class are lessons that most people should learn in their lives.",
                "Yes it's incredibly interesting and I learned alot",
                "yes",
                "Yes, super interesting!",
                "Definitely, great introductory course, lots of cool topics, everyone will find something for them",
                "yes interesting introduction to different types of psychology",
                "Yes, I recommend to those who are looking for a broad introduction to the field.",
                "yes",
                "If they want a basic understanding of psychology then yes. It gives you basic frameworks and concepts for higher level learning.",
                "It is a good course for social science credit.  A large portion of your grade is determined by how well you do on the 3 exams.  They are non cumulative but definitely a lot of material.",
                "Yes, this is a great, fun intro course.",
                "I would absoltely recommend this course to another student  regardless if he/she is a STEM or humanities person. I feel that psychology constantly impacts our daily lives  consciously or unconsciously  and helps us to understand ourselves better, regardless of our differences in aspirations.",
                "Yes. As a non-psych major, found the class super interesting and also gave me some insight as to why people do the things they do and make the choices they make sometimes.",
                "I would recommend this course as a strong foundational building block for psychology.",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking to get a broad introduction to the field of psychology. This course covers many topics, so students learn a lot. In addition, the topics are presented as case studies, making learning them very interesting.",
                "Only if you're willing to put in the work. The workload felt like way too much. We had to submit many essays that felt relatively purposeless and excessive and which we weren't prepared to write. However, the topics of the class were relevant and interesting, and the class gave me a good overview of different areas and topics in psychology."
