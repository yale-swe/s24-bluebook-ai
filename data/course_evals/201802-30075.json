    "We started off with classical theories on dreams which constituted the start point of western philosophy and leaped into Freud, Jung who are the major pillars for the topic. From their witty arguments we started to develop certain senses about the content, material and characters of dream and unconscious.",
    "I learned psychological thinking about dreams, and this class is an inspiration for me that opens up a new field of subject which sounds worth studying.",
    "Discussions and brain storming skills.\r\nDeep analyzing skills for even the most simple things.\r\nHuge amount of knowledge about psychology and philosophy.",
    "The historical views and analysis on Dream. Modern and advanced thinkings on dreams. The way we should consider\/treat our dreams",
    "How to understand dreams \r\nHow to deal of a lot of reading \r\nHow to write a paper"

   "comments": [
    "The strengths would be the highly interacting and provoking environment offered by the professor and classmates, multiple media learning method and detailed instructions provided by TA and Professor.\r\n\r\nYet due to the limited time length, readings are a little bit overwhelming and not fully explained or discussed in class.",
    "This class is more like a seminar which is very good. But the workload is a bit high because sometimes we couldnt finish what we are supposed to finish in the class.",
    "Plenty of sources to read from and discuss.\r\nCovers vast range of topics that are related to dreams.",
    "The reading assignments are all squished together and can be a huge workload. It is understandable as this is a summer course. The class is awesome in general.",
    "Strength: Content is very interesting and is approached from both a psychological perspective and a philosophical perspective. Small class, very good for letting students discuss and share their thoughts equally.",
    "Everyone is engaged in this class, sharing their own opinions and communicating"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is one of the life-changing courses since it brought up what we may left out in our conscious.\r\nBy understanding dream we could understand our life better, to instruct our waking life better.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. Dreams should be interesting to everyone and the professor is really a good instructor. We can learn a lot about dreams as well as movies and poetry and literature works.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting course, especially for non-humanities majors.\r\nIt covers much more than what expects at first.",
    "Yes. I have learned the ways to make peace with my dreams and even to be creative with them. I feel more in control of myself",
    "Yes \r\nIt really changes the way you think"
