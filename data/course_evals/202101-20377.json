                "I think the only way it could be improved would have been if we could have gone to the museums and galleries in person and actually seen the artwork at places like the YUAG, which of course was impossible because of covid. Professor Gaifman made sure the course was the best it could have possibly been without the in-person element.",
                "The professor, Millette Gaifman, is amazing. I would absolutely recommend students interested in Greek art take any class she teaches, she is fantastic. Additionally, the organization of this course with both grad students and undergraduates was incredibly helpful for getting contact with upper level scholars and connecting to potential mentors. Beyond the people, the course itself is fantastic. The work and readings are very manageable while also being super engaging. Definitely central to anyone interested in Dionysus, but also he's the best so really everyone should be interested."

Learning about Dionysus and the intricacies of what he represents was made fun through an interactive discussion, creation of our own art in groups, presentations of individual group discussions, and a great space to talk about the absurdities of the god of paradox.",
