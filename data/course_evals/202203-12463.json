                "We get to learn about interesting topics in India like precolonial Indian history and important issues like climate change while learning Hindi. One weakness is that the class is not structured very well.",
                "the discussions were incredibly thoughtful and rewarding - all thanks to the amazing readings in class! the format is just wonderful.\r\n\r\nas for improvements, one slight suggestion might be to include more creative writing prompts.",
                "Swapnaji is really sweet and attentive. She wants students to learn and is always willing to answer questions. She's also always happy to go over concepts during office hours. There's also a diverse range of assignments, from presentations and group projects to essays, which makes the work more interesting. I also really appreciated that she takes time to correct the spelling\/grammar of our assignments so we can learn. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness is that Swapnaji doesn't really push us to speak our best during class and class time doesn't feel very interactive. A huge portion of classes were spent reading the articles we had for homework out loud. This is good reading practice but it's really easy to tune this out when you're not the one reading and doesn't really help improve speaking. I wish we spent more time actively having conversations and that Swapnaji asked more questions of people who are weaker so that they can get practice."

                "a hundred percent if youre interested in advancing your hindi language skills.",
                "It depends. It's really easy to go through the motions and end up not improving much. If a student is coming from L4 and didn't have much Hindi background before Yale (like me), you need to take your own initiative to become more fluent. My vocabulary is better but Hindi grammar never fully clicked with me before and still, it's frustrating how many simple mistakes I make considering I'm technically \"L5.\" \r\n\r\nIf you're already comfortable with the essence of Hindi grammar\/pronunciation and are looking for a (relatively relaxed) class to grow your vocabulary and practice, I think this course would be great."
