                "The strengths of this course are its specificity, interaction, group work, and material. Weaknesses are really just the stressful workload.",
                "The course strongly encouraged independent learning, which was difficult to adapt to but a necessary skill that made me a more productive student. However, I think the course would improve by a little less independent learning by incorporating more lectures from Dean Chang - especially on the technical information discussed in papers. Some students already had background in these areas but for those who didn't, it was difficult to keep up and hard to advocate for oneself.",
                "Strengths: Massive volume of totally new knowledge learned over the semester, I definitely feel that I have a leg up over other biology majors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The format of the course this semester was a little odd (students presenting to each other every week, Dean Chang lectured only a few times) and office hours became irregular at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Very engaged class, class discussions were some of the best I had. Very close tight knitted group! Some of my best friends are from this class!\r\n\r\nCons: A lot of work! Especially for half a credit. Easily the most work out of all my classes this semester and I took some pretty hard STEM classes."
