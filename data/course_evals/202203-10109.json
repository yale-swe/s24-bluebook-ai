Genuinely I am shocked by how much I learned in this class, but it did require a lot of effort to learn this knowledge. The course is divided into two main sections -- stars and then planets. You learn about the super low-level information about chemistry at an atomic level all the way up to high-level things about our solar system and galaxy, with a lot of astrophysics in the middle. Professor Faison places a heavy emphasis on how we know what we know about space. I do hope I manage to retain a lot of this information now that I've put in the effort to learn it all -- it's very cool!",

Especially for the first half of the semester, I did not get much out of the class period, where we would break off into groups to do problems but no one had any idea what was going on, or how to approach the problem. The TAs often also hadn't been prepped beforehand, so didn't know what the professor was looking for in responses and couldn't always offer sufficient help. During the second half it got a little better, and I feel like we more reviewed what was introduced in the lecture videos through discussions during class which was helpful. Overall I do think I learned a lot  I now know a ton about space  stars, planets, and the math behind it. I had some moments of a lot of fun, and have totally nerded out telling all my friends the things I have learned about what is beyond our sky!"

                "I feel like the flipped classroom model limits the engagement of the students by placing a large burden on those to learn lecture material on their own.",

                "This class allows for discussions within class about the material, which is great. I would have liked more class time spent actually teaching us the concepts rather than expecting us to understand everything through practice problems and recorded lectures.",
                "The flipped classroom is not the best facilitator of learning and makes students understand the content almost entirely on their own. The class could definitely benefit from more review of subjects in class with the professor face to face. Also, more interactive elements of the class like trips to the observatory would make the material much more interesting.",
                "It's a good course, and I like the flipped format. I thought the homeworks and exam problems (at least the midterm, haven't taken final yet) were reasonable. One thing is some problem sets had content that pertained to the next week after's material and those videos hadn't been released. There was two weeks problems sets that had questions that asked about things not present in reading or videos for that week and then when the next weeks material was released it was in that.",
                "This course could be improved by making a bigger connection between lecture, the textbook and class. It feels like the questions we are asked came out of nowhere. It would be nice if in lecture he went through how to solve problems instead of just giving them to us in class and glossing over the steps. Some students know how to do it, so they give a brief and vague response to how'd you do that problem. The rest of the class is left to guess at missing steps or concepts they weren't sure about.",
                "Weakness: Lectures are remote. Flipped class. Difficult to spend time to digest lectures before actual class period. \r\nStrength: broad overview of several topics",
                "Strengths: \r\nExplained many complicated topics well, in an inspiring, fun way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe video and in class lecture content did not always match up or help to accomplish the weekly problem sets.\r\n\r\nThere is very little preparation for the midterm and final; it feels like you are on your own, with so much content to understand and very little understanding of what to expect on the exam, especially with only four questions. There could be a very general study guide given to help ease student's minds. \r\n\r\nAs it is marketed towards non-STEM students, I feel the grading was harsh.",
                "Strengths: Interesting course content, awesome TAs; weaknesses: Everyone I took class with this semester will tell you it's twice as time consuming with the flipped classroom, plus to get a good score on the PSets discussion sections are essential. I would recommend that the course be restructure into lecture and a once a week discussion section, but I don't think there are enough TAs for that as of now. Also, over half my PSets are still ungraded.",
                "I think the grading philosophy is all wrong. It seems like on problem sets an exams, the professor/graders try to find every little way to take points from students. I understand writing a wrong answer and getting points taken off, but, for example on exams, there's a rubric item called \"not relevant,\" where points will be taken off for anything the graders determine falls under this vague phrase. This is pretty much everything that isn't strictly within the bounds of the solution the professor has written for the problem. I think this is very odd for a class that tries to promote the explanation over the answer. What if students have alternate explanations, or different ways of thinking about the problem? Just seems silly to me to mark something down as \"not relevant.\" Am I wasting your time by making you read things I learned in your class in response to an exam question you wrote? My apologies! Furthermore, the professor doesn't respond to Gradescope regrade requests. His word is law I guess.",
                "Strength: interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: online lectures are fine but in person class is kind of useless. You just show up and dont really talk about the stuff you watched in lectures. There would be points in the semester where I was wondering if I could be in the library doing other work rather than wasting 75 minutes for nothing.",
                "A flipped classroom is a really hard format to learn with. It is hard to ask questions, in lecture or in actual class. I think the content isn't that difficult in and of itself, but it is REALLY difficult to learn in this format.",
                "Strengths of the course include very interesting subjects and fascinating in-class discussions. The \"flipped-classroom\" model is also very helpful. The workload was reasonable and well-spaced. The optional discussion sections were incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness of the course is that at times, it didn't always feel that the lectures lined up with the given problems in class, and not enough support is built in for understanding math/physics/equations; for the non-STEM majors, a file or document with clear explanations of units/application may have proven very helpful, thereby not wasting class time but providing clarification. Additionally, the midterm exam (first out of two exams in the course) was administered after the mid term date, so it was a bit difficult gauging how the course was going if considering withdrawing and not wanting a \"W\".",
                "The course is structured in such a way that you end up putting a ton of hours in. You are required to watch about 3 hours of lecture videos before coming to class, and attending the live lectures is also required as he takes attendance. On top of that, there are problem sets every week which take about 4-5 hours depending on how quickly you work, and then two exams that require quite a bit of preparation. In addition, reading the textbook to some degree is pretty much required to understand the course material as he passes by complicated information super quickly in the lectures. (I say that as someone who has quite literally read the textbook for a Yale class exactly one other time). Office hours (the optional sections) were really helpful for completing the problem sets since the TFs are all really nice! If you are willing to put in a lot of work for the class though, you will learn a ton of super cool information, and it's clear that Professor Faison cares about students really understanding the material.",
                "I personally did not enjoy the flipped class style. I felt it was hard to engage with the online lectures, and wished I could have learned the information in person. I felt the problem solving in class was a bit rushed and not always helpful. It was nice to have time to meet many people in the class though. Often the comments I received on my pset were just to \"explain,\" which I thought I had already done thoroughly.",
                "Strengths: one pset a week and flipped classroom \r\nWeaknesses: the actual class time did not feel super productive",
                "One of the weaknesses with this course, in my opinion, is communication between the professor and the students. I tried several times to speak with my professor via email about time sensitive issues but his responses were oftentimes late, and sometimes I never received a response. I also feel that the set-up of the class (a flipped classroom) isnt ideal for the material that is covered. There were many lectures that repeated what was discussed in the video that was assigned before class. I think it would be better if the videos covered the math concepts and the in-person lectures covered the rest of the topics.",
                "I think the flipped classroom format is a major strength. Regarding weaknesses, I think it feels like there is a major lack of support or care from the instructor. For example, I often ask questions when professor Faison comes to the table, but often he will not answer my question, and simply ask me other questions. I understand the purpose of such questioning as it can help students understand topics better by working through it themselves with some help. However, often I would be unable to answer these subsequent questions for the same reason I asked the first: I did not understand some of the lecture material and was hoping to get it explained again. The professor also has a habit of just walking away from tables laughing right after someone has asked a question which is very discouraging. Grading was also very slow, which made it difficult to know if I had understood a concept. Additionally, the TAs had to make review materials for us because the professor refused to, which also made me feel that the professor was not hoping for students to succeed.",
                "interesting material presented in a very uninteresting way. professor does not set the class up as conducive to learning; he does not share lecture slides, does not share in-class questions, is often purposefully vague, and feedback on psets and midterms was lacking and late.",
                "This course, unfortunately, has more weaknesses than strengths. While the topic in and of itself is an interesting and engaging one, Michael Faison has structured the class so that it is incredibly unpleasant. First, this is a flipped classroom, which in theory is maybe a good idea but in practice you have to engage with the class for twice as much time as expected and the learning experience is ultimately worse than if it was just a normal classroom. There is no required section for this class, which also seems like a plus at first, but at the end of the day just leaves students scrambling. Next, the structure of class time itself is totally unproductive. The first 20-25 minutes of the class are spent doing \"star of the day\" and running through other things  Professor Faison does not calm students about the class or answer questions about the syllabus during this sort of free time, and when he does it is not only a rarity, but it is done in vague and condescending terms. This class does not need to be an hour and 15 minutes and perhaps in a 50 minute block, it would be made more productive and better students' learning.",
                "I was not a huge fan of the flipped classroom. I understand the importance of doing the problems in class but I think sometimes too much time was given for discussion so maybe doing lectures in class but leaving a shorter amount of time for discussion questions could be helpful?",
                "Strengths: TA sections were very insightful; problem sets and exams were mostly fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the flipped classroomhaving to watch the prerecorded lectures beforehand was very time-consuming and not conducive to learning, it also meant that actual class sessions were not that useful. I think a more traditional in-person lecture would be better suited for students' abilities to take notes/absorb the information. Additionally, it would have been better if we had practice problems with solutions for exam preparation.",
                "I felt as though the class was aimed towards humanities and non-STEM majors, but the level of content was higher than I anticipated, and the workload somewhat greater. I think the class was good, but should maybe be framed as an Intro to Astronomy class rather than a class that humanities majors would find easy without a strong prior background in math and science. I'm also not sure that the flipped learning model was good for such a large class of over 100 students. It was difficult to ask questions or get clarification on problems that we did in class, and watching the lectures outside of class made it hard to synthesize the material that we worked with.",
                "The flipped classroom was a good component in that it helped me to engage more with the class. However, I felt that the professor wasnt great at leading the discussion classes and didnt tend to be good at helping people understand things in this context.",
                "There are a lot of weaknesses. First, the flipped classroom I did not always prefer. I liked being able to go back and re-watch lecture videos - that was a huge plus. But the videos were from like two years ago, filmed in the pandemic, and it seemed like the teacher didn't always know what were in them/what we had learned before going to class. Actual class sometimes also felt like a waste, since most people were lost/hadn't watched the lecture videos, so there was no one to walk me through what was going on. A lot of the PSETS, especially for the first half of the semester, were also super challenging and would take me like 10+ hours to do at least, which felt like too much time for a class not intended for science majors! A lot of times I would feel totally lost in the class, even after reading the text book and watching the lecture carefully and taking notes. Some stuff just didn't click, and the professor could be kind of rude when answering questions. With the planets unit I do think it got a lot better though, and I ended up having a lot of fun in class. I liked when we really broke down what was in the lecture during class. I wish the TAs were better prepped by the professor, there was less white board break out groups (or if there were, the professor actually explained how to solve the problem after we attempted to and a student tried to explain), the professor was more kind when answering questions (or answer them at all, it felt like a lot of questions didn't get answers), and we could do more interactive activities. I really liked when we went to the observatory, and some of the discussions that we had."

Michael creates a very awkward and unappealing classroom environment. Hes also rude and was disrespectful, laughing at people when they give an incorrect answer or are unsure. Im not one to give bad teacher reviews but Michael is the rudest and most unprofessional teachers Ive ever had, he should not be teaching at the university. I will be filing a formal complaint.",

                "I would recommend this class to another non STEM major, but it is not entirely a gut science. It is a very elementary understanding of Planets and Stars and students do not need high math skills or knowledge in the field coming into the class. The material can be understood, but the flipped classroom makes it a little difficult to foster a very strong understanding. Definitely read the textbook pages, or at least skim the, because their explanations are much clearer than what is discussed in class. Overall, it was not horrible, but be careful going into it.",

                "I would only recommend this class if you're willing to put upwards of 10-11 hours of work into the class (including live lectures) each week. It is super interesting and cool to learn about astronomy if you are interested in it. However, do not take this class if you intend for it to be a gut. If you do take the class, definitely read or at least skim the textbook chapters before trying to watch the recorded lectures. Additionally, go to office hours to get help with your p-sets, and go through the study guide that the TFs send out before exams to make sure you understand all of the content.",
                "Probably not. I expected the content to be more interesting given the subject matter. However, it was fairly mundane. I don't think the course structure was particularly engaging, though if you have friends with you it can be a fun class!",

                "I would not recommend this course. I think astronomy is a really cool subject, but it was taught in a confusing, at times disorganized way, and the professor was not very accommodating or always sensitive! Even if he didn't mean to, I felt put down by him sometimes, or like he thought people's questions were dumb. You will leave the class learning a lot, and it was overall worth it for me, but also caused me a lot of pain."
