                "I learned about ecstasy from the ancient greeks to modern poetry. It's a fascinating topic.",
                "Ecstasy is a class that fundamentally tackles what's irrational about humans, something rarely addressed in most liberal arts courses in my experience. It has given me the language to identify that which is against structure, that which takes us outside of ourselves, and that which connects us to the supernatural. The course addresses logic that has remained largely unchallenged, so being able to address it is to my benefit.",
                "I learned how to critically examine a variety of texts and consider their implications on a personal, societal, and spiritual level. Some particularly potent insights include better understanding how ecstasy is a part of various cultures, religions, and traditions across the world, examining the potential consequences of ecstasy, considering the possible liberative power of ecstasy, etc.",
                "I practiced theorizing on seemingly non-academic concepts in academic ways. I'm particularly referring to our segment on MDMA and LSD as one derivation of ecstasy and reading this theory in light of our ecstatic philosophy, drama, and religious memoirs. We're synthesizing texts across genres, times, geographic regions, traditions, and religions, and that's no small feat, but a highly rewarding one.",
                "This class allowed me to think critically of the biblical, biological and literary concept of ecstasy both in negative and positive light.",
                "I learned how to better think about and write on the topic of ecstasy, as well as what mediums and experiences can and cannot be described as ecstatic.",
                "I learned about the phenomenon of life we call ecstasy, including the academic/scholarly history of the experience as well as a multitude of examples. I also learned how ecstasy can manifest itself in a variety of ways, one of the most common being poetry.",
                "I definitely improved on my close reading, writing, and general seminar skills. But I also think I developed a deep understanding of what \"ecstasy\" means and the wide range of literature surrounding it, from Eliade to Native American peyote usage to Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy. Our focus on ecstasy allowed us to focus on other interesting topics, such as the sublime, the purpose of literature and language, music, and the dichotomy between structure and anti-structure."

            "comments": [
                "This seminar had the most engaged students of any seminar I've ever taken. It could be improved by prompter feedback from the essays and the second essay not being pushed back so late.",
                "Strengths - Readings, interest of discussions, rigor of readings, meaningful seminar time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some readings felt more relevant than others, fundamental expansions on the idea of ecstasy were more or less completed by week 8 or so.",
                "Strengths are that it gave students a lot of freedom and a lot of agency in co-creating the course. Specifically, discussions during class were often guided by what students found most personally fascinating. This led to an atmosphere that was deeply collaborative and in which everyone felt safe to express themselves. Oftentimes, students would open up about very personal moments which were profound and demonstrate how skilled the instructor is at making students feel safe and heard.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Manageable amount of reading, and highly eclectic and diverse texts\r\n- Excellent introductions to the texts to give us some helpful context\r\n- Love the Canvas posts and reading other students' responses\r\n- Productive class discussions and most everyone who had a comment was able to speak\r\n- Students were highly engaged and commented on the course readings alongside introducing personal life experience in exciting ways\r\n\r\nNot so much weaknesses, but considerations:\r\n- Feedback on papers was incredibly slow, BUT it was well worth the wait (though it sometimes feels irrelevant to return to an essay two months later when you're already working on the next)\r\n- Sometimes the class discussions felt a little meandering, like they could be more focused to align closer to the readings (especially when we have so much ground to cover and are tasked to make connections across so many varied themes)",
                "The class discussions were invigorating and respectful. The professor is very passionate about what he teaches.",
                "This course was very strong in terms of content, all of the readings are very interesting and the paper topics felt worth writing. Professor Soles is the biggest strength of the class, this seminar is a passion project of his and it shows. The help and feedback I received on papers was also exceptional.",
                "I really enjoyed the design of the course and it being a longer course that met once a week. The 2 hour time slot allowed the discussions to go in depth and provided ample time for a nice blend of student-led discussion on the content and professor-led lecturing on some of the context. I also think that the syllabus readings were fantastic, as there was a lot to enjoy and read and talk about. I only wish that the direction of the course had been made more clear at the beginning just so I could have more concrete expectations of what I would be studying."

                "I would absolutely recommend the course. It is interesting, entertaining, and worthwhile to one's academic development. It is a course that tackles the question of what it means to be human as much as the best.",
                "I definitely would. It is a class that doesnt feel burdensome and feels incredibly expansive and eye-opening.",
                "YES I'd absolutely recommend this course. The feeling of ecstasy is universal, one that seems fundamentally human, so I think everyone would benefit from this class. Of course, you need to approach it with the right mindset and treat all these somewhat delicate, sensitive topics with reverence and respect, but in this process, new language will emerge to describe what had previously eluded you and that, right there, is awesome.",
                "Yes, I would! Professor Soles cares a lot about the well-being and writing improvement of his students.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student, it has changed the way I think about a lot of this, much like other of Professor Sole's classes have.",
                "Yes; but only if they are interested in the Humanities. I feel like students who might try to take this course for just the Humanities credit might end up feeling overwhelmed with the syllabus.",
                "I definitely would. Professor Soles is an amazing professor, and you will improve your writing and also come out with a new appreciation for literature and poetry and the theory around it."
