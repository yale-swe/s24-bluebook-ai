I learned so much about the human body, homeostasis, organ systems, and a fair amount of cell bio as well.

I really learned to \"put it all together\", which was great.",

The relationships among many systems are covered. Students develop the skills to be given a set of symptoms that afflict a patient and determine what the underlying medical problem is.",

It allowed me to apply the concepts I had learned in classes in cell biology and biochemistry on a systems level to understand the working of organs and organ systems. It promoted relational thinking, and showed me how tightly regulated everything in the human body is.",

When given a scenario regarding some pathology in the body, I can think methodically about the origin of the issue. I have the fundamental building blocks to do further work in cellular-molecular biology. One theme of the course that stuck with me is that all of physiology can be distilled into signaling pathways and feedback loops. That is the key insight needed to solve physiological problems.",

In particular, we learned about many of the body's anatomical systems and I gained an understanding of how many vital functions in our body occur. I now understand how our body works in much greater detail and I can apply this knowledge to my daily life.",

I learned how to think differently -- from a much more clinical perspective that allowed me to realize how each system, although different, worked with the others to maintain a state of homeostasis in the body."

                "The tests covered so much material and we had to study a lot but when it came to the midterms, not all topics were asked about.",
                "This course was great, but the only weakness was that many of the office hours I wanted to go to were during the school day, which meant if I had a question on Tuesday that I wanted to ask in person, I'd have to wait until Friday. Nonetheless, Piazza was a great resource whenever that occurred.",
                "Strengths: Intellectually, the content was very interesting and satisfying. There are also many opportunities for you to improve your grade, such as the mere attendance at section can boost quiz scores up to a 100 as long as you get half of the questions right. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly feel like this class would be impossible in a live, in person setting. Since we were remote, all of our exams were open note, and there is just so much material that I don't know how I would have gotten through the class with hand-written, closed note exams.",
                "I loved this class so much. I learned a lot from it. My one suggestion for improvement would be more clinical vingettes \/ real life examples of diseases \/ disorders. Those were so so fun and helped me better understand the topics at hand.",
                "Strengths are the organization and clarity of the lectures; it is clear what content we have to know, and organized in a format that definitely facilitates student learning. Weakness was that there wasn't a ton of opportunity for grades outside of the few midterms and finals. I would have preferred to have weekly homework assignments outside of the quizzes, which just ask us to regurgitate facts. I wish that the undergrads had an option like the grad students where we could read papers and attend a discussion section to talk about them and receive a grade for that, rather than relying solely on midterms\/quizzes.",
                "Teaching was good. The pace of the course and structure was great.",
                "The entire teaching team was SO responsive and focused on making this course a great one and they definitely succeeded. The course depends a lot on how much effort you put in and engaged with the material given that it could get pretty complex. I would say a great help would be narrowing down the lecture learning objectives a but more or at making more detailed power points. Despite the recorded lectures, I would have liked to pay more attention to the actual class than copying down all the information before they professor moved on the next slide. Despite that, it was a great class.",
                "A strength of the course was that Prof. Saltzman and Prof. Campbell were excellent professors and taught in a clear and engaging manner. I enjoyed being able to watch lectures live but also having them recorded so I could go back to them and rewatch sections that I didn't understand. A weakness is that I wish the tests had more short response questions and less multiple choice so that more partial credit could be given and also that the exams were long and difficult to finish in 50 minutes.",
                "Really cool class, I think the lectures tend to fly through information sometimes (which makes sense as there is a ton of content to get through) but maybe take a bit more time to develop the more important concepts and systems - especially would have benefitted from taking the cardiac system\/loops a bit slower.",
                "Strengths include fantastic instructors, intellectually challenging material, and great TAs\/peer tutors. The only barrier for me was that lecture was early in the morning, but that's just me. I don't recognize any other weaknesses regarding the way the material was taught, but incoming students must have a mastery of introductory biology.",
                "Strengths: You will learn an immense amount in this course. I learned more from this course than from any other course I have taken at Yale. This course gives students the tools to understand most common medical conditions that they may experience in their life, and how to go about ameliorating those conditions. The content is incredibly interesting and relevant. The tests are fair. The workload is manageable (A LOT of reading and a weekly 4-6 question open-note quiz). Weaknesses: There was some miscommunication about expectations for studying on the part of the instructors, particularly Stuart. At the beginning of the course, students were told \"study from the lecture slides, and only go to the book if you have further questions.\" Toward the end of the course, Stuart began referring to the textbook as \"assigned reading\" out of nowhere, and he also began rushing faster through his lectures around this point, making them more difficult to follow and understand. His lectures discouraged me from attending the live lecture screenings, because he moved too fast for me to adequately understand the material in real time. I had to watch his lectures on my own time, with a lot of pausing and replaying, to fully understand the topics he covered. To improve, Stuart can slow down, or the instructors collectively can give students a clear understanding of the expectations for the textbook readings at the beginning of the course that one of them does not decide to arbitrarily change later.",
                "Strengths -- lead instructors and teaching team are amazing at their job, committed to making sure students have a good grasp on the material; tests are hard but fair; weekly quizzes are a great way to stay consistently engaged with the material\r\nWeaknesses -- perhaps sections should be changed from 50 minutes to a full hour, considering we almost always went overtime",
                "This was a terrific course and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the material. I really enjoyed the quizzes as a way to reinforce important concepts and keep all of us up to pace with the course during the semester. Sometimes the quizzes may have required answers that were somewhat long. I liked the model of the 3 exams dispersed throughout the semester without a final exam. It would have potentially been preferable to give the option of dropping the lowest score out of the three midterms, as that would take some pressure off of them, especially since it was easy to lose points due to the multiple choice nature of the exams. I very much appreciated the ability to gain lost point in quizzes by going to section each week.",
                "The lecture format is nice and the learning objectives at the end are helpful. At times the amount of information was overwhelming. The discussion sections were very helpful in outlining the most important concepts of the course. The quizzes were also a great resource for studying foe the exams. However, the exams were incredibly difficult in that we were only given 50 minutes. It was difficult to check answers which led to a lot of simple mistakes that cost a great deal of points.",
                "This was my favorite course I have ever taken at Yale!!! I truly have no complaints",
                "The strengths of the  course is that it really challenges you and makes you a better student. It provides a lot of opportunities of getting help too. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses is that it is a lot of information and the exams do feel very difficult.",
                "I think this courses strengths were having lecture slides and the discussion sections. I think if there were more office hour times or practice quizzes to study it would help out alot",
                "Strengths: The professors and TAs. Professor Campbell and Saltzman were always very supportive and available. \r\nWeaknesses: Harsh grading. The grades I got were not reflective of how hard I worked. The virtual format made it very difficult to feel motivated at times.",
                "The weaknesses are how much reading there was. Its a lot of reading to understand the material. Also, the Q&A session was difficult because it was right after 45 min of class before which made it difficult to pay attention. Some strengths are how everyone was encouraging to help learn about the information. It was helpful and made me want to really engage with the course.",
                "The course is very well taught, the information presented in lectures is clear, and the professors manage the class effectively, but the workload is a lot to keep up with.",
                "The instruction was purposeful and relevant. I felt everything taught in lecture was useful for my understanding and my ability to apply the physiological concepts outside of class. I appreciate the variety of professors as well. It was refreshing to have lectures cycle between three professors and experience three different teaching styles. \r\n\r\nOne challenge was the administration of exams. I personally experienced technological issues. The test would often shut down a few minutes before my allotted time or before I was able to upload written responses. Turning off the automatic submission feature on canvas would ameliorate this. Also, I often felt pressed for time on exams. I had to limit the amount of information I included in responses which jeopardized the accuracy and completeness of my answers. I think a solid 10-15 extra minutes for exams (which were 50 min) would ameliorate this. As our class was a morning class, I can imagine us meeting slightly earlier to accomplish this.",
                "One strength of this course is that the instructors explained difficult concepts very well and had many structures in place, such as Friday Q&A sessions, to make sure that students had an opportunity to clarify confusing concepts that they were unsure about. Also, the discussion sections were very helpful in reviewing content and focusing in on what concepts are most important to know well. The weekly quizzes were also extremely helpful, as they provided an incentive to review lecture content while not being detrimental to our grades.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was hoping for is a little bit more guidance on what concepts to focus on for exams. I did fairly well on the exams, but I would have liked to have some practice exams or more practice questions in preparation for the exams.",
                "Strengths are the professors and the TAs. All were helpful and knowledgeable. Also, the book is helpful if you make the effort to read it.",
                "The course was informative but maybe there could have been more interactive components for example a challenge question every week.",
                "I thought the early live lectures on fridays were not that helpful and also hard to attend given the hour so I was usually skipping them and just watching the lecture on the weekend",
                "The strengths of this course are its instructors. Professors Saltzman and Campbell were incredible professors all around, and the course was extremely well-structured.",
                "I thought a big weakness was the distribution of content. For example, multiple lectures were spent going over the renal system in great depth, but the only one lecture was spend on the reproductive system and I felt like I didn't learn much. Format of the exams was frustrating as well. Multiple choice questions were worth too many points and getting a few wrong would be the equivalent of the short answer."

                "I really liked having recorded lectures that I could go back to when I was confused about something the first time I watched through. This has been especially helpful in this class, where I feel like there is so much information given in so little time. I could go back through the lectures and pause so that I could digest the information at my own pace.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were prerecorded and released ahead of time.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were a huge help, especially in preparation for exams. Although it kind of deincentivized students from attending live lectures and getting to know the professors.",
                "I thought the professors and TAs did a phenomenal job adjusting to virtual learning and were very accommodating.",
                "The weakness to me was the method of content delivery. I liked the pre-recorded lectures fine and thought that the lecturers were always engaging, but there was no incentive for me to go to watch a pre-recorded lecture being screenshared \"live\" at 9:25 AM when I could watch the same lecture at 2x speed later in the day.",
                "Really great how there wasn't a cumulative final.",
                "The live sessions for pre-recorded lessons were great and I think helped create a better line of communication with the professors. I also think the open book tests were great. Or at least going into the future, open note. If we look at it critically, science will always be a collaboration and of course it is necessary we should put our efforts towards learning certain things. But it is very unlikely that we will ever not be able to look up specific details when necessary, so why should we as students spend more time memorizing than understanding. Which is why I think going forward, the instructors should keep, at the very least, open note tests.",
                "I appreciated being able to watch lectures live which gave students the opportunity to ask questions as material was being presented, and I also found it helpful to be able to go back and watch the recorded lectures so that I could rewatch sections that were confusing to me.",
                "I think the zoom for watching the recorded lectures was an interesting idea but I think being able to interrupt and ask questions during the video would have been more beneficial (ie. pause the recording to answer questions)",
                "The changing of lectures to being pre-recorded was a successful, along with the Q&A sessions on Fridays. The exams were difficult but reasonable for being open note. Students should be more explicitly recommended to study in groups, as that helped me immensely.",
                "The recorded lectures succeeded. This allowed students to pause and replay the lectures so that they could adequately understand all of the material. This was particularly helpful for Stuart's lectures, which seemed a bit rushed and difficult to follow in real time.",
                "The lack of a final exam and its substitution with an open note quiz instead was something I found very useful considering the vast amount of information that the course covered. I believe that the fact that the course emphasized understanding of concepts rather than memorization, because of the fact that there was nothing to prevent students from looking through their notes since everything was online in fact facilitated better learning in the class. I appreciated the opportunity to attend live sessions after the recorded lectures were streamed, so as to ask questions. Recordings of the lectures were extremely helpful in my learning experience. They allowed me to go back and look through concepts that I hadn't quite grasped the first time around.",
                "The lecture format was helpful, particularly with time for discussion at the end to interact with the professors. The exam format was not as successful, and I think students would greatly benefit from more time to take the exam.",
                "I thought the pre-recorded lectures were great",
                "The pre recorded lectures succeeded.\r\n\r\nI think the design of the exams could be improved.",
                "The online live lecture was very helpful, especially for asking questions. This format worked very well for this course and made it easier to learn",
                "The time allowed for the midterm exams. It would have been better to have more time to complete tests.",
                "Recorded lectures were great, the Q&A right after the lectures were difficult to pay attention for so long.",
                "The in-person Q&A was great because it allowed students to clarify with the professors whenever information presented in the lectures was unclear to them.",
                "Given the restrictions of online, remote learning, I was satisfied with the set-up for this semester. I had a sufficient access to professors and TAs, both in and out of class, via zoom.",
                "The recorded nature of the lectures was very helpful. I was able to review concepts multiple times and I know that this helped many of the students on the West Coast learn at times that were suitable for them. \r\n\r\nAlso, the instructors presenting the lectures during live class hours was a great opportunity to facilitate virtual engagement. I was able to ask many questions to improve my understanding and the Friday Q&A also similarly was very helpful.",
                "I thought the class was pretty normal. The s being online was the one change and I did not mind it.",
                "The lectures with time for discussion, office hours and discussion sections were very helpful.",
                "Exams had not enough time to check answers or think about mc qs a second time",
                "I really liked how this course was prerecorded, but there were also live viewing sessions where we could ask the professors questions about the lecture.",
                "The opportunity to view the lectures with the professors was really great. This gave us a chance to actually ask questions as if we were in the classroom. I had a few courses that were also pre-recorded lectures, but none of them had an option to watch them during normal class time."

                "Yes. The information taught in this course was really really interesting and helped me understand so much more about the human body and the various systems within it.",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in physiology or medicine at all, this is the course for you! You will have to work hard for your grade, but it will be worth it. This is one of the courses you look back on and feel proud of everything you've learned.",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about human physiology.",
                "100% yes. BENG 350 is not an easy class at all. However, if you are premed, thinking about working in the healthcare industry, or even have a remote interest in science, you will definitely not regret taking the class. The workload was high for me personally due to the amount of time I spent studying and going over the material. But it is definitely a great class.",
                "Absolutely. I think this is the ideal course for anyone interested in the human body, biology, physiology, etc.",
                "This should be required for any Yale pre-med. There are no other classes here where you will learn so much about the human body and its systems and how they function. The integration of cell bio, physics, and chemistry in this course is fascinating and outstanding, and not only will it help you study for the MCAT, but you will also come away with a much more mature understanding of medicine and physiology. This course synthesizes everything you have learned as bits and pieces of other Yale courses and teaches you the big picture.",
                "Yes, very informative.",
                "Yes, the course itself is very interesting and will give you a broad view of the underlying mechanisms of the body. I especially recommend it if you are in a pre-med or biological systems student. It's honestly a course with a lot of work in which you will have to spend quite some time reviewing if you want to fully understand the material, but very worth it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. The material is very interesting and the professors teach in a clear and engaging manner. A lot of material is covered in a short amount of time which is challenging, but I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in physiology.",
                "Yes, the course was a really good survey on all of the body systems and physiological mechanisms involved in keeping us alive.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you plan to go to graduate school in the biomedical sciences or medical school. The material applies the basic biology you learned in first year\/school to the human body. Not only will you learn about how the human body functions, but also about potential areas of research. One thing to emphasize is that the online version of this class is less memorization-heavy than its in-person counterpart, and I think that plays to its strengths. Yes, you'll have to memorize basic things, but the focus of your studying will be on understanding the various mechanisms of control and their interactions. Also the weekly assessments helped to learning material in a pressure-free manner (especially for the undergraduate version), which was helpful because we would review the concepts asked on that quiz the following Monday\/Tuesday in section. A last note on the textbook -- please use it! It may be one of the most dense physiology textbooks on the market, but that means it gives you the best opportunity for understanding. Use it as a secondary resource, as lecture material is paramount. However, don't forget this valuable resource.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. You will learn more in this course than any other course at Yale. All of the information covered is incredibly interesting and medically relevant. The tests are fair. The weekly open-note quizzes are manageable. The discussion sections (used as review sessions) are very useful. There is A LOT of reading, though. This is useful if you want to learn as much as you possibly can. Viewing recorded lectures (particularly Stuart's) is more helpful than attending the live lecture viewings in real time if you have not been exposed to this content before; the ability to pause and replay at your whim is much more useful than getting lost as Stuart rushes through some important details, and sitting there lost for the rest of the lecture. Peter Aronson's live lectures on the kidney are the highlight of this course; Peter is incredibly passionate about the material he covers, he is engaging, and his lectures are well-paced and can be comfortably followed in real time.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the human body and the way it works. The course does a terrific job of presenting the different organ systems in the body and how they work together, and by the end of it you get a holistic understanding of how our bodies work and how everything is regulated. If you are premed or interested in medicine, this course also offers a new avenue to think about biology, as it applies simple biological concepts within the scheme of systems in the body. There is a lot of material to memorize and understand  and even though memorization was not an issue this year, since the exams were open book, there was still a lot of things to keep in mind. Overall, however, it is beautiful to see how all this material comes together at the end of the course, and how everything in the body is interrelated.",
                "This course is challenging, but it was incredibly interesting and informative. If you are curious about the human body, this course does a great job of summarizing the major components and outlining physiological systems.",

                "Yes if they are willing to work hard.",
                "Yes! Honestly one of my favorite classes",
                "Yes i would! It is alot of work so i would only take it if you need it for your major, but if you can credit D it it is a very insightful class and you learn alot!",
                "Yes, but be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class. It was so interesting to learn about the human body system in-depth.",

                "Any student who wants a deep dive into physiology should take this course. I learned a tremendous amount. There is a lot of information to study and understand, but even for students with limited interest in biology, it really improves ones scientific literacy.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning how the human body works. This course, although it requires you to learn some anatomy, really is fascinating and teaches you about the mechanisms that underlie our body's major functions. This class is difficult, as there is a large amount of content to learn. That said, the course is extremely rewarding if you are willing to put the time in to study for the exams.\r\n\r\nThe course is built to facilitate your learning, and if you are willing to put the work in, you will be very happy that you have taken this course.",
                "yes, as credit\/d",
                "Absolutely. If you are thinking about med school or biomedical engineering, this class is a must. 10\/10 course",
                "Yes, this course is a great way to learn more about body systems",
                "Great class for anyone planning on taking the mcat",
                "This class is a gem. Take this class if you're at all interested in the human body. There are very few other classes like it offered at Yale that explores the systems of the human body so comprehensively and challenges you to think in a way that incorporates your knowledge into solving clinical problems. Although this class isn't easy, it is one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had at Yale.",
                "Really interesting course  you don't have to be a STEM major to take this. You learn so much about the human body and how it works. Workload is not bad either  one weekly quiz that is open notes, and if you attend section and score above 50% on the quiz then you get a 100% for that quiz."
