   "comments": [
    "More thorough notes on board in classes that will help with psets, exams questions",
    "Strengths: I really liked the book chosen; it really helped refresh my precalculus knowledge and made Calculus less daunting. The questions asked on exams were mainly fair, but the grading for partial credit wasnt always fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly workshops. They honestly did nothing for my learning, and I think a discussion section would be more beneficial, in which students go over homework problems with a learning assistant and\/or professor. The problem sets due on Tuesdays were also too long. Granted, we had the whole weekend to do them, but many of us have many other problem sets and other work to do.",
    "Better teachers",
    "Teaching was lesser in the section taught by the Graduate Student than Professor Halls section.",
    "The strength is taking the material slow. I did not feel Gabriel was a great instructor so it could be improved by having a better professor.",
    "Strengths: included a lot of information in a short period of time\r\nWeaknesses: I did not enjoy how the course was taught. I thought their methods were not effective.",
    "More focus on material that the homework covered. Going over homework in class",
    "The strength of his course was its cut and dry nature, but the weakness was how difficult the problem sets were. I feel like most werent doable without assistance.",
    "Strengths are the pace and in depth understanding of topics.\r\nWeaknesses are the more theoretical approach to math versus the traditional solving of problems as the hour and a half long sections.",
    "The strengths of this course is the student to teacher ratio and how often the students can meet for office hours and meet TAs. I feel like there could have been more review sessions for midterms and finals in order to better prepare students for the exams.",
    "Self-instruction was prominent and important but helped me learn the material. I would, however, like to see instruction in class reflect what is on Psets and tests."
