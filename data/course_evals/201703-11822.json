    "Broadened my vocabulary and my ability to speak about literature\/politics.",
    "I was extremely impressed with the quality of teaching we received from Prof. Bousty. Throughout the year, it was very apparent that he knew his material extremely well and explained the concepts in a super engaging and accessible manner. He worked tirelessly to ensure that we all understood the intricate details veiled under the Arabic language. What makes him stand out from any other teacher I have had at Yale was that he was more than a teacher to all of us and filled the role of a personal mentor as well.",
    "This class is great for learning how to read texts in Arabic and discuss them!",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding of the Arabic language. This course is much more about discussion and reading than L1-L4, and very little time is spent on grammar. This is incredibly helpful in becoming a better Arabic speaker and reader."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Elbousty is a very engaging and committed teacher, and prepares a very good discussion for every class. Unfortunately I felt that the class was not at all a sequential step from L4 and catered too much to those students who are already fluent and are just getting the language requirement. I found myself putting in a lot of work but just not having the vocabulary base to be able to understand a lot of the reading, same in the tests. That said, he grades fairly and provides good support along the way if you are struggling with anything - I am definitely better at Arabic!",
    "The professor always goes out of his way to assist his students and is a model of how every professor should be. It is also amazing how he remains in his office until around 11:30pm nearly on a daily basis! His doors are always open for his students and he encourages us to use office hours if we have any issues. As far as I recall, there was not even one time over the past year when I left from his class not smiling or not looking forward to the next class, even on days when we had exams!",
    "If you want to learn how to get the main points out of arabic texts (articles and stories), 5this class is a great introduction! The weekly presentations are a great way to practice staying your opinion on a topic",
    "Disorganized.",
    "I thought this course was very strong in that it helps you develop your Arabic quickly and effectively. At times I felt that it was jumping too quickly. On occasion, readings were given that were too complicated and long, and this made the course difficult and discouraging. However, these were the minority of the readings."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this - I mean there's nothing to compare it with because it's the first L5 course and so a prereq, but while I would prefer another grammar course before this course, Professor Elbousty helps to make it very engaging and you get a lot of practice discussing useful real-world topics.",
    "This is a great course for students who want to understand Arabic in its social and literary contexts. It will grow your vocabulary and improve your reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, though it may not improve your grammar much if that is your aim.",
    "If you are thinking of taking any Arabic course, definitely take it with Mr Bousty  he is without a shadow of a doubt amongst the worlds top Arabic professors and is widely respected by leading scholars in the field.",
    "Yes! Take this class!",
    "Yes, if you are already at the level of Arabic that this course intends to get you to, i.e. native speaker. There was a mismatch of Arabic levels amongst students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student."
