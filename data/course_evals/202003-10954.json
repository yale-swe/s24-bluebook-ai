                "Really opened my eyes to the deep and rich Caribbean history that is often overlooked in most history classes revolving around the United States.

Very interesting discussions around the Haitian and Cuban Revolutions. I'll also never misspell 'Caribbean' again.",

                "From native settlement through modern-day history I gained a comprehensive and critical understanding of Caribbean History. This was my first introduction to global history and the lens provided through the Caribbean was incredibly instructive. Our content began with early colonialism and encounters with native populations on the island nations, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the development of the plantation economy. From the beginning, narratives of oppression were countered consistently by narratives of \"counter-plantation\" forces, tactics, and strategies. Always, the analyses were attuned to the role of gender and archive in altering history. We learned about the system of apprenticeship, early revolutions, nationalism, colonialism and neocolonialism.\r\nReading response assignments facilitated the skills to write strong claims and structure convincing arguments. The final essay introduced students to incorporating primary sources.",

                "Strengths: readings typically interesting, relatively low work (Three 3-page pagers, a midterm, and final paper that's just an extension of one of the papers you already wrote), awesome TAs and Prof. Eller is great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: one week we had to read a 300+ page memoir, but that was the only assignment where the reading was unnecessarily long; Prof. Eller talks pretty fast and touches on a bunch of different topics, sometimes straying away from main point of the lecture;",
                "strengths: Prof. Eller is so knowledgeable and passionate about her field of study, easy writing credit, INCREDIBLE readings; weaknesses: heavy reading some weeks, little interaction with students on Zoom lectures when everyone's muted with cameras off",
                "Professor Eller is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, and her enthusiasm for the subject at hand is infectious. The readings, much of it drawn from recent scholarship, were generally quite interesting. However, I found myself wishing that the class was a seminar rather than a lecture, as Professor Eller's personable teaching style practically invited questions and critical discussion, neither of which we had time for when class was only 50 minutes long and the material was so broad. I felt that the classes might have felt more like (and been more effective as) lectures if they were more goal oriented or began\/ended with a summary of key points and essential vocab, which would have made it easier to structure notes and retain information.",
                "Professor Eller's enthusiasm for the material makes the course more engaging, and the well-thought-out structure of the course makes it so we gain both breadth and depth of Caribbean history. Most importantly, the course was refreshing as far as history courses go in that it did not shy away from acknowledging the ways the US itself has been a harmful force in Caribbean history, and makes an effort to center Caribbean resistance rather than focus on only imperial growth.",
                "The course felt kind of a mess. The work load in terms of reading was quite high but did not well supplement the lectureseither they felt repetitive or totally disjoint. The grading was harsh but the feedback was unclear. In addition, the lecture style felt unfocused to me and was sometimes difficult to follow.",
                "Anne is amazing. I really have no other commentary.",
                "Excellent TA (Emily Snyder)",
                "Strengths are the dynamism of Professor Eller's lectures, the unique research contributions and diligent commitment of the Teaching Fellows. Lectures were always fast-paced and engaging. In a Zoom setting, where it is easy to tune out of class, I would practice as many strong habits to stay focused in Prof Eller's lectures. If you stop listening for even a second, you may miss a lyrical insight or witty joke. The course facilitated a community (even online!) between TFs, students and professor by inviting and engaging with guest lectures, sharing each TF's research and always being attuned to the needs of online learning, the COVID pandemic, and the national election.\r\nWeaknesses are also found in the dynamic, fast-paced lectures. Professor Eller is incredibly well read. At times her tangents would veer into material that students were unfamiliar with and therefore unable to engage with. A stronger organization of the main lecture and perhaps reserving a few moments at the end of lecture for tangents, might be beneficial, especially for students new to the field.",
                "Strength  a good survey of Caribbean history from 1400 to present day. \r\n\r\nWeakness  it's a ton, ton of content, obviously. There were many great threads and tidbits that were briefly touched on in lectures and readings that were never picked up on again. I don't think you can really trim much fat from this course, either, which presents a problem. \r\n\r\nImprovement: \r\nSplit the course into fall & spring courses. A good model would be Merriman's French history courses (one goes from the late 1700s till the late 1800s, and the following course picks right up until present day). A fantastic course would be a Caribbean history course from 1400 to the Haitian Revolution, followed by a course from the Haitian Revolution to present day.",
                "I really enjoyed the live discussion sections as opportunities to further discuss topics covered in lecture. I would have appreciated a bit more structure with the lecture material to help with reviewing for the midterm, but the lectures were really interesting, nonetheless.",
                "Excellent material and pace, I would not change much",
                "strengths: incredibly interesting material\r\nweaknesses: lectures were sometimes disorganized and there was minimal material on the slides; very difficult to understand some of the week's material by looking at the slides alone - important to attend or listen to lecture",
                "Professor Eller just kind of started talking every lecture and it didn't feel like there was much direction, so it was hard for someone with very little knowledge of caribbean history to follow, even from the beginning"

The Caribbean is a unique historical and contemporary site for the entanglement of so much of human history, economy and society. Anyone interested in history, language, diaspora--no matter if of a different geographic specificity--will gain tremendously from the transnational and decolonial frameworks of this course.

It's a great bird's eye view of the history or the Caribbean, and you can't ask for much more from a class spanning so much time and space. The midterm is very very fair, and the papers are flexible and you get to write about what you're interested in. If you want to learn more about the Caribbean, take it. If you need a LatAm history credit, take it. If you need a WR credit that's both interesting & not too difficult, take it. If you want a broad intro to ER&M concepts, take it.",

The Caribbean is the birthplace of the social orders and economic systems we have today and understanding the history of this region helps one understand the socio-economic systems that we are all subject to today.
