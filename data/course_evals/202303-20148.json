                "Strengths: In-Class Slides. Please continue to use slides in class and send them out after the class. These are really helpful, especially when there is so much information to be covered. It is also helpful to organize certain concepts or skills with different examples that we worked on in class. For example, talking about countries and using the country's flag/photos. Then, when I think of those photos, the concepts and words come back and they are easier to remember. Also, for visual learners, it is incredibly helpful to see words spelled out on a slide rather than solely relying on listening.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lingco tests. The Lingco tests were not an accurate assessment of students' learning. First, it was always hard to hear via the in-class headphones. Also, the test usually relied on you to be able to listen to the question, when the question was testing speaking. If the objective you are trying to measure is someone's oral production, it should be isolated from assessing their ability to listen. If tests will be online in the future, I strongly recommend allowing students to take the tests at home in a quiet environment on their own computer with their own headphones.",
                "There is a lot of opportunity for practicing French speaking and listening. The pace is just right and there is ample material available. You walk away from the course already prepared for daily conversations and reading basic texts.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course by far is the grading. You need 95+ to get an A, which means you cannot slack off any time during the semester and have to devote full effort to every single exam, because there are a lot of trick questions and it's very easy to fall below 95%. It diverges the focus away from \"improving French\" to \"improving test scores\" which is undesirable for an introductory course.",
                "I appreciate the high standards and coverage of this class, and do feel that I have learned a lot of the language in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the sheer breadth of vocabulary took away from gaining confidence in many of the fundamentals. I would have benefitted a lot from more opportunities to practice speaking and listening, rather than memorizing vocabulary for tests that unfortunately did not stick nearly as well. Additionally, I found it detrimental to expect students to speak and hear only French from the very beginning of the class because I didn't feel comfortable asking questions and when I missed something, felt that I even missed the explanations of questions."

I really don't think there's more significant workload in this course compared to other ones: sure, you have class every day, and homework every day, but the homework generally takes about an hour or less and is not difficult. The only thing you have to be prepared for is harsh grading, and possible disorientation at the start of the course if you've never been exposed to French (or learned a foreign language in general).",
                "Yes, I do appreciate the opportunity to learn French in such an intensive way. Students should be dedicated to learning the language before enrolling, otherwise it can be overwhelming."
