            "comments": [
                "Strengths: extremely interesting and relevant course, accesible for students who don't have prior knowledge of the Middle East, great professor and TF. Not a lot of assignments besides the weekly readings: a small quiz, midterm & final exam and a final paper \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks the readings can be a lot, but I think section and the lectures really helped break them down",
                "Strengths - Lotito is a great lecturer.  Piazza is a fantastic tool for asking questions.\r\nWeaknesses - It would be nice if we could ask Piazza questions anonymously, it helps. Sometimes there were too many readings in one week and you have to do them for the exam. Having an exam and policy memo during the pandemic felt like too much. The policy memo directions were very unclear.",
                "Strengths: I really like the Teaching Fellows and the Professor! I think that it was a well set up course and I really enjoyed the recorded lectures and felt that student's wellbeing was valued. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we spent more time on how colonialism occurred in the Middle East and in each of these countries to step them up as they are now.",
                "I thought it was great the papers were well done and the tests were well formatted",
                "Great introduction to both themes and specific country contexts. Survey course very welcoming to those without an introduction in the region, well planned lectures, great lecture slides",
                "Strengths: you learn a TON in this course without even having to do that much work. Professor Lotito's lectures are really informative, and you get to learn about everything that you've probably seen in the news alreadyongoing conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Yemen; Iran-Saudi conflict; sectarianization and more. This was a fantastic introductory class to the Middle East for people who don't know much going into it.\r\nAlso, the assignments in this course weren't too demanding. There was a midterm, a policy memo, and a final. Although readings could be lengthy, they were really informative and often enjoyable to do (if you actually want to learn about the Middle East). Weekly sections were really helpful to go over the readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with any survey course, it can be difficult to jump around so many different narrativesthat's the cost of breadth vesus depth. For instance, I would have loved to spend more time on Lebanon or on the gulf states individually. But overall Professor Lotito does a fantastic job covering as much as possible in one semester.",
                "This course presented information in an order that was logical (the first half of the semester we covered broad themes like popular mobilization and colonial legacies and looked at brief examples from several different countries, and the second half we explored the policies of specific countries more in-depth).\r\n\r\nI think the biggest issue was that since the course covers so many different countries and such a large time span, it was hard to retain information and decipher which details from readings were relevant and which were not. The midterm and final were also difficult since we were only given an hour and a half to write 2 essays. I feel like I was more prepared for the final since I was more familiar with discussing particular themes and countries, but studying for the midterm was definitely really difficult since I wasn't sure what to focus on. One way to help with this might be releasing sample questions for students to practice with before the actual exam.",
                "It was great, Lotito very knowledgeable, well-made lectures",
                "Strengths: Professor Lotito and the TAs were very understanding and willing to accommodate students. I thought Lotito's lectures were well-structured and easy to follow. I thought the midterm and final exam were well-structured and a good representation of what we had learned. \r\nWeaknesses: It wasn't always clear what we were supposed to get out of all of the readings, which would get very specific at times (but overly specific for what we needed to know). I wish we had focused more on the critique of Orientalism, and that that critique had been extended throughout the semester by Professor Lotito to the materials and videos he was presenting us with.",
                "Lots of well-organized content. I really learned a ton from this class. It wasn't super fun exactly, but it was a good class from an educational standpoint. Just a lot of information pushed at you. I also enjoyed the policy memo writing assignment, though I thought it was a little unnecessary to have that and the final exam due so close together.",
                "For me, this year especially, a huge strength was my TF Dana and the weekly discussion sections which really helped me better understand the readings for the week and the specific topic\/country we were discussing. Sometimes, I did feel that the readings were a lit dense and lengthy but for the most part, they were interesting.",
                "More engagement between students and the professor. At times, it felt completely disconnected. In addition, the course could have done a better job of relating the readings to the lecture. However, I loved my TF.",
                "Lectures and sections were both fantastically organized. Lotito is a great lecturer and his lectures were very well organized. These also complemented section well because section was rigorous enough that we had to have watched the lectures by then so we couldn't fall behind. The readings were a bit long to be realistic though.",
                "This course is amazing and truly teaches about the MENA region and the governments in place. It covered every country in the region in depth and taught so much about the countries that is not taught in most US centered classes. The only thing I'd say is the readings were a lot in conjunction with lectures given how much information is given in both. It was sometimes a lot to take in.",
                "In the first half of the course, you go over political science theory pertaining to the region. This part was really solid. In the second half of the course, you go over history of specific countries (each lecture you focus on a new country). This part was meh. I would have preferred if it was less history in this second section and more political science theory. To be fair though, in the second part of the course, the political science theory comes through via the readings rather than the lectures (which is alright I guess if you do the readings).",
                "Strength: Professor Lotito is a really passionate and energetic lecturer he is undoubtedly a strength of this course. The lecture slides were always very clear, and Professor Lotito did a very good job of walking through the material.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Towards the beginning of the course, it felt like there was a lot of reading and it felt a bit daunting. However, Professor Lotito eventually reduced the reading load. My only other aside is that I was not a big fan of the format of either the midterm of the final exam: both had 3 essay prompts, and we had to choose 2. I felt like writing 2, 5 paragraph essays in only 90 minutes was overwhelming and did not allow me to convey my true knowledge that I took away from this course. I would perhaps like to see a more traditional exam, or maybe even 1 essay question and some multiple choice, fill in the blanks, or even some short answers.",
                "Strengths: section discussions were engaging, Prof Lotito is extremely knowledgable. Weaknesses: recorded lectures lack engagement.",
                "Moves too fast",
                "The course was very organized. I appreciated that a rubric was always available for each assessment, and the TAs were very well qualified. Professor Lotito is also very passionate about this subject.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures make format flexible, exams are fairly written and adequately test knowledge, Piazza helps with questions, Professor Lotito is great",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe recorded lectures were perfect\r\nThe texts were generally interesting\r\nThe discussion sections were engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPolicy memos were new to me so I struggled. I believe accomodations could be made for first-year students who aren't familiar with policy memos, to better explain their composition.",
                "This course was great! I thought it was well organized and the professor did well in interacting with the students.",
                "Strengths: First half of the semester was devoted to developing a conceptual understanding of the region's historical and political complexity, which was necessary and helpful; lectures were organized and clear; assignments and grading were fair; relatively low workload, if you're into that or looking for a fifth class; optional Piazza discussion posts were constructive; altogether, is exactly what you expect from a political science lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Second half of the semester was devoted to discussing a specific country\/sub-region per class, which is an intuitive approach but nevertheless felt less engaging and cohesive than the first half had been"

For some reason, it felt less intimidating than actually raising your hand. I don't know if it's just me, but I think it encouraged participation?

                "Live virtual section went a long way to feeling engaged in the class, especially as we each had to run a section, so you had to be actually prepared. The recorded lectures also were very good because it meant that they could be edited or redone to be as organized as possible and embed youtube videos without tech difficulty. Lotito himself still felt engaged though because of the few \"town hall\" style lectures we had and live virtual review sessions.",
                "I liked the pre-recorded lectures rather than in person. It made it easier to take notes because I could watch them at my own pace.",
                "Having pre-recorded lectures for this course was great. Sometimes the details can get a bit technical, so being able to pause and rewinding as a pleased were really helpful for this course.",
                "There could be more room for access to professor help.",
                "Section was very successful",
                "Professor Lotito was amazing. The course format was quite flexible in light of the pandemic, but he still lightened reading and lecture loads during particularly difficult weeks (eg election week).",
                "The recorded lectures and virtual discussion sections succeeded. I don't believe anything failed.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were the best I had this semester. Professor L. did well in keeping his instruction interactive.",
                "I appreciated the pre-recorded lectures for obvious reasons (could watch, rewatch, and pause at one's own convenience), but this nevertheless engendered feelings of being distanced from the course. I sometimes forgot I was taking it."

                "Yes, it is a chance to better understand the world we live in, and even if you don't like the course, you will come away with valuable knowledge.",
                "Absolutely! I think it's a great, approachable course for students who did not have prior knowledge about the Middle East. I feel like I learned so much, and I feel more confident about talking about these topics with others now, because before I always felt ignorant and uninformed to have meaningful conversations on the Middle East.  Also, I was a little iffy about taking this course, because I was afraid that it would be U.S.-centric and kind of biased, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well Prof. Lotito and Dana navigated this...we actually talked quite a bit about the role of the U.S. in sustaining authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.",
                "I would recommend this if you want to learn more about MENA and are interested in the area. This is not an easy class if you do not have an interest. You need to be able to write well because the exams are essay based and there is a policy memo.",
                "Yes, it was helpful to get an introduction to the politics of the Middle East.",
                "Yes for sure",
                "Yes: great survey and introduction to foreign policies of states in the Middle East, with a focus on the Arab Spring. Introduction to history of colonialism in the Middle East as well",
                "Absolutely. This course was to gain a fundamental history of the Middle East, the modern political dynamics, and how the region will be shaped in the future.",
                "I would 100% recommend this to anyone who is remotely interested in the Middle East. You don't need to know anything about the region going into the course, but will come out with a fundamental knowledge of everything you need to know to understand recent events. It's great for anyone who wants to be able to understand and converse about the news.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is really important to understand the conflicts in the Middle East and how they are deeply intertwined with colonial histories and foreign (especially Western) intervention. If you are unfamiliar with discussing the politics of the region, this course will be a bit more challenging because the readings can just feel like a whole bunch of new information that's difficult to retain, but as long as you make sure to identify the main argument and supporting evidence of the authors, you'll be fine.",
                "Yeah! Gives a suuuuper overview of current ME politics and how they came about",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want a general overview of the international relations of the MENA region. I would not recommend it to students who want to deeply and critically engage with questions of Western bias\/Orientalism in international relations studies.",
                "Yes, but only if you are interested in the material.",
                "If you want to learn a lot about the Middle East, you definitely will in this course. Just a ton of information. Professor Lotito is patient and careful lecturer and obviously knows his stuff.",
                "I would recommend this course. The material was engaging, the lectures well organized, and the whole course felt both interesting and manageable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it provides the fundamentals to understanding current issues in the Middle East.",
                "Yes I'd recommend it to anyone regardless of year or major because of how well taught it is and how it is structured to prepare you to be a well informed person all around.",
                "Yes. Really interesting and topical material, and Professor Lotito is a great professor.",
                "Absolutely, I think the information learned in this course is vital to any student but especially political science majors.",
                "As a political science major and someone who doesn't know much about the middle east, I liked it!",
                "Yes, it teaches a good basic understanding of the Middle East.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in the Middle East at all. I have taken classes in the past that briefly touched on the Middle East, and took this course because I really wanted to dive deep into the region. This is, in my mind, the best course that you can take about Yale if you want to learn about the Middle East and it also has a relatively low workload.",
                "Yes! It's a fantastic class if you are interested in learning more about the Middle East.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, especially if you have no background on the Middle East, this is a great entry course!",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. Middle-Eastern politics are very interesting and important (especially given that many countries are still reliant on oil from the region). Furthermore, the course provides valuable insight into Middle-Eastern culture, which I believe is worth understanding, especially given the islamophobic climate in many Western nations that has arisen from a lack of such understanding.",
                "Yes, this course offers a great insight into analyzing the relations of the middle east countries.",
                "Sure. Why not.\r\nClearly, not an emphatic or resounding \"Yes!\" but I certainly wouldn't advise against this course. Prof. Lotito is a great lecturer, and Middle East politics is a topic everyone should know about but very few people actually do. I also HIGHLY recommend having taken previous coursework in IR-related fields; you could still succeed without the previous knowledge, but it's very helpful. Altogether, this was a very average political science class (but, in fairness, what else can you expect from an introductory lecture)."
