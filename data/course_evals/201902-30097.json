   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: lack of respect for our time; the lab was not so long that we had to be there until 5 every week when the lab was scheduled for 3 hours. The lab protocol was simple and I just felt like so much time was devoted to unnecessary things (taking pictures, looking at pictures, etc).\r\n\r\nI disliked the lack of direction given for how to break down and interpret papers; he assumed we knew how to do so ahead of time when this was the first lab for the majority of people. I appreciated the document on how to construct a job talk, but no insight was given on how to analyze papers.\r\n\r\nI get that his lab during the school year is coveted, but I dont need to hear about it during every lab session.",
    "Strengths: lab, experiments, classmates, Professor Woleskni \r\nWeakness: sometimes lab goes over but taking a 5-10 minute break in the middle is helpful"
