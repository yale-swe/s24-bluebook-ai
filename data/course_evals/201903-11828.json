   "comments": [
    "A strength and a weakness is that it meets everyday. Thus, you are constantly exposed to the language, but you also have to go to a class everyday. Take it as it is.",
    "Strengths: I think there's a really good balance of learning grammar\/vocabulary and reading comprehension in this course, and Profesora Baffi is so, so encouraging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was quite a lot of reading and homework at times (even though Profesora Baffi never really checked the homework).",
    "Strengths- the small class sizes foster engagement with the whole class every day through speaking\/discussion often. That the class is taught in Spanish is excellent listening practice as well. The immersion and consistency of it being every day really helped grow my Spanish skills throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the workload was manageable usually but that the book we read was towards the end of the semester meant that there was not enough time to spend on it to fully gain everything I could from it.",
    "This course contained a good survey and a variety of activities with different tenses. More organized speaking activity and practice using vocabulary orally would be helpful.",
    "The syllabus and course packet were very clear and well organized. However, some of the stories we read seemed antiquated and confusing, and contained a lot of vocabulary that I did not know even though I placed into L3."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, although at the end of the course, the workload pics up a lot.",
    "Yes, and certainly with Profesora Baffi. She is very encouraging, which is great for Spanish-learners at this level. The work is manageable and the class size is small so you can really get to know your classmates and professor.",
    "Yes, I gained a lot from this course from interactions with my professor and fellow students and just the way the course is structured in terms of fully immersing you in the language and forcing you to speak, read, and write in Spanish every day. I appreciate the experience and the methodology of teaching a lot."
