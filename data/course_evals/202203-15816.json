Although reasonably niche right now, given that most problems can be formulated in terms of graphs, and given the power of deep learning, I'm sure the material I learned in this class will come into use in the future. The algorithms we discussed in class were elegant yet powerful - and this made the course all the more enjoyable for me.",

            "comments": [
                "It's a great survey course in graph learning, but it would be very helpful if some of the contents could be explained in greater details rather than just touching upon.",
                "I think a strength of the course were the lectures and the lecture slides. I felt these were very well put together and were quite easy to follow and understand. I thought Rex did a great job putting those together, since they made it easier to follow along during lecture. Additionally, I thought that Rex did a great job of explaining topics during lecture and would always consider students questions carefully.\r\n\r\nSome things I didn't like about the course: I thought the homework assignments were a bit disconnected from the lecture materials at times. They often required more personal online research to answer, which was slightly annoying. Additionally, I wish the colab coding assignments were actually more involved so we learned how to code GNNs just as much as the theory. I think the class was a bit theory-heavy despite the emphasis with the final project being so code-heavy. Speaking of the final project, I think it is a bit too much work especially with a final exam. I think because the final project is so involved and so much is expected from the students, it should be kept while the final exam shouldn't be included in future versions of the course. It seems unnecessary for the course to have a final exam, when an emphasis of the class is the final exam. \r\n\r\nFinally, I think Piazza should be used more. It was difficult for me to go to office hours because I am a PhD student with a family. Especially in the later part of the course, Piazza became completely useless for asking questions. Questions would sit for days and go unanswered. There are still many instructor-unanswered questions on piazza today. There aren't many questions posted to Piazza, and a class with 1 instructor and 4 TAs should be able to keep up. If the class chooses to have a piazza site, it should be used in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that the solutions to the homeworks should be released so students can more easily learn from their mistakes on the homeworks. Not releasing the homework solutions after they were due was a weakness of the class.",
                "The course covers so much relevant material, and the workload is pretty manageable in terms of homework.\r\nThe course does get really heavy however towards the end to come up with a good project and do well on the final requires a good amount of time!!",
                "There was way too much breadth and not enough depth in the course. I'd have preferred if we looked at just a few topics but focused more on application, developing strong foundations. For instance learning everything  from something as simple as converting a dataset into a heterogenous graph all the way up to writing key functions for some of the architectures we covered.",
                "Strengths: 1. There is no one better who can teach you this material. Rex is one of the pioneers in this field, and indeed, many of the lectures dealt with algorithms that he himself was a published author on. 2. Because Rex is a quick lecturer who expects a good amount from his students, lectures cover a vast quantity of super cool material. 3. Although the material taught in lecture is enormous, as far as assessments are concerned, psets and coding projects take only a few hours, and are spaced well throughout the semester. Even the final exam only required basic understanding of the concepts presented, without requiring any of the intricate details. Weaknesses: 1. Given the gigabrain inside Rex's head, it's not a surprise that he moves quickly over concepts, which can sometimes make lectures hard to follow. However, the lecture slides are well-designed, a great reference to review content from lectures. 2. If anything, this course could have had ~more~ assessments, if only to reinforce key concepts more before the final exam.",
                "The course is one of the best I've taken",
                "Strengths: great breadth of content and thus a good introduction to deep learning on graphs; weaknesses: a bit too fast-paced, sometimes lectures contained too much information",
                "Strength: Comprehensive overview\r\nWeakness: maybe should emphasize less of the hyperbolic embedding part",
                "Low workload but emphasized building a strong foundational knowledge. Lenient grading",
                "Good organization of the syllabus, and material",
                "Good: really good slides, passionate lectures, a lot of material\r\nImprovements: the coding homeworks were way too simple and I did not learn a lot there"

Still, despite this, I thought the class was well put together and a great review of the cutting edge of graph neural networks. I certainly learned a lot through the class.",

                "This class is the definition of you will get you put into the class. The content covered in this class is super cool but its very advanced (includes lots of random math, very recent research, and blitzes through lots of complex Deep Learning architectures). However, the PSETS (which are 50% of grade) are really easy in comparison (4 mathy ones and 3 coding ones which each take a few hours or less) and are graded very leniently. There is one test (the in-class final) which is also tame and graded leniently. The final project (in groups of 2-3) is to implement or analyze a Graph learning paper which can feel like a significant jump from the PSETs since now you have to actually implement and understand everything while in PSETs you only have to write function snippets. I did 80%+ of my learning from this class on the final project. I have taken an AI class before but this was my first Machine\/Deep Learning class. I felt like it was accessible but conceptually hard to grasp which I feel like could have been remedied if I had taken another machine\/deep learning class beforehand such as Deep Learning (CS 452) or Intro\/Intermediate ML (S&DS 265\/365) beforehand. I am proud that I was able to delve into cutting edge research but I feel like my understanding at the end of the day is surface level compared to what some students who specialize in ML may have gotten out. We covered basics of deep learning, various architectures to build Graph Neural Nets (GNNs), different objectives for Graph learning (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, node classification, edge prediction, graph prediction). Then some advanced topics such as hyperbolic embeddings, biological applications, trustworthy AI, knowledge graphs.",
