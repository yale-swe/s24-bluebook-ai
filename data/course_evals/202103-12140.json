                "This class provided an engaging overview of dance and music history with a focus on classical dance.",
                "I gained a really great historical lens into general dance history, with an emphasis on music and dance relationships, particularly in ballet. I think the variety of perspectives we covered were really helpful in thinking about dance and music in different ways, and utilizing the methods we surveyed in class was a really great experience in learning to collaborate with new materials and perspectives. I think this course gave me really unique knowledge that could not be really found in another class in the way that it was specific to dance and music, a relationship that goes widely understudied.",
                "Learned a lot about different approaches to choreographing dance to music, learned about music a bit as well (no music background but still engaging)",
                "Taking MUSI 401 helped me understand the ideas proposed throughout history in regards to dance and music, and how they shaped dance and music to what it is today. As I continued to dance this semester, I began to notice the existence of these concepts that I learned about within my own dances. By taking this course, I was able to not only learn about the concepts regarding dance and music relationships, but also when they were proposed, who they were proposed by, and how to evolve these ideas with my own individual artistic direction.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is excellent at bridging the divide between dancers and musicians and fosters equal appreciation of both art forms. The guest visits from professional dancers and musicians very much enhanced my learning and having more choreographers visit would have added to that.",
                "I think the specificity of the course, as in studying the relationship between dance and music, is one of its greater strengths because of the way that this relationship tends to be understudied despite the strong link between dance and music. Having guest lecturers and doing workshops was also very educational and enjoyable. That being said, I wish we could have done more guest lectures or workshops but, given COVID-19 restrictions, it makes sense why we did not do as many. I also think this course could be slightly improved through format by changing the course from meeting twice a week for 1 hour and 15 minutes to meeting once a week for about 2.5 hours. I think that would have given us more opportunity to discuss content and then focus on studio-based work all in one class, which would have provided more depth.",
                "The biggest strength is the variety of content and emphasis on developing your own opinions about it. I also enjoyed to dance workshops. The only weakness is that I wish we had more workshops potentially to play instruments or see that relationship happen in front of us.",
                "Well organized",
                "MUSI 401 consisted of various workshops that I found incredibly enjoyable, whether it be movement sessions, lectures from distinguished guest speakers, or our own presentations that we showcased to our peers. It was also amazing that so many people talented in various aspects of dance and music were gathered together in a class to discuss ideas, whether formed during the class or beforehand. However, I found that the class was too focused on the homework readings, making the class feel like there was not enough guidance if the readings were difficult to understand. Although I loved the freedom in the class, I also felt as if sometimes there was a bit too much freedom, making it easy for students to get lost in the course. I feel that visual slideshow presentations or clear outlines of what the readings were about would be extremely helpful in the class. I was also extremely confused as to why nobody could receive above a 9.5/10 in the homework responses, even when the professor's comments were very positive. Overall, the strengths still outweighed the weaknesses by a huge margin, and I absolutely loved this class.",
                "Strengths include very interesting readings and fun dance workshops that required us to translate the knowledge we acquired from the readings and the discussions into choreography and movement.  I loved that we were all able to bring our own creativity and diverse artistic backgrounds to the class and fully engage with the material in our own ways, especially through the final project.  \r\nI wish we had more readings about different dance forms other than ballet.  Most of the readings were ballet-focused.  I believe we could learn about so many more nuances in the relationship between dance and music through other kinds of dance from other cultures."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone seeking to better understand the dance + composition and how they communicate to us even without words.",
                "Yes! Interesting and engaging, Professor is great",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who have prior music or dance experience, but not for those who are trying it out for the first time. The course expects a lot of prior knowledge later in the semester, and I think it would be extremely difficult to analyze the in-class readings without knowing much about dance beforehand.",
                "Yes, it is very exciting-- this class always made my week!  We had many dance workshops.  The final project was a blast-- there were no limits to what you could do, as long as you tied it back to what we learned in class."
