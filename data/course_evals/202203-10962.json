            "comments": [
                "The quizzes were just hard for no purpose (Dellaporta's especially), they were mostly unclear and hard to read: questions asking the same concepts with clearer sentence structure would make it so much easier. Additionally, for several quizzes there were questions that had no right answer, and people would spend a lot of time trying to figure them out when it was impossible. The discussion sections during class time were very good, I really liked that approach to a journal club like session. I loved having the quizzes rather than midterms/final.",
                "Strengths: It was pretty low workload. You could get by without attending lectures or really reading the text. Weaknesses: The lectures feel really long if you do go, and sometimes it feels like just reading the textbook on your own might be faster and more conducive to learning. The bimonthly quizzes were also excruciating. Some of them just had multiple choice questions that were way too nitpicky.",
                "The quizzes are a bonus for some, but I can see how they can be a challenge for others. The discussion sections are interesting, but often times feel disconnected from the course",
                "Strengths: the textbook covers the same material so there are ways to review. Weaknesses: Professor Gendron is highly unapproachable, it felt like the only way for him to like you was to kiss up to him and align with what his \"ideal student\" looked like. Also, we never got our quizzes back, you just accepted what you got wrong and no work was done to really go back and look at why a student didn't perform well.",
                "Professor Dellaporta is an engaging lecturer who would stay after class to answer questions. The homeworks weren't very helpful and the entire class would be just the same without them.",
                "STRENGTHS: \r\n1. Dellaporta posted practice quizzes for his part of the course, which were super helpful (and I highly recommend doing them) \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: \r\n1. Your grade is solely based on the quizzes. Yes, you have Achieve homework and discussion participation, but that is pretty easy to do well in. Therefore, the quizzes are the only thing that matters \r\n2. Quizzes were super hard. For Dellaporta's quizzes, they were harder than anything we covered during class We were doing basic Punnett squares during class but then way harder stuff for the quizzes. However, if you did the practice quizzes you had a much better chance of doing well. For Gendron's quizzes, they were pretty hard AND he didn't post any practice quizzes so it was more difficult to study for. Also, in general they would take like 3 weeks to release grades which was kind of annoying \r\n3. I literally got whiplash from the difference in teaching style from Dellaporta to Gendron \r\n4. Dellaporta is a boring lecturer\r\n5. Gendron is kind of funny during lectures, but also doesn't know how to explain anything. He would rather give out prizes than actually teach the material properly. There were times that he just sped through lectures and would end class like 10 minutes early instead of actually taking his time to explain stuff more clearly",
                "It's a fun and interesting class filled with surprises. One day, a T-rex may even appear in lecture.",
                "I enjoyed the modular format compartmentalized by 6 overall quizzes, with the lowest score dropped accompanied by deeply interesting, engaging lectures. Both Professor Dellaporta and Professor Gendron exude a natural and genuine love for the subject they teach. Weaknesses: Some questions on the quiz seemed to have only the slightest, tangential contact with the lecture.",
                "Strengths were the awesome topics covered, especially appreciated the clinical examples as a pre-med student. Weakness: no feedback during the semester. You can only view your quiz after section and you're not given much guidance on how to improve.",
                "I liked the readings and achieve questions they helped me learn!",
                "weakness is that they switch professors 2/3 of the way through the semester, so right at the end of the class you have to relearn how a prof teaches which is super annoying. Also, you never get your quizzes back so you can't see what you did and did not understand on the assessment.",
                "It could be improved by having less slides material",
                "i loved the content but i did not think the way we were assessed was beneficial for learning and was actually harmful because it was forgotten immediately after the quizzes.",
                "A strength of this course is the Professors. Both Dellaporta and Gendron are super knowledgable and are more than ready to meet with students to go over course content and ideas in genetics beyond what is covered in class. The review sessions before the quizzes could have been a little better organized.",
                "I appreciated how the course was supplemented with Achieve and followed the textbook quite closely. This course could be improved by having more office hours; I found the small time window of office hours quite limiting and a time which conflicted with other classes. I also wish we received quizzes back to help facilitate learning from mistakes.",
                "I love the way the course is taught with readings and reading quizzes on Achieve and with the quizzes and sections during class time.\r\nThe way both Professors teach is also really engaging and made me look forward to go to class every day.",
                "It is a lecture and because of that I think sometimes the information goes in one ear and out the other. I appreciated the weekly quizzes cause it keeps students on their toes.",
                "strengths: the non-cumulative biweekly quizzes- made classes less stressful, put less pressure on me to memorize the information and gave me the chance to actually learn the material; lecture material was really interesting; I really enjoyed having \"discussion sections\" every other week and being able to discuss papers in smaller groups; review sessions led by TAs were super helpful\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the quizzes were unnecessarily tricky at times; there was also a lack of transparency about grades/grade cutoffs; quizzes were never returned to us; some papers we discussed were really dense",
                "The course was very well organized and approachable. The assessments were also not overwhelming and, while challenging, showed understanding of the material.",
                "The structure of this class was amazing.",
                "Amazing MCDB core course; the best one I've ever taken!! The lectures were engaging, the professors were passionate and funny, and the assignments were fair and manageable. And the best part is, you really do learn the material this way rather than in a course where you have to memorize a million little details.",
                "strengths: \r\n- course content was interesting\r\n- instructors were clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about their subject\r\n- instructors created a fairly welcoming class environment\r\n- the fact that the lecture content lined up with the textbook improved the organization of this course\r\n- lecture slides posted before class made it very easy to take notes on the slides \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- sometimes, the pacing felt off. A lot of time was spent on some topics, such as mitosis and meiosis, that were mostly review for most of us, and then complicated and new topics were sped through even though we were expected to fully understand them for the quiz\r\n- the papers were pretty difficult to read, and I often felt like they weren't introduced in class as much as they should have been\r\n- Achieve often felt like busy work, and it often felt like it didn't enhance my understanding of the course material. I feel like making Achieve optional practice and giving some other form of homework (e.g. psets) could have better facilitated student learning, especially given the high cost of Achieve (which can function as a barrier to entry for this course). Also, the fact that the Achieve assignments were non-collaborative made the course a bit isolating, which could potentially be fixed with the introduction of collaborative psets that encourage collaborative problem solving. \r\n- The amount and detail of in-depth knowledge we were expected to memorize in Module 5 on molecular genetics/molecular biology felt a bit out of place and excessive, and felt like it could have been better spent practicing our ability to problem solve in genetics",
                "loved the material. achieve quizzes were useful practice but didn't always carry over into what we were learning in class / what was on the quizzes during section. the paper discussions felt a bit dry, I struggled to be engaged with them even though I really care and am interested in genetics. I loved that there wasn't a final and the emphasis was on learning rather than memorizing. the in class quizzes were really, really hard. I would have appreciated a lot more practice problems and support for prep. I actually quite liked the switch in professors halfway through, I thought they were both great and gave unique interesting perspectives. something I really hope is changed: not being able to see what you got wrong on the quizzes or what the correct answers are. that's kind of a no-brainer for learning - how are we meant to improve if we don't see what our mistakes were????",
                "I like the course format with the biweekly quizzes. I think the course can be improved with more timely grading of the quizzes. The quality of the review sessions also varied greatly depending on which TA was in charge.",
                "STRENGTHS: Dellaporta and Gendron both are clearly very passionate about genetics, and their love for their field is inspiring. WEAKNESSES: I really dislike the multiple-choice quizzes. I think they do not give you a chance to demonstrate your knowledge, especially because there is no partial credit available for thinking through a process (this is possible for free response quizzes). I'd also really like to see what I missed on the quizzes - not passing them back really doesn't make sense to me.",
                "The quizzes are a silly way to test such a vast amount of material that is covered. They are hard (an average of 7ish/11 per quiz), meant to be tricky, and don't reflect my actual understanding of the material. I actually did quite well on some quizzes where I was most confused on the content due to luck.\r\nI liked the 3 lectures + special thursday schedule, though.",
                "One strength of the class is that lectures were recorded, providing students with another way to review information for the quizzes. Another strength was that the information was taught in an engaging way. Professors were amazing. A weakness of this course was the way that discussion was graded. I believe that it was hard to have all of the students engaged during discussion if we ran out of time or if there were little to no opportunities to do more than was required. Another weakness was also that the quizzes frequently had errors, so grading the quizzes and doing the quizzes was complicated.",
                "strength were that I liked the professors and they were engaging and the workload was reasonable and designed to help you understand the material. a weakness might have been the quizzes, they were really difficult and once every other week.",
                "Achieve reading and lecture were teaching the exact same information, which could be viewed as a strength for reinforcing information but if you paid attention in lecture it was often repetitive without added understanding from the lecture portion. The tests were a good way of testing understanding and the papers did build on the lecture material",
                "Strengths: well-organized lecture slides, close-knit class despite large lecture hall, positive atmosphere, clear connections between the lecture and the textbook readings.\r\nWeaknesses: not very clear on expectations for quizzes and not much practice material to use to study for the quizzes.",
                "weaknesses: the grading scheme. It's stressful when your grade heavily relies on such short 11 question quizzes that have poor wording/some questions that are just kind of misleading \"tricky.\"",
                "Loved the format of the six \"modules\" - great lectures, very engaging! One suggestion is that we never got our quizzes back or any feedback of any kind.",
                "strengths - no cumulative exams which helps to go further in depth in the material, professor gendron is amazingly engaging in lecture and brought life to the material!! \r\n\r\nweakness - really strict on attendance and grades, with no exceptions or flexibility",
                "It's a pretty easy course if you've already taken ap bio or the intro to bio sequence and it's so nice that there are no midterms or finals. Just quizzes.",
                "Lectures were sometimes rushed or difficult to follow the professor. Difficult to gage what to know for the quizzes.",
                "It's a great course! I loved taking it this semester! Both professors are very passionate about the subject and engaging. The quizzes are fair, and the workload is very manageable. The material covered is great.",
                "I think the course material is very interesting, and I love that the discussion section is included during class time for the bimonthly quizzes. It makes the class very convenient and easy to fit into your schedule. I don't love that the professors switch halfway through the semester, but I enjoyed both of them and their teaching style.",
                "Weaknesses: I wish there were more opportunities to practice questions. The textbook questions are not helpful because some of them do not have answers.",
                "Strengths: Professors Dellaporta and Gendron, are very active lecturers and try their best to make the course as engaging as possible. The discussion section papers were interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was not designed well to facilitate student learning and engagement. There is way too much material that is attempted to be covered. This is reflected in the six non-cumulative quizzes that make up 50% of your grade and is the only form of assessment. The quizzes are short and multiple choice, which I do not believe are a very fair and effective way to assess student learning. Professor Gendron's reasoning for why they were multiple choice and not short answer is because it would be too much work for the TAs which such a big class which I, again, don't think is very fair, considering each TA only has ~15 students and there's only 6 quizzes the whole semester. The quizzes were difficult. There were more than one occasion where I had a question about a quiz question and my TA did not understand it either. \r\n\r\n I also dislike that there were no cumulative midterm or exam, encouraging students to just memorize the information simply for the quiz and forget it afterwards because most of the content is not revisited again. \r\nThere is way too much content on Professor Dellaporta's lecture slides, which make the lectures difficult to follow along with. Lectures often times seemed pointless because all the information could be better learned from simply reading the slides after that fact at your own pace. Professor Gendron's lecture slides were a little all over the place, but I thought he did a better job of actually engaging with the content and not just reading off the slides.  In the early modules, the Achieve homework does not align with the lectures at all, so they are not helpful. The course should be scaled down so that instead of glossing over a bunch of concepts, the main important ones are focused on and really engaged with. \r\n\r\nOverall, I was fairly disappointed with this course, which was upsetting considering how interesting and important genetics is. I think it needs to be wholly redesigned and student input needs to be consulted as well as employing a  basic understanding of useful and effective teaching and lecturing practices",
                "I really liked the small quiz system: rather than have one big exam, many small quizzes focused on the units covered since the previous one were administered throughout the semester, which in my opinion helped reduce stress. Additionally, I liked the textbook system for this course. Yes, I normally prefer physical textbooks since I learn better with a physical medium, but the teacher chose the online system specifically to reduce the costs on the students knowing well that textbook companies scam students and set high prices for books. This online textbook system was efficient and helpful.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that the course lectures were often very fast. Nowadays biology professors use lecture slides and post the slides online, expecting students to have laptops or tablets to download the slides and then simply annotate on the sides. I however prefer hand-written notes since i writing stuff during classes helps me remember in the long-term. However, because the course was taught with lecture slides, the professors would often go too quickly for me to take notes, even on basic topics of importance, and partway through I just stopped and read the slides during the course and afterwards since my notes became patchy and hard to follow. Thus, I would suggest slightly reducing the amount of content per lecture so that each slide can be fully explored and discussed. This way, students could have the time necessary to take good notes and follow along more fully with the course.",
                "Strength: really appreciate the paper discussion on the special Thursdayit provides more useful skills for those not quite interested in genetics a way to improve themselves. The discussion both in class and in discussion are appropriately in depth and all teachers and TAs are helpful and responsive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe sometime Prof Dellaporta treat some knowledge in lecture too quickly.

                "If you are MCDB looking for a core class, this is not my favorite one, but it's good enough. Cell bio is harder but you will learn way more, and microbiology has midterms but it's so much fun. There is some overlap with biochemistry, which is nice. Overall, a decent class if you have good quiz skills and are good at semi-hard multiple choice questions.",
                "If you have to take an MCDB ~200 requirement, this is not a bad option. If you're just looking for a science credit, this also isn't bad to combine with other harder courses in your courseload.",
                "Sure if youre interested in genetics",
                "Yes, it's not a lot of work, but it's really boring, the material is a repeat of the bio sequence, and you won't get good feedback. While all of that is true, the course is super light so I still recommend it.",
                "Yes. Anyone interested in entering a field related to genetics (medical, science, agriculture) would love this course.",
                "NO. Based on past reviews, I thought this would be a gut class, but it is not. Your grade is essentially just based on the 6 quizzes throughout the semester because getting good scores on Achieve and discussion participation is pretty easy to do. The quizzes are challenging, especially at the beginning when you have no idea what to expect, and the questions are much harder than what is covered during lecture. The average on the quizzes is between 7-8 out of 11 and they are all multiple choice, meaning there is no partial credit. \r\n\r\nA note on the teaching: I wouldn't say that Dellaporta and Gendron are particularly good at teaching. Dellaporta is a pretty boring lecturer but honestly I preferred him over Gendron. Gendron was easygoing, but seemed to enjoy having fun over explaining the material. I wouldn't have a problem with him if he actually could teach well, but he would just speed through the material and not explain concepts in depth.\r\n\r\nI think this might be a required class for some bio majors (like MCDB), so if you have to take the class then there's really no option. However, if you are thinking of taking the class for fun, I would not recommend doing so.",
                "Definitely a great foundational MCDB course to take for those looking to continue in the major.",
                "Definitely would recommend if you're interested in genetics! Deeper dive than 103 and you explore a huge range of topics.",
                "absolutely yes to any stem majors!",
                "Yes",
                "content wise absolutely. for professor gendron absolutely. otherwise no.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Both professors were great and I learned a lot. The biweekly quizzes kept the content from becoming overwhelming, and nothing was cumulative. All of the homework assignments are graded on completion, so it was nice to do them purely for the sake of learning. The content is very interesting and I looked forward to attending this class every day. Would highly recommend! I would say that a basic foundation in biology is very helpful.",
                "For an MCDB requirement, yes. Otherwise, no.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student, especially if they are interested in genetics or are looking for an engaging MCDB core course.",
                "Don't take it unless you have to",
                "I would. If you put in the effort to pay attention to learn the content during lectures and reading the assigned chapters you learn a lot of very interesting information.",
                "Yes! I think it's a great option for a core class if you're an MCDB major, or if you're interested in this topic.",
                "Yes, the material was interesting and the workload was manageable",
                "The topics covered in this course are very interesting and engaging. The workload is low, and since the assessments are only quizzes every 2 weeks, we do not have to memorize an absurd amount of information. However, the quizzes are extremely tricky and tough.",
                "I would recommend this to a student who wants to gain a broad understanding of the field of genetics. Do be aware that you will be expected to memorize a LOT of information if you want to do well on the quizzes, not all of which seems to be particularly helpful to know. The peer tutors in this class were a hidden gem, and I really suggest that you go to them for help. However, if you want to take a genetics class primarily to enhance your problem-solving skills in the context of biology, this is probably not the class for you.",
                "No. The material can be confusing and the grading system is not reflective of student learning. Very ambiguous.",
                "absolutely yes, if you're interested in genetics. low workload, cool professors, no final exam, not that hard to get a good grade.",
                "Yes, solid MCDB core",
                "This is one of the easier MCDB core classes, so it's a good idea for MCDB majors. If you're interested in doing research in genetics, this is also a good course. Honestly though, if you took MCDB 205 cell biology, there isn't a ton of new information (since cell bio is very thorough and well taught).",
                "Not really unless other courses that fulfill your biology core are not being offered.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the knowledge provided has the potential to be very interesting to other people, especially  because it is taught relatively well.",
                "yeah if it's required or if you have a particular interest in genetics.",
                "Yes, not too intensive but taught what it needed to",
                "Absolutely! I had a positive experience in this class overall. The professors made sure that everyone was following along with the material presented in class and the readings were very much manageable.",
                "Yes - a fun and very manageable biology class. The material is also super interesting",
                "Yes, but please note that this class is not an easy MCDB class. The quizzes are hard and take a lot of time to study for.",
                "I would! It was a great MCDB course.",
                "i would recommend this course if it was required for a major etc or if there is a vested interest in genetics",
                "Yes. Easy class with low workload and I liked the professors.",
                "Yes, if this is a required course or you are very interested in genetics and developmental biology.",
                "Yes!! One of the best MCDB core classes Yale offers",
                "Yes! This is a great course! Definitely recommend it for an MCDB core and a great class for people in any major to be honest. I enjoyed it a lot!",
                "Yes! This is a great option if you're looking for an MCDB course. There's a low workload, and the only grades you really have to worry about are the discussion sections and quizzes every two weeks. The quizzes can be stressful, but going to the review session the night before helped me.",
                "Yes/No. I would only recommend this course to those who are interested in genetics and have great multiple choice test taking skills.",
                "No. There are so many better MCDB courses offered to fulfill the core major requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in genetics. This gives a full overview of the history of genetics, and the various experiments and breakthroughs that have given us the insights we now have today. We learn the structure of DNA and the genetic code, the various modes of inheritance and analyzing patterns in inheritance, quantitative methods for analyzing genetic patterns and trends, epigenetics (which is a beast of its own), and everything from the genetics of a single cell to whole populations. This was a very informative course and the professors were always positive and were willing to stay and talk with students more about the subject.",
