I learned the history of investigative journalism which begins with Benjamin Bache covering a expose about George Washington's lavish spending, I learn about the importance to write every day to increase your ability in the craft, I learned about public documents and how regular citizens have the right to access these public documents (Which is perhaps different in Indonesia, I have to check), how we can learn about a person's entire life just by viewing their public documents, and many more pertaining to the craft and ethics of the journalistic occupation.",
