Taking economics as a whole definitely helps you think more rationally, in terms of opportunity costs and things like that.

                "The course was very intense over the summer, but this is just an inevitable result of the compressed timeline. Tolga was a phenomenal professor and the course was well-structured.",
                "The strengths of this class are that the expectations are laid out for you very clearly. The problem sets are straightforward and there are office hours for all of them. If you understand these and go to all of the review sessions, you should do well on the exams too. The biggest weakness is the sheer amount of work required for each class. There are both readings and lecture videos on top of the 2 hour classes, and it kinda ended up taking up my whole life.  Also, the live sessions tend to be a bit rushed, plus redundant after having watching the videos and doing the readings.",
                "could be improved with additional activities in class to get everyone more involved. strength was that the content across lectures, homework, and exams was consistent and fair",
                "Much of what was covered in the lecture was stated again during section, making the section not as useful at times. I think that rather than doing a repeat of the lectures, going over problems and examples building on top of what we learned from the lectures would be more useful.",
                "The weaknesses of this course are definitely how fast it is. It's only 5 weeks and the entire semester is crammed in there. It was a total of 10 days of class, but because of the exams, we really only received 8 days of instruction so there was a lot of independent studying. Honestly, this class should be restricted to people who have an econ backgroundat least for this 5 week summer course.",
                "Strenghts: interesting material that is important to understanding the world, Prof. Koker is a very genuine, likeable guy who is always willing to help students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course moves too fast and students need to spend extensive out-of-class time digesting material, synchronous lectures do not help a lot as they cover the material superficially (%95 of learning is done watching recorded lectures and reading the textbook). Unfortunately, even though Prof. Koker is a great guy, he spends a large portion of class time going on unrelated tangents, which makes the situation worse. There are way too few office hour sessions hosted weekly (for comparison, classes running in the fall or spring generally have 3-4 office hour sessions\/week. This summer class, which moves about 2.5x times faster, has only 1 office hour session for week, which lasts only an hour). \r\n\r\nHow it could be improved: \r\n\r\n1. My suggestion would be to have slides with the necessary topics as well as graphs, figures, etc. prepared in advance for the synchronous lectures, so that no time is wasted drawing them, and so that the material flows in a cohesive way. This would also help reduce Prof. Koker from being sidetracked, because we would know that we have to finish all the slides by the end of lecture. \r\n\r\n2. Increase the number of office hour sessions to 3 sessions\/week.",
                "strengths: having more support in order to understand any and all concepts.",
                "The course was very thorough, with lots of content crammed into just five weeks-- I felt like I learned a lot, but it sometimes felt like too much to adequately wrap my mind around in time for the exams. Overall I enjoyed the course, and the Professor was often able to tie the theory back to pertinent real-life examples.",
                "I think the textbook assigned was really great and that both the homework and test matched wonderfully with what was taught. My main complaint is that the course could feel a bit redundant between the textbook, the online lectures, and the synchronous zoom classes  much of the content, particularly for the online lectures and zoom classes, was repeated."

If you don't have one of those (unfortunately I had neither) this class will be hell for you. The workload is also extremely high. There are a minimum of 4 psets you have to do over the term, with a midterm and a final. In addition to having to watch approximately 3-6 hours of lectures a week, with live classes as well. It's a lot. I do not recommend this class to anyone who is only slightly interested in econ or thinks this will be an easy class. If you are not good at math or econ, this class will be work.",
                "Yes, because you'll learn a lot of things that are important in other fields too.",
