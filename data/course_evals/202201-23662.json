                "I learned about Ancient Greek art and close looking at objects.",
                "The professor focused a lot on developing writing skills-- both specifically for writing about art history but also more generally. She gave specific feedback to each essay as well as discussing broader advice for the class as a whole that definitely improved my writing over the course of the class. \r\nIn the topic area, we covered wide ranging discussions about the uses and roles of sanctuaries in Ancient Greece in a variety of roles-- how they were used to understand healing, their role in ancient politics, etc.",
                "This class really emphasized how much information you can get out of just looking at an object. I remember at the beginning of the semester, we had an assignment that was to look at an object and describe it. I was only able, at the time, to describe the physical aspects of the object. This class really strongly developed the analysis component, which is a really particular skill that is hard to hone or develop in any way other than focused practice. This class was really fun and I will definitely take the ability to draw complex conclusions from simple observations away from it.",
                "I gained very important skills in how to observe and describe ancient artifacts, and how to gather information based strictly on ones observations. There was a lot of really helpful feedback on how to write. I developed a lot of insight on various sanctuaries of the ancient Greek world, how they functioned, what their role was for the people who valued them, and how they are thought about (sometimes wrongfully) in western academia. In general, I also gained valuable insight into how the ancient Greek world operated and into how it is constructed in academia and the western imaginary.",
                "I learned how to write an art analysis paper, and I generally broadened my view of how to look at and interpret art and art interpretations as well as learning so much about Ancient Greek art itself!",
                "I learned SO much. Professor Gunnarsdottir is so incredibly knowledgeable about Ancient Greek art and approaches to evaluating art in general. I learned how to visually analyze pieces of art, parse through academic literature on the subject, and develop novel theses based on evidence. I also gained a newfound appreciation for the field of art history and an excitement about art in general I didnt have before.",
                "I learned how to describe an object with greater precision and insight. I learned which conclusions one can draw from an object and which are imposed by external biases. I got a sense of the scholarship on Anciemt Greek Sanctuary art.",
                "I developed my public speaking, close reading, close looking, critical thinking, and essay writing skills. I also studied a wide survey of scholarship on sanctuaries and Archaic Greece which I think will be immediately beneficial to my future work in Classics.",
                "I really improved my art analytical skills in this class, which was my goal! I learned a lot about ancient Greek sanctuaries, and the experiences of worshippers and rituals in the ancient Mediterranean."

            "comments": [
                "Very few weaknesses-- the reading load was high but all the readings were extremely interesting and relevant, plus tailored to what the class wanted to discuss. The strengths were definitely the professor-- Soffia was extremely good, very responsive, and lead excellent in class discussions. The topic material was also interesting and wide enough that many people could find their own niches within it.",
                "This course was pretty much perfect. It had a really strong blend of demonstrating art historical techniques (Soffia was very, very good at pointing out possible interpretations of different aspects of whatever object we were looking at), a chill atmosphere, interesting and enriching readings, and plenty of opportunities for us students to engage the skills and the material ourselves.",
                "The strengths: all the readings for each week were all carefully chosen, very relevant and formed a strongly coherent theme that really enhances ones understanding of the topic. The assignments were also carefully designed and worked to introduce students to a specific type of academic writing and then guide them to improve in the area. The course is very discussion based and this allows people to formulate ideas in real time.\r\nUpon further reflection, I genuinely dont think there are any weaknesses. I do think the small class size is a part of the courses strength and think that should be kept in the future.",
                "This course was really amazing! I loved the small seminar format, the class participation, and the readings. I wish that it met for slightly shorter during more days of the week so that the readings were spaced out a little bit.",
                "Strengths: everything! The readings were so well selected and I was so engaged during class time thanks to well-guided discussion and excellently prepared slides. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the 9am slot and the fact that it only met once a week. A twice weekly seminar wouldve been great.",
                "Strengths: It is well organized and interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Too much reading.",
                "The strength of this class was that there was so much to discuss each week about magic and spectacle in Greek sanctuaries. I think the class had a nice format with student-led discussions each week and slideshows from Soffia. However, we spent each week devoted to one topic and never finished a single slideshow, so I wish we had more time to dive into some of the topics or had some topics removed to give more space to others."

                "Yes! This was a great class, well worth waking up for a Friday 9:25.",
                "Absolutely. If this course is offered, take it! It is enriching and loads of fun without being too strenuous or stressful work-wise. Once you get into the rhythm of the class, there are plenty of ways for you to engage with the material in ways that you in particular find interesting. One of the best parts of this class was that no two people would come into class with the same reaction to a reading or to an object, leading to really fascinating and fun discussions! Also, Soffia was an excellent and empathetic professor who has a knack for making everyone feel like their contributions are wanted and helpful in the classroom space. I would 100% take this class again and highly recommend that anyone who has the opportunity to take this class do so.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in any aspect of the topic it covers. It is an intellectually challenging course and I think will be beneficial to any students taking it.\r\nAlso, I would recommend everyone to take a course with professor Gunnarsdottir if possible. She is very invested in the topic itself and the teaching process. The course is very well designed and she cares a lot about her students.",
                "I would one hundred percent recommend this course to other students; it was awesome!",
                "Yes. We received so much timely and clear feedback on our work and I could see myself improving in visual analysis as the assignments went on. It was also just so incredibly exciting and we got to look at and talk about beautiful things!",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to art history and to ancient Greek religion.",
                "Yes! Professor Gunnarsdottir led great weekly discussions and the syllabus was excellent.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was a really fun experience, and this class was a gut. I learned so much about ancient Greek sanctuaries and festivals, so if you are interested in that, you'll have a great time! Plus, the assignments were all interesting. We spent a lot of time analyzing artifacts, but also wrote our own miracle inscriptions and could do any final project you were interested in after talking to Soffia!"
