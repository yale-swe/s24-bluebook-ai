There are two many questions that let use doing repeating work, it's quite tortured when you need to repeat a algorithm 10 times by drawing plots or images like hash tables/B tree etc. Also, questions are ambiguous and TA's answers are wrong sometime, and TAs can't really make them clear and correct.",

There are so many mistakes in psets and solutions, the TAs often release multiple versions of each pset because of corrections are needed.
