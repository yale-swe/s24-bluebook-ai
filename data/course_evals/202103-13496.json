Most importantly, this class helped me to learn how to question the authors I read and my own assumptions. Ultimately, this class helped me to see issues from a variety of lenses I've never considered."

                "Some of the readings were quite interesting, but honestly not worth reading all of them. At most, multiple readings assigned for a class are only discussed for 20-30 min. Summaries were enough to get by. The class discussions didn't go in too deep and the professor did not guide the discussions. It all relied on the students. Also, both papers were not given a prompt or any sort of guidance in writing. I do not suggest this to be one of your first classes at Yale as it does not give support in showing what Yale quality writing is.",
                "Strengths: Dialogue was engaging; I felt included the conversation and that I could experiment with my ideas in front of my teacher and peers who wanted to help me; the professor asked us very interesting questions and provided us with the theory and historical perspective necessary to come to our own conclusions; the professor offered very strong feedback on papers and provided ways to make our arguments stronger\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there was so much reading assignments, we had to skim over very critical material and left out important essays i.e. The Fire Next Time; a possible way to improve this is by limiting the amount of readings due per class to really hone in on that one material"

Additionally, it provided so much valuable theoretical knowledge in one course, allowing students to identify their favorite interests to pursue them later."
