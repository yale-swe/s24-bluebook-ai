These include Euler's method, backward Euler, adaptive step size, runge kutta of various orders, predictor-corrector methods, finite difference approximations to ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical stability, the shooting method, backward shooting, solving tridiagonal matrix equations, using Newton's method to solve matrix equations, adaptive gridding with fixed and variable number of points, how to compute local discretization error for PDEs, FTCS method, CTCS method, Dufort-Frankel method, Crank-Nicolson method, theta method, consistency, convergence, stability, Fourier stability analysis, matrix stability analysis, continuum and numerical domains of dependence, point Jacobi, point Gauss-Seidel, line Jacobi, line Gauss-Seidel, ADI, pseudo-transient continuation.",
                "I learned several methods, both explicit and implicit, to find numerical solutions of linear and non-linear IVPS and BVPS for both ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as characterizing linear systems seen in these methods. The methods studied include Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, \"shooting\" methods, and finite difference methods. I also learned how to perform stability (multistep, matrix, and Fourier) and cost analyses of these methods as well.",

                "Super well taught and goes the right amount of depth into each topic.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett is very good at breaking down complicated concepts in numerical methods into bite-sized pieces that are easier to digest. She teaches at just the right pace to make sure you understand everything on both a conceptual and detailed level. She is also very friendly and was always happy to answer my questions after class and through e-mail. I always left class feeling like I had learned something new. It is not easy to teach a technical subject like numerical methods in a way that keeps students engaged, but Professor Bennett does such an excellent job making sure you understand the concepts that the details just fill themselves in naturally.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the homework problems felt like busywork, particularly those that involved writing out long backward difference formulas and several Taylor series from scratch, some of which were tedious because they were second order. I did not feel that doing these gave me any new insights.",
                "Strengths: as previous reviews of this class has said, this is Professor Bennett's brainchild and what feels like the culmination of my knowledge of ODE/PDEs as a mechanical engineering major. As per usual with classes taught by Professor Bennett, the lectures, though sometimes dry, are extremely straightforward and informational. The workload and effort needed to really process the course content is HIGH, but there's a lot of help available outside of lectures like office hours and Professor Bennett's very quick email replies. The course organization should be the golden standard for all classes. Though many hours were spent per week toward getting through the assignments, I truly felt like I learned so much. \r\nWeaknesses: Some psets required trudging through a lot of dense math and derivations, which felt a bit excessive at times and more like algebra drills than applying numerical methods. The later psets were also weighted less than the first few, though they took arguably more effort to finish. Beyond that though, Prof Bennett has taught this class for a long time and the experience shows.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett's teaching, organization, psets are well-written and you learn from them. No weaknesses, but I'd say the psets often took around 10 hours, so the course is time-consuming, and the work each week is usually concentrated in the couple of days before the pset is due.",
                "The course was very well structured and carried out in a very organized fashion. I remember there was one lecture that did not record properly due to a technical difficulty. The first twenty minutes of the lecture were missing or so. To cover up for this, the instructor uploaded the recorded lecture from the previous semester, specified exactly which minutes correspond to the missing content. I felt this was an extra-ordinary attention to detail in making sure the course content is communicated properly. Greatly appreciated.",

                "Definitely if you like math and coding! Professor Bennett is also an amazing professor.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this course under Professor Bennett. I had never encountered any numerical methods before this semester, which is why I was fortunate to become exposed to them under her instruction. Professor Bennett is a very good instructor, and very helpful when you do not understand something. Out of all my courses this semester, I felt most engaged with this course because I could tell that she cares about her students' learning.",
                "The bottom line is, if you're willing to put in the time and effort for this class, you will learn SO much about numerical methods, starting from simple methods like Euler's method, and going all the way to finite differences, along with learning the computational cost and analyzing different aspects of each method. You will also extensively use the coding language you choose to use for this class (common choice is matlab). This class is time-consuming, the concepts are honestly fairly straightforward but there's a lot of concepts, the psets and exams are long, but if you put in the time and do everything what's expected of you, you will make it through and feel so accomplished at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes. The course is great because Professor Bennett teaches it, and the material is interesting. Just be prepared to make the time commitment to get the psets done",
                "Yes. The course started with the very basic Euler's method and walked students through to finally end with topics of finite difference methods. This is a great leap achieved in one course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students looking to learn the skills I learned. Mostly because I thought the instructor was excellent and was very organized and readily available to answer questions."
