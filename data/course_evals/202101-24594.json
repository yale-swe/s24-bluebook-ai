                "It allows for creative freedom. \r\nHowever, it would be nice if we actually workshopped different techniques for those who are truly new to painting. I enjoyed my independent practice but would have appreciated some more in-depth lessons about how to create certain effects in my work.",
                "This is a great class. It was challenging over zoom, but the overall format of painting a lot every week and learning about watercolor artists is well-conceived. In a normal year, it would be an absolute delight!",
                "The majority of the weaknesses of the course are truly only due to the virtual format. I would have appreciated more specific pointers on my paintings-in-progress during class and office hours, but such a specific level of feedback is impossible when the Professor Van Doren could not physically be with us while we were painting to observe technique, and showing pieces on camera over zoom led to far more misinterpretation than anything else. One thing that future students could find valuable moving forward would be for Professor Van Doren to keep a running list of 3-5 students per week to summon to office hours, to ensure that everyone is attending regularly or semi-regularly, because I think it was easy for some people to allow this course to fall by the wayside while taking other (more demanding) courses.\r\n\r\nOne weakness moving forward that it would be excellent to improve upon would be to do more of a \"this is basic watercolor technique\" in the first/second classes. Not just \"look at how this artist does it\" but something as elementary as \"this is how you hold a brush, this is how you apply the water to the paper, this is how you apply the pigment to the paper, this is how you fill your palette\"",
                "Great class, very much a class about what it is supposed to be about. Never felt like \"why am I doing this?\" or \"I didn't sign up for this.\" Kinda fun, too.",
                "the variety and diversity of artists covered was electrifying. I never expected to be exposed to so much and so many styles. From the way they used color, light, shadow, and the brush, to even the way they *saw*, I learned so much from this portfolio of watercolor masters. I loved Prof van doren's style of teaching. he's so witty, fun, and patient. He never is harsh and he always encourages you to explore and try the weirdest things. this is the best way to learn. Even if you're used to painting and drawing, like myself, his teaching style opens you up to new avenues of exploration",
                "This class was nothing but strengths. The professor was always available to meet with students, always gave helpful suggestions and critique, and provided the space for us to develop our own creativity and skills."

This class is one of very few offered by yale where students come away thinking, \"I can...\" or \"I experienced...\" in addition to \"I know...\" or \"I think.\"",
                "This was a fabulous and enriching course. I learned so much about myself through the process of making off-the-cuff artistic decisions, of picking up the brush every week and just painting without as much planning as I'm used to in my oil paints. I learned to be more discerning with my details and artistic choices because of the nature of the medium. Watercolor is ultimately about confidence, and panache.
