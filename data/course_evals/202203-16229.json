                "Weaknesses: \r\n1. Unrealistic theoretical workload \r\n2. Expensive required course materials (booklet that is produced by the French department yet you have to pay for nonetheless)\r\n3. Lingco is used for the tests. For some reason, there was a lot of technical issues with seeing your marked tests making it difficult for you to see where you went wrong and learn from your mistakes etc.",
                "Evaluations are much too difficult.",
                "This class was beneficial because it met every day and forced me to speak French every day for close to an hour.  This type of repetition kept my French sharp and allowed it to be improved.  While helpful, the daily homework was a bit outdated and often boring.",
                "Weakness: I honestly felt that at times the format of the tests was working against the students and did not allow for actual evaluation of our skills. Many parts of the audio and listening sections were hard to hear\/not at all at the level that was being discussed in class.  Having every single evaluation in the course be online, just to have the final be in person made no sense to me. I liked how in FRench 120 there was a combination of the two, and felt that only having the assessments be virtual was so terrible for someone who understood after the 2\/3 test that virtual testing was not conducive to the way we learned material in class\/studied. Also the course packet instruction was helpful in that most of it felt like review, but not so much when new topics are introduced and there is a level of expectation to already know it\/just copy down what the audio says is the correct answer. There really isn't a set place where grammar rules\/verbiage for this specific level can be located, so I honestly found myself using outside sources to aide in my understanding of the material. I don't think that this is necessarily the professor's fault, but the fault of the structure of the class in general as far as what materials we are given\/are supposed to follow.",
                "I think that the Biweekly testing schedule was better than the weekly schedule I was used to in L1 and L2. I enjoyed classes, especially discussing the texts we read."

If this is a student's first French course at Yale, I would highly recommend it because it got me speaking from the very beginning and interacting with French on a daily basis.",
                "Not unless this fulfills the language requirement as this is the only reason I took the class.",
                "If they want to learn French, yes. However, if you are not proficient, you have to be very dedicated."
