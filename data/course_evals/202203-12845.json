In particular, this course focused on the development of airpower capabilities and the use of airpower in conflicts from WW2 to Kosovo, to the Gulf War, to Vietnam, contrasting the ways in which airpower was used and the role its use played in the conflict's result.",

                "Strengths -- very engaging and collaborative \r\nWeaknesses -- relied on prior information that I found difficult to follow considering that I am not in the ROTC program.",
                "I am a bit frustrated because much of the material is very similar to the Paul Kennedy course. For the ROTC cadets, who are the majority of the class and are required to take it, many of us are left wondering when we're going to learn the important information we need to know for starting active duty. Last year, the 400s learned all the practical things they needed to know, like different scenarios with enlisted people, forms and awards, how to navigate activity duty finances, bases, etc. Are we just not going to learn that stuff? I thought it was part of the curriculum. To me, that is much more important than learning about WWII bombing, again. \r\n\r\nI am also unhappy with AS class now being for credit. I don't have room in my schedule to take a class that is not really that relevant to active duty life (compared to, e.g. AS300 or 200 class). The class being for credit takes away time for things that are actually important to my course of study. And, because it is so repetitive, it is even more frustrating. \r\n\r\nI would very much prefer to just learn the practical information I was supposed to learn before starting active duty rather than having a class that adds more work and takes away from my focus on my actual degree. Especially because the majority of the content was already covered in previous years.",
                "This course is extremely well-organized, allowing students to get an overview of the use of airpower in a given conflict each week through both background reading and the weekly class, which consists of both instructor-led and student-led discussions. Students can then specialize in the conflict or topic most interesting to them by choosing to lead the respective week's discussion or by writing their paper about it. The exams focus primarily on the themes of the course; as a result, they encourage students to synthesize what they've learned from the course to write about a given topic, rather than focusing on rote memorization of random facts and dates. Overall, this course does an excellent job of helping students understand the role of air and space power in both shaping American grand strategy and setting the world order.",
                "The class presentations were a nice boost in engagement and a good opportunity to collaborate.  \r\n\r\nThe paper was somewhat annoying, the prompt was straightforward but I had to stretch for a few pages to meet the word count requirement. \r\n\r\nThrough this class, I actually became kind of disheartened about the USAF  specifically our motives and efficacy. This is probably the point, a millitary needs to constantly be under self-examination and correction. But just a few months away from commissioning, the study of our repeated failures as a force was enough to give me pause.",
                "Consider divorcing the material somewhat from that covered in Military History of the West since 1500. It felt like much of this class was a retread of that material, albeit with a slightly more air force focus.",
                "Strengths: Col. Granholm was an excellent instructor who loves the topic and is eager and prepared to help his students learn about airpower too. The other students in the class are also a plus it was a very friendly and fun atmosphere, which is shocking for a 925am course. The material is absolutely fascinating, and the readings are interesting without being too difficult to parse. Col. Granholm also did a great job of planning out the assignments, as there was a reasonable amount of work, but assignments never piled up onto each other so it didn't feel overwhelming in the slightest.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Genuinely none.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot despite the small workload, fantastic instruction, interesting class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: No weaknesses. Take this class."

                "Probably required if you're AFROTC, but also could be a good GLBL elective.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in military history, defense policy, or US foreign policy in general. While it is a ROTC course, I had a blast as a non-ROTC participant and learned a ton that I found very applicable to my interests. It was a great atmosphere to learn in, and had a great ratio of interesting material learned to work required. The class is perfect for people who want to learn about the military, directly from the military, and have a good time while doing so.",
                "Yes -- I loved this course! The course is very well-organized for student learning: It takes a few core concepts/themes and explores them through readings, papers, presentations, and class discussion. Unlike most courses at Yale, I will remember the information taught to me. Moreover, because the class was USAF, the philosophical debates surrounding air power carried actual gravity (pun intended). Class discussion was highly engaging because these big ideas were concretely applicable. As one of the non-ROTC class members, I loved leeching off the wisdom of my classmates/friends. The course load was very manageable, Colonel Granholm's professional-but-approachable style created a collaborative discussion environment. All assessments were geared toward sharpening and re-iterating main ideas."
