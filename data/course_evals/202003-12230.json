The group project was fun because we were able to research in depth a topic of our interest related to some aspect of early childhood. The guest lectures were also informative and engaging. However, I wish we had a little more direction on the project.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot in this course both in lecture and during your observations. It is a very unique experience to watch yourself develop as an observer and being able to apply concepts you learn during lecture to your observations of children.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lack of clarity in the course. There is very little direction given in assignments and you can still be penalized despite this not being clear.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. My one suggestion would be just to make sure to have some time at the end to go into breakout rooms, or maybe even have this in the middle of the lecture just to break up the material a little bit. I don't think this was the fault of the instructors, 2 hours is just a long time to be focusing on zoom.",
                "The design to do child observations is great. I learned a lot by doing the readings, but the lectures sometimes went a little long. The glad might benefit from a more seminar style.",
                "Strengths: diverse and engaging guest lecturers covered racial inequity in the classrooms, universal preschool, language development, etc. Workload is extremely manageable. Weaknesses: assignment directions not always clear."
