                "Strengths: Professor is very helpful and kind. TF's are super helpful as well. Readings can be interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Can become very burdensome along with other intensive classes. Must have a good writing background and some experience in philosophy to do super well, otherwise its very challenging material. Sometimes can feel like no matter how hard you're trying on the papers, it's to no avail.",
                "Only strengths. Professor Inwood is amazing and genuinely made me want to get up and attend live lectures, even on zoom. He's super kind and so knowledgeable. Also, our TF Austen Hall was amazing. He made discussions very interesting and was super helpful in giving guidance towards me essays.",
                "Strengths: Professor Inwood is an excellent lecturer, and the discussion sections were fruitful. The readings were very interesting. The prompts were thought-provoking, and the process of writing philosophy essays was rewarding\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The content and readings were very interesting, but the lectures sometimes lost my attention. I think in a classroom setting this style lecture would have been fine, but online it was a bit tedious.",
                "Professor Inwood is so knowledgable and is an amazingly engaging lecturer. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to him, even though this class was super early for me with the time difference. My TA was also very good; she gave us a lot of support and was always available to help. Some weaknesses are that, for a WR credit, there are not a lot of ways to get real writing practice besides the actual papers. This is hard because you can't practice the writing in a low-stakes environment. Also, there are some weird and unclear guidelines on peer reviewing, TAs reading drafts, etc. that are inconsistent amongst TAs. If this course is a writing course, then I think that TAs ought to be much more willing to read drafts (my TA wasn't) and would allow people to peer review (which, for some of the time, it wasn't).",
                "The weakness of the course is that we cover too much content in a short amount of time but I guess that can't be changed.",
                "The strengths are definitely the papers, the topics were thought provoking and fun! Lecture was okay, mostly a run through of the assigned reading which was helpful because even if you read it is still hard to fully understand. Section was also good though honestly too short. The greatest strength was my TA, Moya, she really cares about our learning and put in a ton of working reading our drafts and then final drafts! The weakness was probably that there were one or two weeks with a lot of reading and some with barely any so perhaps a more even spread would have been nicer.",
                "Professor Inwood is amazing. He really cares a lot about the subject and that makes the lectures fun. He does a great job giving an explanation of the texts during lecture along with extra information about the texts that is helpful or interesting. The grading scheme is very helpful -- the worst paper has the lowest percentage of the overall grade, the best has the highest, etc. -- as this helps provide some flexibility that encourages students to not be discouraged or worried about writing the first paper for the course -- the first assignment for any course is always worrisome. The grading on the papers is fair as well. No weaknesses.",
                "This course's lectures were very beneficial to understanding and analyzing the readings; however, they often were just summaries. We covered a lot of philosophers, so we didn't go super in-depth on anyone besides Aristotle and Plato. The course didn't really emphasize thinking philosophically. It was also difficult getting accustomed to writing the papers. Regardless, Professor Inwood was an incredible instructor who was very knowledgeable about all of the ancient works we covered throughout the semester.",
                "Good lectures; hard to parse through some of the readings and interpret them correctly",
                "This course has very strong lectures and discussion sections. The discussion of the material was very high quality. However, I wish there was more emphasis on the importance of the ideas with regard to a historical lens.",
                "weakness: too few assignments to stay very engaged; strengths: amazing professor and TAs!",
                "The course was well-organized and the readings were interesting, but the topics near the end of the course (Stoicism and Skepticism) seemed a bit more rushed than previous topics.",
                "The course contains very interesting content; however, some works, such has the Republic and Phaedo are covered so quickly it is difficult to get a real grasp of the work. I understand this is the pitfall of a survey course, but I would have preferred either more depth in some of these works or less reading in something like the Republic because it makes the work seem more confusing and transient than it really is.",
                "The lectures were pretty dry and easy to zone out of. However, the reading was very manageable and the essays were fun to write. Excellent teaching fellows too.",
                "As much as I like being able to go to lecture, take little to no notes, barely do the readings, and then read just enough to write the essays, I feel like I would be more engaged with the class if it included reading quizzes or concept tests. \r\n\r\nAlso it would be great if we were actually taught *how* to write philosophy essays, especially since we are expected to know how to write proper philosophy essays from the beginning and are graded accordingly. We spent maybe one discussion section going over how to write intro paragraphs and that was it! Everything else about how to write must be extrapolated from minimal feedback on papers.",
                "The course was well facilitated and all the teaching staff was very helpful",
                "This course's strengths definitely were the lectures that Professor Inwood provided discussing the readings. After sometimes being puzzled by the readings, Professor Inwood did a good job of clearing up our questions and giving summaries and explanations that cemented our learning."

                "Yes, I would actually recommend this class to people regardless of major because I think it gives you a great background of ancient Greek philosophy. This course focuses more on breadth than depth, which is good in an introduction level course. The papers increase in difficulty, which is good because it challenges you. I will say that this course might be a tad difficult for people who have never written philoosphy papers before because there isn't the best support for learning how to write papers.",

At first, I was thrown off by the presocratics but I over time stuff started coming together and it became really fun to understand and analyze. The papers are also fun to write even as a STEM major who has only taken one writing credit two years ago. My TA was super supportive and gave us plenty of resources so that I really knew how to write a philosophy paper my first time. The material is also super interesting and challenges you to think deeper about politics and life.",
                "Absolutely! Although the material is, well, ancient, the course is super interesting and will make you a better thinker. It really makes you appreciate philosophy and there will be some philosopher's argument in the course that you will probably find super interesting to learn about. Professor Inwood is great and the lectures provide useful information beyond the texts. Some of the texts are very intriguing to read and all the texts will at least make you think.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is very interested in having an overview of ancient philosophers or who wants to learn how to write a philosophy paper. If you are a philosophy major, definitely take this course. I personally had a wonderful experience with my TF Austen Hall, and I feel like your TF contributes greatly to your time in the class. If you desire to see the basis of the evolution of Western Thought take this course, but be aware that many of the teachings and beliefs aren't really applicable in contemporary times.",
