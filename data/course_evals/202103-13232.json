It provided for a close-read on a wide swath of schools of thought, philosophy, and approaches to critical thought and apply that to my work and personal art practice. That has proved invaluable and certainly useful for beyond Yale for a long time to come."

                "The strengths are numerous: the readings are engaging in a broad amount of schools of thought on different subject matters and are related back to a more specific discussion through the lectures and discussion in the classroom. Perhaps one of the only weaknesses is that it is sometimes challenging to keep up with the note-taking during class, but as a song I like goes \"all pain is small change in the cost of wonder.\" That said, I think some of the readings were much more dense than others, which made accessing the core ideas a bit more difficultyagain, not really a weakness, just something that took more time in relating it to the class as a whole as opposed to individual sessions."
