That has proved invaluable and certainly useful for beyond Yale for a long time to come."

                "The strengths are numerous: the readings are engaging in a broad amount of schools of thought on different subject matters and are related back to a more specific discussion through the lectures and discussion in the classroom. Perhaps one of the only weaknesses is that it is sometimes challenging to keep up with the note-taking during class, but as a song I like goes \"all pain is small change in the cost of wonder.\" That said, I think some of the readings were much more dense than others, which made accessing the core ideas a bit more difficultyagain, not really a weakness, just something that took more time in relating it to the class as a whole as opposed to individual sessions."
