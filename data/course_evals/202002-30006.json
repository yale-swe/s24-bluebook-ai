   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write a book review and how to analyze ethnographies. I also gained a better perspective of global health as whole and learning about the social aspects of the following infectious disease: HIV\/AIDS, Ebola, Malaria, H1N1, H5N1.",
    "I learned so, so much from this course about different diseases as well as the social and political factors that exacerbate diseases and their spread. I learned what it means to truly to look at issues holistically, and had great conversations in class. I also learned how to write a good academic book review, which I think will prove useful in the future.",
    "Throughout the course, I developed stronger reading comprehension and efficiency skills. I also read ethnographies for the first time and wrote book reviews for the first time and felt like I had the resources to complete them successfully. The course was incredibly rewarding and I really enjoyed discussing how themes in the books related to the present pandemic situation. Lastly, I developed insight on global health narratives that are often unheard of, and had the chance to learn how ethnographic approaches can serve as a means to broaden discussions on global health matters and bring change.",
    "I learned so much about how medical anthropologists conduct research through the skill of ethnography. I learned about the cultures and social contexts of many countries depending on the ethnography; paying close attention to the social basis of illness and how structural vulnerabilities leave certain people vulnerable to disease. Also, writing book reviews was a great way of introducing me to the art of writing a book review.",
    "This class was absolutely mindblowing and incredible. It revealed to me the ways in which health is not always or solely bound to biology and science and that social and material conditions have deep repercussions in peoples lives. The two skills I have developed are one, reading two books in one weeks, and two, vastly improving my writing and analytical skills.",
    "I learned about the institutions that direct global health policy and their direct impacts on the social, political, cultural, and economic networks of a community.",
    "I learned about recent crises in public health through ethnographies, including SARS, Ebola, Malaria, H1N1, H5N1, and others, as well as how to write academic book reviews."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course was in its structure. I learned so much in 5 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed the presence of Marcia, Rachel, and my classmates. The main weakness is having to sit for 3 hours and 15 minutes. While we had a break in the middle, it was sometimes difficult to be attentive for that long of a time.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is simply the course material. It is so rich and interesting and informative. I really don't feel that there were many weaknesses.",
    "The class readings were incredibly fascinating and I thoroughly enjoyed discussing them. Class discussion is only as good as the people you are in the class with, so I'm glad that we had a strong group. One downside to the class was the length of the discussions. Oftentimes we were fatigued by the end of class and lost focus. Also, the reading load was quite heavy, especially from having a Tuesday class then a Thursday class.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, very interesting content, amazing support network, books were very insightful, discussions were rewarding.\r\nWeakness: None",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Discussion was always engaging\r\n- Book selection was very intentional, well thought out, and followed a cohesive pattern\r\n- Marcia and our TA Rachel were always very helpful and available to talk",
    "There are too many strengths to list them all but the main strength of this course was the depth to it. Discussions were never bland, all of the readings were insightful, and Marcia herself is a leading scholar in this topic so she provided much background knowledge. In terms of weaknesses, the workload was unforgiving at times; two books a week are a lot, especially since you do not receive equal time to read each.",
    "A strength of the course is that it is very thorough. Marcia was able to guide us through student-led discussions about various ethnographies.",
    "The course moved quickly (which I liked) and was very discussion based (also a plus). At some moments, especially between Tuesday and Thursday classes, it was difficult to complete the required readings, but discussion usually functioned well regardless. No evident weaknesses; overall, a great course, especially considering it was remote."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in global health. This class will force you to think critically and you'll truly learn a lot!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. If it is being considered as a summer course, I would tell them that it really is a lot of work and a lot of reading, but if they can keep up it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "Yes! The workload is challenging but you will grow academically and learn so much. By far one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "If you are interested in exploring global health and the social contexts that inform illness, I highly recommend this course.",
    "100% would recommend this class, especially to those looking forward to going into any health related field. Many health problems are blamed on those sick themselves either for becoming sick or for living in the conditions that facilitate sickness. This course completely demolishes that prejudicial form of thinking that is very implicit in the health systems we have today.",
    "If you like reading, this class is very book and reading heavy. You read a book per class, but the content is very interesting.",
    "Yes! The discussion format is good for staying engaged and is a strong incentive to make sure you finish the readings. I also found the course especially interesting because of how it meshed with the current corona crisis, and how ideas from ethnographies chronicling past crises applied to today."
