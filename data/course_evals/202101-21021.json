                "I think this class had good intentions, but felt a little disorganized at times. Most of this is due to the lecture style of the professor. While Ed is certainly nice to his students, he sometimes makes it difficult to follow along in lecture, and even relatively simple concepts can become confusing. The slides are generally good though, and you can probably complete the problem sets just by looking at them. This class isn't too focused on theory, so you do get some applied experience, although if you've taken other S&DS courses already, it can feel repetitive.",
                "A more in depth version of Econ 117. It was poorly taught in my opinion, lectures were very dry and not engaging. Very little practice of the material",
                "I liked the psets and quizzes but sometimes it was confusing to follow Eds lessons. There was no direction for the final project which was hard",
                "Strength: I think that this year the workload for the course was much more manageable and spread out. I liked how the PSets addressed the coding component, while the quizzes tested conceptual understanding. Also, the fact that both were assigned every other week was really helpful in terms of not being overwhelming. Weakness: the material and its presentation can be rather difficult to understand. It is very easy for the lectures to go over your head, and I needed to spend a considerable amount of time reviewing on my own.",
                "The course introduced some useful techniques in statistics, including the bootstrap method. One weakness was that the lectures often glossed over concepts without going over them in depth, and class sometimes felt rushed. As a result, the psets were difficult.",
                "The material and slides was heavy at times and it was hard to understand conceptually the methods that we were taught.",
                "Strengths: Very good TA\r\nWeakness: Rushed, unclear lectures",
                "This class was very informative and application-based which was helpful in learning about how empirical papers are really written. It was interesting and engaging and provided a lot of opportunities to code in R. One suggestion for improvement would be better organization of the course along with clearer and more succinct lecture slides.",
                "The course was well designed and well delivered.",
                "The strenghts were the very thorough lectureslides and materials. It was easy to go back into the slides to slow down and really soak in material. This balanced out the often long-drawn lectures, which moved at fairly slow/dry pace (to be fair the material itself was not to exciting by nature). The professor often also got mixed up during his presentations, which made focusing difficult. This was compounded by the fact that many of the classes focused on a single economic paper and its methods, making it easy to get lost if you ever zone out. However, the prof was very nice and responded to questions well, and his office hours were sometimes more helpful than the actual lecture to help understand certain concepts. The psets were not too hard, given you give yourself enough time on them, and they were fairly accurate representations of the final (although this year the final was take home, not sure how things are usually when there isn't a pandemic)."

                "If you're thinking of taking this, then you probably are required to take it. I had to take it for the economics major because I skipped 117, but most of the others in the class are taking it with the intentions of writing a senior thesis in the future. If you're in that camp, I'd say probably take it, but I'm not sure how much of the content overlaps with 117 in general. I had taken other S&DS courses prior to this, and some of the content felt repetitive. Ed is a nice professor, but not the best at teaching content through lectures. The class is relatively organized though, with regular psets and quizzes, so you basically know what to expect day-to-day from it. The assignments don't take that long overall, and the quizzes are straightforward for the most part. Beware, though, that this year the class felt significantly backloaded. The last assignment was by far the longest, and the take-home exam--released during reading week--took a while to complete. On top of this, there was also a final research project that we had to complete (due the last day of the semester), without much time to complete it, given a take-home final exam was due a few days earlier. Working in groups though makes it easier, so try to do that if you can. Overall, I'd say this class is fine, but probably won't be anything special.",
                "No. Dont take this class unless you need to or youre SURE you want to write the thesis. It was honestly a waste of time and so much work. I was on the fence about a thesis and thought this class would really help me prepare for it. I didnt get much out of it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, took it without having taken 117 and it was fine (Id taken other stats classes like 230 and 240).",
                "Not really. Only if you need it for senior essay",
                "If you are planning on writing a thesis, you would probably need to take this course. In the current format, with the work relatively spread out (fair psets and quizzes every other week) I think that this class is not easy, but most definitely doable. You might need to spend some time going over lectures on your own if you really want to understand the material, but the course was fair this year even though I found the material to be rather difficult.",
                "Not necessarily, unless the person is extremely interested in this kind of stuff. The workload is pretty heavy, especially at the end, where there's both an exam and a final project. So it may not be worthwhile for everyone.",
                "This course is completely different than Econ 123 taught by Costas. If you are planning to do any kind of empirical work in the Economics major but are not taking the higher level Econometrics course, then take this. It is not as difficult and involves much more standard work.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more about statistics in economic research.",
                "Yes if they are interested in statistics and love R.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is important for understanding real empirical methods and practicing coding skills. Its focus on applications is useful for those that might want to do their own research and analysis of data.",
                "I recommend this course to students who are interested in playing with numbers and statistical work, and computer coding.",
                "I would reccomend it if you are comfortable with R already, as it makes following along during class much easier, and takes a pretty big burden off of completing the homeworks. If you are only taking this class for fun, maybe think otherwise. The material is useful, but the lectures can get disorganized and hard to follow."
