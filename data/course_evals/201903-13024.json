    "Exposed to new terms and perspectives!",
    "This course taught me to view ecology through a unique, novel lens that I had not contemplated before. It encouraged me to take into perspective non-Western worldviews and apply them to various ecological issues, such as climate change.",
    "Great look into racial, historical, philosophical, literary and ecological theories and genres I had not encountered previously.",
    "I had a great time learning how to synthesize articles",
    "This class helped me improve my reading, writing, and thinking skills. We drew connections between many of the texts and the discussions were very open, meaning we could bring in personal experiences or real world experiences if we felt they were relevant.",
    "I not only developed as a writer and an analyzer of academic writing, but I also developed my perspective of the present day with regard to black and indigenous communities and the effects of past and modern colonialism.",
    "Human history impacts natural history as the needs of the product and market have become more important than the needs of man. Studying systematic oppression\/injustice through ecological principles has aided my understanding of how our social patterns are changing the natural geological order.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the effects of settler colonialism as well as the different facets of black and indigenous identities and ways of life."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - content; weaknesses - didn't like the writing exercises",
    "This course was strong in its application of theory to practice. It allowed students to extract very dense ideas from texts and apply them to the real world. One drawback might be the difficulty of texts, however. Most students were able to navigate these texts, but they could be quite unclear.",
    "Professor and syllabus are strengths. Some peer editing and in class activities werent effective.",
    "I felt like we could learn more about writing structure.",
    "I think that the main strength of this course was that the professor was very open to meeting outside of class to discuss any material from class or any of the assignments. Our in class discussions were almost always interesting, and students could often take them in whatever direction we wanted. One weakness was that sometimes our discussions ran over, or we didn't have enough time to discuss all of the readings. But over all the readings were manageable.",
    "I think a major strength of the course was its range of content. We had readings that were academic and theoretical, and there were readings that consisted of poetry, short stories, and news articles. This variety made it easier to understand the content. I also like how the class was so discussion-based. The discussions really helped me maintain an in-depth understanding of the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is very interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - it opened my eyes to several diverse perspectives and allowed me to understand ecology from a significant yet often ignored lens.",
    "Yes definitely! The readings and discussions were very engaging!",
    "Yes! This class introduces so many new perspectives on environmental issues that are important to hear and discuss. We thought critically about a lot of social movements and issues, and while the class could be a bit depressing at times, I think the ideas we talked about were very important.",
    "YES! This course is innovative!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the discussion-based nature of the class made it really easy to understand the material, and the readings were always incredibly interesting because they provided different ways of analyzing settler colonialism and its effects on the identities of black and indigenous people. There weren't any other homework assignments besides the readings, and none were extremely long. The papers were very straightforward, and the professor gave very helpful feedback."
