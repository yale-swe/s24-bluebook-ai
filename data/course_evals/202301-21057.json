It definitely felt a little bit repetitive from PSYC 110, but I still learned some new information that I've surprisingly applied to various areas of my life, such as the social media stuff.

                "I wish it was less taught out of the textbook, whenever we went off book and Professor Duchsherer shared more modern studies, it was the most interesting.",
                "way too long so sorry i always lost focus",
                "Weaknesses -- The course adhered very strictly to the textbook, so the personal interests of Prof Duchscherer weren't really explored. \r\n\r\nStrengths -- very understanding of student needs, flexible. Made all materials accessible online",
                "This class was very clearly presented. I never felt like there was any question of what the content would be on an exam or what we were learning. The only issue was that sometime lecture felt like it moved very slowly and the slides were all plain and with few images and like calibari font or something. It needed a little more engaging elements.",
                "Some strengths of the course is that the workload was fairly light. I never felt like I was running to do the work, and the fact that there were only two tests that we were given dates of far in advance was really helpful, I was able to set aside time to study beforehand. Weaknesses of the course would be that it again was kind of surface level, I kind of wish that we could have gone in more detail about studies, but for the sake of time I understand. Also generally the presentations weren't that engaging but again it's a lecture course so I can't be too picky.",
                "Some of the lectures were deplorable in content. One in particular discussing psychological differences between democrats and republicans was insanely biased. I am not at all political and I felt an urge to defend republicans from the subtle, yet intense beating they were receiving. This lecture should not be taught in future.  Along similar lines, the course referenced an enormous amount of correlation studies which made big claims with little evidence. To follow these studies with \"more research is needed\" (which was often the case)  does not excuse them being taught to begin with.",
                "Strengths: the course was designed well so that each topic led into the other and set the foundation for subsequent lectures. I felt like the material was structure in a way that made it easy to understand and it was comprehensive. Weakness: there was a lot of material which could be overwhelming at times, I also think that perhaps reducing the amount of topics covered may allow students to more deeply engage with particular topics. I felt like I got a pretty solid surface level understanding of a lot of topics.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, clear lectures, essay assignments and exams were straightforward and good at assessing how well we understood the material and how to apply it\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not particularly engaging, exams had a lot of content on them, and the word limits for essays were too low (prompts asked for too much to be accomplished in too little space, and often my TA's feedback would ask me to expand on things yet I was already at the word limit)",
                "The strengths were how well the concepts were explained. The weaknesses are how much was covered, it was at times too fast to understand the concepts.",
                "Strengths = Interesting material \r\nWeaknesses = I think there are too many assignments for it being a lecture class. Some of the time, it was difficult to balance the essays and exams, and I think that for some of the essays, I did not learn much. To improve, there could maybe be less essays.",
                "Strengths were that it was a very straightforward class in the sense that you knew what you were going into every class. Weaknesses were that the lectures weren't very engaging and the professor basically just read the words on the slides so sometimes it didn't seem worth going to lecture, especially when it was recorded. The material itself was interesting but it could have been made more applicable to our lives or interactive in the sense that I wish we had interacted with other students in the class more to supplement our learning.",
                "The lectures could have been more engaging with mixing mediums. Maybe some\r\nvideos, examples, different slide formats, demos. I liked the content but the delivery being the same every time just got a little repetitive and boring sometimes. \r\n\r\nStrengths: lots of content learned very fast, very organized and can tell Prof. Duchscherer cares! Grading was kind and assignments were reasonable.",
                "Nice mix of assignments-exams. Interesting topics",
                "Strengths: The creativity of short assignments; Weaknesses: Exams that tended to test memorization over interpretation of concepts.",
                "The readings are very central to the textbook, and the lectures are well-structured and all have a conclusion, which I really appreciated! The writing assignments really spread the coursework out in a very manageable way and provided an opportunity for individual learning and feedback.",
                "The lectures were not super engaging, making it hard to enjoy the subject. Finding ways to keep the class engaged and not using slides with just sentences on them might help solve this problem.",
                "I liked the format of the class a lot. I think the exams were a little tough and graded too harshly.  I think it would be helpful to have review sessions before exams too. Or practice tests so we know what to expect",
                "Strengths: The course is very organized; the slides are well put together (and uploaded before class) and lectures are recorded. Weaknesses: There are quite a bit of essays you have to do though.",
                "I think the classes basically being a summary of the textbook readings is a weakness, since it decreased the engagement I had with the class. I also had mixed feelings about having both papers and exams, though the workload was reasonable.",
                "It felt like a modern approach. It was a lot of content for every class.",
                "A strength of this course was Prof. Duchscherer's teaching style. Each lecture was well organized, grounded in the psychological literature, and offered students the opportunity to further consider questions or areas which remain uncertain in the field of social psychology.",
                "The essays were a good supplement to the class material as they connected well to the material. The lectures were easy to follow because the slides contained all the same information as was said.",
                "The content for this course is very clear, but the lectures are often a little boring (just going through whatever is on the slides). I appreciate the clarity but sometimes it's hard to stay engaged.",
                "Strengths: assignments were not overwhelming but you still get to learn a lot about psychology research\r\nWeakness: lectures were pretty boring and were not that engaging",
                "Strengths - relatively interesting content\r\nWeaknesses - powerpoints quite boring and lecture style not overly engaging",
                "This course was very organized and clearly structured. I felt like the assignments and exams fairly tested the material we were taught, but the exams were a graded hard.",
                "Strengths: the essay topics are very fun and engaging, and I enjoyed writing them. The course material was also very attention-grabbing, and I loved lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the way exams were graded was a little opaque; I wasnt really sure why I was getting things wrong",
                "This course is very organized and I love the feedback we get back from our writing assignments. I just wish the exams were a little less difficult. I spend a while studying for them and using different strategies and yet I am always disappointed by how I do. I think that there should be less multiple choice questions and more short answer questions that reflect our ability to engage in depth with the course material.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and energetic teacher\r\nweaknesses: sometime I felt like lectures were just being directly red off the slides and that I didn't need to go",
                "The strengths are that the course is straightforward, in that the assignments are well-spaced out, and the lectures will help you succeed in those assignments.\r\nThe weakness was that the lectures were quite repetitiveessentially every lecture is in the same format and the lectures are packed with text, which decreased my level of engagement."

It is definitely one of the better if not only choices for completing the social science core requirement and I feel like I learned a lot. It's not a gut, but you don't have to worry about readings or anything because the professor doesn't really put surprise questions and assignments based on readings out.",

                "In general yes, I learned a lot and had a positive experience with the course. In the context of some of the other psych classes offered, however, I would probably not recommend it- I have found other classes a lot more engaging just because of the lecture style\/activities (unrelated to content)",
