I did not receive any feedback unless I sought it out, and even then I only received positive feedback on the ideas I had developed independently, which led me to think that I was heading in the right direction. This meant that I was not learning throughout the process- my learning was self-driven. I worked with an advisor from outside the PLSC department, so my engagement with PLSC 480 was rather minimal. I would have liked more guidance throughout this process, especially since PLSC and other departments may not always overlap in their standards for a senior thesis, but I was unaware of the PLSC standards despite seeking out advice on what those standards were."

My individual senior essay advisor was great, but I wish Id gotten more guidance from the department itself: a rubric, examples of prior essays, a working group or peer editing group, an info session with research librarians - anything, really. Although Im proud of the work I did, Im finishing the major without a clear sense of what the senior essay was supposed to accomplish.",

However, if I hadnt already been confident in my own advisor and in my own research and writing abilities, I dont know how I would have been able to complete the essay as there was almost no guidance from the department.",
                "This is the PLSC senior essay course, so naturally it is unlike any other course I one would take at Yale. Nonetheless, I did not find this course to actually be helpful to my learning or essay writing process, which was unfortunate. I do not understand how we can be evaluated in this course if the process was so hands off and there was almost no engagement with the PLSC department in the essay writing process."
