                "Strengths: Great overview of the model organisms in biological research, spanned molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, as well as organisms in different kingdoms. Instructions on lab activity and lab reports were clear. Feedback was kind of timely, but I would appreciate it if I could get it sooner. Weaknesses: Could have been clearer on the \"Design Your Own Experiment\" part at the beginning of the semester. Give more information about what exactly the student needs to do, and perhaps include some questions to guide them.",
                "I think a big strength is the resources that we were given for each lab assignment and the pre lab lecture that Dr. Moreno gave us. One weakness was that sometimes the direction or order of the lab was not clear/deviated from the packet."

                "I took it with BIOL 101/102 as a first-year and don't regret doing so, but don't feel like you have to take it if you're taking the introductory bio sequence because there's a decent number of upperclassmen. (And don't take it if you're taking another lab like gen-chem or orgo.) That being said, it was extremely informative and I got a good overview of biological research through reading about a variety of model organisms. Some parts of it, such as embryo development and the occasional requirement of statistical tests in lab reports, have been a bit challenging. The workload was definitely smaller than most one-credit courses, but it's a half-credit so... Both Prof Moreno and my TF Kelly were very approachable and genuinely cared about their students. AND it's one of the few STEM courses that give you (half of) a writing credit!",
                "Yes! Dr. Moreno is very helpful and knowledgeable, and you definitely gain alot of new and valuable skills from this lab."
