                "One of the strengths of the class was the variation between the different weeks. Each week we addressed a different civilization, and it was nice to see a wide array of sites. Classes weren't very engaging because there were lots of long silences and not many people were willing to talk, though I think this is partly the fault of the students more than the course. Homework assignments that asked us to engage in different ways, other than just discussion posts, might have been useful in sparking discussion in class.",
                "Strengths-- usually very interesting content, very nice and invested instructor, very reasonable time expectations. Weaknesses-- frankly, the other students sometimes. It would be awkward sitting in silent zooms or having to have the prof ask many times for people to turn on their cameras. This sometimes attracts people who just do not want to engage, through no fault of the professor.",
                "lectures contained discussion sections where we broke off into smaller groups and went over questions, which was helpful",
                "Strengths include the breakout discussions. Room for improvement would be hands on material, but unfortunately this is a constraint of COVID."

The assignments were pretty fun, including the discussion posts, extra credit assignments, and midterm.",
                "I think this class definitely suffered by being changed to virtual format. Normally, we would visit the Peabody and other museums and be doing hands on activities to learn archaeological methods. But this semester we were restricted to just doing readings and watching recorded, which were not particularly engaging. In-class zoom polls or other in-class interactive activities would have made the class more interesting in the virtual format. I also think if the class met twice a week instead of once, it might have been more engaging.",
