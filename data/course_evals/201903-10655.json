    "Critical and analytical thinking, writing, reading the text, translating, grammar.",
    "This class is excellent for a close study of the Latin language with relevant context. I learned so much not only about the history of Rome and seminal texts from three prominent Roman authors, but also about improving my own writing.",
    "I developed better writing habits as well as the ability to closely analyze Latin texts and interpret them.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Latin language, both stylistically and grammatically, and about the history of Rome, both real and mythological. My writing and translational skills improved, as did my appreciation for each author we read.",
    "On the most basic level I developed my Latin translation skills, which are the foundation of the course. As in any Latin course, your appreciation for the finer points of the grammar and your vocabulary will both improve, and I think Professor Solodow does a good job building these knowledge bases (for example, teaching a number of interesting etymologies). \r\n\r\nI also gained a good deal of knowledge about the three greatest Augustan authors: Virgil, Livy, and Ovid. They're each stylistically and tonally very distinct, and I didn't have any experience with the latter two coming in, so I enjoyed making comparisons. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual thrust of the course - how Romans viewed their early history - doesn't provide the most insight, in my opinion, but we definitely learned about that as well.",
    "Further study of the Latin language--grammar, morphology, syntax, reading key texts of the golden age of Latin literature.",
    "Learned a lot about the mythical early history of Rome from the perspective of three great authors. Latin reading skills improved a fair amount.",
    "While of course the class focused on translation, syntax, and grammar, the most important thing I learned was literary analysis and cultural evaluation.",
    "I further developed my reading fluency in Latin and gained an understanding of subtle rhetorical strategies. I also got better at interpreting scholarly commentary and learned about early Roman history.",
    "- English writing specifically in close reading: some of the advice are very specific to this course (e.g. use Germanic words instead of those from Laitn roots) but it really does not hurt to focus on the form of your writing (e.g. making sujects and verbs agree, being idiomatic, being concise, citing examples)\r\n- translation: definitely a lot of practice with various authors (Vergil, Livy, Ovid)\r\n- analysis and grammar: as it is a bridge course, still a significant amount of attention is paid to, for example, uses of the ablative and subjunctive cases",
    "I learned how to analyze Latin better in order to translate Latin better, especially with poetic Latin. I also got better at identifying certain Latin constructions, such as subjunctive phrases. I found that Latin was much more complicated than I had previously found, but I enjoyed the class immensely.",
    "I developed skills in close reading and analysis of the grammar of Latin prose and poetry.",
    "We learn to strengthen our ability not only to understand Latin grammatically,  but also to do close literary reading and comparison of the texts to authors.",
    "Improved translating ability and better understanding of Roman culture \/ writing.",
    "PREFACE: I only took LATN 110 and 120 (L1 and L2) before this course, and therefore, although I was decently prepared for the course, it was a lot more work for me than for others.\r\n\r\nIn LATN 411, I developed more vocabulary in the Latin language, and was able to read Latin more quickly by the end of it. There was also an emphasis on syntax and rhetoric. I learned more rhetorical terms in this class than my previous two semesters of Latin. In the class, we also did a lot of rhetorical and literary analysis, which was enjoyable, since that was something I had not done before.",
    "I developed skills in translation and reading fluency. My writing skills also improved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think our class struggled addressing broader themes within the readings. We were very much tied down to the same couple of stories which some people definitely found tiresome to reanalyze.",
    "I think the course was quite well run! The biggest difficulty I found was the size, as it felt rather large for a language class, but that can't really be helped. The lengths of translations were appropriate, as they were long enough that we made substantial progress over the course of the semester but not so long that they were overly time-consuming. Professor Solodow nicely balanced translation and other discussion, of the style or historical context, and I enjoyed gaining exposure to three different authors.",
    "The difficulty level of the course is definitely a strength. I would say it's approachable without being mindless, and Professor Solodow offers a good number of useful supplements to help along the way. On a similar note, I found the Aeneid Book 8 text we used to be particularly valuable, both for translating and interpreting the content; the others were also useful, but not to the same degree. Another strength was that there was a strong feeling of continuity between many of the readings, so I felt like I could build a mental map between the different narratives and content. And of course, reading Virgil, Livy, and Ovid is always a plus. Lastly, I feel like the additional assignments - two \"polished translations\" and two short literary exercises - were a useful change of pace and more enjoyable than I expected.\r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of the class was that many of the passages were relatively similar to each other. This serves the thematic purposes of the class, but didn't always make for interesting reading. I think that a greater variety of topics or authors would make the material more engaging and would probably liven up in-class discussions as well. If there is any interesting English scholarship on the topic (I haven't checked), assigning one or two articles to read might also expand student understanding.",
    "Many kids in the course; wish there could have been 2 sections in order to get more individual attention.",
    "Strengths: Well-organized, always on task. Weaknesses: I personally did not enjoy writing 3-5 page papers twice, other than that mostly fine.",
    "I would say the primary weakness was that it felt that we were reading the same themes over and over again (similar origin stories of early Rome). While this did hammer in the key points, at times it made the class feel a bit redundant. But that is a small critique, and overall the class was great.",
    "I think that this course helps students attain precision in their Latin reading; however, I wish that more of the translation in-class could have been done independently. Such a decision would allow more time for discussion of concepts and themes.",
    "A strength was the attention that was paid to interpreting the Latin text as literature instead of just strings of Latin grammar. The class often felt like an English class in that sense, which was nice.",
    "Strength:\r\n- interesting material, Livy, Ovid, and Vergil offer intriguing differences to analyze\r\n- everyone is involved in the class (randomly called to translate and to provide insight on discussion questions)\r\n- not limited to just grammar and syntax, especially the essay assignments and responses of exams allow for interpretation and exploration of broader themes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- very routined (other than surprise quizzes), so it might not be very exciting for some students; it could also be seen as very similar to a high school classroom",
    "It involved a lot of student participation, and that facilitated more learning from individuals. I think a Friday class would have helped so that more focus could be put on grammar.",
    "Professor Solodow is generally very clear about what he expects and gives useful feedback. One suggestion for improvement would to be a bit more regular with the quiz schedule; on the syllabus, it said they would be every three days, but that was not always the case and the quizzes especially waned towards the end of the semester, when they would have been most useful.",
    "If I were to improve one thing about the course, it would be the amount of time we spend on translation each class. Professor Solodow does try and break it up with small lectures and discussions, but sometimes going over what you did for homework for almost the entire class does become a bit tedious.",
    "Most of what I learned while taking this course came through me grinding over translations individually. I think I became a much better translator through this process, but I did not learn as much as I would have hoped to during actual class time. I would guess the time I spent working to the amount I leaned has to have been the most disproportionate ratio of any class Ive taken.\r\n\r\nI would describe the teaching style of the class as fear driven. Professor Solodow would often ask who would like to translate the next couple lines. A couple students would raise their hand. Then he would call on someone else, and if they happened to be one of the less confident students, often they would be shamed in front of the class. I would often be glancing over the next passage instead of the one we were working on so that I might not embarrass myself if I were to be called.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am a naive first year college student, and I am unaware that terror may directly translate to learning. However, I did not find that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think reinforced the divide between weaker and stronger Latin students is the fact that phrases like as you should know or as we have discussed or as Im sure you or now familiar. Regarding one topic in particular, which even here I am too ashamed to admit which subject I still do not know, I feel those types of phrases must have been applied more than thirty times without actually clarifying what the point was. I would have no idea the thing in reference, and I did not feel comfortable asking in that environment. Maybe I was the only one ignorant of the subject or maybe many of my peers were in the same boat. Either way I would think restating the point would take almost no more time than applying these phrases that made me feel that much more discouraged about my lack of aptitude for the this class. These phrases were used regularly about many different things.",
    "PREFACE: I only took LATN 110 and 120 (L1 and L2) before this course, and therefore, although I was decently prepared for the course, it was a lot more work for me than for others.\r\n\r\nThe amount of reading for me was a lot, and consumed most of my time: it took me 3-4 hours to read each assignment (60 lines of poetry a night, or a comparable amount of prose). However, many people in the class (literally everyone else) was able to finish them within an hour or two. This class is meant to bridge the gap between L4 and L5, as well as bring first-year students who have studied Latin before \"up-to-speed\" with Yale Classics. Therefore, it is quite difficult to keep all students engaged in the class equally, and to me, it just seemed as if I was an outlier. This could be seen as one weakness: some people are at a disadvantage, while others are at an advantage. Also, I do not believe this class is curved, in case that is something you are considering (I do not believe any Latin course offered is). However, a MAJOR strength is the amount you will learn if you are a little underdeveloped in Latin, as well as the connections between the language and the literature. By this, I mean that you will be reading Latin more as you would read English literature, rather than read things literally without much meaning (such as drills and exercises).",
    "The homework assignments felt like they could vary greatly in difficulty and length, so I would have appreciated more consistency here. This is partly a result of reading various different authors, but the whole class and Professor Solodow seemed to agree that the Ovid was faster and easier than the Livy, and yet the Livy assignments were not (much) shorter in length, meaning they took significantly longer to get through."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. Solodow is incredibly smart and the class is extremely well-taught. If you have high-school Latin experience and want to completely finish your language credit, take it. It's hard but certainly manageable.",
    "Yes  take it if you love the Latin language and want to learn by reading interesting and important texts. All of our texts were so interesting and Professor Solodow both holds your hand through the translation aspect and provides room for open analysis.",
    "Yes, it is a very good course for those who wish to continue Latin studies from high school.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has not taken Latin in some time and would like a course with a moderate amount translation and a pleasantly general introduction to Roman history and literature.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student, especially to fulfill the language requirement. It's a very doable follow-up to AP Latin or equivalents, and I personally find the regular translations to be calming compared to other, less predictable classes. If you're looking for the most thrilling Latin in the world; authors other than Virgil, Livy, and Ovid; or topics that aren't connected to Aeneas and Romulus, it might not be for you.",
    "I would if they have sufficient knowledge of the Latin language and are a good independent learner.",
    "For a language requirement, yes, if you're good at Latin. If not, beware, it might be a little hard",
    "Yes, especially students coming in from high school who have taken Advanced Latin.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to take an L5 Latin class with a reduced workload. That being said, there was definitely a mix of abilities in the class and someone very passionate about Latin might benefit from being in a more specific or intense course in which students honed in on one author. However, overall the course had a good balance of material.",
    "I would recommend this course to other Latin students. I really enjoyed looking at the different ways three different authors discussed the same events in Roman history. We didn't get to make these comparisons in high school, so it was a new challenge.",
    "Students considering this course should be conscious of why they are taking this course, and there are many reasons (fulfilling language requirement, considering potential major) but mostly the students in the class are there for very practical reasons, which is totally acceptable. However, this does sometimes make it feel like just another course you have to get through instead of look forward to. That being said, this class is rather accommodating of students of various backgrounds in Latin training as long as the students are willing to put in appropriate amounts of work.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if they have had at least three years of teaching in the subject,",
    "I would recommend this to any student who took four levels of Latin in high school and is looking to satisfy their language requirement while at the same time taking a truly interesting and well-run course, or anyone with appropriate Latin background who is interested in Roman writers in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has a genuine interest in the Latin language and\/or history. If you are just trying to get a language requirement out the way and do not want to spend an adequate time preparing, then the course is not for you.",
    "My seven years of middle \/ high school education did not prepare me for this class, albeit the Latin program was weak. \r\n\r\nYou will not ever review grammar. You must come in very comfortable translating poetry. People would have debates over types of ablatives a noun could be of which both I had never heard before. I would pretend to know what was going on. \r\n\r\nFor me, my own lack of knowledge combined with getting called on randomly made the class stressful and not enjoyable. Professor Solodow is really nice, but the classroom environment is not a friendly one.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like some people didnt hate the class, so maybe if you are good at Latin, prepared, and enjoy the subject, this class may prove not to be absolutely emotionally eviscerating.",
    "PREFACE: I only took LATN 110 and 120 (L1 and L2) before this course, and therefore, although I was decently prepared for the course, it was a lot more work for me than for others.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this course to another student: it is a good course, and any course with Solodow is an amazing course, as you will learn so much from him. This course was difficult for me, but it was really interesting, especially since I was not well-versed in the history of Rome. Although this was not a history course, I still learned a lot of history. I would definitely recommend this course, but just be aware of the large intellectual challenge if you have not read too much Latin or if you have not studied more than 3-4 years of Latin (a lot of students took AP Latin).",
    "No, I would not recommend it. Although there are often completely correct and unique English translations to a Latin passage, this is not always the case. Multiple translations can be accepted as correct. However, Prof. Solodow was so particular that only the translations he deemed correct would be accepted, even if other translations were just as accurate.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. If someone really enjoyed Latin, I think they could find really enjoy this class, as I noticed that some of my classmates did. But I also noticed at what felt like the majority of us did not particularly like this class, despite thinking we might be Classics majors or having loved Latin in high school. I would ultimately advise shopping it, but highly emphasize not staying married to the idea of taking the class. I wish I had been able to look into the other bridge course for the semester, and would probably recommend that instead."
