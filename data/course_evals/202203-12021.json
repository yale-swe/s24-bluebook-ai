Climate change is just as much an issue of behavior, culture, and adaptation as it is the impacts we are starting to see every day.",

This class help me move beyond the typical science-based notions of climate to see that issues such as polarized views of climate change, moral dilemma of geoengineering among others are not as straight forward and are highly context contingent."

                "The strengths of the course were the insights and discussions from class. I sometimes was unable to spend enough time on the required readings throughout the week, but did not find my engagement or participation in discussion lacking as a result. Another strength was the straightforwardness of the schedule and syllabus. The class was very organized. \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by making students move their seating arrangements two or three times, so that discussions throughout the semester aren't with the same partners every week.",
                "The strength of this course is its attempt to cover as much breadth in thinking about the different facets cultural perceptions of climate are manifested, from historical extinction events, natural disasters, geoengineering, to environmental determinism. Moreover, the lecture helps to tie the readings together that helps to consolidate them together such that they fit into the weekly topic. That being said, the readings each week could sometimes feel unrelated which makes it hard to go deeper, perhaps this could be improved by choosing readings that are more focused on the topic.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Clear takeaways and learnings from each reading, a good understanding and explanation of why readings were chosen \r\n- Each week's theme was clear and readings were able to provide insight into other readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Could have more student discussions about readings"

This course has the ability to provide an alternative perspective to topics that are less obvious but still important nonetheless, for instant reflecting on what constitute as a natural disaster if it impacts people differently",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have a particular interest in climate narratives and discourse. This course was particularly useful in understanding the ways that climate change discourse has evolved across time and the way it informs current politics."
