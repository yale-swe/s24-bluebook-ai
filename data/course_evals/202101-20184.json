It was great to be able to discuss the messages of stories and how horror adds to these messages. I learned how to analyze horror films rather than watch passively as I used to. I wish my creative skills were a little better, but this was the only course I have ever taken including high school that assigned a creative fiction portion that was fun to plan out (though stressful to write and actualize)."

                "Would have liked to have read more theory. The discussions sometimes felt ungrounded, and if we had engaged with more analytical/theoretical/art crit type texts I might have been able to think abt what I was reading or watching more deeply. But I absolutely loved the things we did discuss and Deming is a great Professor! Loved the chance to do a creative project!",
                "Strengths professor Deming is the best part of the course. He was very engaging and invited various contemporary horror directors and authors to the class for us to meet with. The variety of assignments and the class dynamic really facilitated learning.",
                "We were able to speak to many horror creators, which was both exciting and insightful.",
                "The class was just awesome! I loved having a critical and creative assignment to complete. I loved the in-class writing exercises and the how Deming made sharing low-stakes. I loved our guest speakers.",

                "This was a phenomenal course, and I struggle to think of ways it could be improved. The texts and films chosen in the syllabus were excellent and allowed for fruitful seminar discussions.  Important topics concerning race, gender, politics, etc. were discussed in relation to the horror genre and discussions were genuinely very engaging.",
                "Loved the guests we had, and also our little google folder. I got very close with many of my classmates outside of class and bonded through reviewing each other's work, etc. The professor is very entertaining and despite the spring and COVID slump, he still engaged us and I think everyone had a good time doing the work as well. I don't think there is anything I would necessarily add, other than maybe a checkpoint for the midterm and final for the professor, but that's a lot of work to put on one person so the peer reviews are definitely more than enough (maybe do 2 sessions for the students, one to brainstorm and one to edit)."

The works we read and watched were engaging and entertaining and a lot of times didn't even feel like work, and Professor Deming is incredible and will really help anyone improve as a writer.",

I don't have words to express how great this course is  if you are at all interested in horror, in any form (film, TV, books, short stories, etc.) I urge you to take this class. I had no prior experience in creative writing and my skill set is far from that of an English major, and yet I enjoyed this class and would say that it is one of the best I have taken at Yale, in any subject/department. You get to explore your passions and write about whatever you want, in an incredibly supportive and engaging environment. I was so glad to have this opportunity to push myself and go out of my comfort zone: creative writing has always been frightening and challenging for me, but I was able to overcome that fear in this class. If you are even vaguely thinking about taking this course, do it!",
