                "I learned how to evaluate Supreme Court cases and write political science papers on often abstract topics.",
                "Through extensive reading of books, essays, letters, documents and court opinions, I've greatly deepened my understanding of American constitutional government, in terms of its origin, design and operation. Moreover, with rigorous writing assignments, I've also improved my academic writing and become a better writing.",
                "Learn about the background behind Founders' intentions with the Constitution, the Constitution itself, and its application throughout the country's history.",
                "Better understanding of foundational American documents and ideas and their modern interplay today. Practice as a first-year in a seminar setting.",
                "I learned how to read court cases and and analyze them. I learned how to ask Constitutional questions and the different approaches to interpreting the Constitution.",
                "I learned a lot about the reasoning and thinking behind the principles used for the foundation of America. You learn how to read and think critically, and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the Constitution",
                "This course created a foundation of knowledge about early American political doctrine and how our country facilities its government. There were less tangible crumbs of evidence that I walked away with, but rather a more focused sense of how to approach future political science classes.",
                "Really great class. Helps you to understand the thinking behind the creating of parts of our constitution, political philosophy, judicial philosophy, and how they have all played out to today's society."

                "This is a very strong course.",
                "I really liked the reading, I thought they all built on each other very well. I liked that Professor Silverstein facilitated conversations, leaving room for us to debate if wanted to but also allowing us to get through the material and understand the point of what we were discussing. The questions he asked us always made us think, and he was always extremely well prepared for class, despite actually being a part of the law school. I always felt so grateful that I was able to take his class as a freshman, by far my favorite class that semester.",
                "Strengths: Breadth of reading; interesting topics covered. No real weaknesses.",
                "The strength of the course largely comes from the comprehensiveness of the materials involved and the engaging discussions it offer in class. Rigorous reading meant we could each form personal insights into American constitutional government and in-class discussions allowed us to exchange criticisms and debate and sharpen our opinions and judgments. The writings, finally, allowed us lay out our thoughts in a clear, coherent and persuasive manner which not only enhanced our understanding of this complex topic but also made me a better academic writer.",
                "Strengths: Significant foundational learning about the Constitution, what it was influenced by, and how successive generations have sought to guide the U.S. in the Founders' vision.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes more reading than can be accommodated by class discussion time.",
                "Strengths: great readings and insightful guided discussions and ideas by Prof Silverstein. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not the best understandings of what particularly to read for in the readings. a little more guidance could have been helpful. Furthermore, it would have been nice to have a little more talking and teaching by Prof Silverstein, it was all conversation with the class",
                "The course was very interesting and our discussions were very intellectually stimulating. I think that it would have been helpful to have gotten some grades earlier in the semester. More feedback on papers would have been nice.",
                "A lot of reading that we don't always discuss (in detail) in class. Sometimes, class discussions fell a little flat when engagement was low or with repetitive questions.",
                "Strengths: Discussions are interesting and poised around subjects that make us think critically. Professor Silverstein does a great job at leading discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings can be a bit on the heavy side but that is to be expected with a seminar class.",
                "This is most definitely a student led course where all are given a space to explore their opinions. Professor Silverstein does an excellent job of pushing students to explore their own views and those of their peers. At times the class did not fully explore certain texts, but that is to be expected when the coursework is so hefty.",
                "Weaknesses: Since the format is a seminar, the teacher tries to get students to talk as much as possible which can sometimes lead to it feeling repetitive when people are making certain points. The best parts were when Professor Silverstein would talk and really explain all the nuance and other factors we had missed. 80% of your grade is from three essays so really doesn't give much wiggle room if one goes bad. Strengths: That being said, the teacher is extremely nice and always open and encouraging to schedule one on one meetings to discuss how to best write your essay or any other topics of the course. Professor Silverstein is a super interesting person and talking with him about both aspects of the class and other things is always very insightful. This course also helped me really develop my passion for the subject."

                "I would recommend this course to every other student at Yale, professor Silverstein does a great job making this seminar an incredibly welcoming and discussion promoting environment.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This class is especially amazing for those who are interested in Constitutional Law. We read a lot of great works that were the basis for the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Then, we read Supreme Court cases that helped us to understand the applications (or lack thereof) of the principles set forth in those founding documents. I would warn that a familiarity with american history is very useful in this class, as it helps to ground all the information you are given. There is also a good amount of reading, but nothing you wouldn't find in any other Yale course. Moral of the story, yes, I would recommend this class to anyone because you learn so much, but it also teaches you to think about the law in a new way. I went in thinking thinking that Supreme Court Cases always presented the most logical argument, but Professor Silverstein helps you to think about the counter-argument. He always wants you to see the other side.",
                "Yes, if the student has an interest in political science, American history or Law. The material is interesting and covers a broad expanse of the topic but also delves deeply in places. Discussion in class is usually very interesting.",
                "Yes - if you are interested in the Supreme Court, US government, or political science as a major.",
                "Absolutely. American constitutional government is the core of American politics and studying it is crucial to understanding America as a country. I encourage anyone who shares an interest in this topic to sign up for this course.",
                "Would recommend to any student interested in U.S. history, constitutional law, or the workings of American society & politics.",
                "Yes! It was a privilege to learn from such a distinguished professor and to read these texts with his guidance.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about the Constitution and is interested in carefully analyzing court cases. I would recommend this course to people who want to be very engaged in class discussions as that is necessary.",
                "Yes! Professor Silverstein is amazing and asks excellent, thought-provoking questions, and engages with the reading material in very interesting ways. Loved learning about American history through this new lens!",
                "Yes, the course workload is not too much to handle and there are interesting topics discussed about.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Although there is a hefty amount of reading to be done the discussions are very meaningful if you actively participate. It is a small seminar, so there is not much room to hide in the class but Professor Silverstein is not the person to call out people in class. The texts were powerful and relevant to the topics, but most centered around early American political doctrine as the class does examine constitutionalism.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a great introduction to Constitutional law for first-years of all interests.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was great and really develops your understanding for the subject material. The reading assignments are all very good and useful to put you in the proper mindset for discussion during class."
