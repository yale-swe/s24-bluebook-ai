                "This class taught us that the modern essay is an attempt at conveying the meaning behind a specific personal experience, place, person, or cultural phenomenon. It taught us about structure, voice, tone, and other elements of essay writing. One of the key takeaways for me was to be vulnerable and to go beyond the first order of creativity; that is, to think of original ways to express our ideas. We also expanded our knowledge of great writers whose books I want to read now.",
                "I strengthened my narrative writing skills through this class, as well as my ability to critically analyze fictional texts. I think I was able to gain a greater appreciation for writing through this course, and have increased my confidence in my writing.",

                "I learned how to write for fun, but in a way that made the writing feel important and in a way that allowed me to see that scholarly writing is not the only form of writing that has significance. I learned basic writing skills that my other English classes were not able to grant me over the past few years. I learned how to write freely.",
                "I learned how to be more strategic in my writing, and I gained many skills from the class which have elevated my writing.",
                "I improved my writing considerably while also engaging in meaningful discussions about the assigned essays\/articles we had to read. I discovered many interesting pieces, and had a fun time discussing them in class. I also learned how to give and take feedback from my peers in a polite and constructive way.",

                "Strengths: Professor Gellman is an angel. She is extremely welcoming and holds frequent office hours. The pieces she chooses to include in the course are very diverse, fairly short, and entertaining. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You are almost always working on an essay, but it balances out with the short homework readings. \r\n\r\nFor some of the longer pieces, it would have been really helpful to have one or two guiding questions to be thinking about while reading the text. Otherwise, it is easy to get caught up in the content of the piece rather than the writing strategies of the author.",
                "Strengths: perfect amount of work, developed analytical skills\r\nWeaknesses: not necessarily a weakness, but I'm not too sure where I could I apply what I learned in this course to other areas of my studies as I am not planning to major in English.",
                "The strength of this course lies in its structure and the instructor. The units do a great job of introducing us to different kinds of essays and each unit became progressively more complex by adding new layers (such as other people, outside sources, and humor). The workshop is also a great way of learning to spot what works and what doesn't. I also think Prof. Gellman did a great job at assigning a limited number of readings, so that we would actually do them, while not sacrificing the reading list's diversity. I think one of its weaknesses is perhaps linked to the virtual format in that discussion often felt forced rather than free-flowing. I simply would have enjoyed more breakout rooms to speak more freely about our thoughts on the readings rather than staring awkwardly at the screen, waiting for someone to chime in after a question is asked.",
                "This course was very engaging and encouraged both small group discussion and connections. The readings for the class were manageable and very entertaining.",
                "Strength: you get comfortable writing about yourself\r\nWeakness: you dont learn how to improve your writing",
                "Strengths:\r\n- read a lot of intriguing modern essays\r\n- strengthen basic writing skills \r\n- encourages techniques not necessarily preferred in more academic writing\r\n- teaches you how to hone in on the meaning of words\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI just wish there was more time - don't think I've ever said that about any class",
                "I really like how the class is structured: good balance of reading analysis & discussion, writing, lessons and revisions\/workshops. I felt like everything that we did had a purpose and was helpful in some strategic way. The only negative thing has more to do with timeline -- sometimes we had really great essays that we didn't get to analyze enough or at all because we would spend most of the time on only one of the essays.",
                "Strengths: right level of difficulty, community spirit in class, high level of engagement (including from the instructor), clear improvement in skill\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I havent noticed anything that could really be considered a weakness. This course is quite organized.",

                "I liked the video-on engagement of this course. Additionally, it was helpful to have short breaks when switching to a new piece.\r\n\r\nSometimes we would be sent to breakout rooms and with unclear instructions. Other times, we were assigned a piece to analyze and present to our peers. I believe the latter was much more effective.\r\n\r\nThe professor often typed notes in a google doc (like a whiteboard), and I think it was a better approach than using the Zoom chat. I think the chat would be really useful for people to type questions or responses during class.",
                "Awesome to have some of the authors we read come talk to us on zoom!",

                "The one weakness that I noticed was the mild difficulty of Zoom discussions - awkward interruptions sometimes occurred, as is the nature of Zoom. I enjoyed how the professor could share her screen to show us videos that were related to the subject that we were learning.",
                "I think the course ran as smoothly and efficiently as it could have. The professor made sure to regularly use Zoom's chat feature as a virtual board, which really helped.",
                "I liked the idea of using the Zoom chat space as if it were a board where only the professor uses it to write on from an organizational perspective; however, in my other classes, the students using the chat to interact during the class helped bring a lively real-classroom feel to the zoom. It was a nice avenue for expressing the live reactions you can normally gage from everyone else in class when your all physically in the same room, but can't really on low-quality Zoom cameras.",

However, out of all the courses Ive taken this semester, this is the only one that has achieved that to a certain extent.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading the pieces and writing the essays. Professor Gellman gives very clear feedback and provides the students with the tools to improve their writing. \r\n\r\nIt's also really fun to read your peers' essays during workshop. You get a lot of great ideas from others, both in reading your peers' essays and when being the one workshopped in class.",

The course allows for you to reflect back on ideas and events in your life that could make for an interesting story, while also teaching you the key elements to creating an engaging narrative.",
                "Yes, if you have time to write essays and commit time to learn how to get better",
                "Yes. Everyone I know who has taken this course has raved about it. Everyone who hasn't taken it but has heard of it wants desperately to take it. And they should. In an environment where academia is revered and scholarly readings and writings are the primary tools when thinking about papers or essays, it is necessary to have some class which highlights the modern essay, which engages in tools which may not be used regularly for academic papers. This course reminded me of why I love being an English major and why I enjoy reading and writing.",

                "Yes! This course was fun, engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed being in class with Professor Gellman who was reasonable and understanding."
