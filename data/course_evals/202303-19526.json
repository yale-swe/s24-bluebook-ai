                "I developed absolutely no skills from this course. This course is not adequate in learning anything new because we have only two lectures to learn about an entire field of science. I don't think this class format makes sense in the context of learning anything new because there simply isn't enough time to learn anything of substance before the quizzes and projects which are every three weeks. I did learn that I do not like every field of science out there and that I should stick to the science classes that I do enjoy taking.",

                "This course is wonderful. To be able to learn about various fields of sciences is not only a wonderful opportunity, but also incredibly helpful to students who want to pursue a career in science, but are not certain what specifically yet. Working with peers in the class also enables growth of an individual, in addition to cooperation skills to work with a team and get to know my peers better, which I greatly appreciate.",
                "I think this course is great at giving a wide survey of current scientific issues and developments. Each lecturing professor gave great presentations and simplified the material just enough (most of the time) for a lay audience. I think the assessments felt sometimes unrelated to the lectures. I think there was a lot of pure lecturing periods, which definitely lost attention by the end. I think it's impossible to go into depth for any issue discussed in this class,"

As a student who values their science GPA, I would not recommend this course to anyone who is aiming to have a high science GPA and also looking for an easy class to fulfill a credit. You will simply fail the quizzes if you don't put in the effort (which is hard because you are working with only 2 lectures worth of knowledge and some quizzes you can't even use notes on). Also, the amount of assignments due in one class period is simply unreasonable. A debate, quiz, and paper the same day is just too much if you're looking for an easy class, like I was. Also this is a full year course, so if you want to credit/d/fail it, you literally cannot until the second semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It is a good opportunity to explore various fields of science in an interactive and interesting manner. The assignments and activities are often very helpful in supplementing material learning in class, and the opportunity to learn from various instructors is not something you see in many courses.",
                "I'd recommend this to any student who just wants a taste of a broad range of issues in science. It's not that much work (only 0.5 credits per semester) and the material is approachable to anyone, even those without a science background."
