                "The course is well-structured, and Professor Hansen puts a great emphasis on students developing their public speaking skills, which is why we sometimes engaged in debates. This was both a good way to develop speaking skills and internalize the material. We also spent multiple sessions in Yale's collections, libraries, and galleries, and these visits were always fascinating and insightful. There were times at which I which we would have delved more deeply into the historical content during class, but I understand that the primary purpose of this junior seminar was to teach us how to write an independent research paper. Professor Hansen, though she speaks her mind and can be rather demanding, means well and provides extremely detailed feedback designed to help you improve your writing.",
                "Its small size was a big advantage. The Professor made the class very engaging for all.",
                "The field trips to yales various collections were a huge strength. would have liked to spend more time on topics related to the Silk Road in west Asia / India",
                "Strengths  Interactive aspects of class\r\n\r\nWeakness  Weekly assignments make it hard to keep up with readings",
                "It's superb, and everyone will gain a lot from the course. But Prof. Hansen is very demanding and a harsh grader, so be prepared.",
                "Strengths: The course is well-organized and follows a clear trajectory. Field trips to different parts of Yale's research resources, such as Div school, Manuscripts and archives, and art gallery were also especially educational and entertaining.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the big picture of the class was not as clear, as we dabbled around different time periods and topics."

Much of the second half of the course is dedicated to the research paper and is very self-driven, so be prepared for that. You can gain a lot if you put the appropriate time and effort in.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wishes to develop their writing skills and learn more about the Silk Road.",

                "Yes, if youd like to learn a lot under Prof Hansens expertise.",
                "Yes! To me, this is the best class I've ever taken in college.",
                "I would! I think this is a great history seminar to teach you how to write a research paper and/or senior thesis. The class is very structured and you'll have plenty of moments to refine your research paper. Additionally, the final research paper is not long at all, only 3,000 word count which from my experience is a bit lower than other seminars. Class was always engaging and fun to be in."
