The feedback sessions were undoubtedly the strength of the course, because they allowed us to discuss each project in detail and allot 40 minutes of our time and energy to each capstone. Weakness: More clarity regarding capstone deadlines would have been helpful. Class would sometimes go way over time, so a clearer agenda\/structure for each class session would have helped us to stay on track better.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated the supportive environment that the capstone leaders cultivated in the seminar room. The capstone leaders gave very thorough feedback on my initial idea and capstone prospectus. My classmates were thoughtful in their comments and generous in their feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not receive feedback from the capstone leaders on the first draft of my project other than a few comments at the end of my workshopping session. The class also consistently went over the scheduled end time."
