                "This class fills the gap between high school Spanish and L5 language learning in a great way. We got a great review of many important topics to prepare us to write larger pieces in further L5 courses at Yale. I learned to appreciate the complexities of the Spanish language through various topics and methods of grammar learning. I also developed additional writing skills with the five graded writing assignments.",
                "I learned about all kinds of grammatical rules ranging from using the subjunctive, concordance in tense and time, adverbial phrases, verb choice in common verbs with many meanings, active and passive voice, reflexive verbs, definite and indefinite articles, placement of adjectives, etc.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all the mistakes that dont necessarily inhibit communication but that are crucial in developing fluency.",
                "I have never learned spanish grammar, so this was a brand new experience for me. I learned about the different types of tenses and sentence structures, as well as new vocabulary words. Small group and partner collaboration was reinforced in every single class, and this allowed me to learn from my peers as well. I was able to enhance my spanish communication skills.",
                "In the Advanced Spanish Grammar course, I learned various advanced grammatical structures and improved all aspects of my Spanish, including writing, reading comprehension, and speaking. I gained the skills needed to create and execute more sophisticated thoughts and ideas in Spanish.",
                "Good solidification of the parts of grammar that often cause mistakes (ie subjunctive vs indicative, imperfect vs preterite) and introduction to other smaller parts through movies, readings, and songs.",
                "I came into this as a quasi-heritage speaker, so this class was incredibly constructive in advancing my oral and written grammar.",
                "I was able to greatly improve my speaking skills in Spanish and the level of conversation I was able to have in the language deepened.",
                "This course taught me many small details about the grammar of the Spanish language that I have never before learned- these grammatical changes have bettered my speaking and writing abilities, especially. Through the process of learning more about grammar, I have encountered several new verb tenses that I was not taught in my high school Spanish classes, as well as many new sentence constructions that I also had never been taught. This course gave me the ability to deconstruct my speaking of Spanish and analyze it, while also reinforcing the memorization of concepts that are used constantly so that I can rely on having innately correct grammar.",
                "I feel like I learned a lot in this class, particularly how to be more confident in my Spanish voice, and doing that with proper grammar - which is greatly appreciated."

                "The strengths of this course are that the professor is extremely kind, caring, and considerate. The assignments relate directly to class materials and I felt like the exams were fair assessments of the skills we have learned.",
                "The course is very well organized and guided through a series of conversations with native speakers, short stories, movies, and even songs. The applicability of the content to real-life Spanish is obvious. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion is that while the amount of homework isnt excessive, the frequency with which homework is due (every Mon, Wed, Fri) is unusual. Most courses with problem sets have them due once a week, and most courses with papers have them due once every two weeks.",
                "The strengths of the course were that there was lots of collaboration and various ways to engage with the spanish language.  One weakness is that the homework was sometimes overwhelming and I did not feel like I could do it to the best of my ability all the time.",
                "The strengths of the course are the amount of relevant and useable content covered in the course, the structure of assignments that allow all aspects of the language to be improved (essays to practice writing, passages and questions to practice reading comprehension, etc.), and the inclusion of real-life conversation practice with native speakers, first with a language coach through LinguaMeeting and then with a college student in a Spanish-speaking country. One weakness of the course is that there are only three exams, which means that a lot of content is covered on each, which might not be the most ideal way to effectively test all the material thoroughly.",
                "Strengths: lots of practice in class with speaking and written practice, lots of homework with practice (I wouldnt call it useless busy work because I felt it was really helpful and necessary to feel confident with the material) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we have homework for every class manage time because sometimes there is a lot",
                "No one tells you its the hardest Spanish class at Yale",
                "The strengths of this course is the level of engagement that is required throughout the class that keeps students thinking and switched on throughout the class.",
                "Strengths- having class 3 days a week increased my exposure to the material, the homework was well suited for the study of grammar because it required repetitive practice but in many different contexts, the inclusion of short stories and movies provided an opportunity to learn grammar in a non-textbook context\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the amount of homework made it difficult to sift through all of the feedback we received,",
                "The strengths are in the interactive slide shows that Ms. Seymour curates. It always made class very engaging. Every class also felt very organized, and it was generally a fun and good learning environment."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. The professor is extremely kind and caring and wants the best for her students. I think it's important to know going in that this is a grammar class and you will learn a lot of grammar. There are homework assignments each night that often require readings, grammar exercises, and writing. Many of the assignments are graded for completion, but a few are graded like exams for correctness. These assignments are difficult, but there are fewer than ten in the semester. The class also has in-class and take-home writing assignments and exams. It is a lot of work but most certainly worth it!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if and only if you are genuinely passionate about Spanish, as I am. If you are looking for a gut course to fulfill a requirement, this is not it.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student because Profesora Seymour is incredibly engaging and the class material is varied. We would read fiction, watch movies, listen to songs, and discuss it all in class. I learned a lot and I enjoyed the process.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are ready to put in the work, but reap the rewards of becoming much more knowledgable about the different grammatical structures in Spanish and really have the foundation to be able to build even more advanced topics on top of the knowledge from this class. In this course, you will most definitely improve all aspects of your Spanish knowledge and capability.",
                "Highly recommend, lots of practice speaking and feeling more confident with the language as we solidify the grammar.",
                "You will likely get a B.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in improving their grasp of the Spanish language.",
                "Yes- I feel that this course is necessary to the development of the Spanish language as a student, especially to a non-native speaker. It fills a niche: many (if not most) high school Spanish students do not have a focus on grammar, especially intricate details that become necessary in advanced writing.",
                "Yes! Ms. Seymour was an amazing professor who always made herself available and genuinely cared about the learning of her students. I never felt insecure in her classroom to ask questions, and if I got something wrong, she made me feel like it was okay and all a part of the learning process :)."
