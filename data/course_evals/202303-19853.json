                "Strengths: A variety of ways to apply the language helped me learn better. Prof. Diaz was a huge strength, as was the level of engagement of the class. The asynchronous day was also a big strength.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class did feel more geared towards certain subjects (history, writing) which at times made me feel like I was at a disadvantage compared to others because I don't specialize in those areas.",
                "The strength of the course was Professor Diaz' enthusiasm about everything he taught. He was incredibly excited to teach us about the culture and history of so many latin countries and it made the course even more engaging. One weakness of the course was the homework. At times we were assigned over a half a movie to watch before the next class period, which was the following day because the course was five days a week. This coupled with questions assigned to complement the movie sometimes felt like a lot when I would have homework for other classes to complete as well."

                "If you're looking to take L4, take it with Prof Diaz. He's the best. Really detailed comments on our homework and makes classes really enjoyable. Him opening up open office hours was really nice and helpful when you need to ask him questions/or ask for him to review your work. The course content was also quite interesting too and I definitely have a stronger sense of Latin American culture and geopolitics after taking the course.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student! It was a lot of fun and I loved learning from Professor Diaz. I really enjoyed getting to transition beyond only learning grammar during this class."
