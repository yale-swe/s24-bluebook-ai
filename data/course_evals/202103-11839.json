In addition, I think that the workshops and office hours can have more purposeful review practices and specific agendas to better understanding of some topics.",
                "A strength is the in person lectures and office hours. A weakness would have to be that the lectures arent recorded if for any reason someone isnt able to make it to class in person.",

                "I thought a weakness of this course was failure to review exam-like questions in class. I felt that the level of difficulty of material during classes was not similar to the level of difficulty of problem sets, concept checks and exams. I also felt that some of the problem sets were very long. I thought the strength of this course was the ULAs. They were incredibly helpful. However, I felt that workshops were not helpful at all. They were also too long. Felt like I had three math classes a week instead.",
                "The strengths were that there were many office hours to get extra help with the problem sets and the weaknesses were that the content was taught in a  very abstract way which made it harder to understand than it needed to be.",
                "This course taught me the basics and the foundations of each concept. Through the problem sets, the concept checks, and the workshops I gradually learned how to apply the basics in larger, more complex problems.",
                "A strength would the the availability of the ULA and professor during office hours; I could always get an answer to my question. A weakness would be the fact that everything felt rushed. Sometimes I felt like we spent 20 minutes on a concept that would set the foundations for the filling chapters."

                "I would only recommend this course to students who need a math 112 completion for their major. It is nice to have a whole year to learn the material because calculus has a lot of components. If you have never seen calculus before it will be challenging.",
