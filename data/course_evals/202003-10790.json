While doing so, I also got a lot better at interpreting images -- because the discussion format was. centered around a powerpoint of graphics that we interpreted, we got practice looking at buildings, political cartoons, advertisements, pieces of art and many other artifacts from cities.",
                "I gained the ability to analyze art and architecture from a wider understanding\/perspective - Professor Surry is incredibly well-versed, and an amazing instructor (even within the isolation of Zoom). Classmates were highly engaged and also contributed to this - through papers and the final collage, you are able to produce your own in-depth analysis and research of New Haven and the idea of cities at large. Incredible course!",

Throughout this course, we analyze the multiple impacts of architecture on the social and cultural aspects of the city.

                "The readings were interesting and covered a wide range of topics. Oftentimes, however, it felt like we didn't go through all the material assigned for reading in class.",
                "Great professor and discussions, although there were too many\/too dense readings occasionally, the class was amazing!",
                "As for strengths, Prof. Schlabs always moderates the discussions so that we get to talk about really fascinating aspects of architecture and urbanism; he allows us to pick apart our own interpretations of what we're looking at but also provides his own insight, which is always interesting and helpful. The final project, which is a collage, was a really cool way to try to produce artistic pieces somewhat like what we had looked at throughout the semester. The readings were sometimes quite long and dense and it could be challenging to make it through all of them some weeks, but they were usually very interesting -- i would only say that since our discussion was so image-based, it could've been cool to have more final-project-type artistic assignments throughout the term.",
                "Strengths: extremely well-versed professor, interesting lessons\/visuals\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "Strengths: The walking tour of New Haven was quite enjoyable. I also really enjoyed Professor Surry! He brought a passion to every class which made me enjoy the classes content even more! I also really enjoyed watching the different movies and using modern cities as case studies for studying urban planning and architecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometime it was hard to be engaged in an online seminar but that's a symptom of zoom fatigue. Professor Surry definitely engaged us students in many ways, and I'm glad I was able to take this course.",
                "Strengths: Surry is an amazing instructor and is really engaging, even in the Zoom environment. Many of the readings were interesting and connected to fields connected to architecture such as urban studies, sociology, etc. Being a seminar, it definitely allowed for tons of discussion. Weaknesses: there were sometimes where I didn't know how to participate, given my lack of architectural knowledge, so it would've helped to have a resource or place where I could gain some more clarification on some terms related to architecture. Some readings were extremely long too, and often we'd only get to a few of the readings.",
                "Strengths: Despite being online, still a very engaging course. Very interesting material, taught in a tasteful and sensitive way.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were a bit difficult to keep up with, sometimes didn't seem especially pertinent to the in-class material (even though I know they referred to important background.)\r\nTo be Improved: Perhaps reduce or distill the number of readings.",
                "Strengths: enjoy the open discussion during classes; Professor is really engaging with students, encouraging and fun; manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: feel like we are analyzing more art then architecture (though it is extremely arguable that architecture is art; my expectation of the class was just slightly different than the reality, so it caught me off guard)",
                "The strength of this course is the freedom it allows the students to have an honest discussion. The virtual discussions were not fluid and unconducive to effective discussion. but it is not the fault of the professor that this was a weakness in the course. It could be improved by engaging each student more directly in discussion, as it was not easy to learn when no student was speaking up.",
                "Surry's teaching and explanation of the topics (I remember that he explained the religious typology in the first week's reading really well) was very skillful and conducive to learning. I also think the assignments were very engaging and quite interesting to complete. I just wish there were fewer readings for each week, as I felt that some were much denser than others and they weren't too related."

The in-person parts (the New Haven tour, a trip to an art gallery) were nice ways to get to actually meet out classmates in person.",
                "The incorporation of a physical tour was well appreciated and quite rare during this time - I think this course did the best it could under the circumstances.",
                "I really enjoyed the walking tour of New Haven because I got to meet my classmates and Professor Surry. I do wish there were more in person elements such as that, however. It is very difficult to engage in a seminar where you're limited to five people's face at a time on zoom while the professor is shairng the presentation for the day. Yet, I think this seminar was conducted to the best of its ability!",
                "Since this was a first-year seminar that revolved around tons of readings, the slides that would be included for the topic of the week were very helpful. All of the slides provided an opportunity to discuss and engage in conversation.",
                "Zoom-shared PowerPoints with provocative images, followed by Zoom seminar group analysis was particularly engaging.",
                "I think the Professor was really generous and thoughtful by changing a lot of the workload for his students especially during the pandemic. By reducing our workload over the semester, Professor Schlabs really allowed us to focus more on our discussions during class and not about stressing to get different papers done. There is not too much that I think could be improved.",

Be aware that this course requires your full attention, so if you feel like you won't be truly invested in this class, don't take this class.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course even if you're not considering an architecture major! Especially as a first-year living in a new city, learning about the background of the city was extremely valuable. Also, it's not necessarily a technical architecture class, but more of an urban studies class; if you're not trying to do architecture in the long run, you'll learn super interesting things about a large handful of cities which will be useful regardless of your major.",
                "Absolutely - if you are interested in exploring architecture (be it history, design, etc.), have a look at this course! It's fantastic for non-majors too who would like to explore the physical landscape throughout the world and to bring larger conversations of equity into contemplation of design.",
                "Yes! This course was great for introducing critical thinking about how we occupy spaces as individuals, but also as society as a whole. I also would recommend doing the readings because it was difficult to engage in class conversation without them.",
                "Yes, even if you're not yet dedicated to studying architecture as a field. If you have a remote interest in examining \"how is the human centered world around us designed,\" I encourage you to take this course,",
                "Yes! Though, I think this class would best be suited for people who truly are interested in learning about philosophy and architecture. For someone who just wants just get a distributional requirement out of the way, I can imagine that this class might be boring to that person. However, the workload isn't at all undoable so whether or not you are interested in architecture, I highly recommend this class to people.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students because it broadened my horizons in many areas and engaged me in topics including social equality, globalism, politics, and history, not just architecture. Also, the professor was understanding, fun, and engaging.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The topics we discuss in class are honestly very interesting and relevant. The readings can sometimes be a little dense, but the main points covered in class are well-explained. There are some fun assignments that are quite open-ended and can really get you thinking about the course material and how you choose to personally engage with it. I loved the structure of this class (a new topic every week with a set of readings) and I have to say that the case studies (Abidjan, in particular) were my favorites."
