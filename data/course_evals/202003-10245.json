In the meantime, we also read two selections from the Best American Essays anthology. I learned a lot about writing to word count and other strategies: eg. setting the scene in your work, how to invite readers into your story, etc. I also worked on my peer review skills and growing comfortable with my voice + sharing my writing.",
                "This course helped me understand how to work through a preoccupation in writing. I'm accustomed to writing arguments, but this course is less about constructing a thesis and more about attending to an idea. There are a lot of specific things I could mention, but I think the most important thing I learned was how to think about writing, and think in writing."

                "Strengths: the high caliber of writers (and writing feedback), workshops, written feedback from Prof. Zarin\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weekly essay readings outside of workshops, which felt forced and unfocused",
                "strengths\r\n-engaging class discussion\r\n-frequent and expansive comments from Professor Zarin and peer reviewers\r\n-frequent and expansive course discussion of everyone's works (we were constantly reading and workshopping each other's works, and I loved that)\r\n-good class environment where everyone felt free to share and be vulnerable in their writing\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n-reading amount and limited ability to print materials \/ read offline \r\n- a regular mid-class break more regularly would have been appreciated",
                "A strength of the course was Zarin's commitment to each student and willingness to work with them outside of class, and her facilitation of discussion and engagement of the group as a whole. I also enjoyed the fact that Zarin was intentional about making the group feel comfortable sharing intimate work and giving honest evaluations of other's work. A weakness was that the discussions about the essays themselves didn't seem to have much structure, and often ended up being a case of whether or not we liked the writing in general rather than an assessment of technique.",
                "Strengths: Prof Zarin is very knowledgeable and fosters a really nice class environment even while virtual. The readings are well chosen. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The seminar is structured as discussion in the large group for the whole time without breakouts which can be a very long zoom depending on the learning style",
                "I think the course is well done as is.",
                "I really enjoyed the opportunity to write in a regular and rigorous way. I felt like the five assignments grew me a lot as a writer and as a person. The major strength of this class is the peer workshopping. It is super rewarding and helpful to hear from the other (talented!!) students in the class, learn from how your work registered with others, and share strategies about the creative process. \r\n\r\nProfessor Zarin cares about this class, and she is very open about her own experiences. I know that shopping period is kind of weird now, but I would really suggest shopping the class and seeing if you like the vibe. You should know within a few classes."

Virtual learning just kind of sucks in general.",

It is really hard to read how others are feeling and to feel safe to communicate\/heard by others at times. Unfortunately, I cannot really think of a good workaround for this. I appreciated Professor Zarin integrating 5 minute breaks into classtime."

                "Yes!! Prof Zarin is committed to working with every single student to develop their writing and thinking, and the class gives you space to delve deeply into whatever you want to write about. The peer environment that the professor cultivates is the best I've ever experienced, and i learnt a huge amount from editing and being edited by other students. Overall a great course that both stretched me and never overwhelmed.",
                "Yes!! The workload is no joke with an essay basically every other week and drafts in between but your writing will definitely improve",
                "Certainly! This was such a wonderful course and the depth of discussion and topics people wrote about really moved me. Much needed class in the midst of this pandemic!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about improving their writing and being accountable to a small, intimate community of peers as they learn. I also recommend this class if one does not have too heavy of a schedule besides this course - it is really time intensive, labor intensive, and emotionally . demanding. Professor Zarin's comments are detailed and helpful. But developing a thick skin is definitely part of the experience in this class.",
                "Yes. This course requires you to follow through with your ideas, which is often lost in courses where you write something for a deadline, and then forget about it. Peer engagement is really strong, and you get to build connections with other students who are as devoted to thought as you are. I benefited a lot from their commentary, attention and honesty."
