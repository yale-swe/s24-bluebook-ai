    "Strengths: interesting content, great discussion format, wonderful and brilliant teacher, small class size, EXTREMELY generous deadlines and workload, provided you actually do put in the effort. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class was a bit disorganized, and at times I dont think I really received any input on how I was doing in the course or what I could\/should improve on, especially leading up to the final."

    "Yeah! If you liked Historical 1, this is like the real linguistics version of that. There wont be right answers, only debates where you have to justify your responses. You will learn a great deal about things you had never really considered before, and youll get the chance to do it from a professor who is brilliant and caring."
