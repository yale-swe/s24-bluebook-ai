                "Strengths: a great way to get your physics lab requirements in a shorter time period. Also had occasional guest speakers which as very beneficial for our learning.\r\nWeaknesses: often ran out of time to finish labs in one session (so ran into other sessions, which we were given time for so it did not make things more stressful). Maybe next time just ensure there is enough time to complete a lab in one session, or structure the labs so that they can be completed in one session.",
                "everything is good. just a little bit more organization",
                "Great course, no work outside of class, low stress and you learn a lot",
                "Strengths: self-directed nature of the experiments, flexibility to work in groups, accessible teaching team, weekend office hours, reasonable workload, guest speakers, Yale lab tours. Weaknesses: absolutely none, this course was amazing!",
                "This course was awesome in that I felt much more engaged with the material because I didn't feel that I was constantly fighting to keep up with work or achieve a certain grade. I really appreciated how most of the workload fell within the class period, as it kept me super engaged during class time. We covered such interesting topics and the course was well-organized for a first-time class.",
