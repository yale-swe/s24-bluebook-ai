                "The problem sets align well with the course content, though we were behind by the end, especially with the problem set due during reading week. The course does a solid job of building upon itself and, by the final week, everything fits together. Perhaps more foreshadowing of this would have been better, though I did enjoy the explanation of why we were learning triple integrals (the Divergence theorem) before we spent time on the topic.\r\n\r\nMore review would have improved the course around the midterms; we would be two weeks ahead in terms of content in a lecture and then take the midterm that evening.",
                "The lecture videos for the course on canvas were helpful for learning the information. I wish they reduced the amount of tedious calculation in the psets.",
                "This course touched on a broad variety of topics relating to multivariable calculus; in addition, connections with topics in physics were made. There were a lot of resources (e.g. office hours, practice problems, review sessions, peer tutoring) to supplement student learning.",
                "The videos provided before each class were very helpful in learning the material. I also liked how there were lots of practice problems and practice exams available to help students for midterms and the finals. I don't have any complaints.",
                "I had to rely more on videos than I probably would've liked to, but that might just be due to the nature of the content. Not a fan of having PSETs due the week of a test. Peer Tutors were very good. PSETs are much harder than the tests so they prepare you well.",
                "This course requires you to learn the content 3 times - once by watching videos, once by reading the textbook, and once in class. This can be helpful (for me, for example; I have auditory processing issues so reading the book is my best way of learning), but it also seems redundant and encourages students to not come to class.",
                "Section is often a repetition of the videos and textbook and is often not helpful. Should be replaced with group work or in person P-Sets.",
                "A strength of the course is the amount of supplemental resources to help you if you need more help outside of class like peer tutoring, Ximera, coaching sessions, and pre-class videos. However, I'd say the structure of the class in person was a weakness. The pre-class videos were supposed to just be a primer for class where we would learn the information and then do group work. However, we didn't do group work that often, and the class didn't really go over the information in-depth, so the pre-class videos became a primary source of my knowledge of the course material. However, it sounds like this experience differed based on section. I feel like more class time could have been dedicated to working through problems similar to those seen on the psets and exams because class problems were often pretty straightforward, but then pset questions would expand on these in ways we hadn't really gone over."
