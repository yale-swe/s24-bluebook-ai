                "It depends on your perspective on psychology. I think one of the strengths of this course is the fact that it is one of the few social psychological courses available at Yale and exposes students to robust opportunity to delve into social psychological science. However, I think it is also incredibly challenging and dense course material to read. Dr. Richeson does a great job of teasing out interrogations of the content and laying the foundation for why the literature focuses so extensively on some subjects as opposed to others, but it still left a strange feeling for me. The discipline of social psychology, particularly in this domain, is grappling with how we conceptualize stigma and I don't know if I feel entirely comfortable with the approach that stigma is an inevitability that we are drawn towards expressing in some way, shape, or form. I think what helped a little bit was the fact that we spoke on this a bit and how the discipline occasionally seems like it's trying to \"make excuses\" for bigotry, but I felt like it wasn't enough because we didn't focus as much time on efforts that have successfully undermined and corrected these processes. Perhaps that's because of the discipline's relatively young nature, but I still found it troubling and frustrating to navigate the course content with the perpetual reminder that all of this behavior was \"natural.\" That being said, I think that many students who lean more so in the domain of neuropsychology could substantially benefit from this course because it offers an opportunity for introspection and clarification that many Yale students have never had to engage in. The course can occasionally dangerously teeter into a therapy circle because of this, but I believe it is well-managed and redirected expertly. Personally, I didn't enjoy the course, but I believe that the majority of students would not only benefit from but enjoy this course."
