            "comments": [
                "tzb is delightful but I feel like our class and TZb just weren't on the same page this year and didn't really understand one another and that was frustrating because i feel like i saw the fractures of miscommunication. i think a huge issue was that a lot of students came into the class thinking it would be an easy 5th credit and then when things started feeling overwhelming in the course, i don't think they had the resources to understand what they should focus on or not and i think tzb's then language of like grades don't matter\/i've lowered my expectations felt more discouraging. i think that a group conversation on what we hope to gain from this course, creating a group intentionality would be helpful. also the late night time made it challenging without the dinner aspect and also the lessened community aspect. i think another issue\/strength was that on one hand, it was amazing to delve into CRT and get this foresight for the senior capstones. on the other hand, i think that then at some point, you want to learn about other things. like learning about CRT and related topics for an entire semester in a class that wasn't branded as being about CRT has the depth but loses any breadth or any other interests students might have. i did love interviewing a teacher tho and I think that was so interesting and valuable to learn from teachers directly. i think office hours with tzb are really nice she cares about forming a real personal and academic relationship with you",
                "One of the strengths of this course is how dedicated everyone--professor included--is to education studies. I was really excited about taking this course because I had heard such great things about the community building that came with it; and, while I do think I experienced some of that towards the end of this course, I think we lacked that for the most part this semester. Additionally, the beginning of this course involved a large quantity of readings, which I found to be overwhelming and difficult to include in class discussions. I also wish there had been more feedback on the assignments we completed towards the end of the semester.",
                "I feel like it's hard to separate some of the weaknesses and strengths of this class. Part of that depends on whether the question is related to any potential version of 261 or a specific version of 261 that is similar to how it was structured this semester. For a version of the class structured like this semester, the strengths I saw were giving more clarity of context to current debates in education and in helping us (students) put research skills into practice. There were some issues with classes and assignments, but it was a weird semester. However, the weakness of this course most definitely has to be that it doesn't seem to allow for community building the way previous not-full-credit iterations of 261 seem to have.\r\n\r\nI want to break this lack of community building down because I don't want it to be dismissed as a feature of a strange year where classes had to be done remotely or a lack of effort on our (the students') part. A full credit class is antithetical to community building and the fact that connections were able to be made is a demonstration of what community could have been formed had that been the focus of the course. I think it's hard to build community in a content-driven class because you are then building connections with people in relation to the content. There were attempts a few times in the course for us to discuss with people our own histories with high school history education, but even those prompts only produce a limited personal discussion. The only day that I felt like I was able to really connect with people on an individual basis was the last day during felting.\r\n\r\nWhile I get the value of a lab-type class, I think the older version of 261 where the focus was on community would be more valuable. There may be some way to prompt more discussions by adding in a few readings in the second half of a course like that, but I'm leaving this semester kind of sad that I only know a few more people in the Ed Studies Scholars program than I did at the beginning.",
                "strengths content; weaknesses- expectations and organization of the course was incredibly confusing for students",
                "TZB is an incredible instructor and I really liked the content for this class. I think the size was too big, and I honestly think letting people ask so many questions and have so many comments took away from so much of the learning and discussion we could have done. I wanted to discuss the material but it rarely felt like we were able to. That was in no way TZBs fault tho and much more us students fault.",
                "I think having more structure could have helped",
                "I did really enjoy this course. It was a course I always felt good walking into, and was, on the whole, a relatively relaxing course which let me get to know my edstudies cohort better, while still learning a lot of things relevant to the current moment in education policy and methods for education studies research. Prof tzb also really cares about students and material. \r\nIt's hard to talk about strengths and weaknesses of this course because it seems to vary from year to year, and there doesn't seem to be a set curriculum. This is at once a strength, since prof tzb was able to tailor the course to current topics, but also a weakness, since the class felt unstructured to a degree that sometimes I wasn't entirely sure where the class was going, or what was expected of me, etc. Zoom\/hybrid learning definitely hurt this course, but that's not a fault of this course in particular, just how it happened :( - in person, tzb is amazing at leading students to synthesize points from readings by taking many threads and gently guiding students along to make a point; over zoom, this was a lot harder. - The length of the class times - almost 2 hours each - were also double edged swords; sometimes they were long and tiring, but sometimes it was good having the whole time, since it allowed us to have a lot of time to just talk among ourselves and build community without losing time for content (e.g. - one time we did a circle where we went around and said something kind about the next person, which took a while but was very restorative for me) - and also having a lot of time to work through content helped tzb make points without needing to rush. - There are also a lot of people in this course, mostly because it's the entire edstudies cohort - which, again, was awesome since we got to hang out with a lot good people, but also meant that it was sometimes difficult to build community because of the class size. \r\nThe most glaring weakness were the assignments - not the assignments in themselves, which I thought were all relatively reasonable (research paper, discussion posts, etc.), but the way that they were never really structured, and I didn't really get feedback \/ know what was expected of me for each assignment. I think this may have been because this is a course which is really hard to facilitate (it's a seminar with a lot of people), and also since this was the first year it was graded not on P\/F scale, but a little more structure definitely would have helped the course. \r\nOverall - relaxing course which got me in touch with what is going on in education right now, and also the edstudies students around me, which I was grateful for :)",
                "TZB struck a great balance between having us learn the history and context that frames these debates with having us engage in news as it was happening. We were challenged to think critically but also guided well as we learned.",
                "Strengths: sitting in a circle, engaging in conversation with all classmates, option to do work with partners",
                "strength: really valuable readings, suitable assignments and modules, while also being very present in the process of helping us grow as students who wish to make education more equitable for all",
                "Strengths: The students in the colloquium.\r\nWeaknesses: I was not really sure what to expect with this course, especially since it was the first time the colloquium was formally a one-credit class. TZB was also trying to figure it out throughout the semester, so I felt a bit confused at times about what exactly was expected of us and what the purpose of the colloquium was. I wish we had more of an opportunity to get to know our cohort members in the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor TZB is amazing! Her knowledge of history and the culture wars and education allowed us to make timelines of understanding the recurring waves and iterations of debates of parents rights in education. In addition to her knowledge and advice on formulating research questions and processes TZB is one of the most supportive (and supportively challenging) professors.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the format of the class suffered as a result of the pandemic with the initial two weeks online and then hybrid classes which did not work as well with the classroom set up (these are not intrinsic to the class however). I think there were some different expectations from different students on what the class would be like which at times added confusion to the group. The IRB training we completed was a bit stressful because the website was not clear and it had a hard deadline that was important for a larger deadline - having a walk through of this could be helpful for future times when\/if IRB training is required. At times the reading load was large, but overall manageable.",
                "Prof. TZB is a major strength of the course. Her background as a historian and commitment to a depth of learning for her students was such a complement to the class topic which was focused on current events in education. It was also really great to essentially complete a mini-EDST capstone in the class (very mini, we were supporting another students work). Especially if you are unfamiliar with humanities research, it served as a great intro to the work well have to do senior year. Since the cohort was big, it may be necessary to make a concerted effort to make connections with your classmates and TZB outside of class (but with gift cards for coffee chats and very flexible office hours, this is also easy to achieve)!"

I would recommend it as it provided relevant background to issues of education right now (like debates of CRT, private education, control of curriculum) and also imparted critical research skills to the class.",
                "Absolutely! It is required for education studies scholars, but if you are at all considering doing the program definitely doI!!! I was deciding between the scholars program and the certificate, and I am so glad that I chose to be a scholar. The relationships you build with the community and with TZB truly make the program worth it!"
