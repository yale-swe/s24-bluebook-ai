Much of the material is experimentally-driven (like the topic itself), and therefore we learned a lot about different experiments emblematic of the topic discussed.

                "Strengths: Both profs were great and engaging lecturers. The material was super interesting and relevant. The problem sets really made you think and practice looking through primary literature. The project proposal is a good opportunity to practice skills useful for grad school\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more help available for undergrads who are not as familiar with the material. The professor did have office hours but those were intimidating to show up to when people who knew a lot more would ask questions that went way over my head. The weekly section was not helpful at all and it would have been nice if that time was used better. The problem sets were graded wayyyyy too harshly",
                "The class was definitely interesting if you like chemistry, and it's good that they touch on very current research. Sometimes material in one lecture can be a bit dense, and needs to be parsed later.",
                "The biggest strength was Professor Slavoff. She was always available to give advice or answer questions. She explained the topics well and seemed to care about the students. Professor Crawford was not like this. My peers and I emailed him multiple times and he would either not reply or he would deflect from answering. It is very disheartening when a teacher does not care a lot about their course. The p-sets were also a weakness. The grading felt arbitrary and I felt like I was answering the question but not with enough detail, which was not obvious from the wording. I also think a biochemistry course should be suggested as an additional prerequisite, not just BIO 101 & 102, too much of this course builds on topics that were not covered. This last part does not take away too much from the quality, but the warning would have been nice.",
                "Strength: responsive teachers, smaller group, freedom on group presentation and significant feedback on work for projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of cohesiveness in subjects (the course felt like a string of topics without structure or a designed plan), fast-paced and little guidance on what is wanted, inconsistent grading.",
                "Lectures were sometimes a mess (depending on the day and who lectured), and although I enjoyed presenting my own \"NSF proposal,\" it was difficult to stay engaged with other students' presentations. I did appreciate that our TA uploaded the slides afterwards, and that there were recordings available, because there was a lot of material to write down\/learn in the live lecture.",
                "Strengths of this course include PSETs every two weeks (which I thought was better than PSETs every week) and the curriculum (i.e. NSF-like proposal and presentation at the end of the term). Weaknesses include exam and PSET material that wasn't sometimes covered in class: a lot of outside reading needed to be done to answer these questions (for me, I needed to look up 3-5 papers per PSET... exams usually played off of the PSET questions and therefore the outside papers). If this course is designed to encourage outside reading, then nothing needs to change (this skill is good to have anyways, in my opinion). However, if it is not designed as such, then providing relevant papers (or rewriting questions) would help. In other words, focusing the PSET on material taught explicitly in class."

However, I appreciated the slides being uploaded after class and having recordings available if I needed them.",

                "I would recommend it only if you have sufficient background in organic chemistry and biology. As a junior undergrad I felt a little underprepared, but I was able to catch up after a few weeks of understanding how the course worked (basically, primary literature is your best friend). Even though the course was pretty challenging, I really really enjoyed the material and I felt like I learned a lot. I also am much more comfortable with reading papers which is a great skill to have.",

                "I think I would recommend this course if the p sets were improved and it was only Professor Slavoff. If a student has background in biochem then I would recommend this course. I thought it would cover more general topics, but they are very specific to different techniques and methods, so if a student is looking for this then I recommend.",
                "I would only recommend this to someone who is interested specifically in chemical biology.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemical biology. The psets are a hard to get through because they are written poorly\/are confusing, but I think they help you engage with the material\/literature better, especially because the lectures sometimes go too fast\/are not well organized. Take advantage of office hours as well as emailing your TA, they will save you in this class! Also, I really enjoyed being able to come up with our own \"NSF proposal\" and being able to present it to the class. If you already have research experience in chem bio, this class may be less intellectually stimulating than others, but you will still learn a lot from areas of chem bio outside your research expertise.",
                "I would recommend this course only if 1) you REALLY want an education in chemical biology, or 2) you are a chemistry major and you are trying to fulfill a requirement. I would highly recommend taking MB&B 300\/301 before this course, however: it will help you IMMENSELY. This course is an upper-level chem course, so I cannot imagine many people will take this course outside of the the CHEM\/MB&B area. A lot of the material was pretty cool, but again, really in-depth and you will come out the other side of this course knowing quite a lot about chemical biology. NOTE: please look up what \"chemical biology\" means... it is essentially co-opting naturally occurring processes to do chemistry. I, unfortunately, went into this class thinking it would be like biochemistry (just STUDYING the naturally occurring processes), but NO, it is about the application of such processes (or developing similar processes) to human endeavors. It made my little evolutionary biology and physiology brain sad, but I learned a lot about innovation in the human world."
