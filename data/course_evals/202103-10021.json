Theoretical and grounding readings were really enjoyable as well, understanding economics through an ER&M lens. Discussions were quite informative and productive.",

                "strengths: \r\n- prof okihiro is amazing: he obviously cares deeply about making class personal & impactful & meaningful for us, and he does a really good job of showing what's at stake in academia. he's also just so kind: he seems genuinely committed to helping all of his students learn, and expresses a degree of care that I've felt only very rarely from professors at Yale. take this class for him alone! \r\n- angie, our TA, was also amazing: she brought her personal interests into the class in a way that really enriched our discussions. she did a great job of leading class discussion & helping me to brainstorm my final project \r\n- the content was fascinating!! I really enjoyed our readings & discussions, and I learnt so much from prof okihiro's mini lectures\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- the class felt slightly disorganized at times. this isn't necessarily a weakness, because there were broad themes that tied it together (imperialism, labor, knowledge, capitalism + expropriation, etc.) and I appreciated the flexibility \/ openness, but I think a slightly tighter structure would've helped me to get more out of this class. this could come through changes to the syllabus or just through more explicit demarcation of how the week's readings complicate \/ elaborate the themes from previous weeks, either through canvas announcements before class, through reading response prompts, or through the mini-lecture prof okihiro delivers at the beginning of class",
                "This was a great course, with a professor and TF who were obviously passionate about the subject, education in general, and in making sure that everyone could participate in complex and considered discussion.",
                "Strengths: Angie and Professor Okihiro worked together super well as TF and Professor. I wish small group activities had been part of the class from the beginning, but I'm glad they got incorporated in the middle! Loved hearing people's presentations at the end."

                "yes!",
                "Yes, absolutely. It helps to question the world around us, including the institution under which we are learning.",
                "Yes! Take this course if youre interested in the material; the instructors are both passionate and engaging. Conversations and discussions in class were fantastic, and students brought in great final projects.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class!",
                "Yes! This class was a good upper level seminar that I took as an EVST major course, and could see it fulfilling a similar place in AMST or ER&M etc. Professor Okihiro is a fantastic professor and the books we read were good."
