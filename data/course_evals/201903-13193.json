    "I learned about the inception and history of radio, artistic and political responses to the medium, and the sociological factors that led to the way radio works today.",
    "How radios work, history of radio invention, ham radio, pirate radio, sound art, pacifist and activist radio, etc.",
    "I had no idea that radio had such a rich and fascinating history, and how influential it was! I will never look at the medium in the same way again",
    "I learned so much about the history of radio and the way that radio has evolved outside of networks into what it is today. I gained a greater appreciation for the medium and what it has and continues to represent within American culture.",
    "I learned everything there is to know about the beginning of radio, the development of amateur and hobby radio in advent of large corporate ventures, the rise and fall of the rock and roll and pirate DJs, the continuation of pirate radio in small clustered areas, border blasters, weather warlocks, the wave farm collective, transistors, jazz, and the personal development of a radio show in order to create art through the broadcast of original and cultivated works."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus could have been a little more organized. I loved the part at the end where we made our own radio station as a class, but I think there could have been more said about the connections between one topic and another.",
    "It gave me my life. It is perfection.",
    "The best and most challenging part was the freedom to choose our own research topics. While I loved the flexibility to follow my interests, I also found it a little overwhelming. I would have found it helpful to have a choice of paper topics or questions to respond to, at least to get the ball rolling more quickly. Apart from that, I loved this class and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anybody!",
    "I thought that Professor Kane really allowed the course to evolve to us as a class. This allowed us to dig more into transmission practices and thinking about creating a radio with the historical background that we had built and created a really exciting, creative, and intellectually stimulating classroom environment.",
    "While this course will have certain areas preferred by students, it is overall quite astounding. The only weakness I would suggest is the difficulty and abstraction of the radio art readings, but I personally struggle with most artistic concepts. I have no idea how it will be offered not as a Franke seminar, but I believe Professor Kane has expressed interest in offering it again. The biggest strength is the degree of freedom students have over their role in the course, especially during the second half. The first essay allowed students to pick and research any topic. Later, Professor Kane's usage of radio software allowed each student to create a personalized research project largely grounded in the art of radio broadcast--students (and professors) made meme ASMR, pirate broadcasts, ambient sounds of home, and \"jazz that doesn't suck,\" and learned about themselves in the process. Designing a radio show is the logical conclusion of this course and one that the class realized as we progressed, ending in the beautiful rally around the campus to broadcast their hearts into the mysterious ether."

    "OM\r\nWhen I began my sophomore fall in the old year of our lord 2019, I was nothing. I was a fool, my life was in shambles. Picture the black and white segment of a toothpaste tube-holder commercial. I had nothing, I was a speck. and not in a tasty cheese way. In an insignificant, pathetic manner. I cried myself to sleep at night, my dinners consisted of half-eaten crispy chalupas I scavenged in taco bell parking lots. My family disowned me. Love life? ha. I wandered, a vagabond, through this world. Then The Secret Life of Radio came along. [Switch to in-color segment, upbeat music cues]. \r\nI'll tell you -- maybe the life of radio was secret, but suddenly mine was not. My life was a flower that had suddenly blossomed. I sang in the shower, I reconnected with relatives. This class gave me everything. I made new friends, as we traversed the wave spectrum, traveling to a previously sorely underappreciated universe where anything goes. I wrote my first paper on 1920s and 1930s horror radio. That was a blast. When we had the opportunity to design our own radio programs to put on the air, my content was a no-brainer: I had gotten into musical absurdism since the summer, and was staunchly committed to filling my airtime with a combination of things like samplings from the 15 albums of Kids Trap (wholesome rap for kids), Matt Farley's 20,000 song library, sounds of people eating celery, and mormon pioneer music, among much, much more. I reconnected with old friends from LA to get recordings of  intros for their original songs. Suddenly, I had a wonderful idea. As I did research on my favorite artists (blakerules! of kids trap and matt farley, who goes by hundreds of artist names) (aside-- yes, there are academic articles written about people like matt farley and the app called forgotify, which feeds you an endless stream of never-before-listened-to spotify tracks), I considered the accessibility of novelty musicians to their audiences. What was stopping me? The world was my oyster! No more crispy chalupas! I resolved to call my two favorite artists for a phone interview. I started with Matt Farley, since he publicizes his personal phone number, and called him up on a random monday night. He picked up and we had a great talk-- he even invited me to his comedy show in Danvers, MA, and offered to write a custom song about the class for free. Encouraged by my success with Farley, I turned my attention to kids trap. I wasnt sure how to contact blakerules but I found him on instagram (and integrated some comments on his posts into my paper on him). I dmd him the entire explanation of what I was doing, asking permission to play his music on the air and interview him, and he agreed. During the interview, it slipped out that I play the violin, and he asked me to collab on a new album that dropped yesterday. Now I get thirty percent of streaming percentages. Meanwhile, Farleys songs have allowed me to reach new lows of social accountability. For example, his sorry apology song album included songs like Im sorry I threw up all over your grandma. You can bet that if I threw up all over your grandma, I would opt to just text you that song over apologizing in person (let alone apologizing to grandma herself). In november, I asked someone to a formal using one of Farley's [name], will you go to the prom with me? songs, and they agreed. We are now happily dating. One of my fellow students is visiting LA and is coming to my house party; this class has brought me not only romance, but friendship. And when my mom heard my program, she was so blown away she decided to dis-dis-own me, so we good now.Professor Kane supported me through the whole journey, even tolerating me as I integrated multiple interrobangs and sces in my papers. He made it clear his office was always open, a safe space. Sometimes we would just hang out, using radio dongles to eavesdrop on hospital walki-talki conversations. This class has given me everything. I recommend.",
    "Yes, particularly if theyre curious about how our modern media landscape evolved, and\/or in how music became so ubiquitous and personal at the same time.",
    "Yes! The course is such an interesting way to think about art, media, and American history and the way they all interact with each other.",
    "I do not know what form this course will take, as it will be very unlikely to be offered with enough funding to dine with radio experts again (Franke seminars can only be offered as such once). At the time I took this course, it had an additional component of listening to four lecturers contribute to seminars, give lectures, and eat dinner in the Whitney Humanities Center, which helped bind our class together quite well. Regardless, even in a somewhat lesser form, I highly recommend you take this course. Professor Kane is a kind, relatable delight bursting with a genuine enthusiasm for radio (evidenced in his show-and-tell of old vacuum tube sets and handmade antennae) and he sincerely wants every student to succeed. He is easily reachable, helping me program my show often minutes before it went up late at night, and provides students with a great breadth of material with which to improve themselves, even pulling up articles at office hours to help out. If this course features broadcasting in the future, it is true that the time requirement is a bit daunting, but it allows for a great deal of intelligent, abstract radio art that the course talks about. We learned about illegal heroes of radio--\"border blasters\" sending political messages to the segregated south, DJs like Wolfman Jack operating as American icons, and the pirates still operating in Brooklyn today. We learned about radio art--the often unexplored medium making a resurgence through audience interactivity on the East Coast. We learned about the founding of radio, the rise of media stations, governmental interference, and the hometown heroes catapulting electricity into stardom; meshing the rough American male with the pursuit of music.  This course is excellent, and any course offered by Professor Kane is worth your time."
