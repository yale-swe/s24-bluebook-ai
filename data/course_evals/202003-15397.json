                "This course was an excellent primer on the intersection of constitutional law and business activity through an ethical lens. We analyzed major Supreme Court cases spanning several areas of commerce and applied them to broader conceptions of justice.",
                "Solid background in ethical theory, general knowledge of important business case law.",
                "Reading analysis and comprehension, engaging in discussion, analytical and persuasive writing",
                "I really enjoyed this course with Professor Collins. This was my first exposure to business ethics, so I learned about the 4 main ethical theories that can be applied to the practice of business ethics and how business actors can use them to guide their decision-making. We also covered a great number of landmark Supreme Court cases, which I greatly enjoyed reading, and I thought that the course was very well-designed to teach us how to apply abstract ethical theories in practice in our class discussions.",
                "I gained an understanding of both constitutional analysis as well as ethical theories, particularly as they pertain to the economic sphere of life. Throughout the course, I became better equipped to evaluate competing legal and ethical perspectives, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each.",
                "Much better analytical\/synthesis skills of written material to be able to write about the law in a way that went beyond summarization. Respectful discussion over sensitive topics where my viewpoints actually evolved and adjusted based on my classmates' interpretations.",

                "Strengths: structured discussions, class participation and intellect, small seminar size, range of topics, reasonable reading and writing workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally long lectures from Prof. Collins that interrupted class debate, students dropping out post-midterm (presumably due to grading, which was very reasonable)",
                "Strength: I enjoyed the occasional formal debates. I also thought the syllabus was well designed and the majority of readings were helpful in understanding course content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Probably a personal preference, but I thought the course focused far too much on ethical theory. I really would have preferred a deeper dive into actual caselaw and jurisprudence, rather than on abstract theory.",
                "Overall wasn't satisfied with the entire semester being online, but I have nothing to complain about the professor and how the class was taught!",
                "I absolutely loved our class discussions. these were some of the most insightful conversations I've had into the nitty-gritty details of constitutional law that I've had at Yale, and Professor Collins did an awesome job in making sure that we always stayed on track of the cases and ethical theories that we meant to discuss. I also greatly appreciated how Professor Collins always provided us with supplemental reading materials above and beyond what we were immediately discussing in class, as this always provided me with an outlet for my intellectual curiosity outside of class. One thing that I think could be improved is how Professor Collins shared information on the Zoom format. Zoom classes were definitely hard, but I found the whiteboard way of presenting information a little bit difficult to follow and thought maybe a PowerPoint might be a more organized format for understanding the information.",
                "Strengths: Strong discussions, interesting case studies such as the CEO scenarios, and excellent guests. Fulfills its purpose well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "Strengths: you learn a LOT and the reading responses are very engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading, I think a lot of it ends up not getting discussed in depth which leaves quite a few unanswered questions"

                "This was a pretty standard seminar conducted on Zoom. Since fewer than 10 students were enrolled, the online format could handle active discussion. Professor Collins sometimes made use of anonymous polling, which helped structure debates. Hard to improve the situation, but online learning still can't replicate in-person class.",

                "I do think having office hours over Zoom is very convenient, because you don't have to walk and go to the professor's office in-person. If we kept that a thing post-COVID, I'd be okay with that.",

                "Yes, for those looking to better understand constitutional law. I felt like the business ethics aspect of the course was less emphasized, as it was more overwhelmed by the Court cases, history\/approaches of jurisprudence, etc. So for those who are interested, be prepared to learn more about constitutional law than ethics.",
                "Yes. I had a great time learning about both abstract philosophy and very important Supreme Court case law. Also, Professor Collins was extremely accessible in helping me better understand the concepts we were discussing in class.",
                "Absolutely. This course kills two birds with one stone, both enabling you to better grasp the development of how law affects economics and personal rights, as well as the ethical implications of various court decisions. It challenges your preconceptions of moral business behavior and just court rulings. By the end, even if your thinking has changed, you should know why that has been the case and be able to defend your reasoning.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Collins is a helpful discussion moderator and an excellent facilitator. He pushed us to connect the class topics of ethics and law together and created an environment to really learn and grow from each others' viewpoints.",
                "Yes, I think it gives a good review of the ethical concepts and how to apply them to legal questions."
