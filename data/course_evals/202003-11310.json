                "Strengths: Professor Radin and my TA were very understanding that students were all over the world and dealing with various aspects of the global pandemic. They were more than accommodating especially by removing midterm and final exams, and instead allowing us to explore our own experiences with COVID-19 through the final project. I appreciate all of their effort in helping us get through this semester!\r\nWeaknesses: Not any really.",
                "Strenght: the teaching staff is very understanding and make the class enjoyable",
                "I honestly cannot think of a single weakness for this course. The final project, the History of the Present project gave us tremendous space to understand our current moment. The course is taught in such a way that it allows for conversation and allows students to learn from one another. Even though the course was a lecture with about 80 students, it felt like a seminar.",
                "Strengths: the material was interesting, I loved our guest speakers and the lectures given by the TAs, the professor was always very engaged and enthusiastic, the course was very accommodating of students' circumstances during the pandemic.",
                "The course is great as is! Its *so* rare that a professor strikes the balance between curating informative\/interesting course material AND cultivating a healthy learning environment\/work load. Whether you have no, little or a lot of prior experience in global health, you should definitely take this class! The TFs are also amazing people!",
                "strengths: Prof Radin was extremely understanding, as was my TF Kelsey. They were so kind and made this class a wonderful experience and not stressful at all, which was really nice given the virtual semester. \r\nweakness: lectures felt a little bit disorganized",

                "Professor was very kind and understanding but it feels like we missed out on learning interesting material in favor of more frivolous conversation.",
                "This was a fantastic course that allowed a lot of freedom in the curriculum and helped us all deal with the pandemic in a new way. I think the one weakness is that the level of reading we have is a bit high, but the readings are not discussed much in lecture.",
                "Strength: Professor Radin and the TAs were so accommodating. This semester was obviously different from most and they helped create a really nice support system. This class did not have any exams and the course was flexible with the readings for discussion. I also appreciated how it culminated in a project that had us take what we were leaning in class to share our experiences about living through the pandemic.",
                "I like how the course was very flexible in structure allowing for people to participate in both a live virtual lecture and a recorded lecture as well. The course also had many guest speakers which gave me a more diversified perspective of the current pandemic and its affects to places all over the world. The readings were also interesting and doable, often covering a wide variety of topics.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were super informative, Professor Radin is amazing\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes having student conversations during lectures could go dry",
                "The material was easily accessible to people with varying degrees of knowledge about the history of science. I think that the course would've benefitted from using a longer timespan, because you can't understand colonial afterlives if you don't have a good grasp on colonialism.",
                "Professor Radin and all the TFs were so great about listening to the students and not feeling stuck to the syllabus. I loved Professor Radin's style of lecturing and I think the course was even more enriched by having guest lecturers in the field as well.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive yet extremely flexible, adaptable, and forgiving this class operated with students' wellbeing at the forefront which I'm still very appreciative of\r\nI'm still amazed at how much I was able to learn in a setting that wasn't punitive and demanding as classes in elite academic institutions tend to be\r\nWeaknesses: I would appreciate a bit more context on the readings (both primary AND secondary), even if it's a short blurb or reading outside of class because I know we weren't always able to cover that historical context as planned in class due to the pandemic",

                "I felt that overall, the workload was very reasonable except for readings, which I felt were a bit long and mundane. I also felt that having an online course with over 20 students makes it difficult to encourage participation, which made for some awkward quiet moments.\r\n\r\nHowever, I felt the course did really well in introducing a fair amount of concepts and diving into them a decent amount. I also appreciated the flexibility and freedom we had with our semester projects.",
                "The strengths definitely include the passion and expertise of the professor and TFs. They were all so knowledgeable of the material for the class and were a great resource for being able to talk through and better understand the material of the class. It was also very clear how much they cared about this course and how much students were gaining from it. I feel like any of the \"weaknesses\" in this class would only be from the fact that it was virtual and that class discussions and discussion sections would have been even more stimulating had it been in person.",
                "strength - interesting and low time commitment\r\nweaknesses - low engagement in breakout rooms",
                "Strengths: Professor Radin is an incredibly kind professor. Understanding the current hectic state due to the pandemic, she would be empathetic during class, and also connect the topics we were learning to the current situation. The readings were also always very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: It could be a bit easy to put this class on the back burner and not engage as much.",
                "Strengths: Course content managed to cover a LOT while still engaging in case studies with a level of depth and analysis, readings were not too onerous and all felt relevant\/salient\/impactful and covered new ground, final was a project of our choice which created flexibility based on our interests, lectures were informal\/had opportunity for questions and dialogue which made it more engaging, Professor Radin is brilliant\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The lectures and discussions with global health experts were the best, most rewarding parts. I understand why the freewheeling class discussions were introduced, but found them less worthwhile. Maybe put us in small groups to become friends outside of class next time?",
                "The readings for this course were super interesting and I liked how lectures were very relevant to our current circumstances with covid and social distancing. Perhaps one area for improvement could be tying in the larger themes from readings into lectures.",
                "No suggestions for improvement! I thought the instructors and TFs did a wonderful job. I appreciated that all aspects of the course were both offered live and recorded.",
                "This course was absolutely amazing. The syllabus balances breadth and depth quite nicely. Professor Radin was also extremely accommodating and understanding, and ensured that the course structure accounted for the rather unusual circumstances students faced during this semester.",
                "Strengths: I have never felt so supported in a class. The professor and teaching assistants were incredibly understanding and kind, and given all of the tumultuous events of this year, I (and surely many others) really, really appreciated it. I didn't think I'd like the final project because the idea itself was so open-ended, but it ended up being a highlight of my semester and actually a really effective way to think about global health at this moment. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was a little more structure. It was nice that the professor and TAs were so understanding, but at the same time, I felt like lectures devolved into unrelated discussions. I personally would have liked more tight-knit lectures about global health itself.",
                "amazing course. perfect",
                "While I appreciate that this course tried to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of teaching was disappointing. Almost half of the lectures were conversations, many of which focused on the topic of the coronavirus pandemic without historical context and instead re-hashings of the news. Lectures were rare, and we instead engaged in 'dialogue' that I did not find academically stimulating or seemed to require much effort on the part of the professor. The few content-driven lectures we did have were interesting, which is what made this course all the more frustrating to me.",
                "HSHM 212 had a strong emphasis on key concepts and application rather than memorization. Professor Radin was personable and highly invested in both learning and student health.",
                "This course truly adapted to student's needs as the semester went on. It was a great example of taking feedback and adjusting.",
                "The strengths of this class include the empathy with which the course was carried out by the instructors and the structure of the final project, which was incredibly helpful in concluding the class and summarizing the semester.",
                "The information taught in this course was interesting and relevant. Also, I liked that were lots of opportunities to participate in the lectures.",
                "One strength of this course was how we often deviated from the original syllabus to discuss relevant current events.  This made the class more interesting, especially because of Covid.",
                "I greatly appreciate that this was a course that was very understanding and accommodating for all students, and I would say that we learned just as much if we weren't in a pandemic, if not more.",
                "The class was really great and very accommodating to students and the situations of the COVID pandemic. It would have been nice to have some leniency with attending scheduled lecture and discussion times, maybe the lectures being recorded? But this is a minor change.",
                "Weakness: I think that the class became very lenient and a little unengaging, but I think this was well-intentioned in order to ease the pressure of the pandemic.\r\nStrengths: The sections were really interesting with great discussions.",
                "This course was truly amazing. Professor Radin was incredibly aware and conscious of the struggles many students have been facing in the midst of COVID. This course gave me hope that Yale Professors and Yale Courses have the potential to connect to real world problems.",
                "this course was amazing! my favorite this semester",
                "I found every lecture engaging and interesting. I also felt that my concerns were well heard by the teaching fellows and the professor if anything ever came up.",
                "Professor was awesome and content was interesting",
                "Professor Radin did a wonderful job of incorporating discussion and lecture in content during the course, making it incredibly engaging and interesting.",
                "very flexible in workload",
                "One strength of this course was the flexibility offered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We only had one weekly reading response that was due, and the grading was super lenient and pretty much anything you submitted received full credit. Also, I liked that the class was geared toward completing a final project over the course of the semester, as it allowed me to explore what interested me the most about global health. \r\n\r\nI would say the only weakness of this course is that sometimes there seemed to be a lack of structure. Sometimes, during class sessions when we were scheduled to discuss very interesting global health concepts, we would go on tangents and just skip over the material as a whole. As such, I feel like I learned a little less than I could have otherwise.",
                "The professor is incredible. She is so thoughtful and kind, and chose amazing TFs",
                "this course was amazing due to Professor Radin's flexibility and willingness to let the conversation flow based on the students, however I wish the readings could've been a little more connected to the lecture material"

All readings were provided for free and accommodations were made to meet the needs of all students. Professor Radin was so understanding if you needed anything and was always available to meet students wherever they were. This course should be a model for how all courses should be taught.",
                "Professor Radin was empathetic to the fact that we're living through a pandemic, and more professors should focus on developing empathy like her. There were a lot of opportunities to engage with the course and course topics (guest speakers, section, semester-long project, etc.) without pressure to perform as if everything is normal in the world. There was plenty of support from the Professor and TFs to gain whatever insights you wanted to from lecture, section, assignments, etc--they created a great learning environment.",
                "Being lenient and understanding was extremely helpful and made me appreciate the class more",
                "This class was the only class that truly was empathetic to students' circumstances this semester. Thank you!",
                "I think Professor Radin did an excellent job of adjusting to the realities of the pandemic. I never felt like her class forced me to pretend that there wasn't a pandemic going on, and Professor Radin tried to create a community-like classroom environment where we could discuss a lot of the things we were observing and enduring. She also made the material engaging and timely and encouraged examination of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on global health.",
                "Sections were good, but mine didn't seem that engaging. I'm not sure people had much to say, and that might be because they weren't as engaged in lecture.",
                "The flexibility of the TFs and professor Radin was amazing and very helpful. They were all so understanding and positive. Only thing I think should change is that when we discuss things in class, the screen sharing should be turned off to facilitate seeing each other's videos.",
                "I appreciated how flexible Professor Radin was! She tried to make sure students were as involved as we could be in terms of giving her feedback about the course throughout the semester.",
                "The class was very flexible which allowed for a reduced stress environment that was still engaging. There were recorded lectures and live session, the Task were very flexible with assignment due dates, and the professor was understanding.",
                "Use of break-out rooms was effective. Lecture and section format were great.",
                "I truly think all aspects of the course geared toward learning in the pandemic were successful. I think the semester project really encapsulated the spirit of the course and highlighted all the positive things that this class brought.",
                "Consistently checking in with the class about where we were at in terms of our capacity for traditional learning was very important. The adaptability and emphasis on care and wellbeing in this class were absolutely key to its success.",
                "This course was extremely flexible according to the timing of world issues. Sometimes discussion sections would be cancelled and reading responses too. We had no expectations for what our weekly reading responses were supposed to look like. The professor routinely made space for anyone to come forward and speak on anything that they felt should be brought up in class, particularly during times when the pandemic was creating most damage alongside global protests against police brutality, racism, and anti-Blackness. I am so grateful to Professor Radin and the TA's for creating my most flexible course this semester because the peace of mind they gave me actually allowed me to learn more.",
                "The lectures were always recorded and posted which was great in case of emergencies and times where I was unable to show up synchronously. If I wanted, I could have not shown up but each lecture was so interesting and exciting that I wanted to each class. We also had a few guest lecturers and it was great to see some new faces after being on Zoom with the same people for months. The readings were always super accessible which I also appreciated.",
                "succeeded - kind and understanding TAs who were flexible with deadlines. definitely a fresh breath of air compared to a lot of my other classes. thank you so much for this class!",
                "Creating a semester-long project on the \"History of the Present\" really helped us all reflect on the current state of the pandemic.",
                "The lecture started off with music each time which did a great job at centering me and creating a more comfortable learning environment. There were interactive elements as Professor Radin engaged with the chat and with everyone in lecture, and also had q+a sessions with guest lecturers. She also had lectures that didn't have slides and were more of 'conversations' where we could engage in discussions about how the course related to current events. The final for this class was a project, which meant we didn't have to stress about online exam software breaking or different time zones.",
                "The flexibility in the final project was very much appreciated.",
                "This class should not have focused so aggressively on COVID-19. I am living this pandemic and addressing our current reality in every class was not an effective way to teach all of global health and instead often reiterated what I could find in the news. Virtual lecture was fine, when given, and the slideshows were effective.",
                "Course was very well suited to remote learning",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded.",
                "I thought that the virtual lecture and discussion sections were incredibly successful. There were only very minor technical difficulties during the semester but nothing that impeded learning.",
                "What succeeded was the open, non-judgemental communication with the professor and TAs with the students, which is key.",
                "The professor and TFs were very open to criticism and suggestions about how to hold their lectures and classes, and were understanding of how the current situation has an impact on our class and our whole lives.",

                "Yes, definately.",
                "I would overall recommend this course. I think the format of the course was quite different this semester than in previous years, but really focused on giving students a free space to discuss the material as well as not be stressed by additional work.",
                "Yes, it was fun and interactive! The lessons taught were very interesting and showed you the different perspectives.",

                "Yes. Especially given the pandemic, I think it's really important for students to know about the evolution of public health throughout the years. Professor Radin is so enthusiastic and passionate about her work, which is great for lecture.",
                "100% take it and in all honesty tell your friends about it too. If youre interested in this class you may also want to take Sickness and Health with Carolyn Roberts. During and after COVID-19, there is so much to learn about global health regardless of your major. If nothing else, COVID-19 shows that there is not enough investment in public health infrastructure.",
                "I would recommend it for a 5th credit. Since I took it during the pandemic, there were no exams and the only work was weekly reading responses and a final project where you could do pretty much anything. Professor Radin is great and super accommodating. I do feel like the class was more abstract than I thought it would be and I wished I learned more.",
                "Yes, I think this is information that everyone should know about global health.",
                "Yes, I learned so many valuable and interesting things about global health history. It will put a lot of the events of the past several months into stark perspective. Also, I loved our guest speakers.",
                "I don't know what the true scope of this class is, so can't make a recommendation .",
                "This class changed my life, absolutely would recommend it. The perspectives you gain from this course can help you in any field.",
                "This course is amazing! It's a great introduction to global health and allows you to view health in a way that is not often explored. The professors and TAs really care about their students and it just makes for a great learning experience.",
                "Yes I would. The course is very engaging exploring the historical, social, economic, political, and cultural concepts that affect the current context of global health. It made me question the validity of current global health systems, realize how much colonialism affected modern health systems and the accessibility of medicine, and widen my perception of individualized and public health.",
                "Yes! Such an interesting class if you think you're interested in global health but don't have a firm grasp on what it is. The professor and teaching fellows are also so understanding of people's situations, this class made me want to learn instead of dreading zoom lectures.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who hasn't taken a history of science course before. This course is more of a history class for future scientists, which is great for them, but people who have taken history courses at this level before might not encounter many new ideas.",
                "YES!! I absolutely loved all aspects of this course. It is welcoming to students of all majors and provides each with a better understanding of global health and leaves you with a stronger desire to learn more.",
                "definitely take it, it's a lecture worth being in for sure",
                "I would extremely recommend taking this course! It was a pleasure to learn so much about the workings of public health.",
                "Yes; it is a wonderful introduction to the major as a whole. Also, Professor Radin did a wonderful job of explaining and compiling readings that supplement her explanations of the colonial, corporatist, exploitative, and culturally insensitive legacy of Public Health as a field.",
                "This was probably one of the most fitting classes to take during a pandemic. It put into perspective a lot of the real-life issues that we are currently facing and gave a historical context for how something like this pandemic could happen despite attempts to prevent it. It also gave attention to perspectives that are not normally always featured in usual history classes and made sure to be rightfully critical of the history and readings that we were absorbing when it was necessary. There was time set aside during lectures where we were able to talk in small groups about the content we went over before being able to share with the entire class and these were some of my favorite times in the course. The freedom that we were given with our final projects allowed students to be able to create some really interesting and amazing work.",
                "yes! it was interesting and a useful elective that gave me perspective",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS. I don't care if you're premed, a biology\/STEM person, an econ major or a history major. Just take the class, okay? The things covered in this class are so important and critical for anyone to learn about. Aspiring doctors or public health activists should DEFINITELY take this class as it gives a crash course in asking questions about medicine and medical practices and the history of medical practices in pursuit of the idea of global health. Then, the course takes a look at the idea of global health from a variety of new angles I never had even heard about, including an environmental angle, mental health, and a critical Indigenous lens. Besides the content, Professor Radin is a fantastic teacher who does a good job at getting you to think and question things and who really engages with students' opinions and interjections.",
                "Yes, whether you have a background in HSHM or not.",
                "Yes. My eyes were really opened to see how colonialism and racism have shaped healthcare, the standards of health, and who receives treatment and who doesn't.",
                "Absolutely, you learn a lot and the topics are genuinely interesting but the course load was not difficult.",
                "Yes - I'd recommend any course with Prof Radin, and this one specifically to anyone interested in studying HSHM and global health. I thought it was a great introduction to a range of topics and prepared me well to continue studying those topics in more detail.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course provides much needed historical insight into the discourse that presently constitutes global health came to be. Professor Radin is also an absolute joy and an amazing lecturer.",
                "Yes---Professor Radin is a really enthusiastic and passionate instructor, and it was really nice to have a more supportive class in an otherwise stressful year\/semester.",
                "yes. Professor makes this class something that everyone should take!",

                "Yes.",

                "Yes. It's a class that would benefit you no matter what major you are.",
                "Absolutely! It expanded my knowledge as an ERM and HSHM major, but also I think is vitally important for all students, especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic and how we have all experienced it. The professor and TFs are amazing, the reading is not excessive and is chosen carefully and thoughtfully, I loved this class I wish I could take it again.",
                "Yes, I would because it gives a good overview of global health.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students at Yale especially given current events.",
                "yes! this course was amazing",
                "Definitely!",
                "Yes! I think this class is incredibly important for people going into global health work and other related fields (i.e. environmental work, racial justice, economics, etc). It provided foundational insights about the frameworks of neoliberal institutionalism.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Radin was great and the content is something that I think all students should have the opportunity to learn",
                "Yes, this course opened me up to so many different ideas, and I think every pre-med student should take this course.",

                "Yes- Professor Radon gives very interesting and insightful lectures on topics in global public health.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn about the role that history has played in shaping global health. I personally am a very STEM person, however this class was really cool because I got to understand how colonial factors from the past play a critical role in affecting current global health efforts now. This class provided a pretty good survey of important historical events and showcased some of the pressing challenges that face global health today. Also, it is a class grounded in ethics and it raises a lot of important questions about how global health practitioners can ethically work with people from developing nations to truly form mutually beneficial partnerships.",
                "Yes. A professor who actually shows and does things to help mental health in time of COVID.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Radin and the rest of the teaching team were excellent teachers, and also an excellent support system. Global health, like many other academic realms, has an interesting and imo somewhat problematic past, which is absolutely fascinating in a historical context. For anyone who is interested in a career in global health or even just health in general, I believe this course is a must-take.",
