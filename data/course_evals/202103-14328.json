                "I gained a broad exposure to the pillars of ancient philosophy and their core ideas. In particular, I learned quite a bit about Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy. I also learned how to write a paper in philosophy, which is rather different than papers in other disciplines.",
                "I learned how to write an essay in a traditional philosophic manner, and I also developed a basic understanding of ancient philosophy that will greately help me going forward. Prior to coming to Yale I had never taken a philosophy class, but now I feel ready to go further into philosophy and really explore the texts we have looked at in more detail.",
                "A good survey of Ancient Greek and Roman philosophies as well as some medieval and Islamic philosophies with a focus on the original texts.",
                "I developed my philosophy essay writing skills, which meant learning to scrutinize another person's argument more thoroughly than ever before. Specifically, the structure of a philosophical essay (listing premises\/conclusions, making steps in an argument explicit) helped me make essays for other DS courses more clear. This course also developed my knowledge of how philosophical thought developed in ancient Greece and spread to the rest of the Western world after Plato and Aristotle; tracking their influence of later philosophers (Skeptics, St. Augustine, the medieval theologians) was helpful for understanding how reactionary and\/or communal philosophy is. The close alignment of opinions on the highest good being the attainment of Happiness, the repetition of sun analogies, and the emphasis on knowledge as a distinctly human gift\/attribute to hone convinced me that human thought is truly an arrow, with various points of view converging on foundational ideals.",
                "This course taught me a considerable amount about the origins of western philosophy, and provided an excellent overview of the classical part of the western canon. Despite having never studied philosophy in any depth before, I quickly acquired a strong understanding of the basic thoughts underpinning philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle and Aquinas. I also learnt how to read well, since the quantity of reading is very high and, because of the dense nature of philosophical treatises, it is difficult to skim read, meaning one naturally is forced to learn to read efficiently. Beyond this, I learnt how to write an analytical philosophical essay.",
                "Logic, philosophical argumentation, close reading, textual analysis, seminar-style engagement, discussion, & analysis, and writing skills.",
                "I developed the ability to write a clear and concise college paper, arguing for a certain position. Additionally, I learned to logically analyze arguments and find flaws. I gained an understanding of several schools of philosophical thought that have been influential."

            "comments": [
                "I think the texts we read are largely well-chosen: while a month each of Plato and Aristotle felt like a lot relative to how much time we spend on other authors in DS, in retrospect, the time does seem well-spent. Additionally, I think the lectures in DS philosophy were consistently the best among the three DS tracks, as they were almost always really helpful in helping us parse the often-dense texts we read. One change I think would be really helpful would be to have the philosophy lectures before the sections discussing a particular texts, so we could have a better basic understanding of the text going into section (as it is, section was frequently a lot of \"I don't understand this\").",
                "The strength of this course is the amount of material we cover and the professors that cover it. Directed Studies philosophy essentially goes from Plato and Aristotle to Dante, which is a truly amazing amount of texts. . Another strength of the course are the lecturers. With a new lecturer every week, each a leading scholar in their field, the amount of detail they go into is truly incredible. That being said, an issue with the course is that it might cover too much in too short a time. There were some texts that definitely deserved more attention than we were allowed to give them, and I left many of the classes disappointed that we couldn't keep talking about authors like Seneca, and only devoted two classes to the incredibly influential Stoic philosophy.",
                "Strengths: Covers most of the major authors and works in ancient philosophy\r\nWeaknesses: The distribution of texts in regard to their themes is not balanced. In this course you will read Aristotle's Categories, Physics, Metaphysics, On the Soul, and Nichomachean Ethics. I agree that Aristotle is a great philosopher, however the contents of those texts very much overlap and are arguably outdated in our contemporary context based on the principles of modern scientific methodologies. I suggest that the course should substitute some of these readings with parts of Aristotle's Politics and Poetics, texts that are much more relevant to the present day and echo the other two DS courses. Also, I cannot see the reason for including Anselm in our curriculum. Anselm has a rather ridiculous religious logic; I would rather spend more time with ancient Greek mathematical logic then reading Anselm. SJM.",
                "The strengths are the breadth and depth of content covered in such a short time, but one major weakness is that timelines and connections between philosophers can get lost in the sheer volume of content. For example, how much was Epictetus influenced by his predecessors, even while under imperial Roman rule? The through-lines we looked for were not always adequately explained for retention.",
                "The readings are spectacularly interesting, especially some of the later ones that focus on the nature of the soul and the philosophy of religion. My only real qualm with the course was the quantity of reading - it was very difficult to keep on top of and even when I did achieve this, I never really had the time to really start to analyze in proper depth the works in the way that I would have liked to (one seminar is NOT enough time to really understand someone like Maimonides!).",
                "It's a very thorough survey of western philosophy. Greater inclusivity of non-white or non-\"western\" authors would be welcomed, but I suppose that would be in contrast to the spoken aim of DS."

                "I think DS philosophy is largely a very good class, but Prof. Renaud's section was not the best. I'll start with the good: I thought the selection of texts was well thought out, and the lectures were generally very helpful. In addition, Prof. Renaud's feedback on our papers was really helpful, especially as we were learning how to write philosophy papers for the first time. However, the section itself could be improved. It often felt like Prof. Renaud was talking way more than the students, which meant that students often felt like they didn't have an opportunity to participate. It also meant that the section was often not very engaging.",
                "I would, but with the caveat that there is a lot of work, with essays and a text per week, and many of those texts are looked at with an agonizingly little amount of time. I think that Directed Studies is an excellent program, but it simply tries to cover too much ground in too short a time.",
                "Yes. Philosophy is a highly personal subject and your experience would be largely dependent on your personal background. Especially when your section is taught by a rather lenient grader, the course would be a great thought exercise and survey in the ancient philsophies.",
                "Yes - it is a really interesting overview of philosophy that is accessible for beginners and exceedingly interesting. Just try not to have any courses alongside DS that are a considerable workload.",
                "Yes! Particularly through reflections on ethics and \"practical wisdom,\" I found myself frequently referring to conclusions and arguments presented in the canonical works. I think it's beneficial for everyone to study the historical dialogue on the subject of the good life.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. There was quite a bit of work, but reading texts from authors like Plato and Aristotle has broadened my understanding of the world, perhaps more than any other course I have taken."
