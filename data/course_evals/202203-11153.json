The main weakness Ill note is that I still find it difficult to hear and speak tones, which is likely more due to the difficulty of the language than the structure of the course.",
                "I enjoyed the range of projects to evaluate our learning like oral exams, written tests, and speaking presentations.",

                "I wasnt originally planning to take this class, but i switched into it from spanish at the last minute. Im so happy I did. \r\n\r\nIf youre considering taking this, know: this course is A LOT of work. If youre actually doing everything assigned, its around an hour of class per day, plus an hour of homework, plus an hour of studying (for around 3 hours of work a day).\r\n\r\nBUT, its worth it. Mandarin is super useful and extremely interesting to learn. The small class sizes lead to you feeling more engaged and friendly with your classmates, and sort of a type-2 fun bond. The professors are amazing, and there is a lot of support.\r\n\r\nA new language might be the most valuable thing you can learn at yale, and mandarin is one of the best choices you can make.",
                "Yes. The size of the class helps facilitate individual learning and helps foster important relationship between students and teacher.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in many hours of studying each day to keep up"
