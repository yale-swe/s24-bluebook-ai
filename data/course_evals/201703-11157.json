    "Yes definitely if you have any interest in translation or want to tackle some great contemporary French literature. I would definitely recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Translation was fun; you get to know other members of the class and Mme. Waters is awesome. Please take this class.",
    "I definitely will recommend this class to other students who are fluent in both French and English. This class provides the chance for a close reading of literary texts, besides allowing you to try being a translator."
