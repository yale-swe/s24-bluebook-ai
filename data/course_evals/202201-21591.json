                "Strengths: the professors are very supportive and the department as a whole puts in a lot of effort to help you succeed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course material was not the most interesting.",
                "Strengths: this course was very well organized. Each lesson was carefully planned. Material was presented in an engaging format. The professor's office hours were very helpful, as were the peer tutors. The exams and psets were reasonable. I felt adequately prepared for all exams and was able to complete all psets with relative ease.\r\nWeaknesses: success in this course seems heavily dependent on instructor. My instructor was excellent, and consequentially, I had a great experience. Another slight weakness is the course moves very quickly, so if you do not grasp material the first time around you might not understand it for the test. Other than that, the course has no major weaknesses.",
                "Strength was my professor. Weakness was the material was not too enganging.",
                "I think a strength of the course was having a good professor, and maybe a weakness was the peer tutors. I guess compared to Math 112, I felt like it was hard to get help when my professor didn't have office hours, because I wasn't able to make most of the peer tutoring times and the ones I did go to didn't feel helpful.",
                "Sometimes too hard but good teacher",
                "Should be better prep for exams, the in class lecture does not prepare a student well enough.",
                "good teaching",
                "The course is very well organized and it provides a lot of useful information and strategies that can be applied across different STEM fields."

                "Yes! This is a great course that gives you a strong base in calculus. Brett Smith is a phenomenal lecturer and he makes sure students understand the content. Weekly PSETS and 2 midterms are good to help you pace yourself and check your understanding of the concepts. There are many helpful peer tutor hours, review sessions, and office hours."
