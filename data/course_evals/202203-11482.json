                "I came into this course having read a few screenplays and was sort of a self-taught novice screenwriter, and Vineet took my screenwriting to the next levelthe next 5 levels probably. I learned how to outline screenplays using the sequence format and how to structure scenes with the useful tricks and tools the best screenwriters use. I also learned a lot about writing habits from Vineets guest speakers who are all very well established in their respective filmmaking roles.",

                "I learned how to format and outline a feature length screenplay, techniques for writing strong scenes and dialogue, and a lot of information about the industry from current professionals.",
                "The biggest takeaway from this class is the way to structure plots of all sorts, information that I now use daily in media engagement and my own personal writing. Professor Dewan also helped us engage with so many industry members, that I learned many real life lessons about the entertainment industry.",
                "This course was so amazing, I felt like it even taught me how to be a better person. We learned about show business and screenwriting and story structure and compelling characters and psychology and visual art and just everything. I developed skills in writing practice and storytelling. I learned how to write dialogue and create compelling characters with real motivations. I learned how to get started in industry via so many pathways. I learned pitching and writing room etiquette. I learned how to handle sensitive topics and how to open up to other people about my own experiences, and how to listen to theirs."

                "The course provided a wonderful how-to on screenwriting and encouraged students how to write like a screenwriter with deadlines and workshops.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have seen Vineet more in person than in zoom because hes so energetic and engaging.",
                "This was a really great class. I learned so much that will help me with my future career. A huge strength to this class is Professor Dewan. He's working in the industry right now, so he knows about media trends and what studios are looking for in feature films. He knows how to get your screenplays seen and what not to do. He shared with us this wisdom and that was a huge benefit of taking this class. Anyone could teach feature screenplay structure (though he is extremely good at explaining it) but not everyone can share their knowledge from a successful career at present with students who hope to be doing the same job he is currently doing. He also brought in amazing guest teachers and we got to speak to Oscar winners, development execs, writers, directors, and novelists. Truly an amazing experience. My one critique is that I wish we discussed our own screenplays with the class more and workshopped our writing. We never really got to do this because we mostly had guest teachers and worked on our stories in office hours. I think the main issue was that our class was way too short. It's only once a week but we still only got an hour and fifty minutes. We needed three hours.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Dewan's insights from his professional career in the industry and the get speakers he brought to the class. One weakness was that we didn't get much time to workshop our scripts with each other during class, but it was worth it to hear from the people that we did.",
                "Professor Dewan is the greatest strength of this course. The only weakness is not specific to this clas. Writing a movie script is not a task to be accomplished in only one semester. It could make the class feel intimidating because of the amount of work a screenplay entails and choosing the perfect idea for a script.",
                "This course was a whirlwind, and the only critique I have is that I wish it were two (or even three!) semesters long, and multiple times a week. The professor (Vineet Dewan) was a HUGE strength. As someone in the industry, he could really help us get started and write a screenplay that is desirable today while advising us on how to stay true to ourselves. Every word he said was wisdom. He also put aside a lot of time to workshop our writing in class and individually. I felt so good creating something in this class, and when I worked with my classmates (which was not often enough!) I learned so much from them, too. It was also so great to talk to working writers/screenwriters/directors to learn from their path and their mistakes. This class was so cathartic, and I looked forward to it every week. My classmates have amazing lives and stories to tell, and this class really brought that out. The content was so rich and dense and yet still exciting. Also, I can never watch a movie in the same way again (I always find the midpoint!)."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Even if you aren't going into the biz, if you have any interest in how movies are made, you should absolutely try to take this class. It's like seeing how everything comes together behind the scenes, PLUS you get to figure out what's going on inside your own head. My writing got so much better, and my storytelling became so much more precise and motivated. I loved creating something meaningful by writing my screenplay, even if it will never see the light of day (though I hope the stuff from this class gets made, because it is brilliant!). I would recommend this course even if you just want to realize how amazing your classmates are. And you are also amazing! That's what you learn from this wonderful class."
