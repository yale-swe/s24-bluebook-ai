                "Strengths: Very fun topics, homework involves listening to songs, ability to be exposed to new musical genres, cool speakers and guest visits, the TA (Meera Choi) is the best\r\nWeaknesses: Course is advertised as a 1st year seminar but it feels like a lecture (little to no opportunities for the students to talk with each other during class -- mainly just listen to the professor ramble and talk the whole class), workload is secretly very heavy, isn't properly advertised enough as a music class (you need to be able to analyze elements of songs), most of the class is enrolled because they like K-pop but the K-pop unit is barely touched upon (we only had one week of K-pop songs that majority of our class likes and we didn't even talk about the songs)",
                "The material was very interesting, and Prof. Kao has a lot of interesting stories and guest speakers. The class was overall enjoyable, but I felt a little unstructured at times.",
                "The varied materials through which students were able to gain knowledge about music were very engaging, e.g. meeting musicians as well as lectures. A weakness was that the readings were not that beneficial due to the large amount and due to the lack of discussion in class. As a seminar, I hoped that the instructor would prompt us all to discuss more.",
                "The course itself is not very engaging even though it is a first year seminar. The workload, especially the readings are a bit intense for the type of content being covered. A weakness is that the class is structured as more of a lecture course and not a seminar for class wide discussion.",
                "Assignment\/grading schedule and instructions were often vague. Lots of super interesting opportunities, like meeting K-pop groups, producers, and engaging with Korean culture-related events at Yale.",
                "This course was well organized and encourages students to engage with the material by connecting it to ideas that they are interested in outside of class materials (especially in the playlist projects and the midterm and final papers). One thing that could make the course even better would be the use of more small group discussions or roundtable discussions!",
                "strengths: grade visibility was helpful to see progress in class, well organized syllabus and class schedule\r\nweaknesses: discussion wasn't too engaging for students, too many readings to be not so used in class"

                "Yes if you like New Wave AND K-pop. As a K-pop fan, it was very hard to get through the New Wave\/earlier units, and once we did get to the K-pop unit you listen to popular songs that you enjoy during one week towards the end of the semester.",
                "I would recommend this class if you have a strong interest in New Wave or K-pop. The people were fun to be around,",
                "I personally wouldn't recommend the course to other first years. Although the K-pop unit is a fun unit, the beginning of the course is a bit confusing and overwhelming given that many aren't familiar with the nuances of many genres of music. The expectations, especially for first-timers studying music, are a bit too high, because not everything comes to an individual naturally. I would recommend the course to those who are familiar with Ska, Reggae, New Wave, and K-pop as well as the social and political contexts of these eras. Otherwise, the course can be a bit taxing.",
                "Yes - just keep in mind the lengthy New Wave section will be tedious if you're only interested in K-pop",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in how music and media in general can shape our world and the ways in which people interact with one another. I felt that this class completely transformed how I listen to and talk about music, especially with new understanding of the history behind British New Wave and K-pop.",
                "yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was a course that allowed me to look at something that I had an interest in and take a more social approach to learning about British new wave and K-pop.",
                "yes! a great option for first years."
