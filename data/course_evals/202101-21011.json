                "I familiarized myself with the genre of auto-criticism and in general received so much helpful feedback on my original piece, which I produced many iterations of throughout the semester. I think I became a more thoughtful, vulnerable writer through this process and through getting to give and receive feedback. I also developed a better understanding of the process of writing about oneself through our q&as with various guest speakers.",
                "how to ask meaningful questions. how to read and understand the world more intimately and use this reading to sustain our collective continuance. workshopping our 'autocriticism' throughout the semester not only enriched each of our writing abilities but improved our capacity to engage editing in the long-term, a skill that is neglected in most Yale writing courses.",
                "In this course, I gained personal reflection and memoir writing skills. I also think that I grew as a constructive critic through the course's workshops, in which I learned more about giving good feedback.",

                "I was completely new to autocriticism before taking the course. Through reading various models of autocriticism and working on my own piece, I developed an understanding of what can happen when a writer brings the self into contact with a piece of media, another person, a place or a larger system in the world. The course strengthened my close, critical reading skills, my ability to recognize and articulate craft in writing, and my comfort giving feedback in workshops. I also loved getting to spend the second half of the semester working on one piece of writing, which I don't think I've gotten the chance to do in other writing classes at Yale. It taught me how to think deeply and slowly about an idea, revise multiple times, and incorporate suggestions to make something I ultimately feel proud of."

                "Strengths: Professor Rankine and Professor Mirakhor are both brilliant and give you really helpful, generous feedback on your work. They created a supportive class community of writers and thinkers who were all invested in the process. I also appreciated how this course structured the final project to have multiple deadlines throughout the semester so that it wasn't overwhelming at the end. We also had access to some really wonderful guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really can't think of much other than that the syllabus wasn't fully finalized at the beginning of the semester and sometimes changes were communicated the day before class.",
                "no weaknesses! strengths: (1) professor mirakhor and professor rankine's superb facilitation and insightful comments; (2) class visits from prominent writers; (3) alternating discussion posts; (4) syllabus; (5) allocation of workshopping time!",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its instructors, both of whom gave constructive, clear feedback on my writing that truly helped me grow. Neither of them were shy about giving honest feedback on writing that was sub-par, but both were incredibly helpful. This course's greatest weakness was the poor definition of \"auto-crit,\" which really tripped me up at the beginning fo the course. At the beginning of the course, I was very stressed about finding a topic because I didn't fully understand the assignment or the instructors' in-class explanations.",
                "strength - professors were good at facilitating discussion and integrating everyone into the conversation so everyone has the chance to speak\r\nweaknesses - syllabus wasn't updated and re-uploaded with changes in deadlines or books we needed to read so it was very disorganized; for workshopping, wish there were clearer guidelines for the person giving feedback to write enough comments",
                "The course is strong because it really just focused on our ability to read and write auto-criticisms and engage with this work via discussion. The focus was on our learning and not necessarily assignments.",
                "Wish it couldve been in person but it was great to have the authors of the books we read come to lecture!"

                "it's intense! a lot of emotional labor as you process your auto-criticism essay topic. everyone is expected to bring their A-game to discussion posts and class discussions, so you need to be invested and not fall behind, otherwise you'll miss out on a lot!",

Prof. Mirakhor and Prof. Rankine were incredible teachers in their writing feedback and conduction of class discussions. The course really allows you to build a small community while discussing, writing, and workshopping personal essays with each other.",
                "Yes, 100%. If you're at all interested in reading or writing memoir or criticism, this class is completely mind-opening and exciting. Truly, every day you will leave class with SO many new thoughts and ideas and connections between readings."
