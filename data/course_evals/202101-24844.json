                "Great overview of material and the group project allows students to bring in information learned from class. No negatives.",
                "I wish there was some other assignment than the group project in order to summarize the key concepts, because I wasn't engaged too much with the day to day class and needed some incentive to. The group project itself though went better though.",
                "Strengths: great content, mostly great speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I believe we started working on projects slightly early, so starting alter would be an improvement",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the guest lectures who have interesting anecdotes. The weakness of this class is that the grade from this class is heavily dependent on the group project  and the group is chosen by the professor on the first week of class. This really makes or breaks your experience in the class for the entire semester. If you are in a group that just doesn't work well together, then not only will your grades suffer but your enjoyment of this class. In terms of the group research project, the directions and what the professor is looking for is very vague and this makes the group assignments very stressful. Aside from that, students are occasionally put into breakout rooms with our groups for the entire lecture long which is very excessive for what we are suppose to be discussing about. Usually, we'd just silently sit in  breakout room until the professor decides to pop in.",
                "While I did enjoy the original work my group got to do for this class, there was no connection between lectures and tested material. There was no reason to attend class unless it was one of the random class periods where we spent 45 min in a breakout room working on our projects. Although the grading system was very kind in this class, the majority of points I lost for virtual presentations were based solely on the number of times I said \"um\" during my part. For the second of the two virtual presentations (each out of 5 points), the \"individual diction\" section of my rubric was labeled \"unintelligible\" and I was given 0/0.5 points. It's already hard enough to do a presentation over Zoom, but the fact that this professor was literally counting our \"um\" usage during them made it much harder.",
                "really interesting topic, taught in a not-so interesting way. A lot of lectures and no way of retaining the information learned",

                "Only take this course if you are interested in this topic. Otherwise, the course is not well-taught.",
                "The strengths revolve around the freedom that is given in the class to explore any relevant topic in any geographical region and time period. A lot of the learning in this class was experiential and through drafting and finishing the research paper, I learned a lot about the process. The guest lectures were absolutely amazing, and gave us the opportunity to meet people fighting corruption and crime in the real world. The discussions we had were sometimes instructive and constructive. Weaknesses include the fact that there is some lack of structure to what we are learning when compared to traditional courses. It was sometimes hard to link what was being taught in lecture to what we had already covered. The writing process could however be more guided, since as of now the class has only a few checkpoints where feedback could be obtained. Prof. Palifka was however very willing to take time to give feedback upon request.",

I would suggest cutting down on the number of student presentations--having fewer presentations (maybe two instead of three) may help us focus more on writing the project, and maybe leave more time for content.",

A new guest speaker almost every week didn't help with the flow either, the course just kind of seemed pieced together.",
