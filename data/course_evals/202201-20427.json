I did this by also learning how to analyze and have a conversation with the readings we are given, as well as put them into conversation to answer the thought-provoking prompts Professor Quarshie had for us.",
                "A wide array of readings and discussions in African studies, spanning philosophy\/epistemologies, public health, gender, religion, economics, and science and technology studies. This is a great class because it teaches you to think critically about the work of disciplines and thought!",

                "Strengths: great diversity of assigned texts, wonderful discussion format (first 30 mins of class is just student discussion), insightful feedback by instructor (on papers and in class discussions). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Heavy reading load, very philosophical and goes over some heads. Would be nice to have definitions or more tangible concepts to lean on.",
                "The people really make this course worth iteveryone came with enthusiasm and an eagerness to discuss and problem solve. Sometimes the texts were too long for the time given but overall it was fair",
                "This course is very strong in that the readings and the discussions are extremely well tailored to allow for critical thinking and reflective discussion. The only way I think it could be improved would be by reducing the volume of readings or making their completion more flexible, to allow for a deeper engagement with the texts.",
                "Strengths of this course include a varied and engaging syllabus, focused seminar discussions and the ability to cover a broad range of topics without feeling overwhelming. No major weaknesses to note.",
                "I really enjoyed Prof. Quarshie's comments during seminar. He pushes the conversation and throws in new ideas that force us to re-evaluate our thinking. One way the course could be improved would be to have the presentations on the final papers or have some way for students in the class to learn more about what others are writing about.",
                "The strength of this class is Professor Quarshie's ability to choose readings and topics that genuinely get us thinking, which result in classes where the students are naturally constantly engaged in conversation. The strength of this course is how it's set up, with a student presenting each week's topic and providing a list of questions for the class to talk through concerning the reading; this keeps the class in a chain of conversation. I would suggest having students incorporate a very small abstract of the week's topic\/readings as a whole coupled with the author bio, so students can refresh their minds on the topics.",
                "Strengths: The readings are rich and really fantastic, lending themselves to prolonged discussionprobably one of the best curated HSHM syllabi I've experienced! Professor Quarshie is an amazing facilitator of discussion, and this was a seminar where I really felt like I was learning through discussion rather than just hearing the professor talk or hearing people take turns to say their individual ideas. Professor Quarshie is also an incredibly intellectual instructor and he will push you in assignment feedback to rigorously examine the logic of what you are saying. He is a formidable academic but also very warm and friendly. The small class size also helped make engagement with the readings and with other students easier!\r\nWeaknesses: None! Highly highly recommend this class.",
                "The discussions in this course are really well conducted - the professor lets the students dominate the converstation."

                "yes. anyone who is interested in Africa, interested in writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to pretty much anyone. While the reading assignments can occasionally be daunting, it never feels like you are wasting your time, as the seminars are quite engaging.",
                "Yes. A very solid courseone of my favorites.",
                "Yes, this class teaches you fundamental critical thinking skills through a fascinating subject that has is multi-faceted. In the end, you feel as if you are contributig to a cotinued conversation, and it makes you look forward to more of it. Additionally, the professor is an incredibly kind-hearted teacher and mentor, and his teaching style is inviting and enlightening.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. The material was without fail intellectually challenging and stimulating, and Professor Quarshie is a fantastic instructor. He also reduced the amount of reading and assignments this semester from previous iterations for the class, which made it much more manageable and supported us to really be able to engage closely with the readings each week. Each assignment is a paper focused on more closely examining the readings, which really gave the opportunity to think with the readings for more than a week, which is something you don't get to do in a lot of seminars. Plus, I appreciated that we didn't do individual weekly reading responses on Canvas because it meant that we were really able to focus on unpacking the readings and making meaning *together* in class. HIGHLY recommend this class for anyone at all interested in STS, public health, history, philosophy, decolonial thinking, critically examining science and ways of knowing, African studies, and more. You will not be disappointed.",
                "Yes! For anyone interested in understanding African philosophy, science, and medicine this class is thorough lu intellectually engaging! Your experience will depend greatly on the other people in the class but the readings and Professor Quarshies assignments and classroom facilitation lay a great foundation for a wonderful experience.",
                "Yes, very intellectually stimulating and enlightning course."
