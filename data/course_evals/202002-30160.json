    "We were able to talk about a variety of topics related to how empathy or effective altruism in how we may live a moral life",
    "Ethics with philosophical and psychological perspectives mixed in. Very fun class with cool material",
    "I was able to think about moral questions more critically than I feel like I've ever been able to.\r\nI also learned a lot about what it could mean to be a \"good person,\" & the various ways this could manifest.",
    "I suppose I developed my sense of what is considered moral and why.",
    "This course offers extensive insight on moral psychology. I learned a lot about the foundations of moral action and thought. I also explored the contrast between psychological and philosophical approaches to morality as well as how adults, non-human primates, and babies display similar and different moral behavior. Overall, this course is a great introduction to the topic of moral psychology and I am extremely satisfied with everything I have learned.",
    "This course inspired me to view morality in a new light. Before, I have never discussed human morality in such a structured context backed by evidence. This course made morality feel more tangible and easier to grasp. Additionally, this course helped me become familiar with a different type of reading and analysis, one that I had not encountered previously. Lastly, I feel that this course had influenced my perspective on the world and inspires me to approach differing viewpoints with new attitudes.",
    "I developed an understanding of human's innate sense of morality."

   "comments": [
    "I found the discussions very engaging",
    "Great discussions, fun group. Readings can get a little long but they're interesting so not bad at all",
    "I loved having the first meeting with Bloom be a greater overview of the readings & lecture of the week.\r\nI also loved how engaging section was, despite being online. We were constantly engaging in discussions with each other via breakout rooms, & although section was 2 hours long, it never felt like it was.",
    "Main strength is that it provides for some interesting discussions during class. Main weakness is that its not very fun or engaging. Not sure how to improve.",
    "The longer readings tended to be harder to engage with.",
    "I really liked the discussions! Sometimes I felt like the readings werent necessary\/not completely useful for the discussions\/essays.",
    "strength: very interesting and thought-provoking topics for both lectures and readings, the summer discussion section size is very small (for a class which would've been a huge lecture during the semester), great TFs and engaging discussions\r\nweakness: a few chapters in the readings felt repetitive as they overlap quite a lot with the lectures",
    "Theres is a lot of reading and writing for a very short period of time. I personally think that if they reduced the content and assignments, students would be able to focus more on certain topics and learn as much as possible from them. I would also change the due date fo the weekly assignment to after the Thursday discussion section.",
    "I felt that most interactions were with the teaching fellow instead of with the professor. I would have liked to interact with the professor more and have more time in doing so. The professor seems to only read through one piece of our work, so students don't receive advice from the professor himself. There seems to be a disconnect between students and professor, which is fitting for some courses, but not so much for this one.",
    "strengths: very engaging\/interesting, excellent class discussions, clear feedback\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "Very good course with interesting readings."

   "comments": [
    "I would!",
    "YES! Very fun class, take it if you need another class even if you aren't a philosophy\/psych major (I'm not)",
    "Yes! Take this class! Bloom is an amazing & thoughtful professor, and my TF was super knowledgeable & worked to make sure sections were never boring.",
    "Nope. Too much work with very little payoff. Not very interesting overall.",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I took at Yale!",
    "Yes the course had interesting material but sometime repetitive information.",
    "Yes! Paul Bloom lets you think about these topics from all possible perspectives: this course has changed the way I view the world.",
    "Yes! the thought-provoking moral debates are worth learning and thinking about",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, regardless of what they are studying. It is easy to engage in meaningful conversations, regardless of background. Understanding one's morality is crucial for everyone, as it drives personal growth. The classroom environment is also quite carefree, which is a nice break from the academically rigorous courses that we may take regularly. Overall, I believe that this topic appeals to everyone and is taught well, so I would highly recommend this to another student.",
    "YES!! super interesting",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in gaining an understanding of the different factors that are at play in our moral judgements. The course provides a rich and engaging view of the forces that inform our moral decisions and brings them into conversation with our religious and political views. The structure of the class is very well organized, so you will get the most out of the material presented.",
    "Definetely. Not very difficult in workload but incredibly insightful.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think that I would. It's definitely a challenge, and the first week of the course can alienate you if you're not ready. However, as the course went on, I really felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes! Paul Bloom is wonderful and this course really makes you think about what morality is and how we interact with it daily."
