I was introduced to Hemingway for the first time and the book we read \"The Sun Also Rises\" is now one of my favourites! I learnt a competely new way to write an essay and a thesis and my writing significantly improved under Professor Young's guidance!",

We analysed several novels in depths over a number of weeks, looked at a variety of poems, autobiographies and also discussed art and letters. Alonside deep analysis of literature, we talked about the interesting relationships between authors that we studied; the works were not only a pleasure to read, but a pleasure to talk about because their history is so interesting!!",
                "The strengths of this course are its small seminar format and the range of work that we looked at. The workload was also very manageable and usually was juts reading the assigned readings and working on our essays when we had them. The weakness of this course is that we do have to go through the works we're looking at rather quickly and don't have the time to finish every single one."

Paris in the 1920's is a glamorized time-period and we thoroughly disected the mystique while all falling prey to it. In this class, the glamour of Paris is brought to life. We had incredibly interesting social and cultural discussions and I couldn't recomment the course more!!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I thought the course material was really interesting and the range of work we looked at was also very broad. It was a good opportunity to explore works from this time period and place, learn more about the authors, and also develop writing skills.",
