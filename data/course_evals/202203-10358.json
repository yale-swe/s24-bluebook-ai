I also really enjoyed our class trip days to the Yale Art Gallery, Center for British Art, and the chance to look over some specially selected historical archives from the Beinecke. Some weaknesses were the biweekly reading response discussion posts which were time-consuming, repetitive, and not very engaging to the ultimate class discussion. Another weakness was the professor's lack of general flexibility.",
                "The discussions were very much student led and we came to some really interesting. the course does a good job of discussing well-known topics in a new light and discussing womens issues. I think it wouldve been helpful to get feedback on a draft of our paper first because unless you have time to to office hours there is no way to get specific feedback on your drafts before they are graded.",
                "Professor Tannenbaum does a good job facilitating discussion, and the class is well organized. The selected readings are generally interesting, although some could in the second unit were particularly difficult to get through.",
                "Strengths: The discussions in class are extremely engaging. Everyone is genuinely interested in the course work and seems to have done the readings necessary to contribute to our conversations. The readings we do are also super applicable to the prompts we are assigned for papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness but one should be prepared for a decent amount of reading per week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tannenbaum curated a list of engaging readings. Assignments never felt pointless, and discussions were well-facilitated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",

                "The seminar style is difficult when discussing complex topics in which we only know a little section. There often is just not enough to say.",

There are three papers: two 5-6 page papers and one final paper that is 10-12 pages on any topic of your choice. If you are looking for a way to get the writing credit, it is not too much writing. If you are not confident in your writing skills, however, there is less hand-holding in creating your essays.",
