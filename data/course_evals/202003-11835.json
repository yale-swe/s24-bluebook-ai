At the end of the semester, we learned about geospatial mapping using ArcGIS. I also learned how to write lab reports in a biological context, and be able to produce outstanding reports. We learned how to use EndNote library, and save citations to use in our reports. I developed skills to look for sources and references on my own, which has come in handy in my senior project this year!",

                "Strength was definitely the arc-GIS project. Weakness was inconsistent grading between both of the TAs. Joe took points for every small mistake, and apparently from what I hear, Qi didn't. Perhaps students should be curved by section\/TA who is grading their lab reports for more consistency.",
                "Dr. Moreno is one of the greatest strengths of this course, she is a very understanding professor and she takes the time to really talk through experiments given that we were unable to conduct them in person.",
                "This course was very different this year because it was fully virtual. Therefore, I am limited to speaking about the unique experience this year. Overall, though, this course offered a good overview of some techniques in biology and how to do good scientific writing. It also focused heavily on using GIS, which is not what I expected. This course could benefit from 1) students being encouraged to have cameras on and 2) more ties into biology (although the GIS unit was interesting, it could have been better applied to biology and the health sciences, since this was a bio lab course).",
                "I felt as though some of the lab sessions could be shortened by a lot, especially since we were not even in the lab and therefore not able to do the procedures that we were discussing. Staying on zoom for 4 hours straight was excessive.",
                "Dr. Moreno is an excellent professor and adding GIS lessons into the schedule made this an amazing online experience. Some of the lectures and lessons (with the labs and GIS) were very slow and could be tough to sit through, particularly in an online setting. Overall, though, it was a really interesting class and I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths of this course were lab reports every two weeks (rather than every week), and the ability to learn other ways of doing analysis of experiments (i.e. ArcGIS). The ability to use ArcGIS is different ways (including biological ways) was outstanding, and really opened my eyes to the value of GIS mapping.",
                "Very well adapted to online format. A weakness is that the first lab report didnt give enough guidelines about its expectations.",
                "The strength of the class was that there were many opportunities to work in groups of students who I had never met in a virtual setting. The negatives were the length of each session, the lack of tangible assignments and communication with the professor, and the lack of clarity about any sort of grading scheme",
                "I was not a fan of the initial cold-calling during discussions. I did appreciate the GIS workshop and capstone project.",
                "I think the class didn't focus too much on biology. It was also very long and it was difficult to focus on what felt like a 4-hour lecture with cold call questions throughout.\r\n\r\nThe strength was Professor Moreno. It was clear she cared a lot for the class and for her students. She also taught this 4-hour class 4 times a week! She seems not to feel the effects of Zoom fatigue!",
                "The course was well-designed for the development of scientific writing. It also allowed for a collaborative, family-like atmosphere. Its weakness was the length of lab session without direct activity. It is difficult to stay focused when sitting in front of a computer screen for 4 hours. It could be improved by shortening the sessions and perhaps adding more interactive elements to the sessions."

                "Professor Moreno did a good job of adapting to the pandemic by adjusting our schedule for assignments as well as creating a different capstone project that actually allowed us to create something rather than just watch experiment videos. One thing that could be improved is that the presentations given in class about the different experiments we would have done could be shortened.",
                "I think that recording various sessions was very useful because it was easy to go back and look through videos.",
                "Switching to the GIS unit was a great idea because I dont think talking about the experiments we would have done in the lab was a good substitute for actually doing the experiments in person. It changed the nature of the course, but made it more engaging and educational.",
                "Because this was a lab course and we weren't able to do procedures in person, I felt that the first half of the course was almost pointless. I didn't actually learn lab technique, I was just lectured about it. This lab didn't become engaging until we started doing work with GIS.",
                "Substituting the GIS project for the standard in-person labs was a great change and it kept the class interesting in a challenging environment. Towards the start of the semester, the lectures that were about the traditional labs were too long and very hard to pay attention to for their duration, especially given we were sitting in front of computers for 4 hours.",
                "Labs are always hard to do virtually, and considering that this entire course was virtual made it especially difficult. Dr. Moreno did as best as she could to talk through the experiments, but without doing the experiments themselves, it is hard to conceptualize and understand the material. At the end of the semester when we began doing ArcGIS projects, the lectures, at first, were very helpful, and I am glad to meet the ArcGIS team form all over the country. However, later on in our projects, I think we would have benefited off of doing office hours rather than lectures: the material was interesting, but did not help us in our projects. The mandatory training sessions for it were very helpful though.",
                "Giving data sets and working through analyzing them was very successful",
                "Group work was fantastic, but a four hour zoom session was incredibly difficult and in a semester where we could not meet with professors on campus, not knowing where a grade was going to come from was incredibly nerve wracking.",
                "I think that the class should have more opportunities for discussion amongst students to help keep us engaged. Lecturing for a long period of time is really hard, especially on Zoom.",
                "I think that the GIS capstone project was a great alternative given the online nature of the course. Tbreakout rooms we had at the beginning of the semester when we were doing the more traditional labs were helpful in connecting with other people in the class and being engaging.",
                "The flexibility of the professor, in terms of curriculum and assignments, was very appreciated. I think the involvement in experimentation and data analysis should be increased and lab sessions shortened to maintain engagement."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. Although I took it completely virtually, it was a good complement to my other chemistry lab courses: I knew very little about the methods of biology experiments before this class. Also, ArcGIS is an AMAZING tool to learn, and I have already used what I have learned in contexts outside of this class. This bio lab also counts as a pre-med\/vet requirement, so that is also a plus if you are in that field.",
                "In an in person semester yes, the professor works hard to make it interesting, and the project certainly has widened my view of the impacts of science, but the implications for mental health of sitting at a zoom screen for four consecutive hours (at anypoint in which you could be cold called) was strongly negative, and the lack of transparency about grading made it a stressful, nerve-wracking experience. There was no clarity - even after asking - what the split would be between lab reports and project weight in the final breakdown, or what scores would qualify for each part. Additionally for a four-hour online lab, there seemed to be no recognition of the participation effort made by students.",
                "Yes, Dr. Moreno is a very capable professor and is empathetic about her students' needs.",
                "On zoom, only if you have to. I'm sure that in person it would be much better! It's hard to have a lab on Zoom, especially one that typically requires a lot of hands-on work.",
