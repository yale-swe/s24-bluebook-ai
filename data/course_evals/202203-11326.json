            "comments": [
                "Strengths: you learn the big picture of complex analysis with Prof Schotland. Weaknesses: details get lost. Lots of errors in proofs and homeworks.",
                "I thought the problem sets and exam did a great job reinforcing my grasp of the material and were also not too intense or time intensive. Highly recommend as a less intense math class that is still interesting. However, while I understand that the professor wants to cover more material by spending less time on details of proofs in class, I felt that proofs felt less rigorous than usual and often times important details would be omitted, leaving me confused in class since they're not explained properly.",
                "Great class! We learned a ton and it was never really too stressful",
                "Learned a lot of fundamental theorems for complex analysis and had challenging PSETs, but needed to learn some information on my own sometimes to complete PSET and watch videos to fully understand class material",
                "Strengths: You learn the basics\r\nWeaknesses: I was told complex analysis was the most beautiful math subject, but I wasn't really mind blown at any point in the class. Maybe if it were taught by another professor.",
                "Strengths: content is organized very well, and it's all motivated and very clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some problem set questions were bad or boring. The graders were terrible and unfair",
                "One obvious strength of this course was its clear structure. We saw that there are a few foundational results that both lay the groundwork for most of the results in complex analysis, and also establish intuition that makes the subject become more familiar as the course progressed. For the final exam, we had to learn the proofs of around 22 central results in the class  to reproduce on the exam. I felt this was a very valuable opportunity for me to go over details that I didn't understand upon seeing them fully the first time. I would like to note that I had several friends in the class who preferred to memorize the proofs by rote without trying to understand them. This course had a strong proof-based structure, but I also would have liked more examples of calculations that are possible with complex analysis, specifically when using branch cuts to evaluate integrals. This topic was present on one of the homework assignments but was only an aside in class. Lastly, this course did not closely follow the textbook. Although generally all of the results covered could be found in the textbook, sometimes the same name appeared as a slightly different theorem between class and the text. I believe that adhering more closely to the results in the textbook would have made this course easier to follow.",
                "strength - really good TA\r\nweakness - lectures were not exactly structured, many parts of the proof were left for us to figure out on our own",
                "Its a good, coherent course. No complaints.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is a very easy curriculum to follow topic by topic. The TA and teacher were great, and the other students were able to help each other. It was also nice to have topics that involved previous courses, making them easier to learn.",
                "Strengths: textbook\r\nWeaknesses: psets were inconsistently difficult",
                "Need more involved problem sets.  Exam made me really learn the material though which is good",
                "Lectures were a bit disorganized and there was no textbook really followed so it could be difficult to study.  Grading was harsh",
                "Good lecturer, maybe more stuff about zeta function and analytic continuation would be nice",
                "I thought the course was very interesting and mostly well-taught. However, a few of the concepts were not discussed in as much depth or rigor as I would like. The most notable case of this is that the course didn't at any point provide a rigorous foundation for multi-valued functions. in most cases it was not that difficult to work it out using intuition, but it left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable on problems involving path integrals across multiple branches, as well as later in the course when we discussed winding numbers. There were also a few homework problems with frustrating errors or somewhat unclear requirements."

This is sometimes frustrating because e.g., Cauchy's theorem has many versions and the one we proved is a very weak version. Also, we got a really harsh grader this semester, which is probably just bad luck, but something to keep in mind as a possibility.",
                "Yes! The subject is beautiful and not a lot of work. Would 100% recommend to anyone with a basic understanding of analysis",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that complex analysis is unique because of the breadth of its applications. Of all the pure math classes I have taken, this course was probably the most applicable to my area of physics. I think that physicists, mathematicians, and engineers could all benefit from this class.",
                "I would recommend the course to the students who had prior exposure to the subject; those were the students who did really good in the class. The rest struggled a lot",
                "Yes, 100%. Schotland is hilarious and is a great guy, his lectures were always entertaining though they drifted towards physics a few times (good for physics majors I guess). He wants everyone in the class to succeed, so the workload is not too insane but yet there are plenty of opportunities to get a solid background in complex analysis. The graders were atrocious this year but that's not Schotland's fault.",
                "Its a good bread and butter math course. Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course if needed for the student's major. That being said, I would recommend the teacher more so than the content itself.",

                "Yes, if you need it for the major",
                "Yes. It's a good foundation for complex analysis and also includes a fair amount of practice with various methods for computing integrals (both complex ones and real ones not easily solvable through real methods)."
