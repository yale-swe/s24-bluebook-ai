    "If you want to do independent research, then yes. It can be frustrating and hard if for you, like for me, this is your first time doing independent research.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in any kind of research (e.g. academia, think tank, Federal Reserve, etc). Here's some advice: (1) the senior essay experience will highly depend on your advisor -  choose one who is responsive to emails and available consistently (even if this is just every other week), (2) stay in clear communication and make sure your expectations align with your advisor - after all, they will be the one assessing the quality of your essay, (3) set checkpoints with your advisor early on so you stay on track.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend the ability to do a semester-long project which is well-aligned with your research interests\/I personally found it to be a highly rewarding experience."
