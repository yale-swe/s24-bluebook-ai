                "This course was a good way to conclude the Global Health Scholars MAP. I do think that it would be beneficial to have some type of project that guided the entire semester, such as a longer research paper or some other deliverable to conclude. Having a capstone of some sort would also have been a great way to tie together the theoretical education with practical application.",
                "I wished the instructors spoke on each module more, rather than only having students present. I enjoyed when guest speakers came in to talk, as it was very enriching / an intimate perspective into the topic at hand, so it would've been nice to get this \"expertise\" input in the other weeks as well.",
                "I think this class would benefit from being restructured. Most students would have preferred hearing from the professors themselves more, and from delving into new topics. Instead, the course often felt like a summary of everything we already learned in introductory global health classes.",
                "Not very organized",
                "While I appreciated students having the opportunity to run the class, I thought that hearing more from our professors would have given us more to take away.",
                "Strengths: I think the student presentation format is really cool but it would benefit from 50/50 with this and guest speakers\r\nWeakness: It feels a bit fragmented in terms of the competencies. They way the class is structured is that each theme feels disconnected from the others",
                "Strengths  assignment load was great and the feedback was detailed.",
                "The colloquium is a requirement for GHS students and is only for them, so CourseTable doesnt really matter for it. Its a good class, the bonding was great, but too many student presentations. I wish the professors did more of the teaching. The CAs are tough but a good practice to teach synthesis skills! Thank you for them!",
                "The strengths of this course are the instructors and the cohort. The instructors are incredibly kind and supportive, and it's a great chance to get to know the other people in the Global Health Scholars cohort. Weaknesses: though I like the structure of student presentations, I'd prefer more interjections from the professors, since they have so much more knowledge / experience in global health than we do!",
                "Strengths: I love the professors. They are so kind and accommodating and really try to make this class a fun experience. They are incredibly receptive to student input as well. I also enjoyed most of the readings and liked how the presenting group each week sent out notes on the readings in case you didn't have a chance to read through them all in their entirety. The structure of the course is also very flexible and allows you to choose when to submit three critical analyses which alleviates a lot of stress. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is almost entirely student-taught and I would have appreciated more teaching from the professors since they are so knowledgable. I had already seen some of these readings in other classes for the program so I think it would be beneficial to let students choose a current event or area to apply their knowledge rather than just doing student presentations on a set of readings."
