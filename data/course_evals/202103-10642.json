Skills: Improving my ability to productively engage in Philosophical argument on pretty intricate metaethical topics, and also improving my Philosophy writing ability. Insights: I changed my mind about many metaethical questions throughout the semester and changed my evaluations of the strength of many arguments I had previously considered. Additionally, I was exposed to new forms of argumentation which depend on our concepts, and this was valuable as it gave insight into a philosophical approach which I had not so explicitly used\/engaged with before.",

                "The course exposed me to fundamental arguments in metaethics, as well as allowed me to reevaluate some arguments with which I was already acquainted.",

                "Good overview of many of the standard perspectives in metaethics.  \r\n\r\nSuffers from the slings and arrows of the Seminar structure -- sometimes great if the discussions are thoughtful, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nWould have appreciated a little more summary pulling together of the material, particularly towards the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Some of the topics are really interesting; you get significant leeway in your reading responses and papers to look into any topics you find particularly interesting; Darwall is an expert, and is able+willing to engage in pretty deep 1-on-1 discussions even if class discussion doesn't always cover the full depth of some issues. Weaknesses: I think Darwall is too charitable sometimes to student questions\/positions, and this can sometimes divert class onto topics which are less valuable and more obscure than other broader topics which would generate a better general understanding and broader insights; I also just didn't find some of the topics we learned about very interesting (or maybe the readings for that week just didn't feel compelling) so sometimes it was hard to feel what was at stake in some of the discussion which can be disheartening.",
                "I think that the discussion was very balanced, taking into account both students with background knowledge and understanding of the topic and students for whom it was new or unusual.",
                "This class was quite well-structured, and the readings built upon each other in a very logical way.",
                "The readings are great. Darwall is a super attentive and supportive professor. and, if you have an interest in analytic moral philosophy, this class will definitely be exactly the kind of thing you love. only downside is that the class was we got no grades at all the whole term, so honestly am writing this with 0 clue of how I'm performing in the course.",
                "Strengths:\r\nVery high intellectual level (one of the hardest things I have done in my life) \r\nVery kind, understanding Professor, good at exalting issues\r\nLively discussions \r\nResponse papers were a good idea, they made us more engaged \r\n\r\nCould be improved:\r\nI think it would be a good idea if the first 20 minutes of the seminar would start with a mini lecture, outplaying the main post sod the readings, esp. in context with other weeks. That would make it easier to follow",
                "Darwall uses weekly reading responses to structure the course. This is a great way to force some students to study the material in depth, but sometimes it seems to force the conversation to issues that are not at the center of the work. I wish we spent a little more time working through the pros and cons of different positions in relationship to each other (and perhaps were given more support in figuring out our own views)."

                "Yes.  If you are into ethics, it is a must.",
                "Yes, just know what you are getting into. This isn't a class where you systematically go through positions and really dig into which ones are most\/least plausible. There is certainly evaluation of positions, but most of the class is just trying to accurately pin down the views in question so that they can then be evaluated. This is important to do because the positions can be quite complicated and not as clear as they might appear at first glance. Another consideration is just that I didn't find all of the topics in the class very compelling, but when we got to topics which I did find compelling I really do think I got a better grip on them, and if I wanted to talk more I could have done so with Darwall in Office Hours. So, if you think you will find the topics interesting and if you are willing to do a lot of mental work yourself to evaluate positions and sort through complications then yes, it was a really eye-opening course which changed my view on several issues.",
                "Yes, Steve is a generous and wise professor",
                "Yes, and specifically to philosophy students who are interested in metaethics and normative first-order ethics.",
                "Definitely. This seminar is well-structured and pretty comprehensive, and Stephen Darwall is an excellent instructor and a clear communicator.",
                "If you like analytic philosophy, and especially moral philosophy, yes!! If you don't, the course will drive you crazy, because a lot of it is super specific.",
                "absolutely recommend, Prof. Darwall is a highlight.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in philosophy and are ready for a very intellectually challenging experience",
                "Only if you have a strong background in philosophy and time in your semester to dedicate to the readings. The course material really builds on stuff from previous weeks, so taking a few weeks off would be difficult to recover from. The material is also very complicated and may require several readings for someone to really understand. The course probably leaves you with more questions than answers which might be an issue if you go in expecting to figure out morality. The course is also driven a lot by the students in the course, so you may want to figure out who is in the class. Darwall wants to be as inclusive as possible but that seemed to result in some folks in our course who would have benefitted from a deeper philosophical background. That said, I enjoyed the course as a whole."
