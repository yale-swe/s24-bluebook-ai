            "comments": [
                "Although it was beneficial to be in Spain and interact with the culture, having this as an additional course separate from S130 and S140 was overwhelming. It added a lot of additional work and since every excursion (and meal) was deemed mandatory, once we were in Spain the time commitment of the program was incredibly exhausting. There was very little consideration for the students' time and wellbeing, and since this course follows the same attendance policy as summer session any tardiness to any event (even if it was the third one that day and we were required to find our own transportation to our host-houses and back) negatively impacted our grade. It was overwhelming, I barely had the time to enjoy Spain because I was so busy trying to just push through every week. We don't need to see that many parks, or museums, at least not with a guide because ultimately we got to see very little of many things instead of throughly enjoying a few.",
                "I think there was not enough guidance on what material you need to know for exams and I found the tours in Spain to be very unhelpful and pointless. It was hard to focus since we would be walking for hours without a break and half the time, the professors would be nowhere to be found. I also think the tour guides just weren't engaging enough, but it was cool to go on the excursions we did.",
                "The readings in the first half were tough and on a quick time scale with a difficult evaluation afterwards, but overall the course was not super bad.",
                "Because this course was part of the YSS Bilbao program, the aspects of this course conducted in Spain which used real experiences were excellent. The history portion taken at Yale felt more like a class of memorization than learning, but it did help my understanding of the country.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- most of the cultural materials and topics were interesting. I liked the movies we watched in New Haven for 148 a lot, I liked how they were relevant to the Civil War\/dictatorship that we were learning about in class. I liked Ay Carmela and El Laberinto de Fauno a lot. \r\n- I liked most of the cultural projects; I think that I learned a lot through them\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The articles we read were very long and oftentimes they felt like they contained extraneous information that was not particularly relevant to learning about Spanish culture.\r\n- the timing of some of the activities didn't make a lot of sense to me. For example, I wish we had gone to El Museo de Bellas Artes one of the days the week before so that I had more time to work on my cultural project and study for the last exam\r\n- I wish the museums in Madrid were on separate days, I felt like I couldn't spend the time I wanted to exploring the museums entirely\r\n- I wish the cultural class and exams did not have so much super detailed information that we were required to learn because I was preoccupied with trying to memorizing names of artists, etc instead of learning about the culture. Or if they're required, to space them out more\r\n- For Madrid, I enjoyed spending time in the museums, but the guided tours were too long and honestly boring. The tour guide spoke incredibly fast and I definitely did not understand the majority of what she was saying. We also would spend so much time at individual pieces of art and have no time to look at other pieces in that room, and our free time was so limited that there was no time to return to everything. I think that was a big shame especially since the Prado and Reina Sofia were such grand museums but we could barely see anything. I enjoyed that we had time to explore the city by ourselves. \r\n- I liked Toledo a lot too, but the guided tour was also too long. I don't think we had enough time there as I would have liked to explore a bit more as well.\r\n- The guided tour in San Sebastin was better than the others, but it did drag on near the end. I wish we had more time in San Sebastin to explore on our own as well.\r\n- Overall, the guided tours were too long for me to enjoy them, and the tour guides spoke too fast for me to understand most of what they were saying. For the museums specifically, the tours themselves were too long yet we didn't spend enough time in the museums.",
                "Strengths: The information we learned was useful.\r\nWeakness: There should be more variation in the ways we are taught during the first half of the class as it was mostly just movies and article summaries of history but I think having us read or listen to various forms of media like newspaper articles or podcasts could make it more interesting.",
                "Poor professor, and badly created reading assignments.",
                "Because this course was highly influenced by being in Spain, some of the following critique is about living in Spain.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) It would be better if students lived in dorms than host families because most peoples host families could not cook well, didnt have wifi, had racist\/prejudiced family members, which made the living portion of this program terrible and uncomfortable. If students lived in dorms or apartments together, they could cook or share meals together and there would be more bonding. While I do appreciate the added layer of cultural immersion with the host families, the living situation is not beneficial to our happiness or enjoyment of the program. 2) Rather than schedule meals for the group at the hotel or restaurants, students should receive money to buy food during excursions or get to pick what restaurants we go to because the food we ate during excursions and at the hotel was awful most of the time. 3) Excursions should have long tours and instead have more free time or an interactive activity rather than just walking or looking at something. 4) Profesor Daz made a lot of inappropriate remarks and actions (Telling students at el Museo de Bellas Artes te falta or \"The sculpture is lacking you\" in reference to the sculptures of men hanging from the ceiling, saying women are like mangos to suck, telling a joke to some students about a woman who is apechado\/has big breasts, slamming students computers down during a class presentation, mixing up all of the black womens names or forgetting students names, and lecturing us whenever we expressed something we disliked about the program). He made this program truly miserable for so many students and he should not be allowed to teach at Yale again because of his predatory behavior. 5) Once we are in Spain, the program class and workload should be easier as we transition to new life and using our Spanish skills more. It felt like us students were given no grace and expected to come to class 100% ready everyday when we were struggling with being away from home and acclimating to new life in Spain. 6) The program and its professors should talk more about and acknowledge the racism\/xenophobia that a lot of students in this program faced while here. We only ever talked about Spain positively in comparison to the US in class, but the program should have more critical discussions of racism and other marginalization\/prejudice in Spain.\r\n\r\nStrengths: 1) Profesora Vazquez was organized and explained things clearly. 2) I enjoyed my visit to Madrid and I learned a lot more about Spain from it. 3) The professors always let the class know of out of class resources to improve Spanish like office hours or Spanish tutoring. 4) Staff at Deusto were accommodating and helpful when it came to the program. 5) These courses helped me improve my Spanish abilities and cultural knowledge tremendously and I feel a lot more confident about speaking Spanish with others and taking an L5 in the fall.",
                "I thought the strength of this course was the experience of studying the history of Spain, before visiting the country and experiencing it first hand. However, I did think the exam structure of the course could have been improved. The exams relied on a single reading on Friday, followed by one day of review with the exam on the following Monday. I thought the exams focused too heavily on what felt like small details. I also thought that the exams were made more challenging by the fact that they were at the end of our classes, and had been preceded by 2.5 hours of often unrelated material. I think the tests could have been more conceptual, and the preparation for it could have been spread out more."

                "As a whole, I would not recommend the YSS study abroad program in Bilbao to any other student as it is overwhelming and stressful, and the Professors who guided this course were not very present, compassionate, or helpful. Not only were they our professors but, theoretically, our liaisons in a foreign country. I felt hardly and security traveling with them and did not feel like I could seek out their help.",

                "Yes, if they are looking to fulfill their language requirement, but no, if they are taking it for fun\/for the study abroad experience. The course was very intensive, but in some ways, the organizational structure did not help facilitate learning and took away from the experience.",
                "This course was actually useful because it improved your listening and reading ability of Spanish while also giving you insight on the Spanish history and culture. There were also many excursions like museums and cooking classes that helped strengthen your understanding of the content.",
