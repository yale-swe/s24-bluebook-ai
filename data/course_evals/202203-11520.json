                "I learned that writing is a process and should be treated as such. I also learned about the They Say/I Say structure for an argument.",
                "This course was a phenomenal introduction to college essay writing. After the course, I feel prepared to tackle a great number of writing assignments ranging from an academic research paper to a creative writing essay. Professor Klemann's does an amazing job breaking down the essay process into obtainable steps. At the conclusion of the class I produced a research paper which I both enjoyed and was extremely proud of. Overall, I highly recommend Professor Klemann and this course.",
                "I learned how to use footnotes appropriately and revise for concision.",
                "I learned how to write at a higher level and how to approach longer papers and more academic style writing.",
                "I have significantly improved my writing skills",
                "I improved my ability to develop a thesis, support arguments with research and evidence, portray the complexities and nuances of arguments, and write with proper structure and language. I also loved diving into the topics of entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence -- our discussions about AI ethics were truly riveting!",
                "The biggest game-changer for writing that I have learned through this course was to learn how to talk to others about my topic and thesis to develop them further. Toward the end of the semester with the P3 and P4, I heavily discussed my topic with my suitemates and professor as well as unassociated people who were interested in my topic, and it enormously helped me with aligning my thoughts and formulating my essay. I also learned that the thesis should not be easy to think of and requires time to develop. In essays before, I would write a generic thesis and expand on my arguments during the body paragraph resulting in a weak thesis with a load of evidence pointing to many mini-arguments. Upon working on the various essays, I learned to take time with the thesis, and everything will align afterward; the thesis is the make or break of the paper not necessarily the evidence brought."

                "This course was all around a masterclass.",
                "I very much enjoyed the variety of sources used in the course from Sci-Fi movies like Ex Machina to in-depth academic journal articles and case studies. It gave me a wide range of knowledge on the topic and taught me how to analyze these different sources and how to write essays on them. I think the course was well-structured, and the material was presented well, so there is nothing, in particular, I would change."

Professor Klemann is amazing and does a great job pushing every single student to produce their best work and challenges students to push their intellectual understanding.",
