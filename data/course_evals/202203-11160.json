                "This course is extremely well structured. The teachers make their expectations of students extremely clear. The course load can be heavy but the teachers are very supportive.",
                "It is a bit frustrating that the class meets everyday but it has proven to be necessary in order to truly do well in the course. I also loved all of the group activities that we did.",
                "Strengths: very organized, clear and quick feedback, high level of engagement, supportive and responsive professors, exams and homework not too difficult compared to some other courses. Weaknesses: one of the more difficult language courses at Yale, easy to fall behind in, requires a high level of engagement and participation in class (sometimes difficult if you are tired/sick).",
                "I loved that the class time was spent talking only in Chinese and that Ao Laoshi asked us so many questions in order to have us engage with classmates.",
                "I appreciated the very personalized feedback from TAs and my professor, Ao Laoshi. I have little feedback for improvementI enjoyed this course.",
                "The strengths were the knowledge of the Professor and how interactive the course is. The weaknesses were that some sections of the textbook were not particularly useful.",
                "The strengths of the course were that there was a lot of daily Chinese dialogue between students and the teacher as well as between classmates. This proactive learning made it much easier to absorb large amounts of new content."

Class was typically very fun and you never feel blindsided by exams, projects, or grades. It is a lot of work though since it is a 1.5-credit course, so that might be something to factor in.",
