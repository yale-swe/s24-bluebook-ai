However, I also see this course in terms of discussion of figure and form that should be brought to a seminar-style classroom. The classrooms in Green Hall seem to be the roadblock for this, as this space is more for practicing skills. As a new student taking this class, I would benefit from changing locations once in a while to have a more formal discussion about specific historical works and theory in a seminar-style class."
