    "This course examines developments in architecture, museum exhibitions, and other art forms throughout the 20th century to understand the creation of\/changes to a Chinese national identity. There is a weekly reading response and 3 deadlines relating to a 15 page final paper on a topic of your choosing. The first deadline is locating a primary source that relates to your topic, the second an annotated bibliography, and the third the first 2 pages of your final paper. This course is a writing credit and some of the work done in developing a final paper is very helpful.",
    "I gained no writing skills, given that this is a WR class. We only had one writing workshop at the end, with blog posts that we would never get feedback on.",
    "This class provides a fascinating perspective on studying the politics of memory in the Chinese context, starting from the Republican period until today's contemporary China. I enjoyed the focus on \"sites of memory,\" and looking at it in multiple ways, ranging from museums, mausoleums, cities, films, performances, gardens, and even the Internet.",
    "This course taught me about historical sites, museums, monuments, and places of memory in China from 1911 on. More broadly, I gained a sense of how China and the CCP view the past, and the interactions between curators and government officials that dictate exhibitions of historical events\/moments.",
    "We covered almost a century of Chinese history, beginning with the Republican period and ending with contemporary China. Conceptually, we focused our attention on sites of memory like museums, exhibitions and public spaces, and on thinking about questions of history and memory while looking the past as produced rather than simply existing.",
    "I understood how to evaluate artistic history, symbolism, and Chinese Communist Party propaganda critically. Additionally, I was also exposed to grassroots histories and analyzing the interplay between that and official histories. Finally, it was important to have an introduction to archival research.",
    "A deep understanding of modern Chinese history, especially through the lens of collective memory and cultural expressions of history",
    "I received great training in reading and writing in the fields of historical studies.",
    "I really got out of this course what I came in hoping for, and Im really grateful to Prof Ho and my classmates for enabling that. Not only did I get a sound grasp of 20th century Chinese history, I was also able to look at it through the lens of critical theory, and areas as unorthodox as places of memory (museums, architecture!) which was certainly refreshing."

   "comments": [
    "The readings in the class were very interesting and insightful. I wish there had been some more variety in the types of cultural productions we looked at. The first half of the class largely focuses on architecture\/museums. Despite, the class was very engaging and Professor Ho was great about moderating discussions. Each discussion had student leaders but if discussion slowed or required clarification, she resolved these issues. Also, the final paper process was very helpful and I learned a lot more from this class about writing than many of my other classes before (as a senior). Professor Ho provided useful feedback at each stage of the final paper process.",
    "The class was great and I particularly enjoyed the readings. I especially enjoyed it when Prof. Ho talked about her own research experience, the people she met, and also how our readings informed her research. Prof. Ho gave overviews on Chinese history twice in the class, and it was very helpful. We also received amazing feedback for our assignments. Prof. Ho provided very detailed comments on our primary source analysis, annotated bibliography, the thesis statement, and the first two pages of the paper--so we had a lot of guidance in writing our final paper.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class is that I felt sometimes discussions in class would veer off-topic. I'm not sure how effective the student-led discussions are. I think it'll be great to hear more of Prof. Ho's perspective as well about the topics and readings read in a particular week.",
    "Strengths: Great assortment of interesting readings and a fair reading load; Professor Ho's experience researching the topic comes across during class and always sparked my interest; good class discussions with everyone participating; great opportunity for deep research on an open-ended term paper of your choosing; cool connections between modern Chinese history and contemporary China. Weaknesses: Occasionally becomes too theoretical\/abstract; too much of a focus on architectural history; little feedback on writing\/reading responses throughout the class",
    "Strengths: Our readings were excellent! Prof. Ho clearly put a lot of effort into curating them and the class more broadly. The topics we covered were fascinating and very relevant, and struck a nice balance between theory and examples. Having a pair of presenters prepare discussion questions also helped us frame every week's discussion nicely.\r\nWeaknesses: At times discussion seemed to lose steam, although I'm not sure if this was because of our own faults or those of the course. The course packet was also quite expensive!",
    "Strengths: Depth of discussion, quality of readings, knowledge and organizational ability of the professor, background knowledge in the history of modern China that was provided to students who were not experts in this field",
    "As a seminar, class time was almost entirely discussions of the reading. I would have preferred a little more teaching, whether that be student presentations or by the instructor at the beginning of each class",
    "Readings and weekly discussions were interesting, but discussion was not very structured. The workshopping class where everyone presented their theses and received feedback was very helpful.",
    "I really have no complaints about this class - probably my favourite one this semester. The readings were interesting and coherently related, the course was well structured from beginning to end, and the weekly blog posts definitely helped us to clarify our thoughts and also learn from others. Prof Ho was always such a joy to speak to whenever we were having difficulties, and I thoroughly enjoyed how organic class discussions were. I also really appreciated the trips to HAAS and the fact that we also got to hear visiting Prof Xu Bin talk about his work in sociology in the middle of the semester, which provided us a really good glimpse into the world of academia."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to understand the construction of Chinese national identity through cultural productions. You do not need any prior coursework in Chinese history, but I do think you would get more out of this class if you do have some background in this. There is quite a fair bit of reading that took me some time to get through, but I am a slow reader. I would not recommend this course if you already have a heavy reading load. The reading responses are prompted and are only supposed to be a paragraph (but a lot of my classmates would often write a lot more).",
    "No, take something else.",
    "I highly recommend it! Just know that you'll be dealing with memory and sites of memory throughout the semester as an organizing theme, and not a broad overview of modern Chinese history. You'll learn about fascinating ways in which history, memory, and knowledge in modern China have been constructed through these sites of memory.",
    "Yes probably, but not a full endorsement. A lot of the readings are great, but be prepared for some material that to me felt too theoretical\/too technical (when it came to the construction and design of monuments).",
    "Yes! Prof. Ho is an excellent professor and the topics are really interesting and so relevant.",
    "Absolutely. I would encourage other students to take this course in order to develop their understandings of recent Chinese history, become better critical thinkers, and be better historians and purveyors of primary sources.",
    "As the material in the course is quite specific, I would only recommend this course to those already interested in the topic and already knowledgeable about Chinese history at a basic level",
    "I definitely would! Prof Ho is an amazing professor and an absolute joy to learn about Chinese history from. Also, I really enjoyed learning about memory studies and Chinese architecture, and looking at how history and memory interact and evolve. I found myself applying theory and skills learned from this class in other classes too, which was really nice."
