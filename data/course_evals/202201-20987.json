                "I did not know there are this many facets in appreciating music - prof. Kane did such a fantastic job in covering the technical measurements of music, the impact of performers on music pieces and the underlying sociality in music. I thoroughly enjoyed all the classes.",

                "I learned how to listen to music",
                "Gained knowledge about the basics of music theory (scales, tones, etc) and a HUGE breadth of exposure to different genres of music, approaches to composition (sonata principle, concerto principle, etc.), seminal works of music criticism. The class was also just a great outlet to talk about the music that excites you in a more thoughtful way.",
                "In this course I learned how to really listen to music. I looked beyond to lyrics to reveal the form, meter, tempo, affect, rhythm, and so much more. We analyzed many different types of genres too, and in the process, I was able to expand my musical horizons farther than I could have imagined.",

                "I developed valuable knowledge, skills, and insights through the energetic, committed spirit of Brian Kane and his TAs. Throughout the course, Prof. Kane engaged a multitude of academic disciplines to challenge students to think more critically about being a listener of music. This led to a deep appreciation for not only the music, but the course material we covered in class. I learned so much about music theory, music history, and more as Prof. Kane refined our skills as listeners and students of the liberal arts."

                "strengths: great for beginners, materials are organized across different subjects, a great gateway for more music studies\r\nweakness: maybe can add a bit of exposure to more advanced topics to give students senses of direction for further studies",
                "strengths: prof. Kane is so articulate and engaging. He kept the class materials concise, informative and entertaining!\r\nWeakness: nothing really, but if I had to pick a bone, I'd wished for a bit more explanation of technicalities (e.g. how to measure tempo) so we can be more prepared in the exam(s).",
                "Excellent course--Prof. Kane is truly an amazing lecturer!!",
                "Strengths are the numerous different types of music we look at. Professor Kane is also a huge strength of this course and he guided students well to the point that it did not really feel like a lecture class. It could be improved with a more clear structure, and lecture slides being posted right after each lecture.",
                "Strengths -- Professor Kane is an engaging lecturer who makes every class extremely interesting with lots of examples! Each of the assignments are fairly easy to complete and relevant to understanding class concepts and I thought the exams were a great balance of making sure you understood all of the concepts discussed without feeling overwhelming! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I personally thought that section was an unnecessary component to class structure, and felt like explaining concepts we already learned in lecture.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kane and the TAs were great, the classes were always interesting, the course load was super reasonable \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none take this class!!!",
                "Strengths come with the awesome use of examples and cool subject matter! I think it could have helped to start a little less technical, as the start of the course was a bit intimidating.",
                "I liked the professor",
                "Strengths: Professor Kane and TA Ain! They were endlessly enthusiastic, knowledgeable, understanding, and encouraging. The course was well structured, with a sense of coherence among different units and the lectures within each unit. Cool assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any.",
                "Strengths: very fun class, listen to cool music, no readings, chill exams! Weaknesses: none for me!",
                "I think the class could be stronger if the students are involved a little bit more. Each class was performed as a long lecture, and this got repetitive throughout the semester. For instance, I really liked the class we all had to sing in groups, one by one and then all together. The teacher, however, was always very energetic and passionate about the course, which I greatly appreciated. I did learn much information of interest and value by the conclusion of the course.",
                "I thought it was great, all the assignments were very enjoyable and fairly graded.  The topics in class were interesting and engaging",
                "super fun, interesting, you get  to listen to great music -- I personally would have loved to learn more about lyrics but that might just be a different course",
                "Strengths: fantastic professor and TA, incredibly engaging lectures, really cool mix of content, interesting assignments, very manageable and even fun workload",
                "Strengths: Allowed me to explore music without getting to caught up in the technical details of theory. \r\nWeaknesses: Some classes were a little dry and were hard to stay engaged with. From week to week the topics covered were kind of all over the place which sometimes made it hard to connect what was being learned.",
                "Very entertaining lectures, maybe would have appreciated a more planned out schedule for assignments, but overall was given a lot of time so it worked out!",
                "Strengths: Professor Kane! Engaging lectures \r\nWeakness: Sometimes it felt like the lectures weren't connected -- almost like each one was its own ted talk",
                "The lectures were engaging and enjoyable, and the assignments were fair and not too onerous. The organization of the content could have been improved a bit, like making it clearer when we transitioned into a new unit. It would have been nice if the assignments were more evenly spaced over the course of the semester (i.e., not having two of the three assignments due in the last two weeks).",
                "The course is perfect, no need for improvement.",
                "Strengths: vast coursework that provided students with a solid overview of music history and music theory, flexibility in terms of grading and course material, commitment to students learning through experience rather than knowledge (re)production, and the course leaders were absolutely fantastic!\r\nWeakness: not much I can think of!"

Just the course topic itself is so cool tooeveryone listens to music and learning how to do it more critically was fun. The midterm was kind of long, but it was a take home and there was ample time to do it. The short writing assignments (focusing on one song, comparing two performances of a song, and a concert report) were really fun to write.",

It's well suited for beginners with no music theory background yet also engaging if you are a more experienced musician. Plus, Professor Kane's a really great lecturer!",
                "YES 100%!!!! Professor Kane is fantastic and this class was amazingly organized with interesting lectures and full of music! The essays were open-ended and interesting and the exams were very reasonable. I looked forward to this class every time and was never disappointed. It would be a great 5th class or just a generally chill but incredibly enjoyable class.",

                "YES! It was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Brian Kane is so engaging and knowledgeable; he makes every class and every topic interesting. If you're into music at all it is a great experience and not intimidating/too technical at all.",
                "Yes, its a pretty easy humanities credit and I learned a fair amount.",
                "Highly recommend, it is a great class to really explore a wide variety of music and learn how to analyze and put what we're hearing into words",
