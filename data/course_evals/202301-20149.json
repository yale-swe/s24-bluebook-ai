I gained not only knowledge on the topic but improved my skills in reading, writing, and speaking about it.",
                "Deep insight into the inner workings of global energy systems. Slightly more heavily focused on the phasing out of fossil fuels than the phasing in of clean energy technologies, which was a bit of a surprise to me.

Entering this class, I had limited knowledge about the state of the clean energy transition and did not possess the tools to engage in conversation about it. By the end of the semester, I felt I had at least a strong grasp of what the energy transition is, what it will entail, and where we lie as a nation. It is a class that shows you how many years is required to truly understand something. We did so much, and yet I feel like we only scratched the surface. The assignments force you to think, not just write. I appreciated how the length was not nearly important as the content, and Prof. Simons really wants to get the best out of his students. I loved the course because there was no busy work. The work had to be done, and the work was all very interesting and rewarding.",

                "This class is wonderful! I thought Amb. Simons lectures were informative, yet personal and engaging. The guest speakers we heard from were so interesting. My peers were brilliant so I loved hearing from them. My only comment is maybe you should make sure the breakout groups have enough time to occur each week because they were always a highlight and I was sad when we had to skip them.",
                "Great readings, interesting content - amazing and experienced Professor",
                "Strengths: There were so many! To name a few, the comprehensive and interesting course content, small class size with breakout groups and some full-class discussions, and fireside chats with the guests, were definitely highlights. The example submissions of the assignments from previous years were also incredibly helpful in setting a high bar for our work and guiding it! The professor and TA were incredibly dedicated and provided detailed, thorough feedback on each assignment. This really solidified my learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no major weaknesses. One suggestion would be to have slightly fewer lecture slides so we wouldn't have to go through them so quickly.",
                "Strengths: Simons is an amazing and dedicated professor, the assignments are very creative and engaging, the lectures are relevant and interesting, the small class size is a great aspect as well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too many readings, one long class on Friday mornings might be tough if you aren't interested in the topic",
                "A strength was the class discussion between students and the instructor. The instructor was also very knowledgable and shared his expertise well. I think the course would be better if there was more time for class discussion, perhaps if the class time was a little longer or there was less time spent on lecturing.",
                "This course is much like a \"leminar.\" The first 40 minutes is a lecture followed by an in depth discussion. It's actually perfect for the time slot it has on Friday mornings. You ease into the class and build on past readings before a lively conversation ensues. I think it's a great format for learning. My only wish was that we did a bit more discussion and a bit less lecturing. Prof Simons is incredibly knowledgeable and a great lecturer, but some of the lecture restates the readings, and I think an additional 10 minutes of discussion would really help. \r\n\r\nI would also like to comment on the assignments. Rarely have I said this about a course, but I had fun doing the projects/essays. They are really thought provoking and intellectually challenging, but won't make you write 10 pages about a dull subject. I loved the CEO speech, G20 debate, and the final was easily the best final I've ever taken. I had so much fun and learned a ton.",
                "Strengths: Professor Simons is absolutely world-class and brings this course to life. He lectures with passion and excitement, the assignments are creative while not being too demanding, the TA is insanely helpful, the readings are very interesting, and the fireside chats make each class truly unique. It is structured to ensure every student comes in with a different perspective on the topic of clean energy (country-wise or major-wise) and we can all learn from each other in a small seminar. The course covers every possible aspect of the topic which one can think of, and culminates in a thrilling G20 mock negotiation with each student representing a country. Gem of a course!!",
                "This course is a fantastically versatile exploration of the huge field of energy today. In a short timeframe, all relevant topics are explored with enough detail to understand the most recent developments and the current challenges. The mix of lectures, guest Q&A sessions, and class discussions is good and very helpful to synthesize new ideas into an individual understanding, particularly the set of guest speakers offers incredibly valuable insights into the frontier of the energy transition on many fronts. The array of student assignments is also very helpful in engaging students with class content, provides a great deal of freedom for students to explore individually interesting aspects of energy, and allow students to develop responses to different audiences and using different media. Especially the final negotiations roleplay is great fun and very instructive, and the class would certainly benefit from a second such exercise, perhaps at midterm. The course would also benefit from better coordination between the assigned reading and in-class lecture content - often the in-class lecture would review many topics from readings and thus be redundant. Freeing time for more class discussion, and encouraging more dialogue between students would make the class more meaningful and effective. There should be stronger dedication towards reserving part of the class time for student discussions, and lecture content should go into more depth using readings as an assumed foundation.",
                "Strengths: very well organized course with fantastic guests and the most engaged instructor you'll find at Yale. Great mix of students from different backgrounds. Assignments were thought-provoking and focused on useful skills. \r\nWeaknesses: the readings can get quite dense, and we spent a little too much time in breakout groups.",
                "Would appreciate more time for group discussions during seminars.",
                "Strengths: The breakout groups were a fun way to think about the material and contribute in class. Guest speakers were insightful. I really enjoyed the variety of assignments and how they differed from your typical essay or exam. I found they forced me to think about the material in a more creative way that applied what I learned to the real world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was easy to fall into the habit of skipping the readings for the week, which is too bad because I know I would have gotten more out of the class had I done more of them. I would recommend adding reading responses to the assignments to ensure students are reading and reflecting on the material. These could be very short, about 100 words, and posted in the discussion section on Canvas. I think they wouldnt even have to be every weekmaybe students post 6 responses throughout the semesterbut they would ensure more people read more of the material and make discussion more productive.",
                "I very much appreciate the thoughtful course design and the absolutely amazing fireside chat guests. All students were highly engaged, contributing to thought-provoking discussions. The only weakness is that I wish we had more focused in-depth discussions. I understand there are so many interesting and important topics to cover, but sometimes the breakout room sessions felt rather rushed."

Simons makes the information available and easy to learn so anyone  regardless of background  can understand and participate. Everyone should take this class.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You learn a ton about clean energy and non-clean energy, and Professor Simons has an insane amount of experience that he is happy to share. another huge benefit is the \"fireside chats\" -- you get to hear almost weekly from some of the top energy experts in the world. all around an excellent class and would highly encourage anyone remotely interested to go for it!",

                "Yes. I was 50/50 as to whether or not I would take a 9:25 am Friday course as a second semester senior. I'm so happy I did.",
                "Absolutely, take it regardless of your major!! You will learn so much in an environment that completely allows you to do so without worrying about grades. This is because the professors feedback on all your assignments is incredibly helpful in getting you to learn, the TA helps you out always, and there are office hours for anything you may need. The lectures equip you to take creative angles in the CEO speech, the country strategy paper, and the technology video. Lectures are fascinating, and the fireside chats are with guests you would never have the chance to meet otherwise. Professor Simons is just incredible.",
                "Absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in climate change, global sustainable development paths, and of course the energy transition. The course is a great way to expand one's perspectives and gain a systems understanding of today's energy for students coming at it from a technology, policy, international relations, or economics perspectives.",
                "If you're interested in learning more about the clean transition, this is the class for you. The material is very details-oriented, so I would recommend it only to people with previous exposure to energy. The course feels very pre-professional, so don't expect academic assignments in the traditional sense.",
                "Yes, Professor Paul Simons is very experienced in the field and there are lots of room for interesting engagement during class.",
                "Yes. The assignments in this class were fun and the speakers were interesting. Ambassador Simons brings a contagious enthusiasm that makes it worth it to wake up early Friday mornings.",
                "100%. If you have the opportunity, regardless of your major, I'd recommend taking the course with Professor Simons to gain insights into one of the most important fields of our time."
