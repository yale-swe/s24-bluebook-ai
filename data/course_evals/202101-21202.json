                "Strengths: Our presentations at the end followed by Q\/A were nice to facilitate discussion about the material we'd been covering all semester\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't learn as much as I wanted about actually improving my own writing which is why I took the course - it felt more like a history of sedition and dissent than an English class and we didn't receive enough feedback on our own writing. The readings were also excessively long at times and could've definitely been cut to just include the most important parts that we actually ended up discussing in class.",
                "Professor Ranks is a very very good professor and is very good at instructing while at the same time guiding discussions, but I think some times the discussions were cut a little short. Also, she has not given back grades for many of my assignments, so the term si essentially over and I still do not really know how I am doing in the course, which is a little frustrating.",
                "I wish the instructor can give our grades back. Even till the very end of the course, we haven't received a grade on a single assignment. The course itself is super engaging though.",
                "I really liked the content of this course! Prof. Ranks is incredibly knowledgeable and helped us unpack complex topics in class (I still don't understand Milton though). Our discussions were always productive, and we gained new insight on examples that most of us knew about from the news.\r\nI think it would have been nice to receive more feedback on the final drafts (see below) and to use more real-world examples.",

It was relatively interesting to learn about the history of sedition and dissent which is pertinent to today, but overall not worth the time\/work for what I got out of it.",
