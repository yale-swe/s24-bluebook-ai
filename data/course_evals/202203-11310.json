            "comments": [
                "Please do not let Taylor McAdam teach this course again.",
                "Taylor's class notes were fantastic, and I heavily relied on them to learn & study for exams. They were super thorough, and (from personal experience lol) you can do well in the class even if you miss most of the lectures by oversleeping.",
                "This course was honestly amazing. Taylor is a fantastic professor, and she and Erik worked hard to make the class as seamless and well-organized as possible. It was like a machine: the lecture notes, problem sets, and exams all fit together perfectly, and I never felt like we were rushed to cover material at all. I loved that Taylor wrote from her lecture notes in class on the chalkboard, because it made it so class moved at a pace where it was easy to take notes and ask questions. Also, while the difficulty of the material certainly ebbed and flowed, the beginning of the class felt like a super gentle introduction to the topics and wasn't intimidating at all (and I am not a STEM major!). Finally, a big strength was the attentiveness the professors paid to inclusivity and making sure we felt like we belonged in a math class. Every problem set started with a question asking us to reflect on those things in some way, and I think all math classes at Yale (and STEM classes in general) should adopt that practice! Weaknesses: I'm sure this is different for different people, and it's not even really a weakness, but for me, some of the material in the beginning of the course was much harder than material towards the middle (and then it got a little harder again at the end), so that's something to look out for. The later problem sets took me dramatically less time than the early/middle ones. Also, particularly in the beginning of the semester, grading was slow, and we went into the first midterm with hardly any feedback on the relevant problem sets. Small suggestion: I enjoyed the pure math aspect of the class, and obviously there's 222 if you want a more applied class, but I think it would have been cool to have like one example of the usage of some of these concepts when we finished each \"unit\". Sometimes when we did something, even if it was interesting, I was left wondering why we would do that.",
                "- Strengths: plentiful support and clear guidance on problem sets, readings, office hours, and practice questions\r\n\r\n- Weaknesses: lectures can be slightly dry at times.",
                "This iteration of linear algebra was almost all strengths. I appreciated all the ULA workshops and office hours as well as Prof. Taylor's office hours. These times really helped solidify my conceptual understanding, particularly Taylor's. The one thing that could have been better incorporated would be the components of active learning/retrieval practice. I wish the quizzes were better integrated in the class. However, the atmosphere in the class that allowed for frequent questions during lectures allowed us to create moments to check our understanding of material.",
                "I think the lectures could be rearranged a little to be a bit more interesting.",
                "strengths: lectures and lecture notes, USE THE TEXTBOOK, undergrad sessions\r\nweaknesses: takes a while to get feedback from homework and midterms",
                "Strengths: The workshops and study sessions with the ULAs were very helpful, particularly the proof writing workshops since it helped me before more familiar with a skill that is best built through practice. The concepts were also very well explained in class and having access to the instructor's notes after lecture was very helpful in reviewing the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The pace of the class picked up significantly, making the class feel a bit slow at the beginning and fast-paced towards the end.",
                "The course was very well structured, had a lot of practice materials and very helpful lecture notes. Having the lectures recorded would  have made it a lot easier.",
                "Great job offering lots of supplemental help from ULAs. Homeworks would have been much, much harder and time consuming without study group sessions. Course started off slow, so it wasn't very engaging at first, but it picked up the pace in the second semester. Lectures were interesting and published lecture notes were a fantastic resource for learning the material deeply and preparing for exams. Considering this class serves as an intro to proofs, the grading on the homeworks felt too strict/particular.",
                "Strengths: Course is effective at teaching linear algebra as well as proof writing, ULAs were fantastic at helping to understand the material and with challenging pset problems. Weaknesses: to succeed in the class/truly understand the material I personally felt you needed to attend 4+ hours of section and office hours synchronously (section notes lacked answers for example), and I would have appreciated more digital resources outside of the textbook.",
                "Strengths: Learned a lot of material, lectures were clear, weekly homework reinforced content nicely\r\nWeaknesses: Took a long time to get homework graded and see feedback, lectures with Taylor could have been a little more engaging and could have made me more excited about the material, although this was a proof-based course some more applications of what we were learning would have been nice",
                "Moved a little fast so if you miss one class its hard to catch up.",
                "Strength: perfect for introduction to proof based math, covers all the bases (aha) of linear algebra\r\nWeakness: lectures are too slow and could have less of instructor writing down proofs on the board and more of engaging students in doing them. Instructors could point out how the answers to certain questions are obvious (thus giving students an opportunity to gain intuition about the question and use it more actively in future) instead of just answering them",
                "The weekly homework was extremely helpful and relevant to what we learned in class and what appeared on exams. The Undergraduate Learning Assistants and their sessions played a major (and probably under-recognized) role in helping us succeed in the course; the room was filled with students during their office hours as the unstructured time to answer our questions and provide examples was highly appreciated. It was also helpful that lecture notes & homework solutions were posted on Canvas.\r\nThe course could be improved if the grading could be a little bit faster, as this would allow us to receive feedback on our understanding of one topic before applying it to the next topic.",
                "I liked that we started with looking at what a proof is and looking at logic. I also appreciated the proofs workshops and ta sessions. At points, though, it felt like concepts were introduced very quickly without a clear reason as to why they were important or fit in with what we learned previously.",
                "Class time was spent almost entirely on giving us definitions and theorems, so you arent really able to do well in the class unless you spend significant time outside of class teaching yourself how to actually answer questions for the Psets. I often went to multiple study sessions and workshops per week. To improve, I wished we did more examples in class that resembled the psets.",
                "Strong: contextualization, explanation\r\n\r\nWeakness: inconsistent support group times",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the sheer amount of resources you had to work with.  In addition to lectures and the textbook, there are frequent workshops and office hours with the ULAs, discussion sections, and workshops to give you every available advantage in tackling the admittedly hard material.  The problem sets also include additional practice problems for the week if you need them.  That being said, the problem sets definitely stretch what you learned in class so that using these resources becomes second nature.  Besides the lectures themselves, the pacing of the class felt a little strange.  The logic and proof stuff definitely is valuable and makes sense to focus on, since there needs to be a good foundation for you to do the proofs in class, but it did mean that the last couple of weeks of class went at a break neck pace to the point that it become hard to connect the last concepts to other concepts we learned.  The biggest weakness of this course is the ridiculous pace of the grading of problem sets.  Most problem sets take around two weeks to get grades back on and some of the longer ones took even longer than that; it was frustrating especially for exams, since there were typically problem sets on material on the exam we wouldn't get back or would get back hours before the exam.  (This included the final as well, for what its worth.)  Though there were keys for the problem sets posted in the second half of the semester, they were inconsistently posted and usually still a week or two after the problem set was finished.  The specific feedback was always way more helpful anyways since there were usually a couple of ways to go about the harder questions.",
                "The resources and support from the instructors was very good. Our lecture notes in particular were very helpful and well-organized. Our instructors were understanding and wanted every student in the class to succeed. \r\nLecture was structured well. I think the little quizzes in class were helpful for class engagement. I sometimes could not see the board clearly, so maybe some projection mechanism would improve this.",
                "Additional discussion workshops revolving around proofs.",
                "Fun course that was challenging.",
                "There isn't enough class time to cover all the material and there isn't enough information on what the grading will be like",

                "Maybe if Taylor McAdam is not the professor.",
                "I'm a junior, and this is the course that made me second-guess my entire life/major choice. I realized that I could do math, and math could be really fun and interesting. It helped that the first problem in every PSET was something about real people doing math: their struggles, insecurities, journey, etc. But most of it was just that this class was great. This is in my top 3 classes at Yale so far",
                "Would absolutely recommend. The world of linear algebra is so beautiful and clear, and if you like systems that fit together nicely, you will love this content. It was also just fun to get to think in this way. During every exam, I thought to myself at some point: I'm having fun right now figuring this out! Which is a super cool feeling to have during an exam. Taylor was amazing, and if she is teaching this course again, that's one more reason to take it.",
                "Yes! It will be a fair amount of work, but you will learn to appreciate mathematics and its power.",
                "Yes! My only qualm is that the professors who teach this class tend to change every semester such that my experiences may not be representative of how it will be in the future.",
                "Yep, good basics.",
                "Yes, take it over 222 or 226 from what i've heard. if you'll only take one math class at yale this is not a bad choice",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it was very well taught and although it was proof-based, I still learned the important computations needed for linear algebra. Plus, the proofs made the class more interesting and helped me think more logically in general.",
                "I would. 225 is a good class to learn how to write mathematical proofs and help you figure out whether college math is something you enjoy and wish to continue pursuing. Exams are tough and expect you to have a strong understanding of the material in order to write proofs, but if you review all the published lecture notes and write down the theorems we learned in class/HW (you're allowed to bring two pages of notes to the exam) then you'll be alright. To get to the level you need to excel in 225 you should supplement with online videos to help you understand the concepts intuitively (3blue1brown is a great resource for this).",
                "For someone interesting in learning proofs, mathematical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the beauty of linear algebra, yes. For someone who just wants to just learn linear algebra akin to a high school calc class/MATH 115 (ie plug and chug, applying techniques), no.",
                "If you don't need to take 225, don't like proofs, or just want to take a linear algebra class as an elective, take 222. If you enjoy proofs or need it for a major, then yes take 225. It's not that bad of a course. Just watch out, the difficulty of the exams can be surprising.",
                "If you have to, if its not necessary take 222, no proofs in 222",
                "I recommend this course to everyone, particularly to two groups of people: 1) if you have never done/enjoyed proof based math and think you will never have reason to do it again, this course might delightfully surprise you and change your mind, and 2) if you think matrix multiplication is so easy and that's the only thing you'll need for whatever else you do so you can just learn that and skip this course, because linear algebra is DEEP and important and being trained in the basics will help you down the road (speaking as a physics major who wish I had taken this way earlier).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a very good experience, even if math is not what you want to major in.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in math and linear algebra, and wants to learn to think rigorously like a mathematician.",
                "Only if you need to. It takes a lot of time to become adequate at writing proofs so this class takes a lot of time if this is your first time. A lot of the topics do not feel applicable unless you plan on going to higher math.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. Don't be scared offit's not too bad, if you put in a little work to understand the concepts. Office hours are very helpful.",
                "Yes, even for students not studying math the course develops analytical thinking and is engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking to really get into proof based math and higher math in general.  The work is difficult and it can definitely get frustrating in places, but I do think its not too bad to navigate it with the resources invited.  So I'd recommend it on a case by case basis, but overall if you're interested I think its worth trying out.  I definitely learned a lot by the end of it.  Just be prepared to put in the time and not expect perfect results.",
                "Yes I would! I really enjoyed this class and feel that I've learned a lot. I'm also more encouraged and interested in mathematics now.",
                "Yes, especially if considering a major in mathematics, computer science (although you can get away with math 222), and physics.",
                "For those that will be taking proof based math courses in the future, one should take this course before proofs are required at a higher level",
