                "You cover a lot of ground within the topic and delve relatively deep into some specific themes, mcdougle is also super nice and great at breaking down the presentations or discussion readings if anything is confusing. I would say my only gripe is that the coursework is not very evenly distributed. Aside from the weekly reading responses and the midterm, all of the work is practically at the end of the semester, making it feel a bit lopsided. The work at the end of the semester is a bit of a lot at once, with a group presentation, group paper, and then a take home final. I think scrapping just one of those bits of work at the end and putting something else earlier in the semester would be better and more evenly balanced workwise. I'm also not a huge fan of group projects, thankfully it went alright because I had a great group (and I imagine most students are upper-level psych/cogsci people so I don't any group would be bad per se), but group work is always just more stressful than solo stuff for me and most others because it's a lot to organize and manage.",
                "Great discussion format. Good distribution of grades over the semester.",
                "The subject matter was well organized and presented. The class was organized so that the 1st half= lecture, 2nd half= discussion, which was a good balance. A final presentation, paper AND exam is a little much at the end of the semester.",
                "Strength: interesting papers, time for class discussion/asking questions, tests are focused on learning the material and not just memorizing it \r\nweaknesses: workload at the end of the semester was pretty high with group presentation, paper, and a long  take-home exam. Maybe the final paper or one of the papers on the exam could have been replaced with a paper before/after the midterm.",
                "I really enjoyed this course but definitely felt the material was harder than any other psychology course I had taken thus far at Yale. It felt like a big jump from more introductory courses, but I think Professor McDougle made up for that in the way he structured the layout of the coursework and assessments.",
                "Strengths: At the beginning of the semester, I felt very engaged with the course and with the studies we had to read in order to respond to the reading responses. The material was generally interesting when it wasn't too focused on the neuroscience aspect. I also thought that the reading responses were helpful ways to integrate the material that we had learned. Weaknesses: To be honest, I think this class was kind of a mess. The grading system was unclear from the beginning, and the feedback we received on assignments didn't really help clarify the grading structure. Asking the professor about the grading system was also unhelpful; he could never give us a straightforward answer. I also don't think that classes were that interesting or useful; lectures were too short to really understand all of the material, and discussions were dominated by a group of two or three students, making it very hard to get participation points. The class was too big for everyone to participate. I appreciated that the exams were take-home, but I often walked away from these feeling like there was something I missed in lectures; we had to synthesize difficult information and make connections to other topics, which would have been fine if lectures weren't so short. I also don't think that everyone was graded to the same standard, especially in our final group presentations.",
                "I really enjoyed the organization of the class. I found it quite helpful to have a lecture at the beginning of each class to put the readings into context, and enjoyed the discussions of the relevant papers.",
                "You will learn lots of critical thinking. It's laid back, but also you learn a lot. It's less stressful than other courses which makes it more engaging."

I went into this class a bit unsure of how much I'd understand or get out of it because I have zero neuroscience or computational background knowledge, but it was still very accessible and I learned a lot. If you're looking at this evaluation you probably like psych/cogsci stuff so you will probably like this course even if it's not necessarily a branch that you typically study or prefer.",

                "This is more of an overview of skill learning research, which ends up conflicting with itself and often boils down to the conclusion that multiple parts and processes are needed to learn skills. Do not take if you're looking for a lot of practical knowledge.",

It was one of the first classes at Yale I felt comfortable speaking in. I am quite shy so the class was exciting to me for that reason.",
