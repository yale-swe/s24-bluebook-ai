            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof. van den Bosch is a great lecturer. There were some days that I had difficulty focusing because the class was at 9am and often there was just a lot of content to get through, but he is great at explaining things in an intuitive way. I have never understood physics and astronomy concepts as well as I have in this class. Weaknesses: The out-of-class support and the exams. Office hours were only available if we emailed to schedule it each weekit would have been much better if there was a standard office hours time. A TA would also be incredible for this class. The professor didn't want us working together too much, but without a TA or regular office hours, working together was our only option. And when we would all get the same things wrong on the problem sets, he wouldn't address those concepts in class, so it was difficult to learn from his feedback. And the exams really confused me. Let me reiterate that I loved the lectures and I learned SO MUCH in this class. But the exams didn't test that. About 70% of each exam was just writing down formulas from memory (the other 30% was explaining things conceptually, which makes sense). I conceptually understand so much after this class, but I am terrible at rote-learning formulas, which is what we needed to do for the midterm and final exam. The exams could be exponentially improved if we were instead given the formulas on the exam and had to explain what they meant. I see no point in memorizing over 100 formulas (that's how many boxed formulas there are in the textbook, we counted) when in day-to-day research, we can just refer back to them when we need them. The more important part is knowing what these formulas mean. I think the professor also forgets that we have less baseline knowledge than him, so he might not realize that he is asking us to memorize so many formulas. After the midterm exam, I felt demoralized for the rest of the semester, because I felt that there was little point to the class if the exam was mostly going to assess my memorization skills.",
                "The lectures in this class were amazing and very helpful to my understanding of the concepts. I wish they weren't at 9 am, because waking up and immediately trying to understand vorticity is a little bit challenging. However, despite the fact that Professor van den Bosch is a great lecturer and explains topics very well, there were many issues with this class. First, he didn't have regular office hours. When we would ask him in class if he could have office hours this week, he would often tell us that he was too busy, and to try again next week; usually, we would be asking for help with the problem set, and he would schedule office hours for after the problem set was due. Second, it would be very helpful to have a TA for this class. It would mean that even if Professor van den Bosch couldn't hold office hours, then at least we could get some help, and it would also help us get a different explanation for certain concepts. Third, the exams in this class are not at all structured in a helpful way. I understand that making the exams like the problem sets would be too math-heavy and would definitely be too hard, but I think there is some middle ground between that and just forcing us to memorize all 200 pages of Professor van den Bosch's lecture notes (which admittedly are very well written and helpful). It doesn't seem important for us to memorize 100+ equations that we will forget a few days after the exam rather than being tested on our understanding of the concepts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Van Den Bosch is a good lecturer and evidently an expert in this area. His lectures were engaging and fairly understandable despite the material's difficulty (although it did depend on the given lecture). I particularly appreciated how he would connect the course material to important topics and research in astrophysics. The lecture notes are quite thorough and a good resource for studying and problem sets. I enjoyed the lectures and learning from Professor Van Den Bosch. Office hours, when they occurred, were great at improving my conceptual understanding of the material. Weaknesses: The professor went very quickly through the material, which I understand was a necessity, but the class would have benefited if he had occasionally reviewed past material or highlighted what was important to remember by returning to it.  The material/format of the problem sets and exams did not line up, which made it difficult to use the problem sets to study for the exams. I wish that assessments (problem sets and exams) were more of a union between the math and problem-solving emphasis of the problem sets and the conceptual, memorization-based exams. This course is also not well-structured to help students learn outside of class. There was no regularly-scheduled office hours and no TF, which made it difficult to seek help, particularly when completing problem sets. Finally, I think this course should not be offered at 9 AM--this made it difficult to learn the complex material.",
                "The Professor is clearly well versed in the subject however the way in which the material was presented was sometimes difficult to follow and the material was I believe too dense",
                "Incredibly well taught (Dr. van den Bosch is easily one of the strongest lecturers I've ever had) and interesting, but your grades will be struggling.  The homework is graded very harshly and is incredibly difficult in and of itself (with no teaching assistant and limited office hours leaving most of the class feeling unsupported) and the exams are basically straight memorization of the lecture notes.  Even though I learned a lot about the topics of this course, my grade does not reflect that in the slightest.",
                "The main strength of this course is that the lectures are incredible. They are very engaging and usually easy to follow (despite being at 9am). However, this class also had a lot of weaknesses. Primarily there was very little support outside of lecture. There were no set office hours, and there was no TA. Because of this, it was really difficult to get help on the problem sets. This posed a problem as the problem sets were rather difficult. That being said, there were only 4 of them. So really, for most of the time, the workload of this class was not that high. Personally though, I would have preferred more psets that featured simpler problems, so that I could get a more solid grasp on the material. It additionally would have been nice to have some problems that aligned with the content of the exams. I would say that the exam format was the biggest weakness of this class. For the final, we were told to memorize nearly all of the boxed equations in the book, which amounted to ~100 equations, most of which featured some very complicated terms. We were not allowed a cheat sheet. This memorization had to be done in addition to understanding the content, and memorizing various other content-related things. The midterm was the same, although is had only ~1/2 of these equations. However, the midterm exam was on the same day as one of the psets was due, which led to conflicts in how you spent your time and energy.",
                "The lectures were very detailed, which is great, but it was always hard to tell what concepts would be important to know for the test. Sometimes, something that seemed very relevant would not be on the test. Furthermore, the homeworks didn't feel very related to the exams: they were heavily focused on derivation, but the test was instead focused more on concepts. Not a bad thing, but for the midterm, many of us were focused on derivations more, and we all did poor on the midterm.\r\n\r\nI agree that the course is very strongly memorization-based, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. If you are interested at all in becoming an astrophysicist, it's important to be familiar with the concepts taught in this class, and to know them by heart. The only thing is that it was a lot to memorize in a small amount of time, and the lectures often went into more detail than was necessary for many newcomers to the subject. \\\r\n\r\nProfessor van den Bosch was great at making the lectures interesting, and he is very clearly passionate in what he does, but for me personally, I could have benefitted from lectures that were less fast-paced. However, his lecture notes were great in the sense that they always covered what was lectured in class.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness is that there is no TA. Homeworks were pretty difficult, and you need to be careful not to work with other people in the class, because you may get in trouble with the professor. Also, since a lot of the concepts are difficult to grasp at first, I actually think my learning experience would have been so much better if there was a discussion section.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites are MATH 120, but I also think it would help a lot to take at least ASTR 210 before starting this class.",
                "Please, please get a ULA or TF for this course. The group of us students had to learn how to become that ourselves, forming study groups and teaching us the material. For a course so fundamental for graduate school in astrophysics, there should be numerous TF's up for the challenge, especially because our professor, understandable so, was not available that often. This is an extremely difficult course, arguably the hardest in the astrophysics major, and it should have more attention, care, and support.\r\n\r\nPlease, please improve the exams. I just can't memorize the textbook. Make the test more like the problem sets with problem solving so we can bring in our own note sheet of the relevant equations and solve the problems, like I have done in my physics course. I think this would make the class more fair. Some students just had a very hard time approaching the memorizing questions on the exams.\r\n\r\nFeedback took a long time to get on our work. Also, grades were never posted and you had no idea how you were doing while you waited for one of the few problem sets we had to be returned to you.\r\n\r\nI want to add it was weird that we were \"done with all of our course content\" so we did not have the last two class periods when the professor said he would do review sessions those last two days for us. \r\n\r\nAlso, the professor changed the textbook he was using to another version. I downloaded the one from the beginning of the year and I did not know it had changed until the very end. Other students were not aware of this either, I guess this was an in-class announcement he would be changing it but it was never formally announced when it was changed, to my understanding."

                "I'm honestly not sure. On one hand, I've learned a lot from this class. On the other hand, the exams were horrible and I'm really bracing myself for my grade. I spent hours and hours memorizing equations for the final examequations that I will most likely forget over the summer. We had the option to take the graduate version of this class instead, but I decided to take ASTR 320 because the lectures were just really amazing and made a lot of sense to me. I don't regret that decision because I understand the concepts now, but this class really exhausted me.",
                "This class is very interesting and engaging. However, if you don't think you'll have time to memorize 200 pages of lecture notes for the exam and to spend 2 full weeks working on each problem set to figure out what it is asking, take ASTR 595 with Professor Laughlin instead. Professor van den Bosch explains things very clearly and is a great lecturer, but this class is simply not set up to maximize student learning. The majority of the concepts weren't even tested on the exam, it was just about writing down the equations you memorized (which could be any of the >100 boxed equations in the notes). If you do take this class, make sure to read the lecture notes either before or immediately after learning a certain concept in class to understand it better. This definitely isn't a class that you can just go to lectures for and expect to understand everything based on that.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with high interest in astrophysics with the necessary preparation to succeed in this course. This course obviously has essential content for anyone looking to pursue graduate study in astrophysics, and it begins at an elementary enough level that an undergrad could understand it. However, although this course has no pre-requisites beyond introductory physics and multivariable calculus, I think that students should only take this after Astro 210, linear algebra, and Physics 410/401 (perhaps even quantum mechanics?), because Professor Van Den Bosch assumes a large amount of pre-existing knowledge. Without this background, it's difficult to understand a lot of the material, particularly tensors, Fourier modes, and some of the more difficult math. I also recommend that students take the class with friends if possible. Given the limited office hours, you need to work together to study and complete problem sets.",
                "No I would not, it is very difficult and requires too much memorization of equations. There were 72 equations to memorize for the final which I believe so greatly unfair, as there is no situation where I would need to have any memorized for this line of work",
                "If you wish to actually learn about physical processes in astrophysics and don't care about your grades, then definitely take this course.  I cannot praise the quality of the lectures for this course enough.  If you don't care about the quality of the education you receive and simply want a good grade, then maybe don't take this.",
                "I would probably not recommend this course to another student, unless the overall grading and examination structure were altered. Actually, I would probably recommend auditing this course (or something along those lines), since the lectures are really great. But the general lack of support, along with the anxiety caused by the examination structure, leads me to recommend against this course if you have another option.",
                "Audit it if you're interested, or be sure to drop it before the drop-deadline. I'm very nervous to check my grades. It's been super interesting for sure, but the grading is difficult, and there aren't a ton of resources available to help you succeed. Of course, if you're majoring in Astrophysics, it is required.\r\n\r\nIf you do take this class, be sure to get to know your classmates well. It really helps to have a group to study with, and it generally makes the whole experience much better.",
                "No, it makes you question whether you want to be an astrophysics major or not. Take the graduate version of this class if it fits in your schedule."
