                "I learned the fundamental technical skills of semantics, like composing predicate logic on syntax trees. I also developed skills in discussing and discerning between different interpretations of sentences, phrases, and single words. Generally, this course improved my ability to think within formal systems that aren't immediately intuitive.",
                "This course is provides mathematically rigorous logic-driven account of how meaning can emerge from the words and syntactic structures that constitute language. You may think that meaning is incredibly fuzzy, however it is actually possible to build a robust, precise, and formally rigorous account of what sentences mean. To do this you build a series of more and more intricate engines to unpack sentences into logical forms which are more straightforward to understand and to which one can ascribe truth or falseness in a given context. More than this, though, the course emphasizes teaching the techniques and methods that a semanticist has in their toolkit for analyzing meaning in a given language!"

                "Strengths: Lectures were very engaging. I am not good at quantitative reasoning, but lectures were very comprehensive, well-organized, and entertainingly taught. Problem sets challenged my thinking but weren't overwhelmingly difficult or long. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little. Maybe I wish we had a little more class time to practice some more challenging topics we covered like Neo-Davidsonian semantics.",
                "The problem sets were excellent. the textbook was also super helpful, but the inconsistencies between the textbook and class material were occasionally confusing. The humor-fueled teaching style was great. Sometimes, it was ambiguous how strictly we needed to follow what was done on the board, or what shortcuts we were and weren't allowed to take.",
                "The hybrid lecture\/seminar format of this course was great. The lectures and discussions had in class were essential for my understanding and helped me go above the cursory understanding I got from text book readings. The handouts for each class were much appreciated guide during instruction and ultimately became a needed reference library as we crossed into harder material. When I could go to section and office hours, both Manasvi and Lydia were always a great help.",
                "A fantastic course, very well taught and organized. To say that the content is interesting is an understatement! I especially appreciated how thoroughly and methodically the content was introduced. No weaknesses.",
                "I thought this course was incredibly well-organized and helped me develop a strong understanding of the topics we covered. I would have been interested in hearing more about how the topics we covered are actually used by semanticists. I found the examples from other languages (like the Russian adjectives we looked at) very helpful for understanding why we were doing that kind of analysis."

                "Yes! It's a really good course for a QR credit, and even though math seems scary, semantics is so approachable and fascinating. You also get to rely on your own semantic judgment, create fun sentences, and draw trees.",
                "Absolutely. It opened my eyes to so much and it tickled my brain!",
                "This class would not be the first thing I'd suggest for someone looking for a gut social science or QR, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in how language works, even if they don't intend to go into linguistics. The class is fun and the work is satisfying. At the beginning of the year, I intended to only take Semantics I, but the class was engaging enough that I'm now scheduled to take Semantics II as well!",
                "This course deals with the ever tricky notion of what meaning is and how it can arise in language. It is extremely well taught and well organized, so I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rigorous understanding of how we can begin to break down difficult questions surrounding meaning. A major focus is how the meanings of phrases can be derived compositionally from the words that make them up. The course is unique and the professor is outstanding!",
                "I already have! This course was fantastic. I think the kind of logical thinking it demands is extremely valuable for any area of study, and I also found it engaging and challenging."
