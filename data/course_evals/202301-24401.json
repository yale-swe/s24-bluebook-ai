Not only did I enhance my technical skills in lab, I learned to be a better scientist in terms of interpreting data, troubleshooting, note-keeping, planning experiments, designing/presenting a poster, and writing my thesis.

                "Everyone's lab experience will be different, but I can speak to the strong organization of the course itself. The neuroscience faculty made their expectations clear for our senior poster and thesis, and our registrar (Nancy DeSilva) was a wonderful resource. She was beyond helpful and made the workload more approachable.",
                "I feel like we got a lot of information later than we should have, made it difficult to plan. For example, further info on posters was only a week or two before they were due. Info on our time slot for poster presentations was only like 2 days before the presentations.",

                "More direction on finding labs and realistic timelines from the DUS'es. Each project was so different and PI engagement was wildly varied - hard to gauge if I was on track or behind or how the major specific classes related to research project.",
                "Strengths were my post doc and my PI.",
                "I loved my research, I wish that there was more opportunity to engage with the DUS's and with the other students in the course, maybe mid-semester thesis presentations in a Mellon-forum type style may be beneficial",
                "I think a strength was the length in between the things due was great because it kept us on track but also made sure that the assignments were too close to each other. i think a weakness was maybe getting more advice and tips on how to write the paper from the major. There were times when I was unsure if i was doing certain things correctly and maybe having someone who could have read over my thesis (other than a writing tutor) who had a neuroscience background could have been really helpful. That way they could have gave me advice on how to make my paper stronger in a scientific way.",
                "With this course I knew what I was doing since it was my second semester of research so everything went smoothly. I do think that overall with the senior requirement for neuroscience, you are often left to figure everything out for your own and the quality of the experience really depends on how helpful your advisors are. I didn't find much support in the neuroscience department itself.",

I wish I had had more support from the faculty, but honestly, older neuro students were my best resources for choosing classes, finding opportunities, and deciding my thesis topic."
