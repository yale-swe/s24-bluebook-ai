It was a lot of work, but I learned so much from it that it was 100% worth it. \r\n- Larry is an incredibly instructor, and spends so much time with every student.  \r\n-Lab section was enjoyable and taught me a lot of skills that I utilized later in the course.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures in the beginning of the course weren't necessarily super helpful.",

The professors also graded based on their own criteria rather than the criteria of the clients for the final project which was annoying: we essentially had two clients who often wanted different (and sometimes even conflicting) outcomes. Also, grading often depended on the amount of time the professors saw you working in the CEID rather on the amount of work completed.",
