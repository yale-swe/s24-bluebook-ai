                "Strengths: The class has a lot of structure and projects that are dedicated to each skill, which helps a lot when it comes to beginners trying to sort through what code can do. The time we spent familiarizing ourselves with coding platforms, commands, and functions was very helpful. Additionally, Rosa is a great instructor who is always willing to spend time helping anyone understand any technical part of any assignment. (Also, the guest speakers are fantastic). \r\nWeaknesses: I would say that this class is not the most productive for beginners. It's theoretically meant to be for anyone but a large portion of people already have substantial coding experience, which makes it easy for more inexperienced coders to feel inadequate or feel like we're falling behind. That said, Rosa does her best to get everyone up to speed every class.",
                "Flexible projects, great feedback from peers and professor, thoughtful readings and guests, workshops to help people without technical background. Class Are.na was very well-organized and extremely useful for gathering influences. Wish there was more room to showcase process (Are.na of updates) and give feedback to peers outside of class, especially because the set-up didn't always make it possible to interface with everyone in the already small class",
                "I think a strength is the fact that it can be either more or less rigorous depending on how much time you have to dedicate, i.e. it's very flexible due to you being able to come up with your own ideas for most of the projects, although they all follow a general form of some general concept learned in the class such that you get to learn that specific concept and keep it in your toolset from then on."

                "I would! It's a great class to learn about coding from a more artistic perspective, which is extremely helpful for art majors. Just a word of caution to the more inexperienced, you will have to do a lot of reading on documentation on your own to understand what is going on.",
                "Yes! If you have little background with the web, to think more artfully and poetically about the internet's potential; if you have no background at all, you'll get all the technical foundations you need to make websites. It balances the technical and creative wonderfully. If you came in with more background knowledge, definitely press yourself to make technically strong and thoughtful pieces  there are few other opportunities for you to do so at Yale, if any.",
