The course covers a lot of ground and focuses on several important historical figures that all help you understand how we came to the present day situation regarding the topic.",
                "I learned so much important history that is rarely discussed outside of the classroom, including the role of slavery and imperialism in reproductive narratives; the complex histories of contraception and abortion; the evolving roles of different reproductive technologies; and the role of physicians in controlling women's reproductive healthcare. I also learned how to read primary sources and to write op-ed-type papers that were more focused on the historical implications of past events than making a definitive thesis.",

I also learned how to make connections between the history of medicine and political or social history. As a history nerd who does not do STEM and hadn't taken an HSHM class before, this class was fascinating to me. I learned about abortion, contraception, childbirth practices, midwifery, reproduction under slavery, sterilization, fertility, and a lot more.",

As a woman, taking this class helped me learn about the history of contraceptives and realize that although we have gone so far from where we started, the pharmaceutical companies seem to prioritize profit over women's health. This class has been so interesting and I am glad that I took it.",

I improved my discussion skills, learning how to listen better and bounce off others' ideas to contribute to a meaningful conversation. I learned about the origins of gynecology and the practices and laws that preceded birth control and child birthing in hospitals. We also covered many more topics that were very fascinating.",

                "I learned so much from this class about the history of reproductive health from various perspectives: race, class, gender, medicine, economy, and law. I wish we had education about this topic much earlier in our education system--the class was this good!",

                "i learned about the different histories of reproductive health in the US and how every woman was impacted differently. I learned about different forms of birth control and what factors impacted a woman's ability to safely access these resources.",
                "This course is very interesting because it covers topics such as birth control, abortion, eugenics, family planning, and more. I learned much about the histories of reproductive health that I never knew before.",

                "I love this course so much!! I went in passionate about these topics, and came out with this passion escalated to knowledge. I learned so much about the history of reproductive health in this country, my mind was blown every class! I also was able to practice synthesizing my knowledge in discussion section and through the midterm and final, as well as perform my own research for the repro paper.",
                "I learned more about the history of reproductive health and how to apply this knowledge to current day events. Additionally, it helped me understand how to use this insight to become a better future physician that ensures the best treatment for my patients.",
                "A comprehensive history of reproductive health!",

                "A thorough understanding of the different histories and experiences of reproductive health in the US, beginning in the early colonial period",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Studying more recent histories that are often swept under the rug because they deal with legality, reproduction, and women's rights is incredibly important, especially in our current political climate. I learned more about how I should be looking into these histories, and how different accounts reveal differing narratives of health and progress.",

                "I thought that the course material was very interesting and engaging, but I wish we could have talked more about male reproductive health.",
                "Really loved the class! Topics in reproductive health could have been expanded to other identities (Asian American, immigrant, transgender, etc)",
                "The teaching staff was the strength of this course. Professor O'Donnell is a gift. Readings assigned are genuinely interesting, it won't be a slog.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - as the course continues I assume that the organization for lectures will only serve to benefit. Sometimes it felt like the lectures were thrown together last minute. The first half of the course was great, but I'd suggest increasing the breadth and depth of topics covered in the second half. Oh, and also, let's talk about men's reproductive health too!",
                "This course is simply amazing. The strengths are Prof O'Donnell, the TFs, and the amazing environment that is students who care about advocating for women's health.",
                "This course was amazing! I loved the format of lectures and corresponding discussion sections. I took away a lot of fundamental historical knowledge that I have not learned elsewhere while also engaging in some captivating discussions. The way the assignments were structured was also a big asset of this class. The discussion-based nature of the course greatly aided in how much I took away from it.",
                "Strengths: everything! The lectures were always engaging and highlighted frequently undiscussed aspects of history, while drawing connections to modern U.S. politics and the current healthcare system. The readings were very manageable, well-selected, and often moving and enlightening, in that they provided individual stories behind larger historical concepts. Section meetings helped to reinforce lecture ideas in a smaller setting and to hear other classmates' perspectives on these pervasive issues. Small weakness: Perhaps readings could be assigned to specific days of the week, so that 2-3 readings would be due per lectureotherwise it's easy to get behind on the readings and attend lecture without doing them.",
                "Strengths: interesting/relevant content, low workload, and a research paper on any reproductive topic of your choice. It would be an ideal gut except that class/section meets a lot and can feel like a waste of time. \r\nWeaknesses: I thought the structure of the class was not intuitive and we jumped around a lot-- it could either have been chronological or issue-by-issue, but not both. Lectures were slow and not anything beyond what was on the slides. I felt that class time was often actively wasted/filled up with busywork tasks that could have been done outside of lecture like watching movies and searching databases. I learned more from the readings, which themselves varied wildly in length from week to week... and there was no incentive to do them, since they were not necessary for the discussions we had in section nor referenced in lecture. Every week my classmates and I wrote thoughtful discussion posts on the readings that were just released into the void never to be seen again. I think this class could benefit from major reorganization and should reassess its goals regarding what students should take away from the course.",
                "A strength of this course is that the readings were very reasonable and there was only one big paper. I really appreciated how the midterms and finals just allowed us to show what we'd learned from the course without being overly time consuming. I also really liked the final assignment prompt, since it was super open ended and gave me the chance to investigate a topic I was most interested in.",
                "strengths: lectures, sections,\r\nweaknesses: spacing of final writing assignment so close to final exam",
                "Strengths: every lecture is extremely engaging, the workload is not overwhelming and actually helps you engage with the material, all of the readings were interesting, the course is organized in such a way that missing one lecture will not make you fall behind \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The material was very interesting and relevant, and the workload was manageable. I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to discuss what we were learning in section each week.",
                "As this was a lecture class, the level of engagement was not very higha good thing for someone like me who does not like talking in class but prefers listening and learning.",
                "I think it was an incredible course and I enjoyed the way it was taught",
                "Strengths: You can learn a lot of content without being overly stressed and putting in a ton of work outside of class. You come away with a very different and deeper perspective on healthcare and women's health.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that the lectures often lacked nuance and rigor. The concepts were presented as very black and white, good guys and bad guys, women were oppressed and white men were bad. Specifically, I think the professors and TAs assumed and spoke as if women were always in the right and white men were always in the wrong, and everyone in class agreed. The tone of voice was often \"of course doctors were greedy and sexist\" - at least that's how I felt. I was left wondering if credentialing is always bad, if medicalization is always wrong, and if innovations/tech actually worked (like Listerine, Lamaze breathing). And, for all the arguments about the history of doctors and medicine, we missed a lot of medical history (like when did women become allowed to be OBGYNs, and did that change the practice in any way?). There were also a lot of experiences left out: LGBTQ+ women, Asian-American women, Latina women, Native women - and I would have liked to see a little bit of diversity beyond Black and white women. Basically, you learn a lot but are left with a lot of unanswered questions.",
                "This course was super interesting but I wish the lectures could be recorded.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload, great atmosphere, very approachable Professor and TA's, interesting material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: INCREDIBLY biased. At times, you could not even call it a history course. You mostly read opinion pieces so if you are alright with only hearing the feminist, alt left viewpoint (which many at Yale surely are) then it is fine. The professor owns up to her liberal bias, which I think is honest and appreciated, but it definitely is not a course which is trying to be anything other than catering to the liberal viewpoint at Yale.",
                "Strengths: course material is interesting, TAs are very helpful, assignments are fun and encourage you to be creative with the class content, grading is not super harsh, readings are sometimes long but are engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often felt like I learned more from the class readings than from the lectures, Professor O'Donnell seemed like she was reading off of her notes during lectures and felt too rehearsed.",
                "Strengths: lecture! Prof. O'Donnell is an amazing lecturer, used a lot of images and primary sources as examples, also liked the format of the midterm and final exam\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings could be quite dense/long",
                "I think the lecture style of the course was extremely engaging and I appreciated that the slides were posted online. I only wish that the class could have been recorded for students that had to miss lectures at times.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING professor! also the topic is just so interesting and relevant and it felt that way every day of class\r\nWeaknesses: nothing major",
                "The readings were digestible, the lectures were actually informative and interesting, the discussion sections were run really well - ideas were actually fleshed out and I came away with a better understanding of the content covered that week. No weaknesses for me!",
                "the lectures and readings were extremely engaging and informative! i learned a lot and enjoyed it a ton",
                "Strengths: relevant topics were covered while also considering racial and religious implications, brief discussion about male reproduction was interesting (and could be longer), readings were beneficial and added depth to lecture content, dynamic discussion via readings, the workload was very manageable, accessible help, guest lectures were new and interesting perspectives  \r\n\r\nweaknesses: history in the US but the mention of the rest of the world would provide interesting context, some lectures became repetitive",
                "Lectures were informative, were sometimes hard to follow especially when their style was more anecdote telling but were still interesting to listen to",
                "low stress class; highly recommend",
                "Strengths: Prof. O'Donnell is amazing! She is hilarious and delivers the course content in a meaningful way\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps a more equal distribution of readings /podcasts across weeks",
                "I felt that the course structure was very fair. The final project is a lot of work but you have plenty of time to work on it and have to turn in a annotated bibliography to help keep you on track. I felt that the annotated bibliography could potentially be replaced by a paper outline, which would be more useful for the final project as the bibliography for the finished product does not need to be annotated.",
                "I have no improvements!!",
                "The strengths of this course was the teaching staff, lectures, readings, and discussion sections. Professor O'Donnell and the TA's truly care about their students and it is a truly wonderful learning environment. The weaknesses is the distribution of work throughout the semester. It was a fairly low work load which is nice but the end of the class was super busy with the History Matters report and the final. I think it would've been nice if the report had been due a little bit earlier for better distribution of work.",
                "strengths: lots of primary sources, professor's super engaging, and discussion sections were well organized.",
                "Though it was a lecture, it was still engaging and entertaining. The readings always matched up with the lectures, which was helpful in really understanding the material, but sometimes it did feel a little repetitive. But I think the repetition was good because it made it easier to grasp what was going on and feel passionately about it. This course definitely made everyone passionate about the subject.",
                "I absolutely loved the balance between lecture and seminar-style classes. I also loved how personal Professor O'Donnell's lecturing style was.",
                "Fantastic lectures and guest lectures. Passionate teaching fellows. My only wish would be for recorded lectures to review since the powerpoints do not contain all that is said.",
                "Professor O'Donnell is a fantastic lecturer, very engaging. However, there is unfair differences in grading between the different TF's.",
                "Excellent lectures -- Professor O'Donnell is just absolutely wonderful - extremely engaging, understanding, knowledgeable, and humorous.\r\nMy section TA was also very helpful and led very thought provoking group discussions.",
                "The entire course is strong  Professor O'Donnell is amazing. She chooses the perfect readings, assigns the perfect essays/exams, and structures her lectures perfectly.",
                "Content was really engaging, assignments were meaningful, and Professor O'Donnell was such a good lecturer!!",
                "I enjoyed how the course was taught in lecture and discussion section format. I thought the course did a good job of showing us different primary sources. I also liked how in the discussion section you got a chance to dig deeper on specific topics. Some of the lecture topics seemed a bit repetitive so I think in the future they could do a better job in presenting different types of material in lecture.",
                "I think the lectures were very engaging!",
                "strengths is content and prof Odonnel! she is really there for the students and doesnt want us to be too stressed. Weaknesses were i felt like they couldve incorporated more into the class",
                "Strengths: readings and assignments were engaging and the perfect amount. lectures were always interesting and I would always learn something new. Guest lecturers were also super informative.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes content felt repetitive",
                "I think this course is great. The lecture style is nice and shell usually post the lecture in case you cant make it.",
                "This class was one of the most informative that I have taken at Yale.",
                "This course is extremely engaging, well-organized, and very stimulating. Amazing!!",
                "This course was really strong because of the reading selection, lectures and general course plan. The main weakness is breadth of what can be covered.",
                "I enjoyed how applicable the class was.",
                "The seminars are very engaging and help to focus in on specific topics.",
                "I thought the set-up of the class was great  lecture was amazing, discussion section was thought provoking, and I loved how the emphasis was on curiosity instead of grades. I just wish we had more time to dive into some of the material, like everything was kind of covered in broad strokes and I wish we could have gotten more into the nitty gritty of specific topics, especially in section.",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor, TAs, content, and assignments. Everyone involved was clearly passionate about the course material and this allowed the students to stay engaged with the course. The teaching team was clearly invested in the students' wellbeing and I really appreciate the care that the teaching team took to make such an amazing course. I adored the course content and this class has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. There are no weaknesses of this course!",
                "Strength Professor ODonnells passion for the subject\r\n\r\nWeakness None",
                "The workload throughout the semester was manageable and the readings were interesting in addition to the actual lecture content. Additionally, the guest lecturers were interesting and class was never dull. The only weakness would be in the material taught naturally focusing on white individuals . There should be more of a focus on the histories of people of color, sex workers, lgbtq+ individuals, and more since these histories were largely glossed over.",
                "I think a big strength of this course was Professor O'Donnell's personal experience and sharing of stories to get her main points across. Using figures like Martha Ballard and Barbara Seaman allowed for us to see different points of history from their eyes and follow singular experiences rather than generalizing.",
                "The lectures were fun and engaging, the assignments were valuable to my time.",
                "Some of the lectures were a little repetitive, but the overall content of the course was amazing",
                "The course material was really interesting and hit topics other than Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, I felt myself wondering why I was coming the class because more often than not, the slides and her lecture were exactly the same. When it came to topics that she was well researched in, I enjoyed the lecture more because she was able to add comments not mentioned on the slides.",
                "I dont see any weaknesses. For strengths, I thought the professor and TFs were incredible, the lectures were informative and engaging, the readings were engaging and just the right about, section was really fun in that we got to discuss everything with our peershighly recommend the course!",
                "I think a weakness was that there was no stream option and it is very hard to get the necessary info from just the slides. I was ill for a lot of this semester and had to rely on friends to fill me in on what I missed. Strength was discussion section, was a great time to fully understand the material and engage in discussions.",
                "Could have been organized by theme rather than chronologically to avoid repetition, and more clearly follow patterns throughout history. Professor was very kind and funny, and taught the class at a great pace. Assignments were made accessible, and appreciated the take-home nature of exams and truly believed the questions were reflective of our curriculum and open-ended enough that we could review a lot of things - very helpful to me as a student with ADHD that doesn't do too well on exams but knows the content."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think that learning the history of reproductive health can be insightful into how we treat the subject in the modern day, especially if a student is considering a career in medicine.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you're interested in medicine.",
                "Yes, take it. You won't regret it and it will expand your perspectives.",
                "YES",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only do I fundamentally believe that all students should have some knowledge on reproductive rights, but I think that the course itself is fascinating and that you grow as both a student and a person from taking it.",
                "Yes, I definitely would! At times, it felt that the course moved slowly, but I really did learn a lot and the content (while heavy and difficult at times) was very educational and covers subjects that I believe everyone should have basic knowledge about!",
                "Yes!! This class contextualizes such important, topical debates about abortion and contraception, while highlighting aspects of the past that have not been discussed enough, including the history of eugenic sterilization and the Puerto Rico trials. It's especially critical to understand this material in light of the leaked Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade; knowing historical precedents that led up to the present can help us address and prevent future wrongs committed against women, and especially under-resourced women of color. This class also teaches history through the lens of reproductive justice, which is incredibly relevant to the current moment.",
                "Sure, as long as you either 1) are interested enough in the topic to be motivated to do the readings, have discussions with classmates outside of class, write a self-directed research paper you are proud of, etc. or 2) actually want a gut where you can skip class, not do the readings, and be totally fine...  without feeling like the whole thing is a waste of time. I was somewhere in the middle and it did not work for me.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The combination of STEM and non-STEM people means that anyone can take it and it's very accessible. I think that this is such an important history to understand and I wish more people saw it as a necessary class to take. This class will not take up all your time and it will give you the opportunity to view American history from a new and specific lens.",
                "Such important course material. Everyone should take this course.",
                "Yes, I found this course very interesting and had a high level of engagement with it",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone!! Please take this course, the content and professor are amazing. This is truly one of those mind-blowing courses you only get to take at Yale",
                "Yes, this was a good introduction into the history of reproductive health, and everyone should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is important to know about the history of reproductive health no matter what your gender is. I think it is relevant to be knowledgable about the reproductive health and its history.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any students regardless of majot or interest!",
                "Yes, it's super interesting.",
                "I would recommend to someone wanted an interesting, manageable workload, and is highly liberal.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Manageable workload, great atmosphere, very approachable Professor and TA's, interesting material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: INCREDIBLY biased. At times, you could not even call it a history course. You mostly read opinion pieces so if you are alright with only hearing the feminist, left viewpoint (which many at Yale surely are) then it is fine. The professor owns up to her liberal bias, which I think is honest and appreciated, but it definitely is not a course which is trying to be anything other than catering to the liberal viewpoint at Yale.",
                "Yes! The course had its weaknesses, but if you are interested in the class content I would definitely take it. It's a good 5th credit to have that is interesting and not too demanding.",
                "Yes, the topic is super important! More men need to take this course; our class was overwhelmingly women which was expected but still disappointing to see :(",
                "I actually would recommend this course to another student. I think that this topic is extremely important especially in the context of current events today. The curriculum is pretty extensive so you are able to cover a number of topics.",
                "Yes! This course teaches things that everyone should know, it has a great professor, and it's fun",
                "definitely! the course was fascinating but not stressful",
                "Yes, I would. This is a great course to get introduced to reproductive health, especially since history is so important. I feel like I didn't know too much before this class but I learned a lot. The discussion sections also facilitate a lot of learning that I believe benefited me even more.",
                "I think its a good intro history class on the topic. The class can feel like an echo chamber for the same opinions though",
                "YES",
                "Yes absolutely! This class helped me so much in contextualizing various events in the history of reproduction",
                "Yes. Great class and Prof. O'Donnell is a goddess.",
                "Absolutely! One of the best courses at Yale!",
                "Yes! This class is amazing and piqued my interest in reproductive health. It is one of the most engaging classes I have taken at yale and Professor O'Donnell and the TAs are excellent.",
                "Yes!!! This was a truly amazing course with the best teaching staff and such interesting and pertinent material. It is a very manageable workload and the lectures and discussion sections were important and meaningful. I could not recommend this course enough.",
                "YES! Please take this class, especially if you're interested in going into medicine! I personally gained so much insight into the history of medicine, bodily autonomy, inequity of medical access, and the reproductive justice framework. Class is especially informative these days--when Roe v. Wade has the potential of being overturned.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes- this area of history is so important and it was a super enjoyable class.",
                "yes!!! Incredible class and enjoyed it very much!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially in light of recent challenges to women's rights. It is extremely relevant, and many of the histories that we learned about in this class have been overlooked in previous history classes and media about reproductive rights.",
                "Definitely, especially in this political climate",
                "Yes, if you want to take a lower workload history class.",
                "Yes, absolutely. I think it is crucial that everyone has a fundamental understanding of the histories of reproductive health.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Everyone of all genders needs to take this class",
                "Absolutely! I really enjoyed this class! If you have any interest in reproductive health, I would definitely recommend!",
                "I would recommend the scores to anyone who wanted to know more on the reproductive history in the US as well as any premed student as it does give a strong foundation in the history of health care.",
                "Yes! Definitely take if youre even remotely interested in reproductive health",

                "Yes! the professor was amazing and she truly wanted you to succeed.",
                "Absolutely. This course is amazing and the content is fascinating. The professor is very understanding and truly cares about the mental and physical health of her students.",
                "YES, if you can take this class. Professor O'Donnell is fantastic and a wealth of knowledge. She clearly cares about student learning. Every student interested in reproductive health should enroll.",
                "Yes. The topics touched on in this course are highly important and relevant. I really appreciated the topics I learnt in this class.",
                "Yes definitely. The topic is extremely interesting and there is so much that I never knew before.",
                "Yes! Learned a lot, engaged in a lot of different source material.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! I think every person should take this class. Especially with the threat of Roe being overturned, it is so timely!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is a well-structured class that provides extremely valuable information. The professor and TAs are very passionate and they clearly know the course material. There was never a boring day in the course and I appreciate the time and care that the teaching team put in to make this excellent course!",
                "Yes!!! Everyone should know about the history of reproductive health because it affects everyone today!",

                "yes! really great, engaging, approachable intro to reproductive health for anyone",
                "Yes! I learned a lot of important history, and the workload wasnt too demanding.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The information is incredibly pertinent, and the way it is taught makes it easy to make connections with the past and present. I also feel that there are parts of these histories that should be wider known, and its critical that students of history or medicine have this awareness.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot of important history.",
                "Yes, for sure. Especially for pre-med students because the lessons learned in this course are valuable to all future healthcare providers.",
                "1000%! Professor ODonnell and the TFs were not only so smart and engaging but also so kind! The material was also fantastic. Such a wonderful course that everyone should take.",
                "Absolutely. Great class!",
                "Yes. Especially appreciated readings on Black and Indigenous resistance - poc history shouldn't start and end at trauma. Very important to take in the context of reproductive rights in the US today. Learned about the framework of the laws we're seeing being fought against in court today in addition to the resistance of the women who fought for those laws. Could have been organized by theme rather than chronologically to avoid repetition, and more clearly follow patterns throughout history. Professor was very kind and funny, and taught the class at a great pace. Assignments were made accessible, and appreciated the take-home nature of exams and truly believed the questions were reflective of our curriculum and open-ended enough that we could review a lot of things - very helpful to me as a student with ADHD that doesn't do too well on exams but knows the content."
