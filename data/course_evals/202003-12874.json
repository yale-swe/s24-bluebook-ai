                "This course has a lot of support from the Spanish dept. and team of L2 instructors, and it is very well designed. I think in the online format this year perhaps the ratio of presentations to other kinds of speaking practice was a bit high, but ultimately the workload was distributed well.",
                "It is VERY time consuming. However, I want to learn a language. The time commitment is both a strength and a weakness. I think letting students know what they are in for before reading period would be useful.",

                "While I understand all language programs at Yale are meant to be intense, I felt like given the circumstances, the work was less conducive to learning than originally intended. For example, there were way more presentations than I expected when I entered the class. I do feel like my oral skills got better, but having to prepare a four-minute-long presentation from memory week after week for over a month encouraged memorization over actual comprehension and speaking skills. I felt like I spent a lot of time trying to regurgitate words rather than use grammatical structures and vocabulary more organically. The back-to-back cultural presentations left little room to work with the vocab from units we were actually studying, and in writing our scripts, we often had to teach ourselves new vocabulary which wasn't as accessible to our peers when we presented. In reading and writing assignments, I wish we could have spent more time with the new grammatical structures, which would better prepare us for quizzes and exams."

                "COVID presented very few actual challenges for the learning of Spanish, other than the occasional Zoom problems which rarely caused real learning deficits. Generally the worst side effect of the pandemic on this course was the increased workload it induced. In an effort to \"catch up\" or \"account for\" the \"virtual shortfalls\" of the pandemic, the teachers would assign completely excessive workloads and examinations in order to, quote, \"keep us moving\" because they were so afraid that we would not learn in the virtual setting. In reality, this increase of workload only increased anxiety, and we spent more of our \"limited\" time in class doing examination than anything else. Overall this course didn't have problems with the virtual learning, only the instructors responses to the anticipated problems.",
                "Succeeded: breakout rooms to get to know classmates better. Good online format for homework. \r\nCould be improved: The test format has black and white answers that would sometimes mark correct answers incorrect. Virtual class was more difficult all around.",
                "Class discussions were fairly successful, and the oral presentations (especially the mock trial and Cervantes projects) gave us a lot of speaking practice. Also, small-group breakout rooms were helpful for reviewing textbook activities and practicing speaking.",
                "Zoom worked. In the least, our professor made it work. However, breakout rooms in Spanish class just don't seem like they can serve students after about 5 minutes of activity.",
                "syllabus could be better tailored to the online environment.",
                "Everything was taught remotely, so in regards to safety and accessibility, this course was successful. I appreciate that language tables were still offered, but I didn't get a chance to attend them because of schedule conflicts. I think the department really tried to maintain strong engagement, and the film series encouraged student participation with the incentive of extra credit. But languages are best learned when students can practice with one another, and despite the good opportunities, it still felt hard to reach out and make the connection to resources that would improve my learning experience."

If you are like me and need this to fulfill the language requirement, weigh all of your options carefully... This course was my least favorite class of the entire semester for a variety of reasons. First, don't be fooled by the title \"Elementary Spanish\", you will be expected to perform miracles in this short semester; by the end we were giving weekly presentations memorized, taking tests every other week, and during all of this you will be doing excessive homework every day for content that you may or may not be graded on or cover in class. Additionally, with only one semester of prerequisite knowledge, you will be expected to have a natural accent and conversational fluency in order to get good grades; no matter how hard I tried, it was never enough for my professor. Overall the workload for this course is completely ridiculous, and if you need the credit and have to take it, buena suerte...",
