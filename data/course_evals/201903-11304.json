    "Fluid Mechanics, i guess...",
    "I didn't learn anything by taking this course. I did learn some from the textbook, namely mass and momentum balance, differential conservation equations, Bernoulli's principle, boundary layer, and pipe flow.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of fluid mechanics, including mass, energy, and momentum balances, laminar and turbulent flow, and inviscid and vicid flows.",
    "Intuitive understanding of fluid mechanics phenomena.",
    "You will learn about different aspects of fluid flow, with a heavy focus on boundary layer importance, drag, and Bernoulli's Theorem.",
    "I definitely learned how to study for open note exams very well, and I think I definitely improved those kinds of test taking skills throughout the course. This was good for real life situations in which we will have to solve engineering problems with our notes and our brains.",
    "Learned a lot about fluid statics, momentum conservation, control volume analysis, potential flow, drag analysis, etc. \r\n\r\nYou also learn how to deal with more difficult faculty in a way thats productive for you.",
    "I learned a good amount about fluids. This course was really about applying physics to fluids and solving problems relevant to this subject.",
    "Familiarity with several key concepts in fluid mechanics.",
    "Fluid statics, integrals for a control volume (mass and momentum flux), differential analysis of fluid motion leading to navier stokes equations and potential flows, bernoullis\/incompressible invsicid flows, dimensional analysis, boundary layer\/external flow\/draf, internal flows. We did not cover compressible flows.",
    "Learned about statics, boundary layer concepts in external and internal flows, dimensional analysis, etc.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot of practical tidbits about drag and fluid flow. Fluids have all kinds of weird phenomena I didn't know about until now and I'm glad I learned about some.",
    "General introduction to incompressible fluid mechanics.  Included inviscid and viscous (internal and external) flows, with specific focus on applications of Bernoulli and Navier-Stokes.",
    "Absolutely none",
    "A great foundational understanding of the concepts in fluid mechanics, some which I had heard before, like drag, and others which were completely new to me. As a chemE, I enjoyed the breadth of topics that we covered.",
    "Problem-solving techniques and familiarity with equations for different categories of fairly simple fluid flow. Pretty heavy with differential equations and conceptual understanding of the terms of equations.",
    "This class gave a thorough overview of fluid mechanics, focusing mostly on dynamics of laminar flows. In this course I gained valuable skills of applying classical fluid mechanic equations to solve real world problems, and gained a fundamental theoretical basis of fluid mechanics.",
    "This course is filled to brim with fluids. This includes fluid statics, pipe flow, computational fluid dynamics, potential flow, bernoulli's equation, and so much more. Over all a ton of math, playing with equations and problem solving.",
    "A basic understanding of fluid mechanics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot was spent on theory, with the psets and exams on problem solving. would be improved by going over more problems and a slightly more straightforward teaching in class.",
    "The only strength of this course is the textbook, which is quite digestible. Lectures are extremely convoluted, the instructor's hand-writing is indecipherable, grading is inconsistent and arbitrary, and the syllabus is absolute non-sense. There are weekly problem sets that are not graded, but that if you don't complete on time, Gomez will send out an announcement to the entire class threatening to penalize people for not submitting the assignment (which accounts for 0% of the final grade). In order for the course to be improved, lectures to be conducted at a more digestible pace, the instructor should work out at least a few problems in class, and the syllabus should cover a more manageable amount of content.",
    "This class covers a lot of material, and it is taught a bit too quickly. It could be improved by incorporating descriptions of the equations and topics on the powerpoint slides instead of just the equations. Also, we could spend less time going over derivations in class and do more problems instead.",
    "The lectures prepare you for the quizzes, but not the problem sets and midterms\/final.  The homework is not graded, which does not foster learning because a deep understanding of problem sets is key to doing well on the exams, and students will not be motivated to do problems if they are not graded.  If the homework were graded in this class, I really think people would do better in it.  Otherwise, the organization of the course makes sense if you understand it: go to class to prepare for quizzes, go to the TA problem sessions to prepare for exams.  Grading is pretty harsh (I mean, it's fair, but much harsher than other Yale courses, which is why no one would ever take this class for fun) but you will probably learn things.  Prof. Gomez has a borderline hostile attitude toward students sometimes, but in his words, he \"has tenure, so what are they going to do about it.\"  However, he's also often very helpful and open to answering questions if students are confused.  He's harsh, but he's trying to make people learn (more stick than carrot, which is probably not most effective). Honestly, he does a fine job teaching, and he means well, but he's the reason the class gets bad reviews.",
    "The course assumed a knowledge of fluid statics and moved quite quickly (as it had a lot to cover).  I think it would be beneficial to separate the mechanical engineers from the other disciplines (chemical, biomedical, etc.) as they had better preparation going in.  I also believe that the instructor should reconsider his grading curve, as it is harsher than any other STEM professor I have had and encourages students to take the class Credit-D-Fail instead of trying harder to understand and enjoy the material.",
    "The course strengths and weaknesses depended on the amount of effort the student put into this course. A lot of students like to blame their teachers for their bad grades or for not helping, but Professor Gomez was very upfront about the fact that if you were struggling then you would need to come to him directly. In my opinion, this was very smart of him because it allowed for us struggling students to really get some one on one time in order to better understand material or figure out how we could improve.",
    "Textbook is great! Most of the other strengths and weaknesses are a result of the instructor.",
    "Overall the lectures were pretty bad, but the textbook was helpful. I learned everything through the textbook, problem sets, problem sessions, and solutions.",
    "Professor Gomez has many strengths and weaknesses. In general, lectures were mediocre. I felt they gave me a baseline understanding of the material, but I never fully understood what Gomez was talking about until I read the textbook. Exams were too. hard. and the fact that the homeworks were NOT graded was detrimental to ensuring that students were actively engaging in the material. We got penalized if we did not do the homeworks, but had no incentive to make sure we were doing it right... I have nothing against Gomez personally, he's honestly great when you are speaking to him on a one on one basis, but he can seem condescending in class atmosphere to the students who had a less concrete\/intuitive knowledge of the material. Oh also the weekly quizzes SUCKED and points were often taken off for forgetting obscure things.",
    "Fluids is a tough course. There's a lot of material. Fluids are not intuitive at all. Practice problems are only done during a practice problem session outside of class on Tuesday nights. If you don't go to these, you really don't have any opportunity to practice what you learn.",
    "The course is very challenging and the lectures are fast, but it feels mostly organized and I particularly enjoyed the material.  My largest complaint is the homework policy, which really just makes it feel like Prof. Gomez doesn't value our time, despite requiring so much of it.",
    "Let me paint an apt metaphor for you; I was a boundary layer that had to travel against an adverse pressure gradient for too long resulting my speed relative to the object that is MENG 361 falling almost to zero. The adverse pressure gradient was the fact that raw scores didnt matter whatsoever and it was just a competition to try to do better than your classmates. Lets face it, if youve stuck with this class chances are youre pretty smart and a hard working engineer or are kinda crazy if you're taking this course and don't have to. I kept putting more and more effort into studying for quizzes and exams in order to try to prevent becoming irrevocably detached from the surfaces curve (that is the good side of the curve that doesnt land you in the Cs\/ Ds), and spinning off in unrecoverable vortices, but one can only hold on for so long. Unfortunately, sometimes rather than trying to truly learn the material I was just focused on finding the best way to eek out around 50-60% of the points on a test to beat the average. Though I did learn a reasonable amount in the end, at what cost? I was turned turbulent not because doing so was the best way to learn but rather because it was the only way to survive, as I am not a natural genius.",
    "This is a great foundational course and if you are willing to put in the work, you will get a lot out of this class. The lectures were in general, clear in their topic of focus, but a little more disorganized in the execution. Homework problems, while challenging, gave a great foundation to solving these sorts of problems. Overall though, I think the biggest weakness in all of this was me.",
    "It was hard for me to understand what was taught in lecture, but going to problem session with Kevin and peer tutor hours for help with learning how to solve problems was helpful. By asking questions there I was able to pick up on most of the stuff that I missed in lecture and understand what the equations meant and how to use them. Honestly I think the class was pretty well organized, in the sense that there were plenteous opportunities to get help if you are struggling, even if you can't make the normal office hour times. I do think that the fact that homework wasn't factored into the grade caused me to fall behind and not learn from the psets, since I didn't bother to check my answers with others and make sure that I was getting the right answers. That meant when the exams came around I had to go back and correct my own answers and try to figure out where I went wrong after the fact... which is not ideal. I think that the psets should be assigned grade value (even if it's tiny) so that there is motivation to do them well every week and learn everything as you go.",
    "This course was a solid introduction to fluid mechanics. I believe the lectures were clear, and that the textbook was a good fit for the course. The extra help sessions offered by both TAs and ULAs were very helpful as well. all together the course was well taught and it felt as if there were plenty of resources fo help.",
    "The course covers a lot of of important and useful material, and I appreciated that most of the concepts and problems were always discussed in a vary applicable way to real world scenarios, rather than always in far-off theory. With that said, I also appreciated the insistence on understanding a lot of the foundational theory that makes later material easier to understand. Having the additional, optional problem solving sessions once a week were also incredibly helpful in completing homework problems. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that when self-checking homeworks, the provided solutions were often difficult to follow with few (if any) explanations and gaps in processes. Also, material is covered incredibly quickly, and in lectures we often got through a lot of material before ever applying it or really even understanding what we were deriving or solving for in the first place.",
    "I want to preface this by saying I am a chemical engineering major who was forced to take this mechanical engineering class despite all ChemEs having to take it while only ABET MechEs have to take it.\r\n\r\nStrengths: This course teaches fluid mechanics (and even goes above and beyond to teach fluid statics too)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am aware that this is a mechanical engineering class but a professor should be cognizant of what type of students are in their class, especially when this class has had both MechEs and ChemEs for YEARS now. Despite this, any sort of example both in the text and in class has been solely MechE related. This makes it extremely unfair for anyone who is used to seeing those types of problems. Also, the amount of content is too much. There was talk of going into reading period when were weren't scheduled to and the course already felt rushed without the extra classes.",
    "Fluid mechanics with Gomez gave me a bit of the same vibes as thermodynamics with Judy Cha where it was a very difficult course, but it was very fair as well.  Strengths were it felt fair in terms of workload, tests, and quizzes.  Weaknesses were that it felt like Gomez was trying to scare us which made a very enjoyable subject less enjoyable, but maybe it was his reputation as opposed to his rhetoric."

    "if ya gotta take it, ya gotta take it.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course to any student that does not need to take it. If you want to learn fluid mechanics, just download Fox and McDonald's textbook, because that is the only way anyone learned anything in MENG 361.",
    "I would not recommend this class as it is taught to anyone unless they need it for a requirement.",
    "you don't take this class for fun, at least not with Gomez",
    "I would not recommend taking this course if you are not required to and are not interested in fluid mechanics.  It will not change your mind and it is not worth the extra effort unless you enjoy the material.",
    "If you are an engineering student and this class is required\/recommended for your major, I would recommend you take it.",
    "Well if you want to have a good time dont take this class. I assume that you would have to take this class anyway, especially if youre ChemE\/EnvE (honestly very disappointed that the ChemE department couldnt muster up their own fluids class). \r\n\r\nBut if you are ready to learn and have excellent work ethic (which I certainly dont have), then you might get something out of this class.",
    "Not unless you're self-motivated, or it's required for your major.",
    "It's not good, but it's honeslty fine because you can cover the material yourself. don't take it with Gomez though because his lectures are very confusing and he only gives 2 As.",
    "Not at all. Only take this class if you are ABET.",
    "I would. Gomez has some..... perks ...... BUT he does care about student learning and he values practical skills in engineering. He really emphasizes the material that he thinks will be most useful in the real world.",
    "It is required for the MechE ABET major, so I probably wouldn't have to.  That being said, I enjoyed the material and thought the class did a pretty good job of introducing it.",
    "Strong nope.",
    "absolutely not, it was honestly the worst course I've taken at yale, from structure to professor. The content has potential but was seriously below par",
    "Speaking to chemE's, if down the line there is a chemE only fluids course, I think I would still take this 'version' because the generality and foundational nature of this course. If you can do this course, you would be able to understand any other intro fluid mechanics with the added benefit of the mechE topics",
    "I didn't find the material very inherently interesting, and there isn't much built into the course to encourage you to be excited about it. So take it if you want the knowledge, but unless you're interested in fluid mechanics, don't expect it to be one of your fun classes. Also, go the extra mile to make sure you understand everything conceptually because that really matters in this course. I do feel like I came out of it with a good grasp on the concepts we learned.",
    "Yes. This class was difficult, but if you have interest in fluid mechanics it is rewarding.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to anyone other than those who have to take it. It is not particularly interesting to most, and is quite challenging in all aspects.",
    "Absolutely not. The content of this course is fine and actually interesting but the professor is awful and ruins it. If this class is taught by Professor Gomez DO NOT TAKE IT unless you have to (but maybe try to find a work around with your DUS?). If it is not taught by Gomez definitely shop it. It can be very rewarding to learn if taught correctly.",
    "Who takes fluid mechanics if theyre not MechE, chemE, or EnvE?? Youre looking at the course reviews because you have to take it for your major."
