The entire semester there were assignments (the reading responses) which should have just been easy, give-me points that were so, SO ANNOYINGLY NIT PICKILY GRADED. I consistently was not enjoying any of the assignments in this class not because of difficulty or lack of interest, but rather that I was constantly scanning my work and worried about losing points for not doing things a particular way.",

                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Hirsch!!!\r\nShe's so clear in her lectures; her powerpoints and examples are amazing too. She somehow manages to find the most relevant research studies, and the way she covers topics that are relevant and organized thematically is just fantastic. \r\nI loved this class so much that I would constantly tell my friends about interesting facts I learned from lectures / from the readings.\r\nProfessor Hirsch is also mostly receptive to feedback and incorporates it into the class structure. \r\nFinals and midterms were open book open notes, which was great too because it made studying far less stressful since we didn't have to memorize 5000 studies and researcher names.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish there were more late days\r\nI did pretty well on the final and midterm, but I do think some of the short-answers questions (especially in the midterm) could have been phrased less ambiguously. \r\nNo sample reading response answers given, which made navigating the assignment a little tricky",

I think if they were cut down into 50 min lectures, the engagement with the course would be much higher. I also think that having more in-class activities would facilitate more class engagement.",
                "This course was good in lecture style and consistently brought in guest speakers.",

You also get a good, broad overview of a lot of topics in social psychology. \r\nWeaknesses: Assignments do not prepare you for the exams! So, the midterm felt like a curveball and was difficult to finish. There were a lot of questions and the short answer questions were crazy hard, so the lack of prep for them was not great.",

FIRST: IT IS A BIG LECURE PSYCH CLASS AT YALE with NO. CURVE. So don't expect The first one that I've heard of. And as the icing on the cake, the grade cutoffs are harder (93, 83, 73 etc rather than 92 82 . . . ) than average. \r\n\r\nBut, hey, no curve would be fine if the assignments were graded fairly and clearly. Nope. The reading assignments, which were so, so annoying to complete, consisted of doing some very easy questions where points were easy to gather, and then a larger, open-ended portion which if you lost 2 points on you would be at an A- or a B+ for the assignment. The instructions for this portion were vague (share your ciritical thoughts) but graded super harshly. When I asked a TF about this, I was told that an A- was supposed to be the modal grade for the homeworks and that I should worry more about the exams as they were more important for my grade. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the exams were terribly planned, and basically consisted of you throwing up a bunch of citations to studies instead of actually writing anything salient or novel. \r\n\r\nLecture was a drag to get through, and basically consisted of listing definitions from the textbook and reiterating the same concepts from the readings. Even at 2x speed lecture felt slow. I say this because practically no one showed up in person for lecture (for good reason, because it was so boring and not engaging in the slightest) which was even acknowledged by prof. Hirsch in class multiple time. In an 100 person class, maybe 10 people consistently showed up by mid semester. \r\n\r\nTo top it all off, Prof. Hirsch realized some of these short-comings and encouraged all of us to fill out midterm review surveys after the first midterm had more variability than she expected (probably because she did not properly explain that we would have to list 2 studies per answer on multiple of the midterm short answer sections). Instead of taking the criticisms that the students brought to her at heart--that the grading was opaque and harsh, that lecture was slow and not engaging, etc. she defensely wrote a class-wide email saying that the grading was not the TF's fault and that they were simply \"doing what she told them to do\". Great. The issue wasn't the TFs, IT WAS YOUR OPAQUE, UNCLEAR GRADING GUIDELINES THAT WERE SO STRICTLY FOLLOWED THAT MADE US STUDENTS WANT TO TEAR OUR HAIR OUT. I am so glad this class is over. Avoid this class at all cost.",
                "Yes, the material was very interesting and obviously applicable to real-world experiences, so I would consider it beneficial. However, the grading mechanisms were rather strict and did not particularly provide great feedback to facilitate error-correction and understanding.",
