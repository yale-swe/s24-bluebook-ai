   "comments": [
    "I developed a deeper refinement of Japanese skill overall and feel increasingly confident in my ability to study Japanese more independently. Through the variety of course materials, I was able to pick up on the different styles and contexts that Japanese is used in. Especially since this is an upper level Japanese course, my sense is that a significant portion of material is geared not toward learning fundamental concepts but refining those already learned, and I feel like I achieved that. I was also able to have a greater understanding of modern written Japanese by both reading and writing in that style, as I believe this will be important to my academic career.",
    "language skill",
    "My Japanese reading ability greatly improved this semester.",
    "I increased my kanji writing ability, made some small progress on pitch accent, and the frequent atmosphere of using Japanese improved my speaking.",
    "I learned not only language usage and content, but also general cultural patterns and diverse ways that Japanese is used across media. A lot of general improvement especially in my reading as well as pitch intonation, writing, and fluency.",
    "Continued to develop my Japanese skills",
    "Learned more Japanese grammar and got to know more about Japanese society and culture by reading news.",
    "How to write formal-style papers in japanese, the proper accent pattern rules for different parts of speech, how to read and discuss news articles.",
    "definitely one skill the course hammers in is how to get a semi-proficient grasp on formal japanese writing, esp. in academic settings (ie. )  the course goes over a lot over the course of a semester, and the final project can be rough, but nishimura-sensei makes the grind worth it...! you definitely come out the other side weathered and weary, but with a much stronger grasp on reading and writing japanese. the course has less of a focus on speaking, aside from some intonation practice, so be aware (and supplement with japanese table to meet cool friends and faculty)!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The most obvious weakness is that class was held only twice per week, to my knowledge, owing to a limited number of faculty. While not so much a weakness, I think more time could be spent on the assessment of reading comprehension, and especially the act of putting things into one's own words. Although, again this might have been hindered due to a lack of class time.\r\n\r\nThe strengths are various. The most overwhelming strength was Professor Nishimura, who led the class with a focused but light-hearted energy. There was rarely a time that I felt bored or numbed by droll, even during grammar. Professor Nishimura was great at engaging the classroom, not only by drawing individuals into the conversation, but by not limiting conversation to just the immediate topic at handin other words, if the discussion took a tangent, Professor Nishimura was always able to turn it into a teachable moment about Japanese language, culture, or capture the classes attention. Curriculum wise, I think our reading \"Hakunetsu denky\" was one of the most engaging, along with the \"Furta\" reading, especially because they allowed opportunity not just for reading comprehension, unfamiliar vocabulary, or grammar, but because they spawned discussions that tested the limits of our Japanese abilities.",
    "The homework assignments were really engaging and rewarding. In the beginning the kanji was a little too much, but towards the end it was reduced to a manageable amount. The class size was fairly large but everyone was attentive, so it was fun overall.",
    "This class is very challenging, but it will push your Japanese ability.",
    "Final project was sort of meh; maybe with a better topic and more time to do it (including peer-reviewed practice presentations!) I would have enjoyed it as much as the J150 project. Also there is not enough spoken language practice--or grading emphasis on it--which I believe is a problem common to most Yale language classes.",
    "In general this course is pretty good, but sometimes I felt like it lacked organized structure. Perhaps the instructor could spend more time on grammar rather than let the class talk randomly."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for all of the reasons mentioned previously: interesting and challenging curriculum, ability to refine Japanese, and Professor Nishimura. If growth of one Japanese is the goal, this course would greatly aid that endeavor, especially for those who have reached a high level of skill and ability to self-study. \r\n\r\nFor those who are somewhat uncomfortable studying independently or who do not feel they have reached fourth year Japanese yet, I might suggest the Light Fellowship or a study abroad program instead, since in my experience, amount of exposure on a daily or weekly basis helps language learning a lot! But again, for those who are comfortable, it is more than adequate.",
    "yes. the class is well structured with different learning materials",
    "Yeah! Great class to take to make sure that you dont forget the Japanese that you learned so far.",
    "Be certain your Japanese is at the proper level to take this course before you do. It's very challenging otherwise.",
    "This is a well-taught, well-structured, and diverse curriculum that will help students of varying upper levels approach Japanese fluency in their own way.",
    "If you've gotten to this high a level in Japanese you might as well keep going, right?",
    "Yes! I love the readings required by this course, and the videos and news were very interesting. And I paid more attention to intonations now.",
    "Yes, the instruction and content of the course was excellent; yet overall it was still a challenging course."
