            "comments": [
                "This class is a good introduction to latest research into LLM. I don't believe there is another class from which you can learn about this. However, the level of engagement for this class is pretty low across the board. It would benefit from more hands-on projects instead of just introducing papers.",
                "Strengths: great content and course slides, professor is quite clear on explanations and genuinely interested in topics. Guest lectures from top NLP researchers.\r\nWeaknesses: HW needs improving to be more clear",
                "Strengths: material is relevant and extremely useful - I'm grateful a class like this exists as it is only going to be more relevant in the future. We were exposed to really cutting edge research which was really cool. I liked the psets, both the coding and the math was as they, while difficult, really improved my understanding of the material. I enjoyed studying for the midterm as that was a good way for me to synthesize a lot of this field. I especially enjoyed how we were allowed to choose a final project of our choice as many students, myself included, had specific research questions or areas of expertise they wanted to explore. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is mostly forgiven because it's a first time course, but it was very disorganized. On several occasions, the submission portals wouldn't even be up until hours before the deadline. On others, the homeworks had numerous small mistakes or ambiguities and on one occasion the correct answer in the homework autograder was changed a few hours before the deadline! I didn't mind much of this, because as Professor Cohan told us, research contains ambiguities and clarifying them is an important skill but perhaps in the future smoothing out some of them would be nice.",
                "Strength is the course material, the number of guest lectures (which I absolutely loved because this is a very applied course), and Professor Arman's teaching. Weakness, or rather a recommendation, is the fact that lectures were recorded. Students will ask for it, but I encourage not recording because it makes students come to class, which is really important for learning and engagement. A weakness was also the imbalance of the problem sets. The first problem set was really long and really difficult, which stood in contrast to the far more reasonable second and third problem set. I also really enjoyed having a final project.",
                "The course is poorly organized, with assignments often being changed and deadlines being moved last minute. It was often unclear where to submit homework, or in what format to, until mere hours until the submission. The course was also extremely fast-paced, with little regard for student feedback.",
                "develop more homework",
                "1. lectures went a little fast at the start \r\n2. more guest speakers\r\n3. more opportunities to engage with the professor, office hours were not that much",
                "The course material is interesting, but it might need some more organization.",
                "Grading of final project was unclear, no comments provided; no answer key provided after homeworks due dates",
                "Strengths: selection of topics was super relevant and interesting, Arman is incredibly kind and a great lecturer, open-ended final project, a good number of extra credit opportunities, fair midterm, clear slides, manageable workload Weaknesses: course was slightly disorganized, the scope of the first pset was way too large, grading was slow, sometimes TAs didn't have an answer key/weren't familiar with psets, but this is highly understandable given that this is the course's first year",
                "The course felt very disorganized. Grading was constantly confusing and emails to the professor and TAs were never responded to.",
                "Strengths: Great lectures that efficiently synthesized state of the art research in a digestible way. Really helped build my understanding of foundation models in NLP. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Probably less useful if you're not interested in NLP. Lots of unclarity about grading until grades came out. I didn't get a project proposal/checkin/final writeup grade until after the semester ended (40% of grade), and didn't receive any written feedback on these :(",
                "Guest lectures are well designed and impressive.\r\n\r\nLectures can be more interesting.",
                "Strengths: Covered very useful and recent NLP concepts, open to student feedback in most cases\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of feedback, ambiguity in grading expectations for both homeworks and midterm, inconsistency in the recording of attendances, regular updates to assignments even after the were given out",
                "Overall it's pretty good, the only weakness is some assignments logistics are not very organized.",
                "The content is very new and up-to-date, which is a strong plus. The homework needs improvement on the clarity of instructions and the correctness of code.",
                "It was not clear that the polls would be used for participation. I often completed polls without putting down any name.\r\n\r\nThe guest lecturers were state of the art and high quality. Thanks!"

I feel as I am now much more comfortable completing cutting edge research projects in this domain and generally I feel like a stronger computer scientist. While the class isn't super easy (and it probably shouldn't be, given the complexity of the material), I thoroughly enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it. Really cool class!",

                "Yes I would because of the importance of the topic and how in depth the class is",
                "Not in its current state. I believe this course could, with many tweaks, become a strong course in the CS department, but as it is currently, it is a very dense course that does not facilitate student learning, as most of the learning is done by students outside of the course since it is extremely difficult to keep up with the course material. There is also large disregard for student feedback, and the professor seems to think his class is the only one students are taking.",

                "The material is interesting but a bit more organization might be helpful",
                "Yes, 100%! Given the popularity of LLMs, this course is super relevant, and I found the lectures to all be really interesting and well-explained. The psets could be a bit better, but the midterm felt like a fair representation of what we'd learned all semester, and the final project was a really cool way to dive deeper into an area of foundation models research. I'm sure a lot of the minor organizational issues will be fixed with later iterations of this course, and overall, it felt like a really useful and interesting elective. Arman is also such a kind prof, would really recommend that students get to know him and go to his OH!",
                "No, I absolutely would not. The communication was very poor between the professor and staff and the students. Many unanswered emails, questions, no response for weeks at a time, often no response at all, grades months after the assignment was due and very little control over grades in general. It felt like the grades were randomly decided for each assignment with no explanation, and one of the assignments was literally randomly decided-- where the solution was to \"weight the category less\" even though this does nothing to adjust \"relative\" nature of the grading that was constantly emphasized. I really didn't feel like there was any concern or focus on student success or progress in the class.",

                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend the course. I was able to understand deeply how transformer architectures worked because of it and was exposed to many of the current research ideas in NLP. I also got some practical experience working with LLMs and fine-tuning them through the assignments/course project which was useful.",
