                "Learned so much about Latin American history and US involvement in the region!",
                "You gain a wide survey of the inter workings of Latin American revolutions in the 20th century focusing on us involvement",
                "Comprehensive knowledge of Cold War histories in several Latin American countries and political and cultural trends across the region.",
                "The course provided a great overview of revolution and US intervention in Latin America during the 20th century. Most weeks, we'd start with a discussion of current events (e.g. the Brazilian elections) and their connections to historical events, then focus on a different country\/historical intervention. I got a much better sense of the scope of and motivations for US involvement in Latin America, and a better sense of the history of the region as a whole.",
                "This class gave me some basic information about various revolutions in 20th century Latin American history, although it wasn't necessarily a course geared toward comprehensiveness so there are certainly holes in my understanding. I would say what I most gained from this course was an opportunity to explore interesting political and historical themes in terms of Latin American leftism and US imperialism. Prof Grandin is also incredibly knowledgeable about both history and current events and so it was also an opportunity to gain his perspectives on Latin American history and politics."

                "The reading list is fantastic and Prof Grandin is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions. Most classes were just spent talking, but I would say that is definitely a strength. I feel like there wasn't a ton of opportunity for us to get feedback\/updates on how we were doing besides written paragraphs after the papers.",
                "Strengths: readings, subject matter, knowledgeable professor\r\nWeaknesses: more lecture based than discussion based",
                "I thought the readings were all comprehensive and interesting. Presentations during each class were also very conducive to learning and reflection on topics. The countries chosen were great for study. I do think that class time was overly-devoted to Professor Grandin talking. Hes very knowledgeable and gave us a lot of interesting things to think about, but I was definitely expecting more discussion. This might sound crazy, but I think the class should have weekly discussion prompts or posts as assignments just to ensure engagement with the topics. I think the readings were also sometimes too long when totaled up for the week.",
                "Dr. Grandin is a kind and fascinating instructor. The class ended up being more of a guided lecture than a seminar -- Grandin would introduce the topic for 15 minutes, someone would ask a follow-up, he'd talk for another 15 minutes. Midway through the semester, he seemed to want to make it more of a seminar, but didn't really ask us discussion questions other than \"does anyone have anything to add,\" so it was hard to contribute and ended up reverting to a lecture format. That said, Grandin is a great lecturer and knows a ton about the subject, so it was great fun to listen to him. Relatedly, the assignment deadlines and descriptions were extremely loose -- both a blessing and a curse. And every session started with an honestly pretty boring student presentation; maybe it'd be better if a different student brought in discussion questions each week?",
                "This class was not really discussion-based at all. It more took a Q&A format where we would show up, Prof Grandin would give an overview of the week's topic (moving through different countries every 1-2 weeks), students would present on the readings, and then we could ask Prof Grandin questions about the topic. The lack of discussion was definitely a weakness although the subject matter itself was so interesting, and Prof Grandin so knowledgeable, that at the end of the day it didn't matter to me that much. I did really appreciate the opportunity to think critically about different forms of revolutionary legitimacy, the role of Latin America in US global policy, trends in Latin American politics over time, etc."

                "Yes, but I would say it is mostly listening to professor Grandin. I was taking the course in part to hear his thoughts on this topic, but often the class felt like a lecture, but with only 15 students.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're OK with it being more Q&A than discussion and if you're interested in the subject matter. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about Latin American history and especially to think about different ways in which revolutions unfold, governments develop, etc.",
