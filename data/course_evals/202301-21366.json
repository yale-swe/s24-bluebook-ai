            "comments": [
                "Bill English is a great professor",
                "Strengths: The breadth of topics and literature covered is great. Strongest part of the course is definitely the material and Professor Englishs decades of experience in the subject matter. Feedback on short papers was always lengthy and extremely helpful. Its sufficiently but not overwhelmingly rigorous.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were rather bland and dry, though informative; sometimes, they only scratch the surface of what's needed to succeed in exams/papers. Grading felt slightly inconsistent, with somewhat arbitrary score assignments (e.g., 120 total points for a single essay, with points docked off here and there without clear explanation). Splitting the course with problem sets in the first half and short papers in the second half was slightly odd. Final exam is difficult, as it effectively requires a short paper to be written in the allotted time. Students are sort of left in a free-for-all, with those that have more background at an advantage; minimal guidance given as to the depth/breadth to which we need to understand all nuances of the topics for papers and exam (basically asks us to just know everything about everything, which is a lot).",
                "Overall a solid class from a solid professor who is very knowledgeable in the realm of central banking and monetary policy from his time at the Fed; however, the 2-week successive deadlines for the 3 papers were a bit of a time crunch, especially as it somewhat meddled with spring break, though you could space your time out very well or it may be nice to space them out a bit further for next iteration of the class. Studying for the final was overwhelming as the scope of the topics was all the lectures and readings, so make sure you have enough time to dedicate to this class. But overall, if you're interested in monetary policy, this is a very informative class that makes the material feel truly relevant with consistent references to current and historical events.",
                "Every aspect of the course is designed to improve learning. Professor English and his knowledge is the biggest strength.",
                "Strength: well structured, slides are clear, professor English explains things really well \r\nWeakness: weekly section not super helpful",
                "I liked that we had a blend of both psets and papers, I feel like it helped capture both the quantitative and analytic aspects of the course.",
                "Prof. English is a great strength of the course. I was worried about not fully having the prerequisites but I was able to catch up and learn a ton from taking this course with him.\r\n\r\nSometimes things felt disorganized with delayed feedback (i.e. problem sets 3 and 4, paper 2). One of the TF's was not great. The format of the 'seminar' was a bit strange with over 40 students -- the course should be advertised as a lecture.",
                "The lectures were phenomenal and the papers were ideal, making you engage with the topics to a very deep level while simultaneously improving your argumentative writing. Out of all of my professors, Bill English has been the best, top one professor. His teaching is so direct and efficient. Bill elegantly answers student questions, he has the strongest command on the subject. He updates his lectures every year based on the economic situation and pressing topics at hand, and you can just tell that this is because he wants students to understand what is happening at the time. He really grounds his lessons in history and present. His extensive experience allows him to provide insights not found elsewhere, and he is basically giving students a look into his research and updated thoughts as events happen. Bill English creates a unique Yale experience.",
                "Strengths - Professor English is incredible. He knows so so much about monetary policy and can provide so much information. The course is also very well structured and covers all the important parts of MP. The guest speakers are really interesting and the papers really make you think about the implications of monetary policy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The grading turnout was quite slow. We didn't know how we did on paper 2 until after paper 3 was due. We didn't have a lot of time between when paper 3 was released and the rewrite.",
                "The lectures were very thorough, but I felt like the feedback wasn't great. Problem sets didn't have solution sets and the grading didn't provide a lot of thorough explanation to the solution of problems. Paper feedback also didn't feel very in depth and it took a while to get grades back",
                "A very good combination of advanced theoretical work and applied policy work. I think there should be more courses like this at Yale, that bring together advanced undergraduate material with an applied lens that isn't about developing research skills applicable to graduate study. It is a shame that the econ department don't have more courses like this, especially aimed at seniors and masters students. It's a big gap and this course shows why they can be so good!",

                "Yes",
                "Yes. Bill English is terrific. Not the most engaging lecturer but he's still great at teaching and genuinely cares for his students. The workload is a bit high but it's worth it because the content is interesting and the course is well organized",
                "Yes, generally. Its a rigorous but highly content-rich course. Demanding expectations and somewhat harsh grading. But, by putting in the time and effort, students can learn plenty about monetary policy and all its facets.",
                "Yes, I would. This class sits at the intersection of macroeconomic theory, econometrics, and economic history, and for that it is extremely unique. You learn about how to think of a dynamic economy with choice simplifications, and from there what effects monetary policy will have in this model economy. This informs the discussion of actual policy implemented, particularly with regards to the Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this class is a WR class and is useful for Econ majors who have yet to complete this distributional requirement. To this end, it does have quite a bit of writing (maybe just to me, writing isnt my strong suit). There are three papers that task you to do some form of synthesis of research and economic analysis with relation to a topic covered in class. Each are limited to 5 pages in length. I personally didnt find the experience of writing these papers to be particularly insightful or useful, but I can get behind the idea that written communication is critical to monetary policy, and thus it makes sense. Consider this as you decide on this class.",
                "I would recommend if you're truly interested in learning some monetary policy. We do delve a bit into some mechanisms related to the central bank such as open market operations and large-scale asset purchases, but mostly this is a class that develops a framework in which you can identify and consider shocks to the economy, possible risks, and weighing the upsides and downsides, with respect to the interest rate lever and unconventional policy, and think about how you can craft a statement imagining you're the Fed. Prof. English is really nice and incredibly knowledgeable given the decades he has spent at the Fed. The lectures are taught quite well and feedback on our papers were detailed and valuable.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes no matter what major you are, you learn so much",
                "Yes, the class is very interesting and seems very useful. Writing the papers also teaches a lot and forces you to do a lot of research, in turn, teaching you a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend, it's a fantastic way to build practical knowledge of monetary policy and it's probably done the most of any econ course I've taken at Yale to help me understand what I see in the news.",
                "Yes! The course is a lot of work and you will have to spend time in SOM for office hours, but if you put in the work you will get a lot out of it.",
                "Yes- if interested in economics, finance and policy. It has many applications across economics and is a very thorough intro to monetary policy making.",
                "Absolutely, you will be able to understand almost everything regarding the Fed's current actions, its communications, mechanics, and everything in the news regarding Fed actions. Things you had not even thought of before about what the Fed has to take into consideration to implement effective monetary policy. You gain a greater appreciation of how difficult this is. Take the class for Bill English.  Out of all of my professors, Bill English has been the best, top one professor. His teaching is so direct and efficient. Bill elegantly answers student questions, he has the strongest command on the subject. He updates his lectures every year based on the economic situation and pressing topics at hand, and you can just tell that this is because he wants students to understand what is happening at the time.

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Understanding the macroeconomy and monetary policy is important regardless of what area you want to study. It's also extremely relevant right now.",
                "Yes. I think it's a very good upper level econ course to take.",
