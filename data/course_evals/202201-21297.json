                "The strength of this course is that so many topics are being covered and we learn so many aspects of data mining and modeling. However, most of the course load, I believe, was brought on the students at the last two weeks. We had one quiz and one homework in the entire semester before the two weeks. However, in the last two weeks, we were given a second quiz with a short notice, another homework, and a final project with presentation. I think this problem can be improved by assigning the homework and quizzes earlier or at least with a longer notice period so that the students are ready for it.",
                "Strengths - pretty broad overview of biomedical data science if you're into that? However, it didn't feel like there was that much new material - almost everything we learned was something that another class had covered in greater depth.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Honestly, I rarely write course reviews anymore and it takes a lot for me to dislike a course. I'll unfortunately make an exception for this course. I wanted to like it, but it was really poorly organized - too many different lecturers, way too much content, wacky distribution of assignments throughout the semester. We either zoomed through the material too quickly or, in a couple of cases, spent a ton of time diving into the details of algorithms. This made it difficult to figure out how to study for the quiz or even what would be on the quiz, despite the study guides provided by the TAs. (Tip if you do decide to take this class, though: the quiz archive is actually really helpful.) Moreover, the class was ridiculously backloaded - we had only one thing before spring break (the first quiz), and then everything else hit after the break: the first homework, the second quiz, the final presentation and report, and the second homework. I took particular issue with the second homework because it was assigned the day after class ended and due on the last day of finals. I contacted my dean about this because it was a violation of Yale's academic regulations (regular course work can't be due after the last day of reading period! know your rights!) and he reached out to the instructors but received no response, so I ended up working on the final report and the homework simultaneously. I've also only gotten two grades back at this point (the quiz grades) - no feedback on the first homework, my section participation/presentation, or the final presentation. I'm honestly kind of astonished that the course is still organized like this in its second decade of being offered at Yale, but maybe I shouldn't be given the sorry state of STEM education at this university.",
                "Please make this class more hands on lectures are minimally beneficial - to learn mining and modeling, we should spend the semester mining and modelling",
                "Strengths: lots of interesting topics and great lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: if you don't have a background in math or computing, some of the lectures esp. in machine learning can be very hard to follow. Sometimes the wide range of topics surveyed in this class made it hard to feel like I had a good grasp on any single topic.",
                "The final project and some of the tools we learned to do it were very useful and I see myself using them regularly in the future. But I felt there was too much content that was not applicable or was antiquated and not gonna be useful for current research. Instead of diving deep into the technicalities of how to perform sequencing and alignment, it would have been great if the semester was geared towards applying these methods to the final project to have a more rigorous analysis of Carl Zimmer's genome by the end.",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting, the workload is extremely manageable with only two PSETs and two exams. Moreover, the exams are straightforward to study for. It was nice to have multiple professors from different disciplines speak about their domain of research. The course website is a great resource. Weaknesses: the work is extremely backloaded and could be better distributed, and sometimes the lectures were hard to understand and required multiple rounds of re-watching to understand. There could be less focus on certain derivations (especially during the deep learning module) that I think flew over most of our heads.",
                "The lecture covers a lot of background. It is a lot hard for people without any background knowledge to digest.",
                "It will be better if the homeworks is assigned earlier.",
                "very good introductory course",
                "The strengths of the course are that it presents exciting material, is transparent about expectations, and emphasizes teamwork. Perhaps student groups could be given at the start of class. That way they could spend more time getting to know each other's work styles and pooling knowledge to prepare for exams.",
                "The topics went way too fast; it was as if every lecture was a review session of a previous course we supposedly were to take.",
                "Good topics but way to many and spread out. It was really disjointed and hard to follow along. For example, proteins seemed pretty unconnected to everything else we learned.",
                "Strengths : I could skip classes and watch videos online at 1.25 or 1.5x speed, lectures and materials were well organized. Final project was interesting. \r\nWeaknesses : The course title is very misleading, \"Mining and Modeling\" - what a joke. Call it \"Survey of Biomedical Data\" instead please. \r\n                         Poor lecturers.  \r\n                         The last time I took a math class was 7 years ago. I felt unprepared for the questions on HW assignments and quizzes. The questions on \r\n                         HW assignments, specifically HW2, was way out of the scope of the lectures - too difficult, too in depth.\r\n                         The number of topics surveyed was too broad. \r\n                         It felt like I was being taught from a new Wikipedia page every lecture.  \r\n                         Discussion sections and the writing assignments associated with them were fucking awful. . . nobody wanted to be there . . . just absolutely \r\n                         0 passion . . . hardly any discussion occurred. We all frantically took notes from the presenter's slides in order to avoid reading the papers.",
