                "strengths: \r\nSyllabus has a broad scope and a meaningful depth. readings challenged students to think about the theoretical underpinnings of China-Africa relations\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nSyllabus overemphasized Chinese actors and decenters African perspectives occasionally. Although course is a seminar 90% of class time is the class lecturing, and although students are engaged in asynchronous class time, such as discussion posts, no in class time is given to foster learning.\r\n\r\nImprovements: dedicate at least 50% of class time to student discussion",
                "The greatest strength was the combination of Professor Siu and Rundong, who brought different academic and personal perspectives on China-Africa relations. The class also provided a lot of support for the final paper, which was very helpful because the final was a research paper and I was not familiar with this kind of work. One weakness of the class is that there was not much time for class discussion. Additionally, it would have been helpful if class discussion was organized in such a way that exchange of ideas between students was encouraged.",
                "This course was phenomenal. The readings were particularly interesting and informative.",
                "Overall, the information and discussions of the course were well done. However, it would be more fruitful to reserve more time for class discussions after a lecture or readings to engage further with concepts and engage with peers thoughts",
                "Overall it was a fascinating topic, and I learned a lot from the presentations that Professor Siu and Rundong gave weekly. Unfortunately, we did not tend to spare much time for discussion each week, so it ended up being more like a lecture with Q&A time at the end. I think changing the lesson structure to give at least 50% of time to seminar-style discussion would make the class even better.",
