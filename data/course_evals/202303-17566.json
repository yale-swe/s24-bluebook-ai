                "I learned to reconsider fallacies and contradictions of U.S. History that were established in high school curricula. The course helps you look at American history from the lens of American identity.",
                "I developed strong skills for reading and analyzing primary sources. This is a skill that is not often practiced in high school, but this course was excellent for it. I now also have a much more complex understanding of U.S history and American identity.",
                "This course helped develop my historical source analysis skills in a manner that I have not experienced previously.  A true seminar, the supportive environment curated by my peers, and especially Dr. Akiboh provided me with the optimal setting to articulate my ideas, express my thoughts, and practice academic communication skills. Because of the course's assignments, my writing abilities have improved tremendously!",
                "I learned so much about American history from founding to present, particularly about more niche events that had not been covered in high school and I was very grateful to learn about. I also think that the class discussions were very productive and well facilitated, and I learned so much from my classmates through them.",
                "I developed the ability to better evaluate and analyze primary sources. Professor Akiboh taught us to think about the importance of the author, their perspective, the time period in which they are writing, their audience, and more to help us understand each source and each authors' point of view or argument."

                "Strengths: Amazing and frequent peer-to-peer and peer-to-teacher interaction. Amazing selection of assignment material. The energy in the classroom is always vibrant and comforting. Professor Akiboh alone is a strength. Assignments are manageable and further deepened my engagement with history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The seminar setting of the course allowed us to have intimate and enriching discussions, sometimes on difficult topics. The course was structured in an organized manner that allowed us to see how American identity has evolved through our country's history. We also explored American identity from a foreign standpoint that opened up new perspectives.",
                "There are so many good things about this class. The work is very intellectually engaging, but the workload is not heavy. The seminar style class made the discussions captivating. There are no weaknesses about this course.",
                "A strength was definitely the content of the course and the subject of discussions that resulted from it. However one way that it could be improved is by encouraging more engagement during discussions.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Akiboh is an outstanding instructor who's passionate and incredibly knowledgeable about the topics covered within the class. This course was designed to cater to students of all backgrounds and interests, expectations and feedbacks for assignments were always clearly discussed.  The contents discussed within the course were fascinating; they covered both famous and lesser-known topics within American History. But regardless of how popular these topics are, you will always finish the class feeling as though you learned something new! Weekly readings are very interesting, and you can see the incredible care and thoughts that are put into them when you get to select the sources yourself for one of your assignments on the last day of class. I honestly cannot think of any weakness in this class!",
                "I think this was an extremely well put together course with few weaknesses. The readings were a fair length and engaging, and the assignments were also interesting and engaging.",
                "Strengths- Interesting class discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Readings for each class were too long, many students I talked to never did all of the readings, only some. The instructor released the final grades without grading two assignments (Contributions to Class and the Learning Journal) which could have changed my grade. The feedback I received on the final project did not make sense to me, I did not agree with any of the feedback the professor gave on this project since she did not clearly outline what she was looking for. The project was very open to interpretation and therefore should not have been graded harshly.",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussions and the organization\/structure."

                "ONE HUNDRED PER CENT. This was my favorite class that I've taken so far, and I was excited to show up to class every time. And so much of this answer was thanks to Professor Akiboh. She made class so engaging, and gave us the space to work through what we thought about sources. Which such heavy course material which may have felt like a lot for students who belonged to certain identities, Professor Akiboh made sure that everyone felt comfortable with speaking about the course material. She never made anyone feel bad for not knowing a certain thing, and she answered clarifying questions\/ corrected people in a way that did not make people feel less than. Her feedback on assignments is actually as constructive as you can get. The sources are so engaging and there is so much discussion that occurs. I've learned so much about myself and my peers. I cannot suggest this class enough.",
                "Yes! This course is a great course no matter what you are studying. You learn a lot about American history from a different perspective and this course gives you a greater appreciation of how complex historical narratives can be.",
                "Yes! If there is any class at Yale a student should take, it is this one. I honestly wish that more students had the chance to take it considering it is just for first years.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it helps create a more complex understanding of U.S history.",
                "Yes! Whether you're into the humanities or sciences, you will not regret taking this class; it's truly inclusive for all! Not only does this class provide you with interesting sets of historical knowledge, it also teaches you useful skills that are applicable in all aspects of life and sets you up for a successful four years at Yale!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is willing to contribute to class discussions and actually put time into doing the readings.",
                "Depends on the student's preferences. Although this course is very interesting, the readings assigned for each class are very long and very dense. It will take any student hours to go through the readings for each class, however, the class discussions and the professor's insights are very interesting. All deadlines are flexible which is a positive for students who have trouble keeping up. The final project does not have a clear format that a student must follow which is very confusing if you don't discuss your project with the professor. In other words, the professor did not clearly outline what she was looking for. In my opinion, I think the grading is very harsh for first-year students who aren't used to college courses yet.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because we had engaging discussions every class. We looked at a variety of sources, such as newspaper articles, petitions, posters, speeches, and more, and there was always so much material to discuss every section."
