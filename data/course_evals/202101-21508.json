                "Hate break out rooms. Awkward and jam board is hard to use. Not good use of time. The videos beforehand is really useful. I like doing example problems as a class especially when class size is small.",
                "The recorded lessons were very useful in gaining the foundational understanding of the material and there was always lots of practice problems that could be done",
                "The strength is that there are a lot of resources available to learn the material outside of lecture. The TAs were extremely helpful, so were the review sessions. One weakness is that sometimes that homework was not very applicable to what was being tested. Also, I did not love continuing with new material before being tested on a midterm. I would have much rather do some type of review in class rather than get new concepts confused, or avoid them in order to not become confused, which then impacted me later in the course. That being said, the course was very well structured.",
                "weaknesses: too much out-of-class work; between the long, weekly psets and the pre class videos, the work was just too much\r\nstrengths: many resources",
                "One strength of MATH 120 overall would be the material covered in the class. Another strength would be the resources available to learn. The pre-recorded lecture videos and the peer tutor sessions (both available to all MATH 120 students) were both quite helpful!\r\nOne weakness of MATH 120 overall might be the length and timing of some of the weekly homework Problem Sets (typically due each Friday) that are assigned to all sections. Around half the time the Problem Sets are often a bit long, but the other half of the time they're of a more-reasonable length. However, it's sometimes a bit challenging to get some of the longer Problem Sets done for Friday while also juggling other classes' end-of-the-week deadlines as well.",
                "The main strength of this course is the small class sizes of each Math 120 section. Since each class only has around 10-15 students, the professor can spend more time answering questions and interacting with the students, which gives us many opportunities to ask questions and participate in the lecture, which is nice compared to the often unengaging large lecture classes of other STEM classes. In addition, the peer tutors in office hours are helpful with test prep and homework. There aren't any major weaknesses with this course"

It's a lot easier to be able to go to a virtual peer tutor session than to run to a physical one! :)",

In-class activities like breakout rooms and polls were also good for testing our knowledge and getting to know our classmates, and I think they contributed positively to my course experience. Virtual office hours also worked pretty well, and the ULAs were all pretty responsive to questions."
