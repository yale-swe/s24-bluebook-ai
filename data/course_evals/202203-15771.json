                "I already knew a lot about intersectionality, but I learned even more in the context of psychology, society, and history. This sounds strange, but the main skill I learned was critical thinking; this class is titled \"Psychology of Gender,\" but it was really more of an interrogation of the gendered, raced, and classed histories of psychology. Our readings were all through the analytical lens of gender, but we were always encouraged to think deeper: whose voices are we hearing in the texts, and whose are we not? I found that really valuable for critical studies.",
                "I learned a ton about the history of psychology and other parts of history that I had never heard of or thought about before. It was a very enlightening course about social issues as well, and I developed a much greater understanding of intersectionality.",

                "Strengths: Plainly, it was a gut. You can do a bit of the readings and contribute one thing a week, and your grade will be perfect. There are reading responses to do, but that's essentially the only interaction with the readings required. The grading is very lenient, and I'm sure some people took advantage of that, but I really loved using it to just learn. We had a couple papers to write throughout the semester, and I was always able to just write freely and learn from my own writing, which is a really special experience at Yale. Also, Tariq is a very kind and understanding professor who just wants to help you learn. Also, the readings are really, really interesting if you're into the intersection of history, psychology, and gender studies!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Tariq will often go off on tangents during seminar; I tended to enjoy them, but given that this is a psychology class and he would mostly be talking about history, I doubt everyone liked them.",
                "Weakness: this course is taught by a history professor and should really just be considered a history course, we barely learned about psychology. The professor makes a lot of historical and literature references that only people who have learned about it previously would get\r\nStrengths: interesting topics like hysteria was covered",
                "The course had some fantastic readings and very interesting discussions. The only criticism is that sometimes the discussions involved too much of the professor talking and not quite enough between-student communication.",
                "Prof Khan creates a welcoming and comfortable environment for students to engage with.",
                "I appreciated the flexibility of this course in terms of assignments, but I would have appreciated more guidance.",
                "The smaller class size led to some very intense discussions. The only weakness might be time on some occasions.",
                "The course lacked a rooting in recent psychological studies and had a strong focus on the past and historical elements. While the historical elements are helpful especially to developing the ethics of a psychologist and understanding the heavy ramifications of their findings this class often felt very lackluster on the psychology front."

                "It depends on who you are. If you're taking this course as a psychology major, I'd say probably not, unless you also happen to enjoy history. If you're taking this course as a WGSS major, absolutely! It's kind of a gut, and Tariq is super sweet and picks great readings. What I will say is that he is a history scholar transplanted into the psychology department, so this \"Psychology of Gender\" is kind of a misnomer: the class is really more like the history of psychology through the lens of gender, which you can use to analyze race and class. If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, definitely take this class!",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone interested in history, not for people looking for psychology",
                "Yes! You will learn so much from taking this course. While the title might suggest otherwise, it is first and foremost a history class, but the things taught in this class are just as important to learning psychology as any of the actual science. I might not have taken this class if I had known what it was going in, but I am so glad I did take it.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! You learn so much in a low-stakes environment. Its a very welcoming atmosphere.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, this course is super interesting!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student, it opened my eyes to many things.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course from a psychology perspective. The class tended to lack depth beyond the general note that psychology has been misused to cause harm to marginalized individuals. There was very little reading done on the specific use of or methods of psychology used and very little talk of current practice and how it can be used to make better use of psychology to help break gender barriers. I think it's important for any student considering this course to know that it's being taught by a history professor and neither a psychology or gender studies professor."
