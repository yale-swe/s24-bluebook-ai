   "comments": [
    "I've learned to think more critically and approach problems one step at a time. Learned just about everything related to calculus in several variables.",
    "How to take integrals with multiple variables (line integrals, surface integrals, etc.) and how to navigate a 3D graph",
    "I learned how to apply concepts that I had learnt in previous calculus classes to three dimensions.",
    "I learned about Green's Theorem, Stoke's Theorem, and Divergence Theorem. I developed problem solving skills, communication skills, etc.",
    "I can take a flux integral.",
    "I learned to develop my critical thinking skills, enhanced my problem-solving abilities, and increased my capacity quantitative reasoning. I also learned how to approach difficult problems in a group setting.",
    "I learned how to think about higher dimensional math and many tools to find different types of derivatives and integrals on it.",
    "I think more than anything I learned to see how things in three dimensions interact with one another, and I think I have also gained a conceptual understanding of a lot of concepts that have very important applications in the real world.",
    "This course was the first lecture-based math course I took in 5 years (my school does Exeter math) and i learned how to utilize a text book and lecture videos in my math studies. I developed my integration skills and had a deeper understanding of how to visualize vector calculus and integration over surfaces.",
    "Multivariable calculus and some of its applications",
    "I learned about multivariable calculus.",

   "comments": [
    "Prof Itziar and the TAs were really helpful in helping us understand the material. Workshops also promoted collaborative work with my peers and allowed us to share our thoughts and approach when working on problems. The only weakness is lectures were sometimes posted late in the day.",
    "Strengths include having enough work and practice on the problems. Weaknesses include the content of the prewritten notes.",
    "The virtual format was a definite strength. I dont know how the course is taught in-person, but being able to see the 3D shapes on a screen really helped me visualize the concepts being discussed.\r\nAnother strength of this class is the Ximera website where we could once again review material from class and answer practice questions. I found this resource extremely valuable in helping me master the topics and because of it I felt very prepared and confident heading into the exams.\r\nI cant think of any weaknesses.",
    "10 min video lectures are NOT enough time to really go in depth for the concepts.",
    "I thought the workshops were engaging, but there were sometimes when I felt like my random group was unwilling to work together and it just felt like I was the only one actively contributing ideas. That was frustrating. Other than that the class was well put together.",
    "The workshops were an integral component of the course and I really enjoyed the opportunity to practice new skills with my classmates each time we met. For improvements, I would suggest that the lecture videos include a little more depth and more explanation of the derivation\/intuition behind concepts. I did, however, find the incomplete notes very helpful.",
    "It was a great course to take online, mainly because of all of the resources to help with learning. For example, Ximera, the lecture notes, the book etc.",
    "I thought the course was very good at showing us exactly what we had to understand, and how we should understand it. I always had a clear idea of what I had to understand, which is extremely helpful for a student. I do think that we could have spent some more time talking about the geometric ideas before jumping into the formulas, but there is only so much that can be done in such a short amount of time.",
    "The strength of the course was the plethora of resources available to students. Not just the office hours of the professor and the TA, but also the textbook, practice exams, and Ximera. Additionally during class ans office hours, the professor and TAs were more than welcoming of questions. The only weakness was that sometimes the lecture notes didnt match the lecture video, but it was manageable to figure out the notes.",
    "Strengths: Well-organized--I always had a clear idea of what's expected of us, and there were plenty of additional resources (e.g. Ximera, the professor's notes, flowcharts, etc.) available to help us review \/ practice. The format of pre-recorded videos + lectures + small-group workshops worked out really well. I didn't thought I'd enjoy the workshops at first, but it turned out they were a great opportunity to practice and discuss what we don't understand. It also gave students a chance to interact when everything is done remote. Of course, the summer session is really fast-paced, but the course felt as organzied and detailed as possible.\r\nWeakness: not a major weakness, but I wished the pre-recorded videos for each lecture could be uploaded 1-2 days in advance. For students living in a different time zone or who have responsibilities during the day like myself, sometimes the only possible time to watch the lectures is immediately before a class, and I sometimes felt rushed.",
    "Very well structured and executed! Can't think of any weaknesses",
    "Strengths: Great TAs, the professor was readily available outside office hours. \r\nWeaknesses: This course covers ALOT of material (in my opinion) in such a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nI would reccomend not taking this course in the summer after having just taken it. Unless you absolutely need to.",
    "Big strength: workshops."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; the course gives you an idea of the rigor of a STEM degree at Yale and prepares you for classes afterwards. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and I think it would benefit anyone who is\/will take the course.",
    "I would only take it if this is a requirement for a major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The class is challenging, but as you begin to master the concepts it becomes extremely rewarding.",
    "Yes, it introduces the beauty of Calculus to students.",
    "Yea I mean if you have to take it then take it. I probably wouldnt just take it for fun though.",
    "This is a great course to learn a lot of math in very little time! While the workload is rigorous, there is ample opportunity to complete all the assignments if you manage your out-of-class time well. The exams are also very fair and reflect the concepts emphasized in class\/on homework.  The course offers a good balance between pre-recorded lectures, live instruction, and group problem-solving.",
    "Yes, because it is built for students to have as much resources as possible to facilitate their learning.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in pursuing anything quantitative. I think some of the concepts may be a bit challenging for more humanities oriented students because the course assumes a fair bit of intuition about calculus and geometry (working with vectors, for example), but it is a Mathematics course after all.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in continuing their math learning past BC, and is comfortable with a quick pace.",
    "Yes, and especially with Itziar.",
    "yes, math 120 during summer seemed to be better than in the fall. itziar is great and explains material well",
    "Yes, only if you need to take the course in the summer. If not, it's probably best to take it during the normal academic year. We had to cover a lot of content in such little time. At times, this was very overwhelming. That said, you could probably manage pretty well if you are only taking this class. If you are taking two classes, just keep in mind that things will be even more chaotic."
