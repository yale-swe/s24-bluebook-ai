Although there were formulas and math to learn, I think that understanding why we chose certain variables and how we related them to one another conceptually was what I was most interested in.

            "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
            "comments": [
                "The strengths are that the course was very organized with lecture summaries, worksheets, problem sets and peer tutoring. The only weakness I have is that sometimes I felt like the problem sets were too geared towards students needing to perform their own research, when we won't be able to perform research during an exam.",
                "The second half of the course felt like a finance prep course, which I was not expecting. I think it would have been helpful to know that from the start of the semester. A strength of the course was its organization. Dr. Hawkins had so many resources for us at all times.",
                "Lecture could be less jokes and more just teach us the stuff.",
                "Strengths: Topics are very interesting and applicable. Well-organized class. Prof. Tsyvinski is very funny and a great guy. Prof. Hawkins is also an incredible teacher, and his organization of the class is amazing. The worksheets and Psets are great at reinforcing the concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Tsyvinski is a great guy, but his lecturing style is not very good for actually learning the concepts. He often goes off-topic or barely explains what's on the slides.",
                "I appreciated the lecture slides, as they were always very detailed and helped provide a perfect summary of what was covered in each lesson.",
                "No weaknesses. I think maybe the exams should not place so much emphasis on multiple choice.  If you miss one MC question you're down 5 points, which is actually quite significant. Lectures maybe a bit slow/boring.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I felt like Aleh was a really great professor and the lectures followed the PSets rly well.  I genuinely enjoyed learning this stuff and felt well supported in section.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hawkins is the GOAT.",
                "I think the structure of the lectures and content could be improved to increase engagement and maybe peak slightly more interest from students.",
                "The professor kept me engaged. Lecture format should be technology-free to force people to pay better attention.",
                "Weakness: Not recorded.",
                "Interactive with good psets and sections to review key concepts of each week's lectures.",
                "Strengths- Dr. Hawkins has a lot of resources on the Ed Discussion, so it's easier to study for exams.\r\nWeaknesses- I didn't feel like lectures were very engaging.",
                "The problem sets were a bit vague. The worksheets were very helpful and well organized.",
                "Strengths: posted slides, good TFS, funny prof, helpful and kinda fun worksheets. Weaknesses: the grading rubric for the psets was very specific and not always easy to anticipate. Instead of giving a good answer, you had to give one specific answer, ex. needing an example when the question doesn't mention that you need to provide one.",
                "The strength of the course was organization and very knowledgeable professors.",
                "Super well organized.\r\n\r\nAlso very boring.",
                "Lectures can be fun but feel drawn out. It doesn't feel worth it to be there for a full 75 minutes.",
                "Very strong director with strong Ed presence, great practice tests,\r\n\r\nSlides need to be clearer, can be more efficient, lots of random talk in lecture which is funny and nice and interactive but can get confusing. Left every lecture (I attended every one) not knowing much, and forgot everything the next day.",
                "Strengths: Hawkins. This man is an absolute legend. He not only shows that he fully understands everything, but he's also great at teaching it. I wish he would've been the lecturer, because his reviews and section were always extremely rewarding. Weaknesses: Lectures are not taught well. Most of the times it was just him reading what the slides were, and still going too fast. I found that not going to lecture and reviewing the slides on my own often led to a deeper understanding.",
                "Strengths - Dr. Hawkins is the BEST section leader!!! Great teacher and always enthusiastic about teaching macro.\r\nWeaknesses - I love Professor Tsyvinski, and he's hilarious and goes off track sometimes because that's his humor, but he's kind of less enthusiastic about lecturing and just reads off the slides. I often doze off, but maybe that's because I am just not that interested in the class. I think if Dr. Hawkins taught it, it would be an amazing class and more easy to understand for me.",
                "The lectures are very informative, and the course is set up so that topics that are interconnected are taught together.",
                "The strengths of the class are definitely Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins. The class is also extremely well-organized, with plenty of opportunities to get help in office hours. However, it definitely felt much more difficult to stay engaged than I have felt with other economics classes, and this was not a class anyone I know was particularly excited about. I felt as though exams were not always a good test of our knowledge.",
                "It was a super solid course! Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins have really mastered the introductory lecture-series format.",
                "n/a",
                "favorite intro econ here",
                "Strengths: good organization and engaging teacher and plenty of office hours",
                "Strengths - This class was a great crossover between basic mathematical topics and more difficult worldwide phenomena. I think its biggest strength was the combination of Professor Tsyvinski with Dr. Hawkins. They are not only knowledgeable beyond belief but also a \"dynamic duo\" teaching team.",
                "The lectures were difficult to follow because there was a lot of content from the slides to write down and not enough time to process what was being said by the professor while writing. However, the course was extremely well organized and offered countless resources for help, so even if you could not follow along in lecture, there were plenty of ways you could grasp the content.",
                "No weaknesses, I thought this class was amazing.",
                "Strengths: the material is very interesting and presented in a digestible way. There's plenty of support for students (sections, office hours, review sessions). Professor Tsyvinski is also a great lecturer; he inserts jokes to make class funny and plays along with students' shenanigans. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Doesn't emphasize intuition enough. I think the most important thing for understanding econ is to have intuition (why do curves on the graphs move in a certain way?). I would also like to see more quantitative rigor (why are equations for describing certain models the way that they are?).",
                "Lecture is great and so it peer tutoring, test reviews could be better.",
                "I think that this course is only as much as you put into it. If you are willing to put in the hours to learn the material, than I think you will find that your efforts will reward you...for the most part. There are lots of resources if you need help with the Psets like office hours and review sessions during final season. Tsvinski is a great guy and I appreciate his attempt to engage the audience during lectures, although I think that the only reason I didn't enjoy this course too much is that I discovered I'm just not too interested in the material.",
                "Strengths: rigorous; covers lots of breadth. Weaknesses: none.",
                "I thought that the class grading was handled very well along with the lecture teachings.",
                "Very organized! Lecture was as engaging as can be for a large lecture course and all the psets were pretty manageable.",
                "Strengths: Good lecturer, interesting examples and engaging classes.\r\nWeaknesses: Terrible admin, Exams had extremely poorly written questions that didn't test student understanding but rather semantic games.",
                "Good class",
                "Strengths: Great TA system, plenty of opportunities to do well in the course such as office hours, multiple TA sections, understandable feedback, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "One of the course's greatest strengths is that it is very structured as it has regular sections and office hours alongside weekly lectures.",
                "It was very well organized. I think it could have been taught more efficiently and interestingly.",
                "Not great for non majors",
                "Strengths: amount of resources (office hours, worksheets, great and FREE textbook, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lecture slides and lecture in general not too engaging",
                "The exams felt impossible as it seemed like there were always many correct answers to the same questions",
                "The course was extremely well organized and well run thanks to Hawkins.",
                "I thought the organization of this class was fantastic. The homework assignments, worksheets (essentially just required practice problems with unlimited attempts so you can get a perfect score), online ed board, and lecture summaries were so helpful when it came to reviewing and learning content. Tsyvinski was hilarious and engaging, Hawkins' organizational skills were amazing, and overall, the class was incredibly well run!",
                "The professors were very entertaining and the way they taught was able to keep the students engaged. Also, the office hours were very helpful for explaining the content. The main challenge I faced was that at times I had difficulty answering the exam questions because it was challenging for me to answer application based questions.",
                "Very well organized",
                "Prof Tsyvinski is very engaging and good at explaining the concepts. The course is incredibly well organized, with many resources available to students.",
                "I think having PSets due on Mondays is better than Fridays. Also I found it a little distracting at times when the lectures went too far off topic.",
                "some topics are very interewting while others wer rather boring and didn't give much to me",
                "There could be more practice during lectures.",
                "This course was very interesting and has no weaknesses.",
                "The content is very interesting and I the lectures kept me engaged.",
                "There should be Slower lecture and better discussion section.",
                "Very helpful course director and many materials and office hours and resources",
                "Strengths: Well organized, interesting, informative\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None in particular",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, a lot of help is available. The material was overall very well presented\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like there was a lot of memorization of little detail required that made the course less engaging.",
                "I really think the lectures are set up nicely, and there are enough practice problems for each topic to help you understand concepts.",
                "My weakness was connecting topics in the class, my strength was learning individual topics.",
                "More sections",
                "Strengths: abundant resources for studying for the exams and just the course in general\r\n\r\nWeakness: lectures werent all that engaging. A lot of people just end up copying from the slides",
                "I think that it was taught well",
                "Strength was the amount of resources available. Weakness does not come to mind.",
                "The course was incredibly well-organized and the grading process was very efficient. There were many easily-available resources to learn, and they all helped a great deal.",
                "I think that p sets could be more clear about what they wanted students to write. For instance, at times I thought I got points taken off for things that were never asked of me.\r\nI also thought there was a large difficulty mismatch between the midterms and the final. The midterms were doable, but the final was overly hard.\r\nI think it's a bit unfair to ask students to memorize specific statistics (e.g. growth rates of different countries through time).",
                "Strengths are the the logical nature of the course content. Weaknesses are the lectures which are sometimes hard to follow",
                "strenghts--> interesting content\r\nweaknesses --> the midterm content was alright for me but the final felt like too much information and content so i can difficulty doing well",
                "A strength of this course was the amount of resources outside class provided (office hours, peer tutors, Ed, etc.). I disliked some of the exam questions' ability to manipulate the material even when the general knowledge was there.",
                "Great faculty",
                "The course was very well organized. Prof tsyvisnki is a great instructor.",
                "I think the professor was a clear strength. He was always engaging and had a great sense of humor. I think perhaps the pace was a bit too fast and it was hard to keep up. I also think having the lecture recordings in advance would be better.",
                "The main strength is the organization of the course. Prof. Tsyvinski is a wonderful lecturer. Every lecture has accompanying lecture notes which summarize what we learned. Psets are graded promptly and regrades are well processed. Leading up to exams there are many review sessions offered. The ones with Dr. Hawkins are especially helpful. If there is one weakness, however it is a personal opinion, is that class recordings are not uploaded. While I understand that this is so that students will show up to class, I still believe there is merit in the accessibility and flexibility that having class recordings uploaded offers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinsky and Professor Hawkins teach the course in a very interesting and easy to follow way. It remains engaging and interesting from beginning to end. If you enjoy economics, take this course.",
                "This course provides worksheets which are very helpful to learning but its problem sets are often not clearly relevant to the skills being taught.",
                "I have heard good reviews about introductory economics itself but I did not like the way that Prof. Tsvinsky and Prof. Hawkins taught the class.",
                "Strengths, depth of resources available is large especially before the exam. Weaknesses the lecture doesnt always capture as much detail as the textbook does, and sometimes I feel that they both dont when it comes to answering the trickier true false questions on psets.",
                "Strengths: Great resources for study and help, William & peer tutors are very knowledgeable and great.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could be taught a bit slower. And the final exam was extremely difficult!!",
                "Sometimes the lectures weren't as concise as I would have preferred. While they provided good review, I also found the discussion sections to be a little on the basic and dry side (especially compared to the material in the problem sets).",
                "I think the strengths of the course was that students were really well prepared for the exam and the professor was extremely interesting. A weakness I would say would be that class size was possibly too big.",
                "The class was well organized in general, and Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins were both incredibly charismatic, helpful, and kind. I felt that I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well taught, the material was fascinating and consistently connected to other aspects of life, politics, and the economic system, and improved my thinking abilities.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exam questions were less straightforward than they ought to have been and the sections each week weren't very helpful.",
                "The curve was difficult to manage because if i dropped even one point, my grade would be dropped a whole letter.",
                "no",
                "Strengths: Alot of support to students with oh, review sessions etc. Great teachers and also clear syllabus. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "lectures aren't very helpful, psets are pretty dry\r\n\r\nmaterial and professor are very interesting\r\n\r\npeer tutors were awesome",
                "The strength is definitely the unique insights that the Professor provides through lectures and the textbook as well as how organized the course is. I cant think of a weakness.",
                "strengths: CLARITY AND RESOURCES!!  the lecture summaries, plenty of practice tests, and worksheets. there are so many readily and clearly available resources to support students.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: no lecture recordings :(",
                "Sections are very good, worksheets as well. Lecture itself not that insightful.",
                "I wish the course offered the virtual lectures on canvas.",
                "Worksheets are very useful in understanding the practicality and problem solving of the information. Problem sets are well designed to prepare us for tests and many resources to work through problem sets. Lectures can contain a lot of information that feel overwhelming and messy at times.",
                "I believe the instructions were very clear, the sections were helpful, the worksheets reenforced the content, the problem sets were fair, and the tests were completely fair as well. I think this course could have done a better job at relating the lectures to the problem sets and tests.",
                "Strengths: I liked how the lecture slides were posted because sometimes the lecture went too fast for me to keep up with all my notes during class.\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the multiple choice questions on some of the exams were difficult just because I wasn't exactly sure how to study for that section since I wasn't sure which numbers I needed to know, but overall not many weaknesses!",
                "The strengths of this class include section, the ED platform, and various review materials.\r\nOne weakness of this class was that a lot of new material would be covered in just one lecture.",
                "Good amount of weekly work, excellent support through office hours for help. Interesting ideas included in lectures that are  good supplements to actual course.\r\n\r\nToo much content in lectures that is often impossible to take notes on. Slides contain overwhelming amounts of information oftentimes. Prof goes too fast sometimes.",
                "A strength would be the organization of this class. It was very well thought out and provided support to students in need of more practice or discussion on the material. However, I was a bit overwhelmed towards the end of the semester. It was a lot of material and sometimes I felt like I could not gain more insight than surface level information. Also, I would say the final exam was a bit unfair and tested the most difficult material of all of the semester, without going into depth on the newer material, which had not been tested on yet.",
                "Strengths: super super well organized. There's a ton of support to help you get through the class. Professor is passionate and tries to make lectures interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a massive lecture class so you will space out.",
                "I understand that they didnt release the lectures because they wanted people in class, but Im someone that works much better if I can be flexible and watch a class on 1.5x speed and take notes if necessary. Really liked Aleh and Hawkins.",
                "The strengths of this course include the consistent PSETS and the number of office hours that you can attend. The weakness has to be the size, it is sometimes hard to concentrate with so many people.",
                "I think that this course could be improved by having more clear instruction we need to know for exams.",
                "I think sometimes the content of the slides and the lesson summaries would not necessarily echo the extent of content covered in the class",
                "Strength: ed discussion is a really good resource since questions are anonymous and can be answered quickly.\r\nWeakness: Some of the concepts are really hard to understand, especially the subtleties of the solow model.",
                "I honestly dont really see any weaknesses. I wish the first two midterms were slightly harder I guess so the mean isnt so impossibly high.",
                "The strength of this course is that it taught one all they needed to know about introductory macroeconomics. The weakness of this course is that it often had a very high workload.",
                "Strengths: The class was very organized and the PSets covered the material well.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the content was covered a little fast.",
                "The strengths of the course are the slides and lecture which I thnk are very well put together. However, I think that the lecture goes over content a bit too fast, and it would be better if it were slowed down.",
                "I feel that lecture recordings should have been uploaded after the completion of the weekly problem set. I understand that they are attempting to maximize attendance. However I feel that there is no reason to not upload them after the problem set for the corresponding material is completed. I felt this seriously hindered my learning",
                "This course should allow lecture recordings to be publicly available",
                "Weaknesses lots of information to take in in large groups, strengths include good teacher.",
                "- strengths: diversity of material (worksheets + lecture summaries + psets) -- that was very helpful ; a lot of real-life examples, which helps to understand the material more in the context\r\n\r\n- weaknesses: nothing specific",
                "strength: most organized course I have ever been enrolled in, lecture is very engaging and students have a lot of resources. \r\nweakness: a lot of material is covered and it can be hard to differentiate between what is important and what isn't",
                "The assignments/psets were confusing and we didn't learn them in class.",
                "Aleh is a good lecturer and the peer tutors were really helpful (especially great). The course coordinator is very quick to answer questions as well",
                "Tsyvinski is an entertaining lecturer, so he can often make macroeconomics (sometimes a really boring subject) into something easier to listen to, so its not less difficult to grasp material. Its one of the courses biggest strengths. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion the biggest weakness about this class is that there is so much material and even with the 1 page summaries they do provide its not always obvious what is actually necessary to know just as people studying economics, and what is going to be tested.",
                "The course was extremely well structured and easy to follow. The number of resources available made me feel extremely supported throughout the entire thing.",
                "I think that there is a ton of help if needed but the weakness would be that it is hard to focus in the lectures at times.",
                "Very well organized.",
                "It covers a broad range of topics, but in order to do so, it goes very quickly. Most of the material ends up forgotten or not tested because there is just so much in each lecture. I feel like giving greater emphasis to the main points might be a way to improve.",
                "The course provides a lot of information and extra insight to those who can put the time into it. Professor Hawkinss commitment to aiding the course was very helpful. 116 gives the bases to understand much of what is said in media as well as provides the bases for further study in economics. It is however not always clear what is testable, and what are the takeaways that we should take from certain expositions (not because theyre useless but because they have a lot going on).",
                "This course had strengths in providing ample information on topics, but a weakness was organization of slides and applications of formulas to certain topics",
                "There is a lot of interesting material, and the lectures are pretty engaging, though maybe could have been organized better.",
                "Weaknesses- it went too fast and most learning happened outside the class\r\nStrengths- professor is nice",
                "Well organized. Wish the lecture recordings were available.",
                "The methodical way in which it is organised is a big strength. A weakness is that some lectures were challenging to follow at the time and I could only understand them after reviewing the material.",
                "Strengths the professor is engaging\r\nWeaknesses content review is unorganized and TAs are not always accurate",
                "Strengths of the course were that it was well-organized and there were many resources available to students for studying and reviewing the material outside of lectures. A weakness of the course was that lecture recordings were not made available to us until the very end of the semester for reading period.",
                "Grading requirements clearer",
                "Strengths: Office hours, peer tutoring, and general lectures were all accessible and all very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "There is absolutely no Instruction or teaching in lecture; I felt like I wasn't being tought",
                "This course did a great job of providing immense resources to study and review the material even after lecture (which were very well done in it of themselves). The calendar provided every time and place for office hours and discussion sections, and there were many options every week, so you would always make it to the sessions you needed to no matter how busy your schedule was. There was also lecture summaries alongside each slideshow that were great for reviewing before the final, which required us going through a lot of material. There were also review sessions before each exam, with the sessions before the final each focusing on each third of the semester. Additionally, the ED discussion board was a useful way to ask quick question and get clarification on the off chance I couldn't make an office hours.\r\nThe only thing that stood out to me that could be improved upon was discussing exam questions with TFs and possibly getting points back. I felt that for both exams, some questions had vague or misleading wording, which did not fully encapsulate what the question was asking. Looking back afterwards, a couple of questions seemed to expect too much given the instructions.",
                "Strengths: It is very organized with many office hours and a clear understanding of what you are expected to know. Homework is not too overwhelming with it really only being psets/worksheets.",
                "Strengths is the course organization. A clear weakness is the fact that the professor basically just reads the slides, which makes the class not engaging.",
                "I think the course is good in being split by two professors and having discussion sections and well split topics, but the timing of midterms was a bit odd to me (being frontloaded made studying for the final surprisingly more overwhelming).",
                "- weaknesses: Did not have access to online vidoes until end of course, psets were sometimes random\r\n- strengths: now I understand the news and understand how our central banking system wors",
                "The course is very well organized and there are many helpful resources that can assist in helping absorb the material like peer tutors and office hours. \r\nThe only weakness is that it is so much class content and the lectures I felt like could be a bit more engaging, but it was definitely manageable.",
                "I think that its difficult for the prof who teaches the glass is so different from the prof that writes the tests and sets the grades, bc the one who sets the grades dr.hawkins is so mathy and not very good at understanding or explaining why wed be struggling on a topic or explaining to us in a way that wasnt really mathy and didnt honestly leave me more confused than before. I think things for me on the midterm wouldve been better for me is if the ppl who teach the class also have the hw ajd the exams written in the same way/style they teach it, so like tyvinski i think he really enjoys the history parts of economics but hed go into such specifics itd be hard to know which were the important facts to remember and if you were just unlucky to remember on exam day you lose maybe a 2 point mc question which is a lot in exams out of 50 pts. I dont like also how they have multiple choice and true/false its just a laziness on the part of the professor prioritizing whats the easiest format for me regardless of whether this negatively impacts students performance. I know for my two midterms i got nearly perfect on the long/short answer question but on the true or falae section and definitleh the mc section i got points off that added to a lot that were bc of misreading the question bc im going fast but unlike long/short answers you cant get partial credit on a mc choice or true/false its either all points or no points and that isnt right. They didnt have practically any zoom tf/pt sessions/office hours which i think wouldve been better for some. You learn a shitttt ton of content and we got no calculators and no formula sheets even when there are so so many formulas and theories you absolutrly must inow exactly write or you could misanswer a potential exam qurstion, even though in almost all past years in this class calculators and formula sheets were offered or it being open book/open note. I just dont get it this policy doesnt reflect the real world at all where we arent isolated with only our knowledge; we have the internet our opinions calculators our notes when we need to make decisisions based on economic principles. Again i think this is just lazy exam and grading style by the prof because open note and calculator exams have to have questions that are more theoretical or are apllicance based and are not just replicas of a past exam problem where the student couldve aready found a past answer key you have to devote more time and it is harder to write these exams and grade them bc the graders really have to consider each point each student makes. The information and examples on the lectures would always feel so much simpler than what was put on the exams",
                "This course must be one of the most well-organized and structured courses at Yale. Students were able to ask question in an anonymous manner, and received clear and concise feedback on each PSET. Lectures were equally engaging and organized.",
                "I sometimes found the problem sets to be inaccessible without office hours help.",
                "Lecture pacing is often hard to keep up with, but the support which surrounds the course is phenomenal",
                "The strengths of this course are the resources beyond lecture to support students in learning. The Ed discussion forum, office hours, peer tutoring, section, one-page summaries, and additional practice exams all served as great ways to understand what is often glossed over in lecture. I also appreciated the use of the worksheets as a low-stakes way to apply the knowledge from lectures. However, the lectures contained too much content that was not fully explained, or explained too quickly. There were also not enough opportunities to work through examples directly on the slideshow or during lecture. I also wish students would have been able to ask more questions during lecture.",
                "Strengths: covers interesting material, sections are helpful\r\nWeaknesses: not engaging",
                "Automated Gradescope, lecture summaries, sections, review sessions are all excellent",
                "Professor Tsyvinski is awesome and keeps his students engaged",
                "Strengths: Dr. Hawkins was a fabulous course director and the course was very well organized. The TFs were also wonderful and great at explaining things. Professor Tsyvinski was funny and engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt a little long for the amount of content they covered",
                "I studied very well on my own but didn't enjoy lecture very much",
                "I thought that one of the strengths of this course is that although a lot of information is being thrown at you, it really forces you to learn a lot in a short period of time. I went from knowing practically nothing about the macroeconomy (except for perhaps some information I had learned about macro during introductory micro in the fall) to having a pretty solid fundamental understanding. I thought that one of the weaknesses of this course is that due to the fact that there is so much information, I had a hard time really learning much of it right away during lecture, which could at times make things rather confusing. However, I tended to be able to learn the material on my own when I went back to the lecture slides after class and with the help of discussion section and TA office hours.",
                "moves ver yfast and the lectures were kind of hard to follow, so it took a lot of outside time to understand the material",
                "the strengths was the clarity in the synthesis of class material, but I wished there were more detailed explanation on the slides to review/ more diagrams.",
                "Overall great material",
                "The course was well structured, especially with the cutoff on information used on each exam.",
                "The lectures were not very helpful and the course director was much better at teaching the material. I also thought the problem sets were very different from the exam questions. The lecture slides were also very long.",
                "Lectures could be a bit shorter or more narrowly focused.",
                "A weakness is that the professor just read the lecture slides which made lectures not important to attend. He also did not make the important things clear until after the lecture was over, so it was hard to follow."

At times, this course was frustrating because it felt more like career prep than intellectual learning. That being said, I think that understanding how the financial sector works is important, even if its not all that interesting for people who have no interest in the profession. If you dont want to go into finance, I would just consider that before taking the course.",
                "I mean I guess if you want to learn more about money and things like taxes and banks and stuff. Most people are just doing it for their major.",
                "Yes, but take it if macroeconomics interest you (unless you are an economics major)",
                "Yes, as long as Hawkins is the course director. He really makes the course run.",
                "Yes. I think that any student who is trying to get an introductory/ basic understanding of macroeconomics would benefit from taking this course. It is very easy to keep up with, and facilitates student learning well.",

                "Only if they are interested in majoring in Economics.",
                "This course is awesome even for non-majors. Gives you a good overview of the global economy and your place within it.",

                "Yes, it's not only a requirement, but it also covers plenty of genuinely interesting topics and ideas.",
                "If you're taking this class, you're probably an econ major.  If you are not an econ major, I would recommend this class because it gives you insight into some important concepts however don't feel like you're missing out if you do not take it.",
                "Definitely",

                "Definitely - a super solid course with real-world applications. It's not too difficult, but not a complete waste-of-time-gut either.",
                "If they are interested in macroeconomics, yes. But if not, then this course may not be very enjoyable since it requires a lot of memorization of macroeconomic facts.",
                "Yes I would - very engaging",
                "yes very good intro to macro",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great intro to how our national economy works and interacts with those around the world. It was also great in explaining issues with our current economy that our generation will encounter. Dr. Hawkins was also the most organized, engaged course director of all time!",
                "Yes the course is very well organized",
                "Yes! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn basic knowledge about how our system works.",
                "Would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants to understand how the works. Macroeconomics is a great way to understand why large-scale movements in the economy happen, and why those movements matter. Would recommend to anyone who's interested, even if you haven't taken micro before.",

                "Yes, if you want to get some world-class teaching from some very good professors who will teach you the basics of Macroeconomics. I appreciate Tsvinski's attempt to include some of his own research into the class material, so just know that the class is facilitated to help you succeed... for the most part.",

                "Yes",
                "No, I would not recommend this course and this is coming from someone who loves economics and is majoring in it. If you need to take it then of course do so; however, if you are considering taking it just to learn about econ do not. The admin who grade and create the exams are terrible. They are extremely unforgiving in terms of giving students credit and the questions were so poorly written at times it blew my mind. The professor is good but otherwise all the other aspects of the course infuriated me.",
                "I would. Good class",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It was very well organized and provided an important overview of introductory macroeconomic concepts.",
                "Yes, it is helpful to understand these concepts.",
                "Nah",
                "Yes Id recommend this to anyone; it may not be the coolest course, but it provides important foundational understanding of economics that is applicable to any field!",
                "Yes if they want to understand the financial system",
                "Yes! It's an intro class, and it's likely just a pre-req for most people taking it (me included), but I truly feel as if I understand so much more about the world now. I can read about economic concepts in the news (the fed, the money supply, bank failures, inflation, etc.) and understand what is happening and WHY it's happening. The workload of the course wasn't ridiculously high, so I 100% recommend it!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it was part of their major requirement. However, outside of that I probably would not recommend it. This is because it does not provide a QR credit and can be difficult to navigate. I also feel as though it is a very independent course; I along with many of my friends had to go through each slide again to completely learn and absorb the material.",
                "Would definitely!",
                "Yes! It gives good foundations in topics that are relevant for everyone, not just econ majors; especially because Prof Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins work hard to make the course international, integrate cutting edge research, and be super up to date with everything (bringing in topics like bitcoin, China, climate change, etc).",

                "Yes. You learn a lot.",
                "Yes to learn basic principles about the economy that are applicable to everyday life",
                "Yes, I would. I thought the course taught me a lot about how the world works, and found the lectures on monetary policy and trade particularly useful; I feel they gave me tools to better understand the world around me.",
                "I would recommend this course whether you want to major in econ or not. The professors are amazing and they are there to help in any way.",
                "Yes, it was a great way to get exposed to economics.",
                "Yes it helped me get an economic perspective on current events",

                "Yes, very good way to get into economics",
                "Yes, take it if you must or want to.",
                "Yes. I think that it provides amazing insight into how the world works. It gives you a really deep foundation in econ.",
                "Yes, it was a great foundation for anything else related to econ or finance",
                "yes, if you are interested in majoring in econ and/or econ in general. would not take if you are trying to get a requirement there are easier classes to fufill requirements.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would highly recommend any Yale student to take this course.",
                "Yes, as it is a standard introductory course. However, it may be a little dull but required. I think the information I learned is important and I don't regret taking it.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn more about how the world works according to classical theories of macroeconomics, then this class is for you.",
                "I would strongly recommend everyone take this course. If you want a crash course in economic literacy and dont want to get a bad grade, just cr/d it. Youll learn a ton about economics, and if thats something that interests you, then this course is for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wishes to become more financially literate.",
                "I wouldnt necessrily reccomend it, as a likely econ major I have no choice but to take this class. I much preferred econ 115 and have heard good the 116 is ususally not bad but I really did not enjoy this class.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! I think it sucks that you have to take micro to get it because I think the knowledge that we learned from there that shows up in macro can be learned without having to take a whole class. Its relevant to our daily lives and current issues. I really value the information I learned",
                "Yes, definitely. It's super important in gaining a introductory knowledge of macroecoonomics.",
                "It's a very versatile class especially if you're considering monetary/public policy so there's no question of its utility. That said, while not unreasonably hard, it can be tricky with the curve as your grade largely comes down to whether you've memorized more definitions than your peers. Also, I would go into it expecting the curve to be harder than micro since many of the less serious people drop econ after first semester. The lectures also had a tendency to drone on and be less efficient than they could be (although the lecture summaries were a nice touch).",
                "Yes I would take it again because it was very informational.",
                "I would, primarily because it is a requirement for the Economics major. The course can be at times stressful, but I think it is primarily because there is so much more material that I was expecting (a lot more than Introductory Microeconomics).",
                "Yes, you should absolutely take this course. It's essential for anyone who wants to be an informed, critically thinking citizen. If you're interested in pursuing additional economics courses or a career in finance, it's especially valuable.",
                "No it was difficult and not clear in its content.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others, but no for the professor. If Professor Hawkins was teaching the course I would highly recommend it",
                "Yes. If you are someone who has an interest in economics or even business I would recommend taking this course.",
                "yes, if they are interested in the economy on a broader scale",
                "Yes, absolutely, even if its not for major requirements.",
                "would recommend for the general economic knowledge!",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend it to students who need it for their major or for other requirements.",
                "Absolutely! The professors are very engaging and have very different styles of teaching to facilitate each students needs. Although it may feel overwhelming at times, if resources are used right and you keep yourself engaged with the material, its a great course!",
                "Yes. It is a great class, and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes if you need it for your major or want to take a social science credit that isn't super intense.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about global trade and applicable aspects of economics.",
                "Definitely! Having a solid understanding of the global economy, along with historical context and current issues is very important for anybody.",
                "I would recommend this to students who have to take it for the major or students very interested in the topic. I would not say it is a class to take for fun. It can be challenging at times.",
                "Yes. Take this class if you are interested in anything related to not just econ but also social sciences. Also good knowledge for managing your personal finances.",
                "Yes. I think all students should be required to take this or any other economics course, because it truly does change the way you look at the world. I bet that half the students at Yale couldnt tell you exactly what the banking system or Fed do, which is unfortunate because of how important of a role they play in our lives.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is really applicable to the nature of global economics and I think everyone should be aware how the economy works.",
                "Yes, if they want to know general knowledge of macroeconomics",
                "Yes, it has a lot of real life applications",
                "I would because I think the information is very useful to know in life and you get a very nice overview of the subject",
                "I would! I think its a nice introduction class to learning how economics is generally applicable to everything around us and hones us in onto macroeconomic issues that are beyond the U.S.",
                "I would. If you need a social science credit, it's a good choice. Learn a lot, not too much work.",
                "Yeah I learned a lot and I enjoyed the lectures",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it's a great stepping stone to start learning about economics.",
                "Yes, since it is a gateway to future econ classes. However, even if you are not looking to continue Econ I would recommend it because it gives you a good big picture understanding of how our economy runs and what policies are implemented by our government.",
                "Yes, I would. I think the contents of this course are extremely essential in the context of world affairs.",
                "Yes, its an important introduction to macroeconomics.",
                "Yes, good class to learn fundamentals of macroeconomics.",
                "Essential course for Economic majors, but also helpful to non-econ majors to understand macroeconomic policy and how it affects your life",
                "Yes you learn a lot of applicable skills in this class",
                "Yes, especially if you're in the major",
                "Yes if interested in Econ or EPE major! Definitely take it in the fall rather than the spring",
                "Yes, if they plan to major in economics or if it is  concentration related, I would recommend this course. Otherwise no, there are better ways to use their time here.",
                "I would recommend this course. The number of resources available makes your success really coordinate to the amount of work you put in, therefore, it can be very satisfying.",
                "Yes if they are interested in or majoring in economics it is a must.",
                "Yes. Great course for intro econ.",
                "I would if the student has never studied macroeconomics and wants to learn more about it. I had already self studied a little and found that the course did not really add to my understanding of macroeconomics.",
                "Yes, as it gives more insight into what media says about the economy and it can help break down some otherwise deceiving political statements. It would be important to note that the models seen in class are of course only models, and dont speak much about political economy.",
                "I would recommend this course for people interested in how markets work",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in economics, or just wants to get a better understanding of the way the economy works.",
                "Yes as I believe that this knowledge is applicable in daily life and gives you a better sense of how the world works",
                "Yes, I learned a lot.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes for anyone who wants a better understanding of how the economy, and more broadly the world, functions.",
                "No",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they enjoyed microeconomics and are also interested in a larger, global view of economics.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely - if you are looking to gain a fundamental sense of macroeconomics and are genuinely curious about how countries function in more ways than just economically, this is the class for you.",
                "Sadly I was required to take this course but sure",
                "Yes. Honestly, before taking the course, the only thing I knew about GDP was what it stood for. I had no real idea of what it measured, and how essential it was for the entire course of macroeconomics. Additionally, learning about financial crisis and how we attempt to prevent and respond to them was very applicable to real life, especially with the Silicon Valley Bank Bailout that happened during the semester. We even had a problem set devoted to this event, which I really enjoyed learning about. Overall, I have a much better understanding of how our economy works, and even if I don't pursue economics in the future, I'll always be able to understand what I read or watch in the news 10x better.",
                "If you have to take it for a requirement, then yes. For the average non-economics major out there, DO NOT TAKE THIS!!!!! You will have such a horrible time learning it because unless you love economics, this content is not enjoyable.",
                "Definitely.\r\nYou learn a lot that helps you be an informed citizen, and you understand trends regarding the economy. Professor Tsyvinski is a great lecturer and very engaging. He's obviously passionate about what he teaches.",
                "Yes, only if they are interested in the Major or need it as a prerequisite. The course by itself is not very engaging and I believe it is not well taught.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the topics covered span a broad range of topics and allow you to understand the theory behind issues such as unemployment, climate change, etc. that affect the world.",
                "Yes, I think that this class is a foundational course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I thought it was graded very fairly and the material is relatively easy to understand, it just takes a lot of time because of how much content there is. I also like how application-based it is rather than just memorization.",
                "Probably not its a hard class especially with these two teachers the way the classes are taught do not correspond with whats being asked for on exams. This year some people did amazing i can guess its bc of the multiple choice and true/false questions that im sure are just bread and butter for alot of the amazing standardized test scorers but are actually just damaging for thise with accessibility challenges with this format neurologically so that the exam score doesnt deel like a fair reflection of the work youve put in. They have no business being as harsh with their grading and the difficulty of the problem sets and exams.",
                "This class is a great introduction to Macroeconomics and I would definitely recommend to another student. The course was well-organized and many of the lectures incorporated information related to the present day. For instance, we learned about financial institutions such as banks during the time in the economy where banks collapsed. We were able to understand every day news, both in the U.S. and abroad. It is a great way to be exposed to the way the economy works in the U.S. and on a national stage.",
                "I would if they are interested in the global view of economics.",
                "Yes. It is a fun class which gives real life insights",
                "Yes. It provides good foundation.",
                "The class is excellently structured and deserves its plaudits. William Hawkins is the man.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Even if you are not Econ/EPE/Global, it's good information to know. Plus, it's fun to be in a big class and often entertaining.",
                "Yes. Good professor, exams can be tough but fair",
                "I would recommend this course to any student seeking to learn more about the economy, even if they are not an economics major. I think that the knowledge I gained in this course is going to prove useful to me no matter what professional field I pursue because at the end of the day knowing what the economy is and how it works is extremely important. I would advise students not to be overly concerned if they feel that they are not able to understand everything right away during lecture. A lot of material is covered during each lecture, and it is not designed for you to get it right away. While students should not be discouraged by this, they should make an effort to review lecture slides and their notes after class during that week as opposed to waiting until the midterms and final exam. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the amount of material if you do not pace your learning/studying.",
                "most ppl only take it if they have to",

                "Yes, very insightful lecuteres",
                "I would recommend this course as it is an important skill for people to grasp for the real world.",
                "make sure to go over the lecture slides and notes after each class. Talk to your classmates about the materials and probelm sets.",
                "Yes because I think the course gives a good general background of the US economy.",
                "If they are interested in Econ., then yes."
