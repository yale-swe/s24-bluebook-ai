                "I really liked that every student got the chance to work on an academic article they found interesting. We weren't stuck translating easy sentences from a grammar book, but got to read academic Hebrew right away. It did feel like a lot of work sometimes. Some of it I understood and other things I didn't. For instance, highlighting the same words in the Hebrew and English form of our abstracts for the final felt a little futile. The tests also seemed like they covered a lot of information. Perhaps weekly quizzes with less to study and memorize for would have been better.",

                "This course was very good at teaching us how to translate modern academic Hebrew and introducing us to important resources. Different methods of translation (word-by-word and skimming/scanning) were taught, and while I had issues adapting to the skimming and scanning, I feel like the class taught word-by-word translation very well. The workload was very high, and I think the amount of text we had to translate for each class was at times too much and difficult to keep up with."
