The questions could have been more geared towards understanding and engaging with the material to think deeper and more critically about it instead of just regurgitating readings and lecture notes.\r\nAlso, I don't think there was enough focus on Western imperialism",

                "Poorly written questions. Often confused on what TAs and Professor wanted.",
                "The strengths were the readings and the lectures, the in person segment could be a little bit weak at times.",
                "The strength of this course lied in the reading materials and Professor Queralt's lecturing style. His lectures had lots of links and other resources for students, which was helpful due to the asynchronous nature of the course. The articles were engaging and informative, though there was a heavy focus on the U.S. and China, and it would have been nice to explore more country's. The assignments were interesting, but more clearly defined expectations would have been helpful.",
                "Prof. Didac is a very clear lecturer and cares a great deal about his student's ability to learn",
                "The course's material was interesting. A strength is Professors Queralt's review of the relevant studies during the lectures. It made it accessible and also the syllabus is very well organized, which very helpful when answering the assignments. A weakness, the class moves really fast, not only the speaking pace but content-wise it might be hard to keep up with especially towards the middle of the course.",

Additionally, the weekly Q&A sessions were helpful in keeping me \"on track\" with the course.

Submitting assignments was easy, and Professor Queralt was avaliable to answer students' questions, whether during the Q&A sessions or over email. \r\n\r\nThe asynchronous format had its pros and cons. On one hand, it allowed for greater flexibility. On the other hand, it was easy to fall behind on lectures and\/or readings (though obviously this is my fault and not the instructors'). For this reason, I thought the Q&A sessions were very helpful.
