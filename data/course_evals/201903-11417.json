   "comments": [
    "The strength has to be Ustadh Aziz. You have to take Arabic with him! Only weakness is there are a lot of daily assignments and the website we had to do for homework was very unresponsive.",
    "The course was very strong in giving many vocabulary words that were useful in daily speech. However, it was difficult to learn everything at such a quick pace.",
    "This course is very demanding, being 5 days a week. It takes a lot of time, in and outside of class to keep up with the workload. It requires more time to study the language and practice speaking. I think its hard to do all that and balance other courses when there just isnt much support offered outside of class.",
    "this course could be improved by having supplemental material (e.g., worksheets, practice exercises similar to the ones on tests) to help learning and memorizing; the textbook and homework is not enough to feel comfortable with the material",
    "I would like to have more intense classes. I think that the workload was fine but we weren't efficient enough during class.",
    "The course is very fast paced and by the end of the semester all the students show a huge improvement in the language. However, the rigor was very uneven. The first month of the class demanded a lot of work and attention while the rest of the semester went more slowly.",
    "I thought the course was really interesting. The one thing I struggled with a lot was that many others had a strong base in the language in experience with the language in some way. I felt as if the course was taught more towards them, as we went very fast over the alphabet and other introductory stuff, and then slowed down. For me it was difficult to adapt because I was still struggling with how each letter sounded before going into sentences. However, I felt as if once I adapted to the language, I was at a higher level than what I would have originally been."

   "comments": [
    "I 100% recommend! Especially if you have some basic knowledge of the Arabic alphabet",
    "Yes. I think it is a very good introductory course for learning Arabic.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you wish to be challenged and learn a new language. This course does take a lot of time, so you need to focus and be willing to sacrifice that time to really benefit.",
    "I would recommend it if the Student has a goal linked to arabic (Professional or personal reasons).",
    "As it was the only course for beginning Arabic, I would recommend it if a student is committed to learning the language. The professor seemed better suited to teaching higher level Arabic classes rather than beginner level\/",
    "Yes, if they wanted to take a challenging course."
