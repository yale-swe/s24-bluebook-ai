   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses of this course are definitely the flipped classroom style which could be improved by changing it. Also the professor you get really does make a difference on how well you learn.\r\n\r\nStrengths of this course are fair grading.",
    "I think that there is a huge disparity between instructors, which means that each student can be learning different things while taking the same tests. I think that having some way to standardize the course material would make the course more fair.",
    "Video modules were not helpful and I learned the majority of the material I needed not in class, but in doing the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: class was short.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: everything",
    "The weakness of this course is that it is too focused on pure calculus without really discussing any applications. Considering most students take this class without the intention of continuing with calculus, I believe the course should have a much greater emphasis on how to use the math rather than just teaching it in the context of symbols only.",
    "One of the big strengths of this course were the tutoring options for students. Tutoring sessions were a great way for me to figure out what problems I had with my understanding. I think one of the main weaknesses of this course was a general lack of feedback on how I was doing in the course and what I could do to to improve. For example, it was a huge hassle to go back through past homework assignments and try and figure where I went wrong. The comments were often ambiguous and the correct way to do things was never shared."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class to another student that was required to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who need math as a requirement. It was not the most interesting class, but essential to many fields of study.",
    "Only if absolutely necessary for the major of the student. This course was not organized in a manner where lectures supplied any sort of insight, and the video modules meant to introduce the material were often inapplicable to material tested or on p-sets. All facets of the class were disjointed, and most of the learning was done on my own.",
    "Yes to get the requirement out of the way.",
    "No.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially with the instructor I had. There was little helpful feedback on my work. I often felt confused. However, the tutoring availability was helpful."
