   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot. Definitely changes how I view math. I entered not knowing anything about math proofs, and after having written many of them, (many!) I feel much more confident in my math skills.",
    "My proof writing abilities greatly increased, and I learned a lot about linear algebra, real analysis, and calculus.",
    "Problem solving skills, proof writing skills, critical thinking skills\r\nKnowledge of analysis and algebra",
    "I learned a lot of vector calculus, linear algebra, and a few other things. The first few weeks were about proof-writing, followed by limits of sequences and functions, open and closed sets, calculus theorems, derivatives, linear algebra, and all kinds of intersections of topics discussed.",
    "I learned how to think logically about math problems and truly understand why things work, but unfortunately this came at the cost of also learning how to manage not sleeping very much and spending twenty hours a week on a pset.",
    "I learned about various principles of vector calculus, topology, and analysis, as well as how to write proofs.",
    "How to write proofs, linear algebra, real analysis, some set theory, and an appreciation for mathematics.",
    "Improved my proof thinking\/writing skills, learned mathematics from the ground up: vectors, matrices, span\/bases, continuity, derivatives, limits, topology, sets.",
    "More than anything, I gained a deep understanding of how proofs based math works, as well as how to approach problems logically and work through them no matter the difficulty.  I certainly learned a lot of the specifics of calculus and linear algebra as well, but this is not a course that teaches mechanics or computations.  For example, students are not allowed to use integration at in this class, because it won't be defined rigorously until 231.  \r\n\r\nPat does a great job of not assuming any prior knowledge, especially of how to do proofs, so you learn from the very basics until you feel much more comfortable in your ability to do proofs.  I had never seen any proofs before this class (minus a few middle school geometry proofs), but Pat made sure myself and anyone else in this boat was able to keep up.  I feel so much more confident in my proof skills, which is a really exciting and fun (and important!) part of math that most people don't get a solid exposure to until college.",
    "Learned essentially the first half of a course in elementary analysis and the first half of a course in linear algebra.",
    "topology was cool",
    "I learned a lot of math - having only taken up to multivariable calculus before, most of the material was really new to me. I also learned how to write proofs and think logically. Finally, I learned how fun math can be, especially when working together.",
    "Introduction to higher math (proofs). Learned how to construct and think about proofs. Also learned vector calculus and linear algebra",
    "I learned how to really apply myself in a class, write proofs in a very straightforward and cohesive way, and build mathematical concepts from the ground up.",
    "Math",
    "I developed a lot of skills with regards to mathematical proofs, which is a completely new way of thinking for me, which I liked and found interesting as a new way of thinking.",
    "This course has changed the way I see math. This class has made me a more rigorous thinker as I was forced to approach math from a logical point of view and make a convincing argument through mathematical reasoning.",
    "improved proofwriting skills, exposure to math, etc. etc. \r\nMost valuably, pat taught us how to think mathematically and logically.",
    "You learn to write proofs, which is super important in separating a rote understanding of math and a fundamental understanding of math. In particular, this applied to calculus in 230, but you basically start from square one (e.g. what is a real number?).",
    "Proof writing skills",
    "I learned a lot during this course. I learned linear algebra, real analysis, and how to write proofs that are rigorous and clear. In each of the fields of math we learned, I learned many new concepts, ideas, and overall, I gained a much better foundation in math.",
    "I learned how to do math proofs. I feel like this is a valuable skill not only in math but in other subjects too as it helped with my logical thinking.",
    "I gained a proficiency in proof writing and learned various topics in analysis, linear algebra, and topology.",
    "This course offered me a lot of academic challenges. Not only was the material often difficult for me at first but also the work load of this class required me to develop not only skills related to the class such as proof writing but also developed general skills such as time management and cooperation.",
    "Proof-writing, proof-writing, proof-writing; learning math from the ground up as a wholly logic-based endeavor",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of vector calculus, linear algebra, topology, and real analysis.",
    "A very solid foundation of proof techniques and approaches. Understanding of fields, functions, continuity, vector spaces, differentiation, matrix and some topology. Being able to collaborate with peers on math problems, and having fun despite the rather heavy workload.",
    "I learned a lot of math, but more importantly, I learned a lot about how to think like a mathematician, and how to go about writing proofs. This class is basically just proof after proof after proof after proof; you get so much experience out of it, and as a result I can honestly say that I feel very confident about diving into more advanced mathematics courses in future semesters.",
    "I learned how to do proofs in real analysis and linear algebra."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved its emphasis on problem solving, and the psets were very interesting. The course is sometimes disorganized, however (lin alg one day then real analysis the next).",
    "Strengths: very fun and engaging, good community and interaction among students and between students and faculty. Great learning environment, FANTASTIC teacher who was very helpful and understanding. I cannot emphasize enough how good a teacher Professor Devlin (colloquially, Pat) is. It is very very saddening to me that he will not be teaching at Yale next semester, as he is the best math professor or math teacher I have ever had.\r\nWeakness: Nothing, other than a pretty high workload.",
    "Based on your proof-based math experience, this course can be a bit boring in the first few weeks. But If you have not done proofs before college, I think Math 230 gives a good crash course on proof-writing in the first few weeks. I think that any student can succeed in the class because the material is covered at a reasonable pace and there are no assigned readings apart from things from the lecture and the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: PAT! He's a great teacher, and people feel inclined to take the class because of him. Unfortunately he's leaving next year I believe, and the past teachers are considerably worse. But he was absolutely fantastic.",
    "This course covered very interesting material but the organization of the topics at times seemed haphazard.",
    "Pat is one of the biggest strengths of the course, he adds his unique flair to everything from lectures to psets to tests. The only 'weakness' is a significant workload, but that can be planned for and mitigated.",
    "The course is a good introduction to proofs; it could be improved by moving at a faster pace.",
    "Strengths: the content, psets, TAs, and professor, almost everything\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the structure\/timeline of when we learned what was confusing or didn't make total sense, also the midterms had unlimited time, which benefited students who were able to stay all night, and pset graders stopped grading on time after pset 6",
    "Strengths: I really learned a lot in this class, and it's the class where I've met a lot of people whom I consider friends. Pat is also just a really funny and down-to-earth guy--you should definitely try to get at least a couple meals with him!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is very, very fast-paced, and you have to put in a lot of late-night hours (I think it put in 25+ hours every week), to the point where I think I regret taking the class. The class environment can also be toxic at times, where some TA's seem to pick favorites and there's a race to see who can understand the problem\/concept first. The exams were also very difficult.",
    "I think the professor is a strength of the course - he cares a lot, is super smart, and does a lot to engage students. He is very helpful at office hours and makes you want to learn more. A weakness is the length of the psets, which kind of ruins your life and leaves you doing only psets till early mornings.",
    "The strengths include but are not limited to fostering a community among students, a collaborative learning environment, and guaranteed growth as a student of math. This class is extremely difficult and is certainly a time commitment.",
    "Strengths: p much everything\r\nWeaknesses:",
    "Weaknesses - if you're reading this, Pat isn't teaching the course any more. He made the course great.\r\nStrengths -  you will feel better equipped in any other STEM class",
    "My strengths were in linear algebra. I struggled with slightly with real analysis.",
    "Strengths are how much each person learns throughout the class since there's so much homework, the material is hard and thorough, and the teacher and assistants are amazing at explaining and helping each student. Weaknesses are how difficult the exams are, and that can lead to a little bit of discouragement for each student.",
    "I think the teaching strategy and the progression through problem sets was well done. I learned concepts by just doing the problem sets.",
    "There were no obvious weaknesses to me. The course was incredibly engaging and all tasks assigned were worthwhile.",
    "This course was challenging and I believe that I learned a lot from engaging with this material. Furthermore, there is a lot of support from the instructor and the other TFs in office hours. Also, the graders offer specific personalized feedback on psets which is very helpful for correcting mistakes on future psets. One aspect that I struggled with (particularly in the beginning of the course) is that the difficulty of in class exmaples was less than that of problems on psets. This was mostly remedied by visiting past pset results in class.",
    "Strengths- excellent teaching, good pace, in-depth psets\r\nWeaknesses- slow feedback on psets, psets don't always prepare you for exams",
    "One strength of this course is that it tries to build up our foundamental capability to understand math and the ways to look at it. The training is rigorous and very beneficial for students pursuing a math major, or simply want to challenge his\/herself in logical thinking. Pat and the TAs are VERY SUPPORTIVE IN OUR LEARNING (They are always there to answer our questions, and one of the TAs baked us brownie before one of our midterms <3 (ok this part is not really related to learning but you can see they are really supportive and nice)). Pat's lecture is usually very clear and we don't have to refer to textbook to keep up to the pace, and he uploads and organises the lecture, homework and exam material very neatly. Moreover, Pat and the TAs give very detailed feedback for EACH of the homework and exams. The course material itself is interconnecting, so we get to view mathematical objects from various perspectives (such as linear transformation vs matrix multiplication vs topology). The homework is definitely chanllenging and we did spend a lot of time on it, but it is very helpful for us to fully understand the underlying concept and train our mathematical thinking. Exams are fun and challenging as well, and Pat always encourage us to collaborate and upload study mateiral and practice questions before hand. There are many ways to earn extra credit, such as solving \"for fun\" questions at the end of each homework, posing good questions, answers and study material others on piazza and participating in math competitions. Pat does take note of each student's foudation and effort in this course, so I feel it's largely fair. \r\n\r\nCouldn't think of many weaknesses for now. Maybe at the start, the learning roadpath for this course can be drawn more clearly, as I did feel lost sometimes because I don't understand why we are covering certain topics. Moreover, the homework can be returned to us more timely.",
    "The course was strong in almost all regards. I loved the problem sets, I thought Pat and the TA's were amazing and incredibly helpful, and I love that I've been able to learn so much math in so short a time span. I also thought it was fantastic that Pat gave us two free extensions to use whenever we wanted, which really helped lift some of the stress from the process of doing the problem sets. Pat's teaching style is great: every class was enjoyable and memorable, and he never made the math more complicated than it needed to be. The class also had a warm community spirit to it. I felt like all of us were in this together, and I certainly didn't feel pressured to constantly outdo my neighbor. Perhaps the greatest weakness of the class in my eyes is that the lectures were at a much lower level than that of the problem sets. They provided the basic information that you needed in order to do the problems, but the problem sets still ultimately felt like a separate, much more difficult affair. Since the class is ultimately about proofs, I think that a better use for class-time would have been for Pat to guide us more in this area, instead of merely presenting theorems and outlining the proofs thereof step by step. If, for example, instead of merely being told the intermediate value theorem and shown the proof of it, we were told the intermediate value theorem and then shown how we ourselves might have been able to come up with a proof for it, I think I would have learned a lot more.",

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Take this course even if you aren't sure. If you are considering this class at all, take it. I was on the fence whether to take this class, but I am very happy I did.",
    "Definitely! If you are interested in math, take this course. You will get a good idea as to what it's like to be a math major.",
    "YES YES YES! It was an amazing course that definitely developed all facets of my mathematical knowledge and ability.\r\nThe only downside is the high workload",
    "Absolutely! I think that people even remotely interested in mathematics or sciences should at least shop the course. The material covered is nothing crazy but still very important in many disciplines. The support system is also useful and there's a real \"230 community\" which makes taking the course even more fun. Problem sets are challenging but extremely fun and rewarding. If you think that you can dedicate enough time, you should take this course because it is a great way to start (or continue for that matter) your college experience.",
    "This is the course to take to figure out if you wanna be a math major early on.",
    "Absolutely! The course creates a solid community among students that makes the hard work much more fun and rewarding.",
    "For students who are interested in proof-based math and either a) already have lots of experience with it or b) are willing to spend 10-20 hours a week finishing problem sets, this class is perfect. Not for everyone - shop the class and try at least the first problem set.",
    "Only if you are interested in majoring in Math\/related fields. Otherwise, think deeply on why you are dedicating so much time on one class outside your major. The class itself is fantastic but it is a huge commitment.",
    "Yes, this class is a LOT of work, but I absolutely think it is worth it.  I didn't need this course for a requirement or really anything else other than I wanted to see some cool math, and I'm so glad I took it. If you find the right study group the 15 hours a week (that's probably about the average time) becomes fun social time rather than an impossible slog.  That said, know your schedule, the class does require significant time and you'll want to be able to give it the time it deserves you get the most out of it as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is also a very good class to take if you are considering being a math major, as it will certainly help you decide whether rigorous and complicated math is your thing.  That said, you don't have to be an intended math major or even a STEM major to take this course (I'm not, and I'm so glad I did).  As long as you like working through interesting problems and don't mind the time commitment",
    "Yes. This is a great introduction to proof-based math, real analysis, and linear algebra.",
    "Id recommend that if students come to Yale knowing linear algebra and multivariable calculus that they should just skip this",
    "Yes!!! So much learning to be done.",
    "Absolutely. Though it is a lot of work, don't let that scare you off. If you are at all interested in math, this is an extremely interesting and thorough introduction.",
    "Okay, here's the thing. If you want to be a math major and think the concepts and proofs you're learning\/doing in the class will be worth it to your studies in the future, go for it. But if not, I'd say take Math 120 or 225 the first semester. I was one of those people who came in having taken multivariable calc. and linear algebra, liked math, and wanted an intellectual challenge, but after a couple of months of really late nights and just devoting so many hours to one subject, I really didn't think it was worth it anymore. I have so many friends who dropped in the middle of the semester and have so much more time to socialize, self-reflect, and just relax, and personally that's something I always yearned for while taking this class. Also, I will just say that your satisfaction with the course really depends on the professor. I know the professor before Pat was really, really tough with students (so a pretty miserable experience), Pat is pretty great (so not as bad of an experience as it could've been) but is leaving next year, so who knows who the next teacher will be. Just try it out the first couple of weeks, but know that if you're planning to major in the social sciences or something that's not like math or physics, in my opinion, taking this class isn't worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course. I am not at all a math major and was unsure whether to take math 230 or another lower level math class, and I am glad that I took 230. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you get really invested in the proofs and in all of the course.",
    "If the student has a very strong background and passion in math and is ready to commit to a time-intensive course, this may be a good fit.",
    "Only if you're gonna do math or a math related field\r\n\r\nEven if you've got extensive knowledge of collegeiate math or extensive olympiad knowledge, still take this course because of the quality of the professor",
    "Highly recommend for any student with an interest in math.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who has even the slightest appreciation for the elegance of mathematics.",
    "I would! I learned more in this class than I have any other class in my entire life. It also showed me how much I enjoy math and want to keep learning it.",
    "Yes but I would warn them about the borderline excessive workload. Otherwise I loved this course.",
    "Absolutely. Although it has a huge workload, the course is incredibly engaging. I would recommend that any student who thinks they might want to take it at least give it a try.",
    "If the student is interested in proof based math then I would recommend this course. It is engaging and challenging and has really interesting material. For me, it was a relatively large time commitment but it was definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, it's a good introduction to thinking about math in a new way. However, you should probably only take it if you're willing to dedicate a good chunk of your time to the homework and you aren't overly worried about your GPA",
    "Math 230 is an excellent course for prospective math majors.",
    "Yes, but two things are paramount in my eyes: firstly, the student should have a real passion for math, as opposed to a vague interest in it; otherwise, the workload will just be too much. (The workload is a lot for everyone who takes the class, not just those with the least interest in math, but the advantage that those with a strong interest in math have over those without is that they'll have an easier time staying motivated, which is vital when having to put in 15+ hours of work week after week.)  Secondly, the student should probably build their schedule around this class, as it is likely one of the most time-consuming classes at Yale. If these two conditions are met, then I would strongly recommend the course to anyone who loves learning about math!",
    "Absolutely. Very well taught with great material."
