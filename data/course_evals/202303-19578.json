                "Strengths of the course is Professor Kathy Zhang. Fantastic teacher and guided us through each lab. Weaknesses are the length of the lab, often dragged out too long and with too many instructions.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Zhang was a great professor who explained things in detail and was very hands on.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture aspect of the lab was often very long and we didn't get to the experiment sometimes.",
                "Strengths: Kathy Zhang teaching the course. Her pre and post-lab presentations were extremely helpful in understanding the lab. She was great at explaining everything and had very reasonable expectations. The grade appeared to be entirely based on the lab notebook and the respective lab reports. The expectations for the assignments were made clear and the grading was very reasonable. As long as you put in some effort into your lab notebook and reports, you'll be able to do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Keshishian would demonstrate the entire lab before you get to do it. I stopped reading the lab procedure\/handouts before lab for this reason. In some cases, the lab was very difficult to set up, and having the demonstration made sense, but on some other occasions, it felt very redundant. The demonstration would cut out about an hour of lab time potentially making your attempts more rushed. On the other hand, if your experiment didn't work or the setup was too complicated, then at least you could see what should have been done.",
                "I like how this course allows us to experiment with different animals. I do think that the structure of the lab time could be adjusted, so that there is less demo time and more time for us to actually experiment. I felt that we wasted a lot of time in the demo, when we could have been learning and experimenting ourselves.",
                "I think the strength is having Kathy Zhang as an instructor. She was so informative and helped us understand what to write in our lab reports and how to formulate hypotheses related to the concepts that we observed, if anything would deviate from what we would expect."

                "If you have a lot of drive to learn neurobiology techniques, you will. If you're looking for an easy way to fulfill the neuro lab requirement, I don't think this is the right course.",
                "Yes! one of my favorite science labs at Yale",
                "I would recommend this class. While the experiences didn't always go well and can sometimes be frustrating, working with live specimens made the class interesting. As long as you put a decent amount of effort into your lab reports, then you should be fine with the grade. Expect to stay the entire allotted time. The experiments can get quite long, especially taking into account Prof Keshishian's demonstration which takes at least an hour.",
                "I would! I think it's a great way to learn how to apply concepts experimentally to understand the sometimes confusing concepts that we would cover in class. Also you are able to connect with more neuroscience students which is sort of difficult in the major right now."
