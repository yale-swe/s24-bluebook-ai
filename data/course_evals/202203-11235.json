                "Advanced chemistry knowledge in quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metals, and solids",
                "As this was one of the courses I took in my first semester at college, chemistry 163 taught me to learn at a faster pace and take more efficient notes. It also helped me to become accustomed to seeking outside resources, like working together with classmates, going to peer tutoring, and asking questions because just listening to lectures and looking at the textbook aren't enough on their own.",

                "More in depth knowledge of organic chemistry and quantum mechanics",
                "This courses helped to better my understanding of chemistry. Through the problem sets, I also learned the type of critical thinking needed to approach problems.",
                "This introductory course takes a broad look at quantum mechanics (and how it relates to atomic/molecular bonding theory), organic chemistry, and transition metal chemistry.",
                "I learned to think critically about the inner workings of chemistry",
                "Not only did I gain basic knowledge of general chemistry on the fundamental level, but I also received an overview of the different, specific fields within chemistry. I feel like this course teaches chemistry at a far more fundamental level than other general chemistry courses, so it is more interesting.",
                "Greater foundational knowledge of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metal complexes, and solid-state chemistry",
                "General chemistry skills, critical thinking skills, quick comprehension and summarisation skills (from length of PSETs)",

Chem 163 went beyond surface level and the things we learned in the beginning of the year such as quantum and MO theory went back full circle to the transition metal unit.",
                "I learned quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solid state chemistry. These fundamentals will help me lay the groundwork for future chemistry application.",
                "I learned a lot. I loved our unit on quantum mechanics because it was so contradictory to what I've learned about physics and the way the world works according to Newtonian principles. I learned how atoms actually work within their own units as well as to make organic systems and inorganic matter. I have a much better understanding of why metals are the way they are. I truly enjoyed this course in how it challenged me conceptually and introduced me to such new and different topics.",
                "I learnt so much on this course, how to tackle real world problem, and being introduced to quantum mechanics",

                "The peer tutors were incredibly helpful in navigating the very complex topics covered in this class, 100% a major strength that you should make use of. A weakness in my opinion is the exams: Prof. Mayer is incredibly creative with the exams, it felt like no matter how well you studied you were bound to be met with something completely foreign to you that is loosely related to your material, and is thus somehow a candidate for a major question on the exam.",
                "The strengths of the class include the resources which include the peer tutors (USE THEM), TFs, and how accessible Professor Mayer is.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses include the lack of clear communication at the start of the class.",
                "The course would be improved by decreasing the amount of testing students had to do.",
                "Some of the material was taught only by peer tutors. There could have been a bit more organization for the lectures and lecture slides. But, overall, the course was extremely good.",
                "I feel a strength of this course is how it tests applications of the concepts learned in class, not just testing memorization or plugging in numbers. I feel a weakness of this course is in how some of the questions in problem sets or exams felt a little too hard, like even applying the concepts we learned was a bit of a stretch to answer the questions. I feel this could be improved by going over some more application of concepts in lectures, or by making the problems given to us easier/more plausible.",
                "I enjoyed the class, although it was very difficult. I would have appreciated more information about the content of the course content before enrolling. I also would have appreciated a bit more review of AP chem topics.",
                "Strengths: well organized, lots of support from TAs and Peer Tutors\r\n\r\nCons: fast-paced, especially organic chemistry unit",
                "Lectures moved very fast for me, and problem sets were difficult to complete well. However, I appreciated the amount of office hours held by everyone involved with the course. The many review sessions before exams were also incredibly helpful and offered a good overview of various topics.",
                "Strength: This course is heavily concept-basedthe questions on exams and problem sets force students to truly understand the material (no numerical problems). The peer tutors and TFs were also a huge helpas long as you go to office hours and/or peer tutorings, youll be able to get all the work done accurately and be prepared for exams.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures move quickly and can be difficult to understand/grasp key takeaways from, leaving students unsure of what they should know for exams.",
                "Extremely difficult and fast-paced but engaging\r\nI wish it could have been slown down and we were assigned more preparatory work as it was very tough to follow at times\r\nI wish that the problem sets were graded earlier on as I did not think it was fair that we were responsible for grading our own work by looking at the answer keys",
                "Strengths include the quality lecturing given by professor Mayer along with ample help/ resources made available by the TA's and especially the peer tutors. All of which had exceptional office hours. The Psets, though difficult, were designed well. Weaknesses include the mandatory discussion sections which were not the most helpful to me.",
                "Strengths: professor mayers teaching and lectures, the wide range of course content covered",
                "peer tutors were a strength, sometimes content didnt feel cohesively taught and could be confusing",
                "The strengths of the course lie in the content, the teaching fellows/assistants, and the peer tutors.",
                "This course was great at delving into the complexities of chemistry while still staying true to its introductory nature. I saw how different units flowed together.",
                "Strengths: the lectures are well-organized and all sections are well-connected. The problem sets, though a lot of work, help greatly in fortifying the understanding of course materials. Prof. Mayer, the TFs, and peer tutors are all very willing to help. \r\nWeaknesses: not much! The only issue might be the amount of work one needs to put in, and also sometimes the problem sets and exam questions cover concepts only briefly mentioned in class.",
                "Lectures tend to be jumpy and sometimes I felt like not enough material was covered / went on tangents.",
                "This course and its contents really engaged my critical thinking skills and frame of thinking with chemistry. At times, however, information seemed tangential and content tested was beyond the scope of what was taught. This could be improved by refining the content and information therewith.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the professor loves the material, students are in a safe environment to ask and analyze questions, the peer tutors are eager to help us, there are many resources at our disposal and it is made clear how topics intertwine with one another. The weaknesses of this course are that a good portion of the material on the slides isn't reached in class because we bounce around, there is no structure for the TF's so there were times when discussion sections covered nothing, the professor is very eager but because of that it is easy for him to go on tangents, and the final is the very last testing spot.",
                "the professor is really passionate and encourages learning beyond the syllabus which has made it really interesting and enjoyable. It could be clearer on what is on and off the syllabus for tests",
                "This class was well structured and very organized. Sometimes I wished the p-sets were a bit shorter.",
                "Strengths were the passion of the Professor and the very interesting material. Weaknesses were the unpredictability of some of the material on the tests."

                "Yes and no. The content of the class is beautiful, genuinely. However, the exams are put together in a way that devalues studying the actual course content. Major questions are formed on miniscule topics and are interwoven with concepts that are not related to our content: it does not feel like the tests are meant to gauge your understanding of the class material.",
                "Yes. Its a course that will challenge your initial perceptions of and most likely grow your love of chemistry.",
                "It depends on the student's interests. I would recommend it to them if they were very deeply interested in the field of chemistry. If they're just trying to fulfill requirements, I'd recommend the 161-165 series.",
                "Yes, I would. I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
                "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to other students, since it would generally be taken by first semester college students who have just begun adjusting to college life, and this class was quite difficult and time-consuming with both the psets and online achieve homework. Nevertheless, I still learned a lot, and for students interested in chemistry and intellectually stimulating classes this would certainly be great.",
                "yes, if youre looking for a challenge and have taken AP chem.",
                "If you are willing to put in the work, I recommend this course as a much more fulfilling alternative to gen chem.",
                "I would probably encourage other students with my background to take 161 because this class was very hard and didnt review much gen chem.",
                "Yes, as the professor is great and the material is interesting",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they really really love chemistry and are actually good at the subject. This class is much more difficult than Chem 161 and so much more stressful because you don't know your actual grade until the very end when the curve is constructed. There were many times where I wished I had not tried to challenge myself by taking this course, but I will say that overall I will definitely be better prepared for orgo and other more advanced chemistry classes.",
                "Absolutely. This course does a great job at providing a solid foundation for chemistry, and will help prepare for other chemistry courses.",
                "If your major requires a more in-depth understanding of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and/or transition metal chemistry, then yes. Students who take this course are certainly in a better position to do well in later courses that cover these topics in more detail.\r\n\r\nIf you just need to get a chemistry pre-req out of the way, then no. 163, unlike 161, has weekly PSets that require several hours of time to complete (the 161 PSets are short, online practice questions that 163 has its own equivalent of - in addition to its actual PSet).\r\n\r\nOne more thing: if you are planning on also taking lab, this course DOES NOT cover the material you need to know for labs (161 does). If youve taken AP chem, you should be fine.",
                "Yes, if you are willing to put in the work and are certain about pursuing a high-level STEM academic path at Yale. It is very tough but very engaging.",
                "I would only recommend it for those students actually interested in chemistry, not for those taking chemistry only as a prerequisite. The course is very interesting and goes into great depth on certain topics, but it is a challenging class. For a student willing to put in a little extra work, it is generally worth it.",
                "If you are interested in chemistry and want a better foundational understanding, I would definitely recommend. Was the highlight of my fall semester and helped me learn quite a lot after already haven taken AP Chemistry in high school.",
                "Yes - great intro to university level chemistry having done some advanced stuff at high school",
                "Yes, thought it was hard it was rewarding",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the sciences.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I came into this course somewhat disinterested because I was taking it solely because it was a premed requirement, and I left it with a feeling that I might major in chemistry! I love that we focused on conceptual understanding instead of blindly plugging numbers into formulas. Chemistry, which I was previously bored of, now seems like an exciting and nuanced field that I yearn to explore more in my future years at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to those with a strong background in chemistry (having completed courses like AP Chem) and up to the intellectual challenge. This is a very challenging class and the workload is undoubtedly on the heavier side, but as long as you pay attention in lectures, work hard to understand the questions on problem sets, and seek help when needed, you will be fine. Prof. Mayer, the TFs, and peer tutors are all very helpful.",
                "I would recommend the course under very specific circumstances. There is a gap between CHEM 161 and orgo for first years, but that gap is relatively small for CHEM 163 to fill. I would recommend for most people to enroll in either of the former classes, rather than the latter.",
                "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in chemistry and has the ability to challenge themselves because it was a very interesting course with great people. However, if a person is simply trying to fulfill their chemistry requirement, then I would tell them to take 161 because it is so intellectually challenging and can be incredibly stressful at times. The professor and TFs are eager to help but if you have a heavy workload due to other course then 161 is the better bet but if you're looking for a challenge that will expand the way you look at Chemistry take 163.",
                "Yes its great fun especially if you have studied chemistry in your last years of high-school.",
                "Yes, this course is good for learning about chemistry as a whole and acts as a good overview which can help prospective chem majors decide if they want to continue.",
