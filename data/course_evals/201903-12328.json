    "I learned a lot about British political history and its implications more broadly. I definitely developed my reading and writing skills as well.",
    "This course is an exceptional class on \"the long nineteenth century\" in Britain. Balancing high parliamentary politics, populist movements, stimuli from the reaches of the Empire, and high-level thematic progressions, Professor Semmel teaches one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "A relatively detailed overview of 19th century Britain. There is good context provided at the beginning as well as implications for the years following 1914.",
    "It gave me a good understanding of the gradual evolution of Britains democratic processes in the 19th century. It offers a very interesting case study in comparison to early American history, which I think would be intellectually rewarding for any student to experience."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the professor and the content are intriguing. I actively wanted to learn during lecture and paying attention was not difficult.\r\nWeaknesses: No structured discussion section that made preparing readings for class difficult.",
    "I think both a strength and weakness of this course this semester was the lack of a TF. Due to the lack of a TF, the course essentially operated like a seminar some days. There was still a lecture component, but then discussions of readings were conducted like a seminar. Plus, I though the access we had to professor Semmel was really lucky and helpful. We got direct feedback from him on midterms\/papers rather than from a TF. This is especially unique in the history department, so I felt very fortunate. However, I also felt with a TF and separate discussion sections we'd likely have gotten to discuss the readings more thoroughly. I felt discussions were often sacrificed in order to complete lectures.",
    "Professor Semmel is an exceptionally effective lecturer. I've never been in a class with a orator so compelling, organized, and thoughtful. He carefully plans out his lectures so you almost enter his stream of historical thought. He effectively uses blank slides, and includes caricatures, primary sources, songs, and novels into his curriculum.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the material. The papers are relatively easy, and he is certainly a fair grader. He also offers a TON of options for IDs\/Essays on the exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of the small class, the course was switched to two 75 minute lectures. Professor Semmel definitely did a good job in reorganizing class so last minute. With the two 75 minute lectures, we were supposed to devote class time to section-like discussion. Often times, however, lectures would run really late and we wouldnt have time to discuss the readings. Not a big deal, and I am sure this will get fixed if the class switches back to the 50-minute + section format."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are interested in British political history and willing to dive into primary source documents, you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "Absolutely. I really enjoyed this course. I looked forward to lecture every day and stayed engaged the entire time.",
    "Absolutely. This course is a gem of the Yale History department.",
    "This class explores a fascinating bit of history in a lot of detail. I learned a lot but Professor Semmel never made the details burdensome. Rather, the class was engaging, interesting, and at times quite moving. I would definitely recommend it. It was a great history course.",
    "I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. I dont think you have to be interested in British history to appreciate the course. Professor Semmel does not present the course in a chronological format. Rather, each lecture described a different cultural, societal, or political force. He jumps around a fair bit, but there is certainly a unifying thread to the course. Having taken Early National America with Professor Freeman, this class was particularly interesting when compared with the political development of the US. The papers and exams are relatively easy, and hes definitely a fair grader!"
