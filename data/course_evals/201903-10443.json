    "Astronomy observations",
    "The skills to operate the telescope and to analyze data.",
    "I gained more questions than I did answers. But that is not a negative comment. It was very interesting and I learned much about astronomical techniques than I ever thought I would. It was pretty cool.",
    "How to write a lab report",
    "The course was focused around six main labs with each one meant to teach a specific facet of observational astronomy. The main topics covered throughout the semester include celestial coordinates and how to point a telescope, simple telescope physics\/optics, how to observe using the computer-controlled 12 and 16-inch telescopes, how to determine when targets are optimally located for observation, and how to image and analyze nebulae, star clusters, variable stars, and stellar spectra. This is a great course if you are interested in learning how to do amateur astronomy but is not such a great course to learn about astronomy\/astrophysics (e.g. you'll learn how to point at, observe, and create a color image of a nebula but won't actually learn what a nebula is).",
    "Operation of telescopes and related equipment, basic photometry and data analysis in relation to astronomy",
    "This course allowed me to apply my knowledge of telescopes through hands on labs.",
    "I learned how to take pictures of stars and how to use MaxImDL.",
    "Many skills about observing astronomical objects",
    "Just a few basic concepts on observation of the stars and planets like right ascension and declination.",
    "The course gave an overview of observational astronomy, including how to operate telescopes and use image processing software like MaximDL to analyze images.",
    "I got to use a telescope",
    "Learned how to use high powered telescopes and analyze astronomical data using MaximDL",
    "Improved my ability to use astronomical tools.",
    "This course is a hands-on practice of observational astronomy. You got the chance to really control the 16-inch telescope inside the dome at Leitner Family Observatory up the Science Hill (it's a pretty good weekly workout too).  You got to spin the dome with the handle and listen to the motor rumbling at midnight. You got to know the nitty-gritty task of astronomers, such as imaging the stars, combining pictures, analyzing data, writing reports... (which are totally different from the romanticized icon of star chasers). This course might ruin your illusion about astronomy. But for me, it opened a door behind which there is a whole new world.",
    "In this course, I learned about basic principles in astronomical observations and how to operate the equipment housed in the observatory."

   "comments": [
    "Passionate professor. However, he assumes you have a background in astronomy when delivering the materials. Very difficult for new students to fully understand the class. \r\n\r\nCloudy nights - a lot of my evenings were blocked for observations but only to be clouded out. Wonder if there can be a better system.",
    "Strengths: group work is very helpful and I can learn from the very begnning\r\nweakness: a lot of time commitment",
    "The professor was very unhelpful with accommodating with lab times.",
    "This course was very interesting. The best way to improve it would be with better (more rapid) feedback. Additionally, the classes and lab reports were not lined up very well.",
    "Labs too long and graded harshly",
    "The strengths of the course are its accessibility, hands-on labs, and fair reports. I took this course as a senior MB&B premed with some physics and math experience but certainly knew nothing about astronomy or astrophysics. I found the course very accessible despite my lack of astro knowledge and did not find the lab reports particularly challenging (although if you have no background and skip the Monday lecture like most people, I could see why you might find the repots a little challenging). The observing labs were a lot of fun! I actually got to use the massive 16-inch telescope in the dome and got some very beautiful pictures of celestial objects this semester, which I am very happy about. I also found the actual work assignments for the course to not overwhelming. The weaknesses of the course are the highly-variable observing times, late-night walks to the observatory, workload for 0.5 credits, and the scope of the content covered. The biggest stressor of this course are ironically also the observing labs. Although a lot of fun, the variable nature of them made the course a little stressful. Basically, you sign up every week on a first-come, first-serve basis. However, the weather needs to be clear to observe and about 60% of the time it is cloudy on your observation day. So, you have to find another time or wait it out a week. This semester I had a lot of nighttime responsibilities (work, section, duty) and really struggled to fit in the observing labs. I understand it has to be dark to observe and don't really have a solution to the problem but would warn people who anticipate having things to do most evenings to consider taking the course in a different semester. Also, although each individual report is manageable, I do feel like the weekly 1.5 hour lecture + data analysis + report + pre-lab + time spent walking to the observatory for lecture and observing and data analysis resulted in quite a bit of work and time for only a 0.5 credit course. Finally, a suggestion I would make would be to restructure the content of the Monday lectures. I think they focused a little bit too much on random telescope facts and minute details for a lab that most people would not be observing for for at least 4 more weeks. I wish we would have learned a little bit more traditional astronomy\/astrophysics during the lecture. I think this would have reduced the amount of time I spent Googling things during report writing.",
    "This is an extremely interesting, fun, and unique class at Yale. How often does one get to use giant telescopes and look into the stars on a weekly basis. I do wish we got grade back sooner on labs and that the class was a little more organized and that I knew what to expect though.",
    "Lectures did not provide much more insight than labs; the administrative needs of the class were almost impossible to meet; scheduling was unpredictable and highly inconvenient. Specific expectations were not made clear, and the content seemed overly disparate.",
    "As an astro major, this course was a fun chance to get hands on practice with telescopes and basic data analysis. I think for non-astro majors, it would be difficult to follow along with all the vocab used, especially about data reduction as it's not all fully explained.",
    "There wasn't much guidance on how to do the astro labs.",
    "The class is really fun and interesting. Unfortunately it is heavily influenced by the weather which in my case led to a lot of headaches trying to reschedule labs and get things done in time.",
    "It would be improved if it was graded better, meaning no deduction for an assignment submitted at 12:00am instead of 11:59am.",
    "There were six labs throughout the course, and you signed up for an observing slot every week. If the sky was cloudy during your selected time, you would have to reschedule the next week. If you were able to observe for every labwithin the first two to three weeks or soyou were great. However, the weather in New Haven isn't the best, and I ended up being clouded out five or six consecutive weeks. There is no real safety net for this, and even though we repeatedly talked to Professor Faison about the problem, he didn't offer us a lot of support. We ended up using a remote telescope in Arizona to do the observations, but even this got clouded out. It was very frustrating and it felt like we were on our own.",
    "It was very disorganized and, frankly, way too much of a time commitment for a gut, half-credit stargazing class.",
    "Content was very interesting but I felt that expectations were not clearly communicated and grading was sometimes unfair for the amount of effort students put into lab reports",
    "Meeting so late at night so far from campus without any shuttle that goes to Leitner was difficult, and I think in the future a shuttle could be organized.",
    "Strength: I liked the lectures a lot; Dr. Faison was great at delivering fun facts with some serious stuff. I also enjoyed each lab as well as writing lab reports. \r\n\r\nWeakness: However, I would have liked more instruction and help when writing lab reports. The lecture and TA could have set up special time helping with lab reports. Also, feedbacks for lab reports were posted a bit too late. I got my feedback for the first lab report after submitting the forth, therefore I didn't have the chance to revise my writing according to the feedbacks. In addition, I wish I could get a bit more detailed feedback and comments on each one of them. \r\n\r\nBut overall, a very enjoyable and engaging course!",
    "The course was highly interesting when we were able to observe, and unfortunately with the weather this semester that was difficult. My only complaint is that it took weeks and weeks to ever get any sort of feedback in the class, which meant I had little guidance for writing my reports."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course was both thoroughly instructive and incredibly enjoyable. The labs were fantastic, and the lectures were engaging. Probably my favorite class this semester.",
    "Yes - if you are interested in learning how to use the telescope and basics of astronomical observations.",
    "Yes. This course is very different from the courses we take from Yale SOM. And I think this course may be the only chance for me to learn about astronomy. Also, I want to say sky is beautiful.",
    "no",
    "I highly recommend this course if, and only if, you are genuinely interested in it. This is not an easy class, but it is very rewarding. You will get out as much as you put in, so please put in a lot.",
    "NOOOO",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they knew what they were getting into before starting the course. This course is a great way to learn how to become an amateur astronomer and does not require any sort of background in astronomy\/astrophysics to do well (I took this as a MB&B premed and was more than fine). There are only 6 reports to write and each lab offers a unique opportunity to observe a celestial object, oftentimes of your choosing. I got some beautiful pictures of some really cool objects and also feel like I learned enough to go out and purchase my own telescope and observe from home if I ever really wanted to. Also, the grading system is fairly generous (if you can get a 90% or above, you get an A. It literally says in the syllabus that he expects everyone will get an A). However, there are a few things I would caution you about before getting into this course. First, this is a course in observational astronomy, not the science of astronomy. You will talk a lot about telescopes and how they are constructed and how their CCD cameras work; you will not spend any time talking about what a star is or what a nebula. I do wish I would have learned a little bit more about the science of astronomy in addition to the observational techniques. Also, the course is taught in LFOP (a little past CRB) and has Monday night lectures + the 6 observing labs which also occur at night. This poses two annoyances: first is walking up\/down the hill, especially as the weather begins to decline as the semester progresses. Second is the fact that the weather needs to be clear for you to observe. Because we live in New Haven, this means that 60% of the time, the day you are assigned for the lab will be canceled and you will be expected to fit the lab in during another night that week (or try again next week, which minimizes the time you have to write the report). I had a lot of nighttime commitments this semester (work, section, duty) and found it challenging to fit all of the labs in. So, if you also anticipate having a lot of nighttime commitments, I would recommend taking the course in another semester. Otherwise, if you want to observe some cool stuff using Yale's big telescopes and don't mind a nighttime walk to LFOP, I can definitely recommend the course to you.",
    "Yes it is a fun course to add to the schedule even if you are credit\/d-ing it",
    "Noit is simply not possible to predict how smoothly the class will go when one is at the mercy of the weather.",
    "I would recommend this to other astro majors as an alternative to an intro physics lab, or to students looking for a cool half-credit.",
    "no.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students just be wary that if the weather is bad throughout the semester it might be pretty stressful.",
    "Only if you are actually really curious about astronomy or really need an easy half credit. If you are just taking it for fun, even though it was fun at times, you can definitely find other classes that you would enjoy more.",
    "Not really. Like not at all",
    "I would recommend taking it credit\/d\/fail. The content is interesting but the lab reports were often difficult, time consuming, and hard to get great grades on",
    "Yes, this is a great class for any astro student.",
    "Yes I will. Take this course if you are interested in astronomy, stars, astrophotography or even...astrology. (this course does not open every semester or every academic year, so take it when you can!) This course is a hands-on practice of observational astronomy. You got the chance to really control the 16-inch telescope inside the dome at Leitner Family Observatory up the Science Hill (it's a pretty good weekly workout too).  You got to spin the dome with the handle and listen to the motor rumbling at midnight.

(which are totally different from the romanticized icon of star chasers). This course might ruin your illusion about astronomy. But for me, it opened a door behind which there is a whole new world.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting half credit to attach to any semester for a student.",
    "Absolutely, and I already have numerous times."
