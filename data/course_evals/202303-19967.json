                "Learned a lot about the philosophy of friendship and got a basic introduction to a lot of well-known philosophers. I also learned how to write various types of papers and how to write in a more clear and concise manner.",
                "I learned how to write different kinds of essays and read thinkers who I have not encountered previously.",
                "I was able to build my self-confidence in writing longer, research-based papers.",
                "I developed the ability to write a structured argumentative essay very well. My ability to write effective thesis statements and engaging topic sentences improved, and my overall writing style developed. Another aspect of this course was learning how to decipher complex pieces of writing from other authors to incorporate into my argument. Overall the skills learned in this intro writing course were very useful and applicable across a variety of subjects.",
                "I improved my ability to structure arguments and sentences.",
                "Definitely made me a better writer! My high school writing experience was very formulaic\/rubric-based (think: AP exam essays), but this class gave me a chance to really use my own voice as a writer."

            "comments": [
                "The course itself was really interesting and fostered a great sense of community.  I love how we got to examine friendship through multiple different lenses and forms of media. I think one improvement that could be made would be to give an lessons about grammar\/style before we start writing our pieces and not after we finish our first draft because sometimes I would write my first draft and realize that I had misunderstood the assignment.",
                "Strength was definitely the supportive envrionment the professor created. She facilitated discussions well and all of the assignments were clear. I also appreciated her willingness to meet with students individually and give feedback on our writing.\r\n\r\nWeakness was probably the discussions, the professor could have definitely pushed us to think more when discussing the readings.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the readings were very relevant and we had some great discussions. However, I think the organization of the latter half of the course could have been improved - sometimes it was unclear what readings we were supposed to do.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Perry's engaging classroom discussions on assigned readings, workshops on papers, and peer reviews. I felt like we really took our time to understand the structure and main points of each argument we read. Also, the theme of friendship in this class is generally just enjoyable. You will question many aspects of friendship, but even for STEM people, it is engaging.",
                "I think that a strength of this course was the collaborative peer editing processes that we did. I think that a slightly more robust selection of modern readers could improve the course.",
                "As far as strengths go, I loved the structure of the class! I think it was nice to have lower-stress readings + discussions as our more regular assignments with the four main papers due at intervals throughout the course. Plus, the class is structured where you get lots of feedback from both your peers and the professor! Super helpful, and really helped facilitate a feeling of community since its a seminar class. \r\n\r\nAs a weakness, I think sometimes the readings were not completely related to our essay-writing, but perhaps thats to be expected + every reading still helped broaden my perspectives on friendship in a way that helped me form my own ideas when it came time for me to write my papers."

This is one of my favorite courses and even though this wasn't a philosophy class, I learned a lot about the subject so I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting a basic introduction to philosophy. Also the topic itself makes for really great discussions and I walked away learning more about my own relationships.",
                "I would, I think it is a great writing seminar!",

                "Absolutely! I adored this course; it helped make me a better writer, but also in general helped expand my perspectives on friendship in my own life. (Also. Megan Perry is so sweet and so brilliant. Such a great class.)"
