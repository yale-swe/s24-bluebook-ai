   "comments": [
    "A better appreciation for the relationship between means and ends and long-term strategic thinking. I also got to try my hand at more applied, practical hand-on thinking.",
    "I  learned how to condense and pitch ideas that have an impact on today's world, discuss and refine policy suggestions to practitioners, and negotiate with classmates in simulated crisis settings. I also continued to develop my network and conversation skills outside of the classroom.",
    "I learned a lot on what goes into making large scale decisions which impact the global community.",
    "I learned a lot about the fields that the three guest practitioners work in. I particularly appreciated the first two units, which I found to be substantive examinations of specific topics in foreign policy and international security. I'm certainly not an expert on those topics now, but I would feel more comfortable reading about them and pursuing further study around them.",
    "Apply! And if you get in, take it good-spiritedly. No the course is not perfect and sometimes lacks in depth of subjects addressed, academic's rigor, and the moral complicated questions of studying \"grand strategy.\" However, the guests, interactions with professors and practitioners, and fellow students make up for any deficiencies ten-fold. Also, though, you wouldn't be shopping this class unless you took part I, so with that in mind, stick with it! Many people (not all) enjoyed the second half more than the first."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the resources, caliber of instructors, caliber of students, forced-preparedness through reading responses, and quality of class materials. The weakness is the sometimes-disjointed combination of topics and instructors.",
    "Strengths are getting to learn from Jake Sullivan and Victoria Nuland about American foreign policy and strategy. Also the summer research funding and dinners with prominent guests. Weaknesses are the sections on activism.",
    "I thought the presentations and briefings were really well done and well managed. I  do wish we could have presented on our summer research to a group. I  also thought we should have discussed climate change more.",
    "I think the people they invite and take into the program are the ultimate strength of this class. I learned the most from them. Would have appreciated some more organization to what we were going to do, especially in the past few weeks.",
    "One of the strengths is the research project. It gave me the flexibility to write on any subject I am interested in. Another strength was the style of teaching. Working with practitioners was the highlight of this course. Also, the dinners were unforgettable experiences.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I felt as though a lot of this class was busy work. We read entire books but did not discuss them in class. Also, I think we should have paced ourselves during the class time itself. I felt as though we spent too much time laying the groundwork of facts before we delved into discussion of the topic at hand.",
    "I really enjoyed writing my summer research paper in September, and I would recommend facilitating more opportunities in the future for GS students to discuss their summer research projects with one another once complete. Another strength of this part of the class was that Professor Gage and Professor Brenes made themselves very available to talk about our paper progress and offered valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nAlthough I know the practitioners liked leading the class sessions as discussions, I did think it was helpful when they began each class with a short lecture or overview on the topic (like when Jake Sullivan discussed the technicalities of nuclear power and intl negotiations). Those could be encouraged and incorporated more in the future.\r\n\r\nThe briefing preparation process was fun and I learned a lot about the topic on which I presented, but I found the disparity in team member efforts to be frustrating at times. In our group of four, some team members put in significantly less work than others and skipped all or parts of team meetings. While it should ultimately be the briefing teams' responsibility to discuss and correct these issues, I think it might be helpful for the instructors to make a greater point from the beginning about sharing the workload of the project."

   "comments": [
    "I do recommend this course to other students. I think it's valuable at Yale to take a course the encourage applied, practical thinking. There are few courses here that encourage students to take abstract, humanistic knowledge and apply it to real-life problems. The year-long experience with a small group of students is also unique and special.",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to engage with the big questions of American foreign policy. Discussing the Iran deal with Jake Sullivan or the Ukraine crisis with Victoria Nuland is an absolute treat. The policy briefings are a good way of practicing real world briefings, and the fancy dinners with guests are really cool. Skip this class if you're not interested in American foreign policy.",
    "Yes, GS is an amazing opportunity for any student to take advantage of and I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would.",
    "Yes, if you have the opportunity, you should take Grand Strategy. It's an engaging and ever-changing program that defies expectations and offers opportunities that you won't get anywhere else on campus, especially as an undergrad.",
    "I would recommend GS to another student. At times, the class was very demanding of time -- between heavy reading loads and evening events. I really appreciated the year-long course for several reasons. The theory portion last spring exposed me to a lot of foundational texts that I missed by not doing DS, and the fall portion allowed me to meet three practitioners that were eye-opening to hear from. The events were also consistent highlights (like meeting James Comey and Samantha Power). If students have the time to devote to building strong relationships with their classmates, doing all the readings, and attending the evening events, they should consider this course. It won't give you all the answers to strategy and leadership, but it'll provide you with a challenging, supportive space to think about these topics.",
    "Definitely."
