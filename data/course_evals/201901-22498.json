   "comments": [
    "The course material would be useful and truly fascinating if it were well-taught. Unfortunately, Professor Wenjun Hu is not a clear instructor. She is difficult to understand, and the presentation of materials does not facilitate learning. As a result, homework assignments feel random and unrelated, necessitating 100% of the background research on assignments to be completed on the student's own time after receiving the homework assignment.",
    "One strength was the content; Wenjun did an excellent job curating this class to provide ample breadth and depth in course content!  The major weakness was about halfway through the semester we were informed there'd be 2 more labs, although they did end up being fun.  I also think the project was a fun way to get more depth in a topic of our choice.",
    "This class is a good intro to a broad field. The broadness of this field is unfortunately the limitation of this class. It is a very large field that requires very specific knowledge to understand the little details. Because of this, the information was very high-level.",
    "I think the first few weeks were very overview and highlevel and the back half of the semester very specific."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely -- Yale EE needs more of this type of course: it provides insight into emerging technologies of the future, which better prepares EE grads for the future.  Wenjun is a really great person, and each lecture was on an insightful topic.  Some of the labs were a little dry, but some (like creating a door security sensor) were super interesting and applicable.  The project was also a fun alternative to the typical exam-heavy EE courses.",
    "Yes if you are invested in wireless communications and its applications in WiFi, IoT, and emerging technologies.",
    "Yes if you want to learn about IOT."
