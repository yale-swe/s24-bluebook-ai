                "I really liked the discussion sections and some of the readings. I feel like a lot of the homework felt somewhat meaningless - the coding parts were easy for the sake of the polisci students and the short answer questions were easy for the sake of the CS students - but I still got something out of them.",
                "Strengths are the relevance of the topics and the professors; weaknesses are that nobody attends lecture so sections are a waste of time.",
                "I loved the almost seminar-style lectures and was very engaged with the content. Homework assignments felt disconnected from the course at times (trying to learn an ML package on our own was not as exciting) but were all doable.",
                "The weakness of this course is that the course lends itself to interpretation and personal opinions (although there are certain facts and policies we must know); however, although it lends itself in that manner, the way the course was designed did not allow for many room for error. Thus, any mistakes on an exam or homework was very costly which I did not like and I can assume most of my peers also did not enjoy. It deterred us from enjoying discussion.",
                "Discussion was much more preferable to lecture content, which we had comparatively less of",
                "I thought it was bizarre that the problem sets had almost nothing at all to do with the lecture material, with a few exceptions. Several of the assignments were arbitrary programming exercises with very tangential relationships to the issues being discussed in class. I wasn't too bothered by this as I do a lot of programming anyway as a CS major, but I could imagine a less technically inclined individual interested in the political side of the class being befuddled by having to process spreadsheets with Python scripts or train a decision tree classifier for practically no reason.",
                "strengths of the course are that it was a manageable workload and the teaching was excellent.",
                "Strengths: Feigenbaum is a pretty good lecturer. They both also make a strong effort to include discussions in the lecture\r\nWeaknesses: Hardly anyone showed up to lecture which was unfortunate. There was very little coding involved in the class as well. Mostly just material on the law and politics of it.",
                "Strengths: topics were interesting (by their own merit, not necessarily through the professors'), last two psets weren't too time-consuming and also quite fun, professors were fun to talk to individually, tests are pretty straightforward\r\nWeaknesses: very little buy-in because class didn't feel personally applicable, first two psets had little to do with what we learned in class and were very time-consuming",
                "The greatest weakness of the class was the fact that students were generally totally disengaged. Many did not show up to lecture or participate in section. I wish there was a mechanism to select for more interested students (maybe this should be a seminar?)",
                "It's an interesting topic and minimal coding if you are looking for that in a cs elective. I think it would be interesting to have more hands on work on something related to content moderation"
