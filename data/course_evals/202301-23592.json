                "Theories of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy of science and medicine, the doctor-patient relationship, humanistic view of medicine, biases in medicine, narrative style writing.",
                "I understood a great deal more about the relevance of humanities to medicine and the role of uncertainty.",
                "understanding the cross section between medicine and the humanities (photography, music, paintings, nature..etc), and how to embrace uncertainty in the field",
                "This class showed me how medicine goes beyond the levels of certainty and allowed me to understand the value of the uncertain.",
                "The two primary skills that I developed in this course were discussion skills and critical thinking/analysis skills. The seminar format of the course helped me to strengthen my listening/responding skills in discussion, and the range of content of the course allowed me to practice applying my learning in one subject to another.",
                "I developed an ability to connect the humanities and an understanding of philosophy to pressing questions in medicine and the treatment of people. We gained valuable insights in how to utilize various perspectives to our advantage for the advancement of the medical field and supporting people in their health, through a process of reading and communication that strengthens our ability to read and communicate in a peer setting.",
                "There is a need for an understanding of the humanities if you are to be a good doctor. This course really elucidated the intersection between these seemingly disparate fields. And most of all, I learned to recognize that doctors are human too. And that its not just about organic chemistry and science but also about empathy, understanding, and love.",
                "I began freshman year questioning whether or not I would be pre-med, but Dr. Morrison was the defining answer to my question. As a doctor himself, Dr. Morrison shared his immense passion and dedication with me, giving me so much hope and excitement about my future medical career. Through his class I was exposed to a much deeper behind-the-scenes look at medicine, including topics such as the ambiguity of patient diagnosis and what defines a good death. I cannot recommend this class enough to anyone who is considering pursuing a medical career."

                "It was really good but sometimes the lectures got a little long. The field trips were very nice though.",
                "This course was extremely strong in exposing me to literature and various perspectives on medicine by philosophers and doctors alike.",
                "Although the lectures were often my favorite part, I thought there could have still been more time for discussion in the class formatting. The field trips were all very impactful to me and will always stand out to me as unique opportunities for the rest of my time here.",
                "The course allows you to experience interesting seminars in which we do various things, but it is still a lecture format where we hear about philosophical thought and it is sometimes easy to space out. However, engagement in the seminar setting is increased by kind class environment, and Professor Morrison's exciting, supportive and communicative nature. It does introduce you to very interesting modes of thought.",
                "I loved the seminar format with Morrison. I felt like we were able to read so many great works and discuss our own reactions to them. At times, it did feel like the class was talking to Professor Morrison instead of to each other. Perhaps discussion between students could be further facilitated.",

There are a lot of readings as part of this course, and while they are very interesting that is something to keep in mind. Dr. Morrison is a great lecturer who is incredibly passionate about the class, but the class definitely was more of a leminar than a true seminar with all discussion. Also, the grading is a bit fuzzy; I didn't really know my grade until the end of the semester and there are only a few major assignments with no rubrics.",

                "Yes, I would. This class definitely peaks intellectual curiosity for people in pre-med, or even those who simply want to understand philosophy in the humanities as it applies to some other real-world field where its connection is not often understood but, as we have learned, is deeply necessary.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. If you are prospective premed, this course will give you the time and space to evaluate your decision to become a doctor. It will force you to ask yourself why and will present you with many reason that other doctors have for pursuing medicine.",
