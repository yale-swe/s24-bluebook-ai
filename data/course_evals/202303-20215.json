Gained insight into thinking critically about engaging with sound / music more conceptually as \"art objects\" in relation to their physical / visual packaging as well as the audio.",
                "Coming into this class, I had absolutely 0 knowledge about Ableton/mixing music and sound, the technicalities and science that went into sound, early sound history, and the myriad of ways you could manipulate digital and analog sound media. After this class, not only did a gain a wealth of knowledge on each of those subjects, I have been inspired to take a completely new route in my personal art practice, even going so far as to use a project I made for the class into an overlapping mid-year thesis project.",
                "This course can best be described as the weird lo-fi music course where you learn a lot about old music technologies and the groups/art that surround them. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experiment with these old technologies and be creative in new ways! (I created my own vinyl records and cassette tapes!) Ross is amazing and always willing to help out too.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Engaging material, clear format (weekly artist discussions, then more substantial projects), cool opportunities (making your own vinyl!), pushes you out of your comfort zone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of how vast the scope of each project is, I wish there were more support to access materials or methods outside of the class. For example, it would be great to have direction on how to access printing without needing to coordinate with the art majors in the class - I later learned there were open hours, but would never have known if I hadn't had a friend in a photography class. Also, it would be nice to have perhaps a shared materials archive of sorts of potentially common needs (photo paper? card stock?) for the more physical visual elements, if the class budget allows.",
                "Overall, the strongest part of the course was the division of time between history lessons/accompanying artist discussions and project brainstorm/project critique. By focusing both on history and product, we were able to use much of what we learned/the topics that arose in our discussions to lead our projects, often allowing us to try something new. The only weakness, I would say, is the subtle ways in which not having a music background/engineering background can stifle your creativity when it comes to your projects. I felt as though having neither of these backgrounds significantly limited my ability to actually produce and act-on the ideas I had, mainly when it came to the final two projects. This wasn't a deterrent for me, but it was just more difficult trying to learn Ableton/Logic while also having to use it for class. I was still able to create some amazing things, but I often felt frustrated with myself since my classmates' ideas/projects were much more expansive and technically advanced than mine.",
                "Honestly, this class took a bit more effort than I was initially expecting, but it was well worth it and I got out just as much as I put in. The projects will take a lot of time to figure out and get the way you want them, but the end results are very satisfying and worth it."

                "Yes, this course was very unique in terms of the types of projects we were allowed to create, everyone got to make some interesting stuff.",
                "Yes, provided they understand that the course is about the MEDIA of sound. It will get hands on, ask them to think outside of the box, and will not just be a basic intro music production course. The record projects are also substantial, but incredibly fulfilling and worthwhile.",
                "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in music, sound, sound/music production, the engineering/science behind sound, or anything of that sort, you absolutely MUST take this course. Ross is an absolute genius and an amazing professor, and his class has fundamentally shifted my personal practice/approach to art as a fine art major. However, there's two things I must stress to those interested: 1) this class will be a lot of work, but it is fun, rewarding work that is dependent upon your individual interest level/what you are hoping to get out of the class, and 2) if you do not have a background in engineering or music, and if you don't know Logic X/Ableton, you will definitely feel \"behind\" at times, even though you are not. This is an introductory course, however, I must warn you that the latter will often make you feel as though your creative options are stifled for projects, or that you're not doing things that are as \"cool\" as your classmates, since this external knowledge often leads to more technically advanced projects. However, even as an art major with no knowledge of either DAWs/engineering/music, I was able to create some amazing stuff, learn a ton about music production and different types of sound media, how to make music with DAWs, the history of sound, and even the amazing ways you can transfer analog audio to digital and vice-versa. It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken at Yale, and I am thankful for every second I got to spend in this class!",
                "YES!!!! You get to cut your own vinyl records, mess with tape, and make cool sounds and art. It's even better if you aren't exclusively an arts student either, and there was always a way to bring your prospective to the topics in discussion.",
                "I would completely recommend trying the class, but its important to understand that the class is not necessarily a music class but an art class. Ross wants you to push your boundaries and the ideation / making art with the medium itself is often more important than the sound itself."
