                "Course should be offered as a full credit, and I wish there was more access to individual time.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, great TA, excellent examples and assignments. The only weakness was not getting feedback on any of the recorded assignments.",
                "While fundamental music theory knowledge is required, the course reviews a majority of the topics before assuming that everyone is familiar with the more advanced terms. I was able to get very personalized feedback and recommendations for improving my skills on the keyboard, which is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this class so much.",
                "This course is fantastic. I thought the curriculum met people from several different musical backgrounds where they were at very well, and the choices of classical and jazz/pop were good. I think there could have been a few more options for advanced study / next steps, such as jazz harmonization or playing in different genres (and also giving more intermediate players a taste of the possibilities)."

Otherwise the class had a good set up, where lectures were live and you could practice concepts (muted) on your own as they're introduced. Meetings with the professor or TA and another student were also very helpful for asking questions and seeing if your playing is right before an assignment is due.",

If you are not interested in one of these topics, or if you already have a lot of experience with either, you will most likely be bored since a lot of time is spent covering both. The course mostly stays at the beginner/introductory level and we didn't explore many advanced topics.",
