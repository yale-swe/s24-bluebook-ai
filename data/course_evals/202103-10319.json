I'd say that the most important skill that I learned from this class is how to write papers for college since they are rather different from the ones you write in high school. In addition to improving my writing, a valuable skill I also learned was just generally how to go about writing papers in college. I learned how to effectively work through supporting materials and how to layout my papers structurally.",
                "Exposed me to a lot of scholarly conversations surrounding the topic of the University. In doing so, improved my ability to synthesize information from texts and to participate in a seminar setting. Learned to look critically at the university, infrastructure, and decisions being made around me to better understand the values behind them.",
                "This course did a fantastic job at developing my writing skills. Instructor and peer feedback (of which there was plenty) played an instrumental role in this. Most class sessions were dedicated towards analyzing the selected texts, so through this I feel like knowing what to look for in writing was definitely a skill that was strengthened. A student taking this class will also gain a lot of insight into the topic of the classes which for me turned out to be very rewarding.",

                "The strength of this course is that you're able to work on your writing skills in a low-stakes environment. You get sufficient feedback and help from your instructors throughout the writing process and whenever you need it.\r\nI am very happy with the way the class was set up, so no major drawbacks for me. However, at times I did feel like there was too much reading. For certain texts, I wish we'd have had more time to discuss them in class. At times, it felt like we were rushing through the readings and I did not really have enough time to think through what I'd read before we'd move on to a new text.",
                "Great instructor with often interesting content. Becomes much more interesting in the latter stages of the class when we begin to guide the material we focus on ourselves. If this were an option earlier on that would be great.",
                "The strengths are the class discussions, peer reviews, and instructor reviews/help. There arent many weaknesses that I would point out. The course was taught very well.",
                "This course was great at engaging students in the humanities. It could be improved by incorporating less scientific readings.",
                "I didn't feel like there were any weaknesses, but I felt one major strength was how much we read in class.",
                "less reading and more archival work",
                "Strengths: feedback on papers was always in-depth and very helpful, as were one-on-one meetings. I also thought the readings were quite interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: I enjoyed hearing what classmates were writing their papers about and doing peer reviews, so more opportunity to share writing with other students would be helpful.",

I really do feel like this course provided me with a very solid foundation for all my future writing assignments in college. So I'm very pleased that I decided to take this course during my first semester. I can't imagine how I'd have managed in my future humanities and social science courses without the knowledge about writing that I received from this course.",

In addition to being a good introduction to college-level writing, I think it was helpful to take a class about college at the beginning of my college experience, as it got me reflecting on Yale, my relationship to it, and higher education more broadly in interesting ways.",
