If you felt like intro Econ glossed over too many things, this class is for you.\r\n\r\nThe best part - though the material is rigorous, you end up getting many results that feel intuitive.

Its a pretty great feeling to look back and realize Ive built an understanding of many important models, including dynamic equilibrium, consumption smoothing, and the Neo-Keynesian model.",

                "Really compelling lectures, office hours are great, TF section is helpful and useful to understanding the course, psets are really good for understanding the material and realizing the applications of it to the real world.",
                "The course was well structured and progressed from easier material to harder material.",
                "In lecture, Zhen helped student learning by answering questions with a lot of care, asking \"Did it make sense?\" after his first explanation, and providing additional explanations if necessary. He and Ziqing were also very helpful in office hours, where most of the learning actually took place.\r\n\r\nOverall the course felt disorganized. The textbook listed for the course was never once discussed (on the syllabus just for show). The course schedule was tentative and some topics were never covered. The lecture numbers in the files did not agree with the lecture numbers in the titles (i.e. Lecture 17 is Lecture 18). There was one lecture that was just two slides with a graph and a table of values without titles. The timing of the TF section, 7pm on Thursday, was decided by a one-vote margin in a poll at the beginning of the semester which included shoppers, and as a result only about 20-30% of the class ever showed up. I still showed up even though it was a terribly inconvenient time. Lecture slides and problem sets often had typos, which Zhen mentioned but never corrected. Communication of expectations for the course were unclear and I only really learned what this course is about (mathematical applications you learn from the TF sessions and office hours) after the midterm (but fortunately in time for the final).",
                "Strengths: You get a super clear sense of structure. Zhen makes sure to explain the outline of what youll cover at the start of each lecture. \r\nStrong sense of interaction: since the class is about 20 people, the professor has the bandwidth to answer everyones questions in detail. You get way more interaction than Econ 122.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem set due date was a little awkward. They made it due at noon, but if it were due at midnight it wouldve been better.",
                "I thought the class was well taught and the content was all very interesting. The professor and TA were also very hands on and willing to help. I  wish the class was a little more engaging at times and participation was more encouraged.",
                "Strengths: Zhen Huo is an amazing professor, with extremely clear lecture explanations and office hours to improve our learning and assist. Exams were incredibly fair and tested knowledge. Weaknesses: Obviously, the material can get a bit dry at times, but I think Prof. Huo was great about bringing in data and making things relevant to the real world.",
                "I think the strength of this course was a comprehensive introduction to most Macroeconomic Models. Additionally, I enjoyed being able to work with data from time to time.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Psets, I think that the problem sets were very well formed, and helped me to learn the material a lot better. I think that the lectures were good for introducing the ideas, but psets were good for building true understanding. Sometimes they are difficult, but they prepare you well for exams. Redo problems before the midterm and final! The psets in the middle did get tedious for me, as I did not put enough time into them for understanding, but once I understood the Lagrangian, first order conditions, and summations well, the problems on the final were like butter, and were actually fun to complete.\r\n-Section, I really thought that the sections were well done. Our teaching fellow, Ziqing, did a great job explaining homework problems (section was a day after homework was due), and this also helped to reinforce understanding of solutions, and the process to get there. \r\n-Lectures, I think that Professor Huo did a great job with example problems in lectures, which helped to guide you through the homework.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I think that some of the middle lectures became a bit tedious, as they did not reflect homework problems. We had several lectures on side topics, like unemployment, like in the economy of France, which were interesting to learn about, but I feel that the math heavy lectures towards the end were a bit cramped as a result. Perhaps if these side lectures were placed at the end of the course, and the math heavy lectures were earlier, then students would have more time to cement their understanding of the math."

The models you learn here will pop up again if you take higher level Econ classes, so its worth it to learn them well. If it's with Zhen, extra recommend!\r\n\r\nIf youre debating between this class and Econ 122, give 126 a chance. Go to one full Econ 126 lecture and youll be able to decide. But please dont choose 122 just because it sounds easier. Theres a chance youll actually enjoy the content in 126 as more than another requirement.",
                "Yes! Great if you're interested in math and Econ and how they overlap",
                "If you're deciding between ECON 122 and 126, absolutely take this class. I don't think it's much harder (and maybe even easier), from discussions with friends in intermediate macro. And, Prof. Huo is a gem, and you gain all of the benefits of being in a small class with more individualized attention.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the math behind the models or generally getting a more solid understanding of the material, I highly recommend this course over the regular intermediate macro option. Zhen is a fantastic and very very caring professor. And it is a wonderful opportunity to learn Econ in a small group.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Macroeconomics. It is quite theoretical, but we also get to work with data and apply the models we learn to the real world.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the applications of math to macroeconomics. It was really a joy towards the end of the semester; I love math, and it was great to see how it all began to work together with the macro theories. The math is a tad bit challenging to wrap your mind around at first, but is rewarding in the end.",
