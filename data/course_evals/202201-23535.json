                "Strengths: the curriculum and the format (2 exams, 6 homework assignments, no section) were both perfect. I also appreciated the supplementary resources for those that were curious to learn even more than what was required of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Super long slide decks included a LOT of information, which made studying a bit harder. I enjoyed learning so much though.",
                "A lot of the homework questions were very plug-and-chug (i.e., you don't actually need to understand the theory; you just plug numbers into an equation and get the answer).",
                "Strengths: Extremely detailed lectures, interesting topic, extremely knowledgeable professor, assignment flexibility\r\nWeaknesses: At 9am.",
                "well taught",
                "Strengths: many accommodations for students who would rather take it remotely/asynchronously; organized content; useful psets",
                "Strengths: very informative lectures that covered each technology in the right amount of depth. I feel confident in my ability to approach detailed news articles or to work in an energy-adjacent field after taking the course. The whole course is also well organized and structured. It was fun to hear from both professors, too. Weaknesses: the midterm and final are significantly more difficult than I might have expected for the course. They're fair, and the problem sets are reasonable, but they did surprise me.",
                "The course presented a wide variety of topics and technologies in an organized way. The slides were thorough and the problem sets generally aligned with material we covered in class. Study sessions with Professor Oristaglio were helpful. I think one way it could be improved is to have more quantitative problems.",
                "Professor Oristaglio is clearly very very knowledgeable about the field + always gives great/thorough answers to questions. Open note exams useful in detracting the focus from memorization. Pacing speeds up considerably the last few weeks. If you're genuinely interested in the field (or want to be introduced to it), this class is great; if you're taking it as a gut, it's good in terms of workload/grading, but lectures will seem dry.",
                "Strengths include the breadth and depth of the material, the rigor in practicing quantitative questions through several problem sets, and the availability of Prof Oristaglio and the TFs for help. One thing that could be further improved is the variety of assignments. Given the richness of the material, it would be exciting to work in groups on written assignments, presentations, or other projects where we combine the variety of knowledge and skills we learn in class into a comprehensive project. This could also take away some of the stress from the exams (and midterm exam) in particular, which - from my own experience - feel like point-assessments heavily influenced by how well you perform under pressure.",
                "Automatic 48hr extensions on psets and flexibility with test times/dates were very helpful and accommodating of individual student needs.",
                "- great rpofessor",
                "Overall a very interesting class and a great way to learn about renewable energy. It was a lot more technical than I expected so be prepared for that. You will be presented with a LOT of information. This made it a little hard for me when studying for exams because it was hard to determine what is actually relevant and important. Again its great if you want to learn about renewable energy but I wasnt prepared for the amount of information wed have to know. Super interesting just dont expect it to be a true gut cause the workload isnt insignificant.",
                "Strength: really engaging material and lectures, structured very well\r\nWeaknesses: more transparency in feedback on psets and exams needed",
                "strengths: super interesting material, learned a lot\r\nweakness: didn't always get feedback on psets/exams without specifically asking for it. also the lectures often had a LOT of slides. I think shorter powerpoints could have made the lectures more engaging/easier to retain",
                "The material is interesting and the professor is great, but the lectures can be dry at times.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, fun mix of science and real-world content\r\nWeaknesses: teaching style is not super engaging, and answer keys to problem sets could be more fleshed out -- I know a lot of questions have multiple correct answers, but (for example) a question that you need to solve an equation for could have an example of one possible correct equation that leads you to the answer rather than just the input values and the final answer",
                "Awesome class!",
                "Great content and teaching",

                "I thought the content was all very interesting and both Oristaglio and Ron Smith were great lecturers. I do think Smith's lecture slides could've had some more information on them, as I would typically forget some of the details that he would mention in lecture and they would show up in exams.",
                "This course is more focused on breadth than depth. I thought it would have been more useful to learn less topics and instead delve deep into the more prominent forms of renewable energy. Instead, we learned a little about essentially every energy source. I also thought some of the lectures were quite boring due to being full of redundant or erroneous. Additionally, I found the exams to be unnecessarily long and stressful compared to the rest of the class.",
                "This course is beautifully organized and very well explained. Professor Oristaglio is very receptive to questions and will often go out of his way to send thoughtful and detailed email responses. Some of the subjects are more fascinating than others, and the guest lectures do not add much - I wish that Professor Oristaglio had taught the course entirely. Also, although it was out of anyone's control, about half of the lectures were through Zoom, during which I learned markedly less.",
                "Zoom was bad",
                "Strengths: learned some things about energy that are somewhat interesting and helpful for life. I will be able to read my monthly electricity bill more critically going forward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class was not engaging at all. The lectures were boring. Often, the PSET questions were incongruous with the material covered in the lectures. TAs weren't always very helpful in office hours. I counted down the days til this class would end. Nothing against Prof. Oristaglio, he's great and just doing his job. I just didn't find the course material interesting, fun, engaging, or insightful at all. Grading was also too heavy on exams.",
                "Very comprehensive, could be a bit uninteresting at times",
                "Strengths: Professor was very flexible with extensions on psets and exams were open note which made the tests more manageable given the material covered. There were plenty of office hours and TAs were very happy to answer questions/clarify material from class. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could be a little dry at times and the first few weeks of the class were very repetitive from EPS 274.",
                "Strengths: excellent broad-based introduction to full spectrum of renewable energy solutions, helpful and informative problem sets, practical and engaging lecture slides\r\nWeaknesses: midterm and final were not exceptionally well-designed (too many questions, too little time)"

The week-to-week work (problems sets) are very reasonable, but the midterm and final are more difficult than you'd expect, especially in the amount of time given. But, the expectations are clearly laid out for you, the lectures are interesting, Professor Oristaglio really knows what he's talking about, and the content isall major advantages to the course.

                "If you are interested in the material (which, if you care about the environment, you probably should be), then this makes for an interesting surface-level introduction to modern energy. It would make an excellent fifth class or STEM course for humanities students. As a STEM student, I was a bit bored at times. Also, although it was out of anyone's control, about half of the lectures were through Zoom, during which I learned markedly less. In more normal times, there might be more field trips; I was looking forward to these, but unfortunately only one materialized this semester during the last week of the class.",
