                "Pre-recorded lectures and class were heavily based on the textbook. The examples, ordering, and teaching was exactly the same as the textbook. Class is often just reading directly from slides that are just a few sentences from the textbook, but at a pace that is unsuitable for first exposure or review of ideas. I didn't get much from attending/listening to class. Just read the book and you'll be fine.",
                "The power points were very clear and useful. The format of class was nice as well (watch pre-recorded lectures beforehand and then go over the lectures during meeting times).",
                "+pre-recorded resources+TA sessions are great. Textbook is clear and course closely follows it meaning you can go between the resources.\r\n\r\n-Pace is real fast and problem sets are huge. In the zoom format, lectures are basically repeats of the pre-recorded resources; Professor Smooke pauses for questions, but due to the pace of the class it doesn't feel like the best place to ask them and instead will go to smaller TA sessions to find answers.",
                "It felt super rushed as a summer course, but I imagine it would be wonderful if offered during the academic year. I did appreciate that Prof. Smooke worked hard to fit all the subject matter in while trying to make sure it was still manageable.",
                "Strengths: pretty thorough lecture videos, and re-explaining the material helped cement the idea\r\nWeaknesses: fast pace did not allow for us to dive into the material and gain a deeper intuition behind the problems.",
                "Professor Smooke was great, along with Priya and the other TA's. This course is not the most stimulating, so that is a weakness, but I did enjoy it overall.",
                "Strengths: Teacher / TA was flexible and understanding to a situation that popped up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Did not enjoy the teaching style. Everything was on pre-created slides which often skipped integration steps. Additionally, it felt like things were just being read off the slides instead of being taught. I wish there was some virtual whiteboard (iPad) or something he could have used to physically show us in real time the steps he takes to solve an equation. Often felt like I had to self learn.",
                "Strengths: Clear instruction with posted lectures, and well-paced, with well-written tests and a friendly professor. \r\nWeaknesses: Because it was all techniques, it would have been interesting to learn something besides just technique after technique (that we might quickly forget, although useful to have background). Either a little math theory or more focus on real applications (e.g. from professor's own work or something) would have made class SUBSTANTIALLY better.  I know good real-life models are probably more complicated than what we learn in class, but still would have made things feel more relevant.  Alternatively, some practice setting up differential equations in word problems would be nice... we did a few in the first week, but for the other 4 we did not.",
                "I don't recomend the summer format, as I feel like it was way too condensed. The way it's structured, you have a test every week and the tests arent cumulative, meaning that after leartning so much for each week, it is very easy to forget what was previously taught. Also, the lectures were redundant, as class time was just reviewing them. The problem sets are 30 pages long, which I feel is way too much. Office hours also sparse.",
                "The teacher is very approachable and does his best to make the class interesting. He cares a lot for his students.",
                "the questions about scientists in examinations were somehow hard to answer (though quite interesting) even if I have listened to the relevant contents in class carefully.",
                "Perhaps fewer questions per homework? It was a summer session so everything was crammed together and there was a lot of problems to do. Also more clarity regarding our usage of graphing software and calculators would be appreciated.",
                "I think having the recorded lectures and the in-class lectures being exactly the same wasn't too helpful, I would prefer if the examples from thee videos and in-class were different so we got more practice"

                "If you already know exactly what you want to use differential equations for, this class is great because it quickly covers a lot of methods for solving them and gives a strong base of knowledge.  Otherwise, it will feel like meaningless techniques that you'll forget soon... the professor did provide SOME real-life examples, but it was a very small component of the course. So I think it's well-structured for a CERTAIN student population (mostly engineers, statistics people).",
                "If you need it for your major, yes. During the summer, I would not.",
                "Do NOT take this course over the summer if you actually want to learn the material well and/or have the time/effort for a very demanding class. It goes very fast which makes it extremely difficult to actually absorb any of the material, and we actually skipped over some key topics I believe. You will spend most of your time reading the textbook and teaching yourself things than actually engaging with the class. That said, the main reason I dont recommend taking this class over the summer is the insane workload. Problem sets took forever to complete and would range from 30 to 40 pages for me. This, on top of weekly midterms, made for a very stressful five weeks. Definitely not the light workload that I expected for only taking one class.",
