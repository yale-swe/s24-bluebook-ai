    "I developed my listening abilities--i.e. I improved my ability to distinguish among intervals and chords and to perform harmonic\/rhythmic dictations.",
    "I how to listen to two part counterpoint dictations. I learned theory behind intervals, major, minor, diminished, and seventh chords. I was able to listen to these intervals and identify them by ear. I learned theory behind chord changes especially major chord changes in popular music transferring between tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. I was able to practice sight reading and analyze theory with written sheet music. I also improved on my sight singing abilities.",

    "it does what it's supposed to--very difficult, feels like it should be a full credit course because of its level of difficulty.",
    "This course definitely improves musical skills, but can feel really hard if it doesnt come naturally. I would say that experiences in this course probably vary a lot based on what skills are more natural to you.",
    "Strengths- engaging, skills actually develop, taken into bits and pieces, manageable",
    "Strength: Really chill with Prof. Adam and a great course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lot more work than 0.5 credits dependent on who you get for piano section\/lab.",
    "I think this course does exactly what it says it will, which is develop your musicianship skills.",
    "The strengths on the course include the professor. He was very willing to answer questions and was thorough in this response. He also showed examples on the board and was able to illustrate some examples on the piano. I enjoyed the keyboard lab as an addition to my coursework in class.",
    "The strengths of this class are its accessibility and its ability to build off of existing skills easily. I say build off of because in areas where I was lacking the basic knowledges, I felt myself quickly falling behind and unable to catch up."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only really if one is a musician. Cultivates a very niche set of abilities that aren't essential for most.",
    "Yes. very helpful to anyone doing music in any capacity",
    "Yes, great way to build musicianship at individual pace",
    "Yes!! But make sure you're prepared to take a courseload greater than 0.5",
    "Yes - this is essential for musicians.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student who wants to improve their musicianship skills. It is not a difficult course, but the more work you put in the more you will get out of it. There aren't a lot of strict homework assignments, so it is really up to you to practice in order to improve your skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone else.  This was well taught and helped me in music composition, playing and hearing.",
    "Anyone who wants to get better at music in general needs to take this class. The plethora of skills learned in lecture and piano labs enhance all aspects of a music interest, and its truly a necessity to become the best musician you can."
