However, in terms of writing, I often felt like there was no clear instruction as to what we were meant to do, and this led to much confusion and unnecessary stress.",

Although my professor was a very interesting person and very good at the humanities, he has never taught an intro-English class before. This meant that it was a learning curve for all of us. While I understand that it was his first time teaching the course, it was less than optimal as a student to take this course.",

I thought it was going to be more interesting, which is why I signed up for it in the first place. However, if someone were to have a great interest in iconoclasm, I would totally recommend this course to them."
