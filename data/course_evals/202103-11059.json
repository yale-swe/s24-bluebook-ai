                "Strengths: Interesting subject material, Professor Natarajan clearly has a lot of knowledge to share, open-ended final projects, good pacing of assignments. Weaknesses: First half of the course covered fairly easy material and went kinda slowly while the second half covered much more complex topics, and some important but challenging topics were seemingly rushed (and then showed up on exams).",
                "Strength is open note exams very fair, and no final exam\r\nWeakness is final project length",
                "I think the material is genuinely interesting. It's really cool to engage with the fundamental truths of our universe and understand what's going on in the Cosmos. I liked being able to understand, if only on a basic level, what rules govern our universe and how our understanding of the universe changes over time. One improvement I would suggest is a more engaging format than reading/working off of a slideshow. I found myself disengaged often in class because the subject matter was so broad and it felt like such a mass of information coming at me that I would just wait until after the lecture to try to actually process the lectures. Writing on the board or simply talking might be a more engaging method of information delivery than working off of a pre-made slideshow.",
                "Strengths: really interesting material presented in an understandable way by a brilliant, engaging professor\r\nweakness: I really enjoyed the final project and wish we had a similar mid-semester project, or possibly a research project about a scientist of our choice.",
                "Great course overall",
                "I found the lectures engaging, and the problem sets were interesting. I appreciated the emphasis on the ideas underlying the quantitative skills we were learning. I sometimes wished for more feedback on assignments.",
                "Lectures were well-organized, homework and tests were spread out well throughout the semester.",
                "I think the strengths of the course is that if you are interested in the subject manner but don't have a strong background in math or physics, it is packaged in a way that makes the math easy. Another strength of the course is the final project. It is nice to have flexibility in what I choose to research or do. It is also really interesting hearing other student's projects. I think this course has a few weaknesses. It starts really slow but gets more interesting as the class goes along. Its a small lecture but it would definitely be helpful to have discussion sections as sometimes it can be really hard to understand the material conceptually.",
                "This course was amazing, likely the best class I've taken. The problemsets were meaningful and interesting, the textbook was great, and the lectures were absolutely wonderful. So engaging, so interesting. I recommend this class more than any other class I've taken.",
                "I liked how this course focused on the actual techniques and methods astronomers used to discover the facts we know about the Universe and included references to the history of scientific discoveries. Allusions in class to current open questions in cosmology and ongoing research to solve them were also fascinating.\r\n\r\nI think this course suffers a bit from being too ambitious with the amount of information it attempts to convey. While I enjoyed receiving such a comprehensive survey of cosmology, trying to cover that many different topics meant that parts of the course inevitably felt rushed and not sufficiently explained in depth. While these sections of the course were never tested, that also meant I was less motivated to engage with and truly understand that material."

I felt lucky having already taken several advanced math classes at Yale, and I could imagine that someone with a weaker science or (especially) math background would have a harder time grasping some of the more technical concepts.",

For me, this course would have been better if there was a greater focus on math, but you can decide whether this course would be right for you with a very simple question: do I want to learn the history of our understanding of the universe? The focus of lectures is much more on the history of our own understanding than the history of the universe itself.",

It's not a gut, but it's also completely doable for anyone with solid mathematical intuition. I'm not sure I would recommend it, though, to someone who doesn't like tinkering with numbers.",

                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in astronomy or physics. I think it is especially well-suited to humanities majors like myself who are interested in physics but would rather engage with it on a conceptual rather than a mathematical level."
