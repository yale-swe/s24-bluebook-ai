                "Learned the basic techniques of multiple printmaking processes, including monotype, woodblock, copper plates, and screen printing. This course is a very hands-on class and we spent a lot of time going over each process.",
                "This course was one of the most rewarding art classes I've ever taken. I was exposed to a wide variety of printmaking processes; I gained experience with woodcutting, copper plate etching, aquatint, risograph printing, screen printing, and more. I learned how to use the equipment and utilize the facility of a printmaking studio. Generally I developed new sets of skills and ways of thinking about the creation of images and graphics, and how different printing processes can be leveraged to produce particular results.",
                "I learned a variety of printmaking techniques (woodblock, linoblock, silkscreen, etching, aquatint). I also learned some nifty tricks for how to keep a studio practice (how to keep it clean, how to be efficient, etc.)."

                "the course was a bit disorganizedthe instructions could have been made more clear, but you got a lot of freedom, which was nice.",
                "If you are interested in gaining a good overview of printmaking, this is a good class.",
                "A strength of the course was having access to the printmaking studio during class and open hours. Once I had watched a demo of a technique, I could spend time outside of class working on assignments and my own projects. At times the course was kinda chaotic and unorganized. A set syllabus and online database of instructions about each technique would greatly improve the learning experience.",
                "The class is very free and facilitates pursuit of any creative idea.",
                "Strengths: The course is very hands-on, and there is a lot of practice and learning by doing. The class was relatively small which allowed for frequent interactions with the instructor. There was a lot of flexibility in how you could approach projects. For instance, we had options to do collaborative work, but also to work independently based on your own preference.",
                "I came out of this class feeling confident that I could do these printmaking practices on my own. I would say that sometimes the class felt overwhelming, because there were a lot of students for an art classalthough the professor and TA made an effort to give a lot of individual attention. But sometimes they went through the steps very fast. I think it would be helpful if they made handouts with step by step instructions, as it's hard to retain all that information. I also think longer crits for the final crit would be helpful, as everyone only got 5 minutes to get feedback about their art.",
                "There are countless strengths to this course. There was a laid-back but productive class environment. We were exposed to a variety of printmaking techniques, and learned how to operate the equipment of a printmaking studio. We gained a thorough understanding of the ways in which different steps in the printmaking process can be manipulated to achieve certain results. It was also very enriching to have guests join the class to impart their knowledge and experience. All I can say is that Maria is doing a wonderful job as professor and it's frankly difficult for me to think of a single way in which the course might be improved--it was a very rewarding experience.",
                "Strengths: 1) balance of studio time in/out of class. I often find architecture studios to be inordinate in terms of the expected time dedication. This course was a great balance of studio time inside and outside of classroom time. We used class to work on our projects, and it was awesome to work next to classmates and feed off one another. 2) exposure to a wide variety of techniques, not sure where else you could get 5+ techniques in 13 weeks!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) because the class is so fast paced, sometimes certain techniques only had a week or so dedicated to them. To me, this felt rushed in a way that made me approach the class more like a survey of techniques rather than a conceptual studio. I really appreciate the wide exposure to a variety of techniques, but I was sad that there wasn't more of a conceptual framework."

Anyone who likes to experiment with new artistic mediums would like this course. The course was relatively laid back but it was also one of those courses where the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. I would highly recommend this course as I got a lot out of it myself.",
                "I would recommend this course to a couple types of students\r\n1) someone who wants to learn printmaking techniques (this is the class for it, and also required for more advanced printmaking course)\r\n2) someone who wants to take a studio art course before graduating (this is a reasonable workload for a creative class, and will get you in the mix with some wonderful artists)\r\n3) someone who wants to incorporating printmaking into their other classes (this class's structure enables self-directed projects within each technique. so, if you are interested in interdisciplinary applications of printmaking, this class is a great opportunity to explore that)"
