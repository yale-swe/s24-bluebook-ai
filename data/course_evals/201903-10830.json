    "A lot of my takeaway insights from the course are about economic values and the mindset that economic thinking fosters even from the Intro Micro level. In terms of knowledge, its pretty straightforward: you learn about product and factor markets: supply, demand, labor, capital, and some interesting econ\/psychology crossover concepts. I also got a QR credit, which was great because this course is pretty straightforward in terms of the math.",

    "I learned the basics of microeconomics, and now have a stronger understanding of economic systems.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of Microeconomics, such as market structures, consumer behaviors and choice, and the labor market",

   "comments": [
    "Tolga is absolutely a strength of this course. While Tolgas humor can take some adjusting to, I ended up being really impressed by his commitment to teaching. His lectures are impeccably concise and he really knows how to teach these concepts in a funny, sticky way. Another strength is that the expectations of the course, down to what will be on each exam, are extremely clear. Sometimes the class, by virtue of its intro status and the amount of material to be covered, is a bit simplistic in its assumptions made regarding human behavior.",
    "I liked how Tolga posted lecture videos so it was easy to go back and review content. Office hours were used to go over P-sets. There were always ample opportunities for review and questions the week before exams, but I do wish that there were office hour opportunities for non- Pset related questions aside from then.",
    "Strengths- provided relevant feedback for improvement, small class size, excellent professor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- none",
    "Strengths: learned a lot. Weaknesses: content felt scattered.",
    "Strengths; The class met a lot and the office ours were really really helpful, there was a lot of review for midterms and finals, the professor is really great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses; the class is hard (not the workload but the actual material itself, since this is technically an intermediate Econ class since Yale doesnt offer an intro intro Econ class), the book kinda sucks (I never used it because it was often different than what was taught; it was never helpful for the math parts but it was helpful for conceptual parts of the class).  The class is also VERY VERY FAST",
    "Student engagement in the course was particularly strong as well as ample availability of the professor outside of class, particularly at the time of tests. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tolga."

    "Yep, I would definitely recommend taking intro micro with Tolga in ECON 108. My class was diverse, interesting, curious, and collaborative, and Tolga seemed to genuinely have fun teaching us. Its no easy QR, and I certainly spent a lot of time on it, but it was also refreshing in that it was a very straightforward experience with no surprises.",
    "Yes- if you have to take econ, take it with Tolga!",
    "Definitely- if they need a QR credit or are interested in learning about microeconomics, Id suggest this course rather than the lecture due to the class size and level of engagement.",
    "If a student loved economics and wanted to really engage with the material, then yes, I would recommend. Otherwise, I would say just take the seminar!",
    "No I would not, they should take the lecture class for Intro micro.",
    "If youre interested in Econ this would be a great class to start.  Honestly, Finance bros are gonna be the most interested in this one because its Microeconomics and mostly deals with stuff like how much a firm will produce or how many laborers will they hire.  If youre like me (a Poli Sci major) then Macroeconomics is going to be a lot more interesting as it deals with big picture stuff like unemployment and GDP, but this class is a prerequisite for Macroeconomics.  So be wary!  If you want to do Macro (which is mostly concept-based), youre gonna have to do this one first (which is very math-based).",
    "I would recommendif they are simply looking for a QR credit. If they are interested in Econ as a major, I would still recommend taking it but preface my recommendation that it may lower their interest for Econ since it is largely math based and not as interesting as MacroEconomics.",
    "I would recommend introductory microeconomics to another student if they could guarantee to have Tolga as their professor."
