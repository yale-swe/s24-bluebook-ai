   "comments": [
    "Learn EVERYTHING about Jane Austen and her career as a writer. It's super interesting to track her growth as a writer. Work on writing skills, as well.",
    "I learned how to write entire essays about a single passage from a novel. My close reading skills greatly improved as a result of this course, and I now find that I'm better able to make connections between one central passage and other parts of the novel.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned to internalize the idea of literary criticism as something encompassing not just the work in question, but the dynamics of the world in which it was written and eventually consumed.",
    "Ive learned to write more critically as a writer and pay attention to subtleties in literary texts.",
    "Greater understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen literature and her ideas.",
    "I learned about Jane Austen and her life, her lasting impact she made through her books, and the major themes of her work.",
    "I learned how to do close readings of novels and write essays about close reading of passages. I also learned how to manage lots of readings within a week.",
    "I learned how to do a close reading of a passage as well as how to recognize the elements of an Austen novel. I am now familiar with the Austen canon and feel more capable of understanding the literary strategies through which Austen pushed her courtship plot and bildungsroman plot.",
    "I certainly improved my writing because of this source. I learned about developing and justifying a focus, writing academically, and close reading. I also learned much about Jane Austen's writingboth the texts themselves and the scholarship\/analysis surrounding them. This was also a helpful introduction to seminars at Yale; the class was small and engaged and required engagement.",
    "I learned how to analyze novels more carefully by looking at word choice, repetition, tracing themes not only over a book but throughout a series. I also improved my ability to contribute to group discussions and writing literary analysis essays with a lot of freedom of topic.",
    "I think taking this class made me think more about devices and form that Austen uses. I tend to focus on imagery so I learnt to focus on other areas of Austen's writing.\r\nAlso, Professor Markovits helped me with my writing. It was good to think about the structure and style of my work.",
    "I learned how to read large amounts of text in very short amounts of time and also how to develop succinct arguments when writing."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of work but intellectually stimulating.",
    "Strengths: No matter how closely I read an assignment, class made me realize how much was going on beneath the surface of a novel and how much I was missing. I loved gaining new insights about the novels from class. There were many days when I would hear something in class that totally amazed me. For example, Professor Markovits' analysis of the Sotherton scene in Mansfield Park made me see the scene entirely differently; I hadn't even thought twice about that scene before we spent a significant portion of the class discussing it. What I learned really amazed me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes felt like there were \"right\" and \"wrong\" opinions in the class. Sometimes people would say their ideas and it would seem like Professor Markovits wanted them to move their thinking in a different direction  like their opinion was \"wrong.\" It often felt like there was a pressure to adopt the same views that the professor had about the novels.",
    "The strengths of the course was the simultaneous depth and breadth of the discussions, which encompassed all of Austens novels while remaining dedicated to approaching each as its own independent work of art. The only discernible weakness (and this was not a detriment to the class) was the density of the reading which could sometimes be overwhelming.",
    "It was a great course overall  I really enjoyed our class discussions every day!",
    "Perfectly spaced out with novels and class time.",
    "This course is absolutely enjoyable and instructive; although the workload is heavy, the in-class discussions are eye-opening.",
    "The weaknesses of this course were that there was simply an insurmountable amount of reading assigned. I think the course could be improved if it met three times a week rather than two, so that the reading would be spread out over more days. \r\n\r\nThe biggest strength of the course is Professor Markovits's passion for the subject and ability to encourage us to look deep into the texts. The books themselves were very enjoyable as well.",
    "Strengths: Strong engagement with texts, well paced, students learn from each other\r\nWeaknesses: Purely-academic engagement with Austen\r\nThe course could possibly be improved by a discussion of why academics and non-academics love Austen so much. I feel like the almost universal appeal of her writings is an important element that the course does not go very far into.",
    "The class pacing is very good, all the books and readings were covered extensively and there was also time to look at some modern adaptations and movies.",
    "Gave me a greater understanding of Austen and how clever she was. It was great that we were introduced to her short stories and juvenilia. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes would like discussion to be a bit more student led but understand that there is a lot to get through in a short period.",
    "I thought that this course was great and exactly what I signed up for."

   "comments": [
    "If you are passionate about Austen or have read her works before, definitely! You will really get a great understanding of her as an author. If you haven't read any of her works, this class will be very difficult and time consuming and all the characters may begin to blend together. Class is basically just an hour and fifteen minute discussion so you always have to be prepared! Professor Markovits tends to have one interpretation \/ analysis of the texts that she puts forth and then disregards all other possible interpretations (even those written by respected critics), which is an interesting way to approach Austen's works.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the skill of literary criticism, as it teaches one to engage in conversations spurred by the texts but not limited by them.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you love reading Jane Austen and enjoy small group discussions, this class is for you!",
    "Yes, as a non English major it was great to be guided through novels and writing with such a small class.",
    "Most definitely; it changed the way I think about fiction and is making me consider changing my major!",
    "Yes I would. It is a great first writing class for college. The instructor does a great job at feedback and facilitating student learning.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are prepared to spend 4-5 hours a week reading just for this class. Besides that, the class was wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Austen.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone! The material is interesting and useful to everyone and the skills that the course developsmainly writing and close readingare essential regardless of what you are studying.",
    "Yes, I think even if you have no knowledge of Jane Austen the class is still valuable and there is time to really explore her writings.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone who loves Austen and is looking for a good way to ease into college writing."
