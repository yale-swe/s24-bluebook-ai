                "I now have a very solid understanding of the drug development process, from A to Z. It's hard to verbalize all of the insights I have gained from this class, but they have allowed me to think about Pharma industry in completely new ways.",
                "Financial modeling, market forecasting, evaluating companies and competitors, reading scientific articles, developing drugs.",
                "I learned how to value a pharmaceutical company as well as how several medications worked.",
                "For someone with limited knowledge in economics, this course was a great intro to the business side of biotech and pharma. This course offers a really interesting perspective for biology majors who want to explore the real applications of biology. The course covers various case studies on real biotech companies, the drugs they developed, how they were marketed, mergers and acquisitions, clinical trials, etc. The assignments in the course were also very interesting and meaningful. We were assigned to write a valuation for a company and a report for a drug -- both very interesting assignments (especially for bio majors who want to learn more about the business side of drug development).",

You learn how to do a deep dive into a company and build financial models. You develop a good intuition on how to analyze a therapeutic / biotechnology company.",

                "Strength: speakers were great, and the level of science to econ was a good balance. \r\nWeakness: the group activities sometimes felt a bit unnecessary, so perhaps they could be replaced with whole class discussions",
                "Strengths: The assignments in this class were all very purposeful and interesting. They all covered real skills, like analyzing clinical trial data or forecasting the sales for a drug. It was a great introduction to valuations and market forecasting for a biology major. The discussions in the course were also very interesting and I liked that we looked at case studies of real biotech companies. The professors were also great. Both of them were very funny and made the class very enjoyable! Weaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: definitely how approachable the professors were - they made the class super engaging and tried their best to get to know each individual student. The class was a good mix of science and business, so you could get a lot out of this class regardless of which side you lean more heavily towards. The midterm and final assignments were fun (although they did take up a lot of time).\r\nWeakness: I think i would've appreciated slightly more instruction on what input/assumptions to use for the midterm/final project valuation exercises.",
                "A strength is that the course is extremely engaging and involves lots of group discussion. A weakness is that the things you learn in the course do not really translate to the midterm and final very well, you're sort of on your own with those.",
                "Strength is that this class has a lot of real world applications unlike some other courses. Only weakness is that if you have a strong science background, you may get board during some of the science overview segments because the course is an Econ course tailored to Econ majors.",
                "Profs Dr. Dash and Raskin are the highlight of this course. They make class fun and select case studies that are interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: Pharmagellan Guide was impossible to find online and it didn't feel worth it to purchase it. I don't don't think anyone in the class had the book despite it being required reading"

                "Absolutely recommend this class!!! I think it's really great. Dr. Raskin and Dr. Dash are fantastic, and their dynamic makes class really engaging and interesting. Every week was focused on a different disease (cancer, diabetes, arthritis, etc), and had a case study focusing in on a particular pharmaceutical company and their drug, which we discussed in class and thought through the pros/cons of potential decisions the company could make. Also the assignments are more finance-oriented, which I enjoyed. There were incredible guest speakers from all the different parts of the medical industry (from a biotech research company, a healthcare investor, a healthcare consultant, and healthcare journalism).",
                "Yes! If you're interested in biotech AT ALL, this is so important to gain a baseline foundation of the sector.",
                "Yes, it's a great course with great and fun professors, but do note that the midterm and final assignment will take an extremely significant amount of time. There isn't that much time intensive work besides those two assignments, though.",
                "Yes! This course teaches a lot of valuable information for anyone interested in medicine, biotechnology, pharma. This course helped me develop many practical skills for industry and the professors were wonderful. They brought in many interesting speakers and were always excited to teach and receptive to questions.",
                "Cautiously, you learn a lot but it also asks a lot of you",
                "I would! Its great if you want to go into consulting or just want a general knowledge of how pharma works.",
                "Yes! For a biology major looking to gain exposure to the business world, absolutely take this class. It covers the biotech and pharma industries, and teaches many valuable skills for any bio major looking to learn about biotech.",
                "Definitely. It was interesting taking a class with a mix of economics and pre-med students. I don't think I would've taken a class together with such a mix of people otherwise, and it was great to have everyone bring a different perspective and knowledge to the table. The two instructors are so engaging and entertaining, and class time felt incredibly fun because of them. Workload is light for most of the semester, except for the midterm and final projects, but given that the assignments were actually quite informative and fun, that's not a major weakness - you just have to budget time for it.",
                "I would recommend this to pre-meds or people who want to go into bio-consulting.",
                "Yes. Definitely take this course if you are interested in pharma / biotech.",
                "This is a must-take class for anyone interested in biotech, pharma, or healthcare. The profs are extremely knowledgable and successful in their fields, and they also bring in a lot of cool guest speakers. I've never had a class with so many distinguished guest speakers. The assigned case study readings are interesting. Most people came to class eager to discuss the topics."
