                "Strengths is the fair amount of work given to the students in the course. The combination of problem sets, a project, and a presentation was a nice aspect of the course; it helped us work with the material in different ways. A weakness was the recordings of lectures, since it did not show the slides that the the professor was using to teach."

The breadth of material covered is quite expansive and offers a lot of good insights into the world of economic research more generally, but the course suffers from the fact that it isn't about replicating the research so much as just understanding it. This fact makes it difficult to remain engaged with the course at times.",
