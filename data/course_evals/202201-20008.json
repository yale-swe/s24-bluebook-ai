                "I learned about the history of the Olympic Games from ancient Greece to the modern era. I was able to get perspectives from the ancient Greek philosophers to the great minds who brought the Olympics back in the 19th century to the different figures in history that shaped the various renditions of the Games in the 20th century and the social, political, economic, etc. ramifications of the various renditions of the Games.",

            "comments": [
                "Spent way too much time on antiquity. I was anticipating getting a few classes of background on the Olympics and then discussing modern issues and development with some supplementary material relating back to ancient times. However, by class eight, we were still discussing topics over a hundred years ago. I would rather spend more time on modernity. However, it did give good conceptual understanding of how the Olympics changed. I also liked how we drew in examples of the current Winter Olympics that had happened during the class.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, interesting readings. Weaknesses: Discussion is not always very engaging and often turns into more of a lecture, sometimes discussion does not pertain to our readings, writing directions not always clear",
                "Strengths were that the topics were gripping and often themes present in the ancient games were very applicable to case studys from today. The weakness is that I received limited feedback on my reading responses.",
                "Amazing!",
                "The strengths of the course are the variety of sources that we engage in (ancient Greek texts, Olympic material, documentaries, videos, variety of secondary sources) and the scope of the course, as it allowed me to comfortably put everything in context and get a new understanding of the Olympics and sports in general across a large period in human history. A weakness of the course was that the discussions in class sometimes went stale or died out a bit, which was a shame because the readings and topics were interesting and had great potential for more thorough and interesting discussion. I feel like that is not the fault of the course, but more so how willing the people in the class are to contribute and speak their mind on the topics. It could be improved by finding some way to foster more discussion and give more flow to the class. I also feel like spending some time at the beginning of the class going over the readings with the professor leading the conversation would be a good way to frame what we read and then be better prepared for the class discussion. I also feel like instructions and guidance for the papers throughout the semester could be more clear so we have a better example of what we need to accomplish.",
                "The information learnt in the class was fantastic, really interesting, and the structure of the course moving from ancient to modern times worked well. Could be improved by allowing a little more time for students to talk and explore ideas during class."

                "I would recommend this course only if you're really interested in learning more about the Olympics and the different aspects of the Games throughout history. The course content itself is very interesting, but the in-class discussions sometimes felt like they dragged on, so if you're excited about the content, then I would recommend it, but there are probably more engaging classes available if that's what you're looking for.",
                "Yes, loved the content, the structure of the course, and the more discussion-based nature of the class."
