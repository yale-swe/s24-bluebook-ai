                "This class was incredibly effective in building a bridge between the academic and real-world applications for design thinking and public health.",
                "Tips for starting an entrepreneurial venture, particularly in the developing world. Ways that technology can be creatively applied in low- and middle-income countries to address pressing problems.",
                "I learned about how to successfully design, prototype, and implement a biotechnology in low- and middle-income nations from the beginning to the very end of this iterative process. This class also touched on important themes in global health such as hurdles to vaccination uptake, how to quantify development (via use of DALYs and QALYs), etc.",
                "In this course, we explored the different aspects of biotechnology. We studied various cases of developing countries that are in need of innovation and creative thinkers. We also designed a heart monitor from scratch at the end of the course.",
                "deep learning, convolution neural networks, generative models",
                "I learned how to think about biotechnological solutions to issues in developing worlds, and how to go about implementing them. I sodered a heart monitered, improved my group work skills, evaluated real world grant proposals, and met a lot of inspirational entrepreneurs.",
                "I absolutely loved this course and the professor. It makes you think practically about how to begin a start-up and how to implement an idea. It is very collaborative and low-stress. It is truly meant to be a learning experience."

                "Strengths: very open-ended in terms of what you wanted to do for your final project. Finding a good group that shared some of your interests was important. Reading responses were helpful and a low-stakes way to make sure you did the reading. The class also had no exams, which was awesome for an engineering student taking many exam classes.\r\n\r\nSomething to note: lots of the work you produce in this class is self/team directed, and if you want guidance from the Prof / TFs you have to ask.\r\n\r\nWeakness: it would be helpful to have participation be part of the grade distribution (like as 10% or some other small amount) to encourage people to raise their hand in class. Towards the end of the semester with the guest lectures, it felt like not as many people were participating as there could have been.",
                "This class was my favorite class at Yale. It is incredibly engaging and the professor and TAs were all an incredible help.",
                "Strengths: you can really get out of this course what you want to get out of it. If you're interested in entrepreneurship, there's plenty of content to help you develop your ideas and understand what it's like to be an entrepreneur. If you're looking for an easy but interesting and engaging 5th class, this will be it. Weaknesses: not too technical, and a little bit too broad to really learn much. It's more of an opportunity to review broadly biotechnology in the developing world and start thinking about your own ideas to implement in the world (which again, is what you make of it).",
                "Strengths - the assignment load was very reasonable and none of our projects were busy work. For every reading response, midterm project, and the final, we were critically thinking about how to actually implement biotechnologies in the developing world which was very exciting. Professor Gonzalez was also great - incredibly encouraging of all students in class and her excitement for the subject matter she teaches is palpable.",
                "Strengths - assignments were very do able and professor was thorough \r\nWeaknesses - unclear rubric, especially in final project (a bit of ambiguity)",
                "strength: smita is great, the content of the lectures is awesome and thorough",
                "I think the course could have been better structured - at a certain point in the semester we kept going back and forth between certain topics, and I think class time could have been spent in a more productive manner.",
                "This course had incredibly engaging lectures, hands-on activities, challenging group projects, and was overall extremely well -balanced. I think it could possibly benefit from some more out of class readings and discussions.",
                "I absolutely loved that all of the projects were group projects. It felt much more applicable to real life than many of my classes that are more theoretical. I thought that there could have been more class related group activities throughout the semester as some of the lectures were less engaging due to less participation."

                "Yes! Prof. Gonzalez is very kind and the course is well-organized and you learn a lot in a relatively low-stress environment. However, the two major assignments (midterm and final projects) sneak up on you, so make sure you start them in advance and spend time on them. Guest lectures are by very interesting people too.",
                "Yes\r\nWas one of the best courses I have taken at Yale",
                "Yes, I will highly recommend this class for anyone interested in public health and design thinking.",
                "I would as an easy 5th class, if you're interested in entrepreneurship and creative solutions to issues in low- and middle-income countries. However, it's a very interdisciplinary class, so if you're looking for something that is more technical, this is not it.",
                "Absolutely!! For any global health scholars out there, I would strongly urge you to take this course. It will count toward your elective requirements in the GHS MAP and its a wonderful introduction and hands-on immersive experience into biomedical engineering courses at Yale, even if youre more biology/sociology/history focused in your other courses. Professor Gonzalez makes this course accessible to all students and celebrated differences in academic backgrounds.",
                "Yes, if pre-med or BME, you would love the course.",
                "yes! better if you have previous knowledge in ML and familiar with maths",
                "I would still recommend this class to other students since throughout the course we have great guest lectures and a practical understanding of the biotech world. It also a great opportunity to start creating connections with people in the field.",
                "I loved this course so much. Prof Gonzalez was the coolest and most engaging teacher! The class was a good mix of lectures, speakers, and presentations. We had really cool hands-on activities that promoted creativity and taught us hard skills. There were two group projects, and it was cool to connect with other students over common interests. Having two projects allowed us to build off the feedback of the first to create something more comprehensive. Overall I was very inspired and always looked forward to going to class. The whole class was made up of innovators and eager students, and Prof Gonzalez really tried to get to know each of us and provided fantastic support.",
                "Absolutely! Anyone who is interested in global health and innovation should take this course. It makes you think critically about real-life questions that must be answered when considering how to implement an idea in a resource-limited setting."
