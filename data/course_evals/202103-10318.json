I also learned how important it is to come to class prepared and having done and annotated the readings because days I did the readings were so much more enjoyable than days when I didn't do them or just skimmed them.",

I never felt that I fully understood what a \"guilty pleasure\" is, or perhaps, at least, I just don't have any.\r\nIn addition, and this is totally my fault, but I never had enough time to do the readings before class, so I was never prepared when class started. (Signing up for three separate classes that had weekly p-sets, plus a five-days-a-week language course, was not a good idea.)\r\nI'm still not sure I actually know how to write an essay."

A lot of the readings were also super enlightening which was great. A weakness is that some of the readings were a little old-fashioned and dense so it was hard to really understand them outside of class and come to class prepared. There was also little incentive to really engage with the readings outside of class because there were no reading responses or reading checks.",

                "The materials that we read in and out of class were very strongly related to the theme of the course and helped build an understanding of guilty pleasures as a whole. Some of the materials were difficult to follow and it could be helpful to analyze more."

The teaching fellow, Gabrielle Reid, was very capable and although the discussion in class was sometimes a little slow, when everyone came prepared and engaged we got into some super interesting topics. I also really enjoyed all the papers. The prompts were just broad enough so that I could put my own spin on it, but they were structured in a way that kept me on track and focused. The workload was very reasonable and mostly enjoyable.",

In addition, I don't follow sports, celebrities, pop music, or many of the TV shows discussed in class, so I felt very disconnected from the subject matter. Depending on who this other student is, I may or may not recommend this course."
