                "This course was incredible for teaching how to write about nuanced personal experiences, and has an amazing range of readings that open your eyes to many talented writers and interesting topics.",
                "I gained a deep understanding of how to approach creative writingsomething I haven't studied academically. I also learned how to read with the lens of developing your own skills as a writer, extracting useful strategies and skills from the work of accomplished writers. I learned how to receive and implement edits effectively, and most of all, I learned how to tell stories in a compelling, insightful, believable way.",
                "I learned how to read critically, focusing on a writer's persona, intent, and tone. I also learned how to write more clearly, something I struggled with before. Lastly, I found myself becoming more comfortable speaking and articulating in front of others, as this was a discussion-based class.",
                "I learned about different political views and about personal stories of individuals. I learned more about my aspects of writing and specifically grammar and usage.",
                "I developed my ability to write clearly and concisely while focusing on a particular narrative that has a unique insight to offer.",
                "I feel I finally grew into my own as a writer in this course. Having the opportunity to write about myself and my experiences, as well as people and things I know about was very exciting. Through all of Professor Caplan's detailed feedback, I learned how to show instead of tell and highlight the important aspects of a story. I also feel I really gained a sense of how to write for an audience that \"knows nothing.\"",
                "I became a better writer through editing out excessive phrases and condensing key details. I learned the power of word limit and conciseness in modern writing.",
                "I developed skills in nonfiction creative writing and writing clarity in general. Most of the work was about creating a coherent narrative and storyline that adheres to the overall purpose of writing the specific piece.",
                "I felt like I got significantly better at writing compelling nonfiction. A particular area of difficulty and development was conciseness; the session of this course which I took had a 1500-word limit on each essay, and it forced me to spend a lot of time figuring out which parts of my writing were not serving a helpful purpose so that I could prune them."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Caplan's section of ENGL 120 was easily my favorite class of this semester -- I loved reading the essays by my classmates, and thoroughly enjoyed the discussions about the readings. Definitely for anyone who likes writing and reading talented writers like Jia Tolentino and Lee Chang-Rae, this class is a must-take.\r\n\r\nA potential weakness is that sometimes we were assigned too many readings that were too long to cover in-depth in a single 1 hour 15 minute lesson.",
                "The strengths were the high level of discussion in the classeveryone came to class having done the reading and that allowed great, insightful conversations to take place. Professor Caplan's edits were also always extremely in depth and helpful, and he was always willing to go the extra mile to elevate your first draft to a final draft. I wouldn't say this class has any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Caplan always encouraged students to speak, even making guiding questions for us before class. He is also a very articulate critic, which helped my writing improve over a short amount of time. The readings were always interesting and relevant. The syllabus outlined the due dates for the readings and papers beforehand, so managing my time was easy; there were no surprises in terms of workload. However, the biggest strength of this course for me was the workshops. I not only got peer-reviewed for the first time but also learned how to read critically and articulate my thoughts and feelings in regard to others' writings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of.",
                "Strength: Very interactive, Prof. Caplan is very quick to respond to emails, he is very understandable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the readings would be a bit redundant in terms of content.",
                "This structure of this course greatly helps in making sense of the material, and the readings are always a great selection of essays that inform you on how to approach a particular type of essay, like a personal essay or a profile.",
                "I really loved the format of the class, especially with regards to how our readings directly corresponded with the essays we were writing. The variety among the essays we read was also extremely helpful and enticing to read. I appreciated the level of detail in the feedback we received from our rough drafts. I found that these really helped to focus my essays and allowed me to develop a new degree of analysis when editing and reviewing my own work. I do wish that post-workshop, we would have been able to edit our essays. The workshop advise and critiques made essays seem worthy of an additional edit, especially since those not workshopping were able to use the advise to help their final draft.",
                "The feedbacks from essays were great and detailed, and I learned a lot from our reading. But I wish that the discussion section could be more encouraging, because I was afraid of wasting other peoples time with some obvious commentaries.",
                "strengths: I loved the workshops I felt that it was really nice to evaluate other students' work and get feedback on my own work.",
                "There can be a lot of readings and not too much engagement with them, and at times they don't help you connect with the prompt.",
                "As for strengths, I loved the time we spent workshopping each other's essays. The readings we had assigned were a good length and always very interesting. We were given enough time to think of an idea for, draft, and revise our essays. I liked that we were not graded until our revision. I found this most conducive for improving our writing because we had a chance to take Professor Caplan's feedback on our drafts before being graded. As for weaknesses, I would've loved to have even more workshop time during class rather than most of our class being discussions. I also found it difficult having two units (appreciation and profile) that were so similar and wondered if there was another option to doing both of those.",
                "The variety of different readings is good, and the prompts offer a great deal of leeway both in what you write about and how you write about it, which I found very nice. It allowed me to make essays that I legitimately cared about as pieces of craft, not just to complete an assignment.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the course feels fairly punishing at times. Some of the essay prompts are harder than others (and which ones are which will vary a great deal from person to person); when you run into a difficult one, having only a week to produce a good first draft can be a bit rough."

                "Absolutelythis was my favorite course of the semester and it really challenges you to approach writing in a creative way. You will learn how to interpret your life experiences and share them with other people in wonderful ways. While the writing in this class isn't academic, it absolutely has improved my skills as a writer in ways that are extremely applicable to academic writing.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking to improve their reading and writing skills, regardless of major.",
                "Yes. It is a great way to meet the writing requirement because it is an engaging course that won't really bore you.",
                "This is a great class to take if you are interested in not only improving your writing in general but also developing your ability to construct an effective narrative and a compelling line of reasoning.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The ability to focus on essay writing, like that of newspaper articles and The New Yorker, is great. I not only learned how to be a better writer, but also developed a new perspective when analyzing other's work, beyond the high school \"find the symbols\" reading method.",
                "Yes! Its my first writing class, and I feel like it will be the best writing class Ive ever taken.",
                "Yes I would. I would definitely say that my writing has improved.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As a student who went into the class not super confident about their writing, I felt like I learned and improved a lot, especially because Professor Caplan gave really specific feedback. Having workshops where we read our peers' essays and gave feedback on them was a great learning experience as well, both for our own writing and for just learning about our peers. In addition, our assigned readings and the discussions we had on them were always super interesting (again, coming from someone who isn't huge on English). The workload wasn't bad, although the readings could get long sometimes.",
                "Definitely, if you would like to write compelling nonfiction and want to improve your own craft. If that's not something that particularly interests you for its own sake, then you'll probably still get quite a bit from this course, but may not find it as enjoyable."
