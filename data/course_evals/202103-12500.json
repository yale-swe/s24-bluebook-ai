                "In this course I learned a lot about the way newsrooms operate along with the skills needed to conduct a journalistic interview. I learned how to write a profile, an op-ed, and other various journalistic writing styles that I had not learned in other writing courses at Yale. In addition to this we learned a lot about all forms of news media from magazines and newspapers to social media and the way they change and interact with each other. Of all the courses I have taken here, I feel like I have learned the most useful skills in this course, especially when it comes to media literacy.",
                "I learned how to think more critically about the journalism I consume and sharpened by writing skills.",
                "I learned so much about the news industry, and in a way that made it exciting to learn about. If I was interested in journalism this class would have been even more beneficial, as I felt it almost gave a taste of what deadlines and stories are like in the real world. I truly cant stress enough how much I enjoyed this class and the way it was run.",
                "I leaned lots about the state of the news media and American democracy.",

                "I learned a ton about well, media and democracy! It was amazing to meet and hear from so many industry figures industry Professor Lipman herself.",
                "There was a large focus on news analyses and identifying bias in articles among different sources. In our writings, there was also a large emphasis on organization and grammar.",
                "SO many! Understanding of journalistic ethics and practices, how journalism affects public politics and how public politics impacts journalism, different eras of journalism, how to be a better newsreader, how to analyze and critique news, how to be a better writer, how to confront key issues in journalism today, a better understanding of the mindset of those who don't trust mainstream media (QAnon, Trumpers, etc.), how to solve these issues, and so much more. This has been the most relevant American political science course at Yale hands down. The knowledge is practical, the skills are tangible, and the insights are nuanced and unforgettable."

                "The strengths of this course are mainly in Professor Lipman's vast experience and expertise in the field. Each week had a solid lesson and we often had very interesting guest speakers who provided crucial insight into the things we were learning about. The assignments were well curated and Professor Lipman always provided very detailed feedback which was very helpful in improving my writing. I can't think of anything in this course that could be improved.",
                "The course is great! The assignments strengthened my writing and the readings were interesting and kept me engaged with the class.",
                "Strengths: great professor who is very experienced and well-connected in the field of journalism, interesting guest speakers and class discussions, interactive class activities\r\nWeaknesses: none really, though there were more assignments than in the original syllabus",
                "The professor is fantastic and so cool. I can't stress that enough. The class is fantastic and very cool as well with lots of famous journalists as guest speakers and incredibly interesting and relevant material. I do not think there were many weaknesses. My only suggestion is I would have enjoyed hearing about Professor Lipmans experience as a journalist even more. One of my favorite class days was when she discussed her experience during 9\/11 having been in one of the towers when it was hit and on the Wall Street Journal staff that printed the very next day.",
                "Grading a little unclear and the course is difficult.",
                "- incredible guest speakers (Brian Stelter, Jodi Kantor, Poppy Harlow, etc.)\r\n- manageable workload \r\n- an attentive and thoughtful professor who is invested in the learning and development of her students",
                "No weaknesses! Just take this course, if you can get into it. Professor Lipman's feedback is clear and direct and amazing.",
                "The material is really interesting. All of the readings and weekly topics are very relevant, and the topic of discuss each week is very clear. The readings are always news articles and other primary sources, and so they are often enjoyable and not too heavy. The grading is harsh, and grades were often lower than one would expect relative to other Yale seminars.",
                "Strengths: a truly stellar prof. who CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR EDUCATION!!, relevant readings that aren't overwhelming, amazing guest speakers (Brian Stelter, Jodi Kantor, Monica Drake, Poppy Harlow, (almost) Katie Couric), fun and relevant assignments, dynamic class discussion. Tens across the board.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: basically none. A couple of the assignments did seem a little rushed, but prof. Lipman is undoubtedly going to improve on all levels in her second iteration of the course. Anyone who gets in will have a blast."

Not only do I feel like I learned more in this class than any other class I have taken here, it is by far my favorite class ever taken. Everything that we learned about was extremely relevant, always interesting, and Professor Lipman had a way of providing insight into things that I had never considered. Professor Lipman's connections and ability to have really interesting guest speakers was a plus but even without them I think this class is tremendous.",
                "Definitely! It felt relevant and engaging and every assignment felt purposeful. I learned so much from the professor, my classmates, and the guest speakers.",
                "Yes! Great professor for this topic, and interesting class activities.",
                "100%. One of my favorite and best classes I've taken at Yale. I cannot stress enough how amazing professor Lipman is.",

                "Yes yes yes yes just take this course, provided you can get a seat.",
                "Maybe. The material is really interesting and the readings are often news articles. But, the grading is quite tough. Unless you have experience in journalism or other professional writing settings, you will find the grading to be much harsher than other seminars here. The way papers were graded was often unclear.",
                "YES. YES. YES. This is truly the best course I've taken at Yale so far. You might read this elsewhere, but they don't mean it like I do. Anyone remotely interested in journalism or American politics MUST apply to this course. Your life will be changed. The course is literally the highlight of my Yale career. You'll meet amazing people (both industry professionals, your peers, and of course the instructor). You may even get the chance to inspire a CNN news segment (true story). Some advice when applying: embrace your personal background and the original perspectives you can bring to the classroomstuff like this is even more important than whether or not you've worked for a political campaign or if you report at the YDN. This is a future \"staple\" course at Yale; you are missing out on something special if you don't take it.\r\n\r\nProf. Lipman is the shining star of the course. Her wisdom, insight, curiosity, and passion for this topic is unlike anything else I've encountered at Yale. APPLY TO THIS COURSE IMMEDIATELY."
