Finally, I learned how to discuss these philosophical topics with my classmates.",

I feel like I'm much better at thinking deeply, developing questions, and forming opinions about a practice/approach to life that may be very different than mine, as well as using it as a starting point for reflecting on my own beliefs/traditions. Every unit was so fascinating and eye-opening!!",

                "Strengths: Overall, I liked the different traditions chosen for the class, and that there was a mixture of religious and secular ideas. I liked the lectures by the experts as well. The readings were not overwhelming, and as a result I actually managed to read all of them. I really liked my section leader Deborah, and I liked that the class was a low-stakes environment where we were free to explore the ideas of these traditions without fear of judgment. In my section, we also had a Zoom retreat and check-ins at the beginning of each class to discuss what was going on in our lives. It was nice to get to know my section as people and understand how their personal backgrounds contributed to their beliefs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's just hard to examine each tradition in-depth when we are going through so many! (This can't really be changed). I would personally prefer to read more about how the actual traditions are lived, because this can differ from what holy texts describe. Some of the primary source readings (mostly for Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism) were sort of dense and did not give me a clear picture of how people actually practice those traditions today.",
                "There are too many strengths to list, honestly. This class was one of the most comfortable academic spaces I've been in, had incredible vibes, I learned so much, grew so much, and could feel/see the impact it had on my life and my thinking. However, I do think the beauty of this experience was a result of having a really strong class and instructor! Everyone was always engaged, open minded, friendly, and Deborah did an incredible job facilitating discussions and teaching us.",
                "strengths - very welcoming environment.  The class discussions felt extremely comfortable and vulnerable -- I knew I could be honest and open in these seminars. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none...Being over zoom wasn't ideal so I'm excited for other students to get to take this in person!",
                "LOVED the readings, guest lectures, welcoming/supportive nature of the course",
                "DEBORAH IS AMAZING!!!!! My whole\r\nclass got to bond a ton and it was a very rewarding experience, even on Zoom.",
                "This class would have been better if it was in person .",
                "Strengths: the discussion format really allowed for us to taking meaningful lessons away from the readings. The biggest strength is the discussions you are able to have with your classmates. The environment of the class was super open and welcoming and allowed you to be vulnerable and honest, though this may vary from section to section. The papers also allowed for a lot of flexibility in my opinion and pertained to topics that affect our daily lives.",
                "Strengths: diverse array of information; open and welcoming class environment \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: learning about religions out of context and without the full picture led to confusion and incomplete understanding",
                "I loved the scope of content, and the discussion format. I think this course could be improved by having at least one reading be a clear (textbook-esque) background of the tradition being discussed. Some of the primary sources were difficult to understand without enough context about the tradition first!"

This class probably won't entirely change the way you view the world, but it does force you to actually examine and articulate what you think, which is great.",

Overall, the workload is not bad, the readings are super interesting and I genuinely felt that my discussion leader cared about me and my classmates.",
