We examined almost the entire Critique, from Kant's Introduction, Transcendental Aesthetic\/Deduction, Analogies of Experience, and the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements (Paralogisms, Antinomies, etc.). We explored in great detail the Supreme Principle and conditioning relations in Kant.",

Professor Watkins' explanation of the Critique was so helpful; especially by the end of the course, I felt as though I was really beginning to understand Kant (as well as anyone can). I'm so happy to have taken this course--Professor Watkins provided the guidance that anyone wanting to study Kant desperately needs. I will also add that Prof. Watkins really conveyed his enthusiasm for Kant, and it was difficult not to be super excited about Kant like him!",

Unfortunately due to time, we didn't get to discuss some of the most interesting implications of Kant's philosophy"

                "Yes. Kant's transcendental idealism changes your whole view of how metaphysics and epistemology can be done, and especially if you don't have a lot of knowledge of the history of philosophy, it gives you a really good sense of the major debates and approaches of philosophers in Kant's time. As well, learning metaphysics and epistemology as part of Kant's system, as opposed to in a contemporary class, is often more satisfying, because it tries to give you an explanation for everything that you've wondered about and not just a particular narrow or specific question."
