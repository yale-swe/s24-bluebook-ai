                "how trans studies works as a discipline",
                "I learned about the history of trans people through narratives centering on an individual person. All histories were from the pre-modern era. I learned a lot more about what it means to be trans, and ways of gender expression. We also covered some theory. This class was really eye-opening.",
                "HIST 418J introduced me to a brand new way of thinking about the past. Thinking about gender in the historical sense became not only a way to conceive of the individuals we studied but a way to think of human action more broadly. Due to the limited scholarship in the field, we were forced to think creatively and synthesize a number of other theoretical frameworks.",
                "Above all else, above learning about some fascinating corners of history I wouldn't have otherwise, above getting me more in tune with the state of contemporary queer thought, this course deepened my understanding of how empathy and creativity enter into rigorous, systematic academic thought, and in bridging those two worlds massively improved my skills in both.",
                "I discovered a new way to look at history, away from the usual cis- and heteronormative history, and learned to be more critical of historical narratives that we are given.",
                "Great course that seeks to understand history through a trans/non-binary lens. Many of the readings analyse gender-fluid/gender non-conforming/trans individuals through a cis lens, but the active reinterpretation of the readings during class helps to dispel contemporary myths about the existence of trans+ folks.",
                "This class was phenomenal, and offered an interdisciplinary dive into pre-modern experiences of gender and deviance. We learned about religious saints & texts, nuanced historical figures, how to read 'gender deviance', and the trickiness of engaging with queer history. We also connected these conversations about the pre-modern world to contemporary debates on gender and queerness. Overall, much of the learning is really centered on primary and secondary readings about these pre-modern figures that were gender deviant in some (or all) ways, and were highly relevant to all modern conversations about gender!",
                "i learned how to think through theory much better in an intimidating way which has helped with other subjects as well. I also learned a lot about queer histories! and history through a trans lens. We got to see how cisgender expectations of bodies have changed yet maintained a type of rigidity."

                "strengths - great discussions, great professor\r\nweaknesses - i think the readings in the second half of the course could be more diverse; instead of i think 3 weeks or more on christianity, there are defenitely african and asian stories of gender expression (in animism and buddhism, etc.) and we didn't look at any of them",
                "Strengths: The readings were really great, and I enjoyed the assignments we had and how they were spaced out. I liked that we were given creative freedom for our final project. Igor has really great insights as a professor, which I liked as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think our discussions could have been better. Maybe it was the dynamic of the class, but sometimes we would be engaged, but other times it felt like a small lecture.",
                "I think the course would benefit if it were taught bi-weekly for shorter times periods rather than once a week.",
                "The course was well-structured and engagingly taught, with a good blend of lecture- and discussion-style material. The only thing that I might have changed about it was that I would have preferred two hour-long meetings instead of a two-hour session, as I always felt my focus lagging at the end of class through no fault of anyones. It would also break up the readings and give more time between classes to meditate on one subject in the wake of conversation, which I would guess would improve engagement.",
                "The course offers a novel look at history through a trans lens, so the main strength of the class is its originality. The curriculum takes the student to multiple time periods and locales, and finds trans representation in unlikely places. There is always something new every week, so I was thoroughly engaged with the class throughout the entire semester.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class is the midterm exam. I believe everyone scored well for it, but I'm not quite sure what was the point of it since rote memorization from the provided study guide was sufficient for full marks. If the professor wishes to reinforce understanding of the texts and encourage critical thought, it would be better to assign another essay instead, with prompts relating to the texts seen in class.",
                "Most of the readings will focus on historical European records of transfolk. Readings on transfeminine individuals are much fewer than records of transmasculine people, due to the inherent nature of male bias within historical records.",
                "The course was really strong because of Igor and his depth of knowledge on the topic. So many of the readings and figures were completely new to me, but Igor was really an expert at guiding the conversation to a generative and thought-provoking place. I think it is a class that is easy to engage with, regardless of background knowledge. The pacing of the writing assignments was also really a strength for me.",
                "very interesting readings and De Souza is a wonderful professor. the midterm wasn't intimidating and the creative option for the final wasn't stressful and was fun to do as well"

If you enjoy taking a fresh perspective on history, you will definitely enjoy this class. It is a decent amount of reading though, so be prepared for that, but the assignments throughout the semester are few and enjoyable.",
                "Of course. Even if the student is not interested in the specific subject, the practice of this field--the methods of strict scrutiny and reassessment--are applicable to all courses of study.",
                "If a student were interested in the subject, I'd have nothing but good things to say.",
                "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in history and/or gender studies. It offers a fresh perspective on history and opens up a new avenue for trans narratives. Students doing religious studies classes can also find value in this course, as there is extensive discussion of Judaism and Christianity. The material is engaging, and the workload is very manageable as long as consistent effort is put into the weekly readings.",
                "Yes. This course is important in how it fosters academic discussions on transfolk and their place in the world. It is also very timely of this course to be offered in a contemporary moment where great amounts of attention are being placed on transpeople. To build up the future, it is helpful to look into the past and recognise the work that has been done by previous scholars.",
                "I would recommend this course, whether you're a WGSS major or not! The readings are accessible and interesting, and Igor is super well-equipped to guide the conversation in an engaging way. I think everyone had such interesting points and the space was really welcoming! If you're interested, you should absolutely give it a go.",
                "yes! sometimes there are some big ideas that you really need to think through which are a bit difficult, but the discussions are great and after the big ideas are down, you're able to keep up."
