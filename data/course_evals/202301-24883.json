                "I learned how to truly take the environment around me and let that inspire my interpretation and presentation of myself as well what is going on around me and the small details and beauty in the world around around me. Professor Irene helped to foster an environment that felt like a truly safe place to create new ways to understand myself, my art, those around me, and the environments around me.",

                "The strengths of this course are the facts that it is a very emotional and deep connecting class that really requires that you give yourself to the teachings, and it is quite immersive which is lovely. Its other strength is the professor because she fostered the perfect balance of work as well as caring compromise that made the class engaging but not overly stressful.",

                "Absolutely!! If you're looking for a chill three hours of movement per week, this is the course for you. It flexes totally different muscles than most other Yale courses. A creative and kinesthetic mode of learning!",
                "I would suggest this course to other students because it fosters a great community, but it also really does help you to develop a new point of view if you really immerse yourself and engage with the guests and choreography. There are a lot of readings and videos to watch though, so be aware of that, though your level of engagement with that is pretty much up to you.",
                "Yes! Great class to explore movement within the body and how external features (architecture, sound, thought) affect it."
