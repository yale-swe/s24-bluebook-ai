                "This course needs extreme improvement should it provide any value to student learning. Every class, we would sit and watch the instructor perform an experiment for the first 1-2 hours and wait until he could help us through the dissection or set-up as nearly every week, we required instructor help. This was made worse by the TAs who often had no idea how to help and would just wait until the instructor could help. Labs should be pre-set and ready to go when students arrive instead of them having to wait during their lab time. The lab was not a good use of my time. Furthermore, there were no objectives or learning goals of the lab. It often was an exploratory lab to see what results you could find, and then TAs would harshly grade any and all data you could get, often saying 'not enough data' for labs where we literally could not get the equipment working to get even a single source of data. The inconsistent grading had all students extremely worried. The course needs to have explicit learning goals and procedure every lab, the dissections and materials should be prepared and ready to go when students arrive, and the TAs need to be trained and be able to actually assist students and taught how to grade. Taking this course concurrently with the lecture, was one of the worst courses I have had to take at Yale.",
                "This course could be improved if the instructors put any effort into preparing for the lab.",
                "The content was interesting and it wasn't too difficult. Haig says that you don't need to be good at dissections/microsurgery to do well in the lab, but in the end, a lot of people weren't able to complete the dissection successfully, so they had to borrow other groups' data. There were also a few days when we had to sit there for 1-2 hours while Haig and the TAs prepared the lab for us.",
                "each experiment was very easy to follow and the manual was very helpful. I would appreciate it more if we had some more guidance with what we were asked to write in the lab report afterwards.",
                "There is so much troubleshooting involved during lab that we rarely have time to collect all of the data expected from us",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot of concepts and got to explore many techniques used in the field of neuroscience. I was fascinated by some of the experiments we got to do, and when the experiments worked, it was incredible to see some oof the neurological principles. The lab manual is well written in the concepts explored. \r\nWeaknesses: The course can be a bit disorganized. The lab notebooks we have to hand in is a bit unclear as to what is expected with the points taken off seemingly at the discretion of the TF. For the commentary we have to write, we were told to write so that it shows we thought about our data. The vague instructions can be quite frustrating. For some groups, the data that was collected relied on the quality of the oscilloscope and the dissection, which meant some groups couldn't get data if their oscilloscope was not very functional. Of course, Prof. Keshishian asked us for oscilloscope graphs to put on Canvas, but the timing of that can get disorganized.",
                "The class was great and the concepts were fun to attack, but the equipment never worked.",
                "We need smaller class sizes, it felt like we were waiting for help from Professor Keshishian a lot of the time because sometimes the TAs couldnt figure out how to fix our equipment or setup, and the professor was busy helping other students - This could be remedied by having smaller class sizes so that there would be a higher TAs/professor:student ratio",
                "There are many ways in which this class could have been improved, the most important being the amount of wait time before we started the lab. We consistently had to wait 2-3 hours or even longer of the 4 hour period before actually beginning to collect data. This could have easily been avoided. For instance, we had 4 weeks of frog leg dissection experiments, and for 3 of them the frogs were not killed in advance of us getting there, so we just had to sit waiting for 30 minutes doing nothing while they were killed. This lack of preparation was a consistent theme for the class. Another issue was that despite such long demos we were not given sufficient instruction so as to be able to complete the labs on our own. Almost every week involved doing something under the microscope and Prof. Keshishian would attempt to do a demo under the microscope but the way that the camera was set up he would have to turn it off to actually do the dissection, leaving us sitting for 45 minutes staring at a black screen and not knowing how to do the dissection. When it came time to doing the labs ourselves Prof. Keshishian would attempt to come around the room and help, but usually less than half of the class would get the help they needed before time ran out leaving many people with no data. Overall, this class did not seem well organized. There was so much sitting around and waiting and very little learning happening.",
                "This course was very interesting and there was a lot of material to learn. At times it felt it was a bit unorganized and expectations were not entirely clear. But we did some complicated labs, so it makes sense they did not work all the time. However by the end of lab we usually got the hang of it and it worked out."

                "Do NOT take this lab. There are other options to fulfill the lab credit for the NSCI major and they surely must be less painful. I learned nothing from this class except how to properly commiserate with fellow classmates. I've never had a class that I dreaded going to so much because I knew that when I left SCL I would be in a horrible mood. The instructors were never prepared when you came into lab, and so you often would waste hours of your life just sitting there while the professor and TAs killed frogs or sedated flies. None of the equipment worked properly which wasted even more time when you realized that you needed a new oscilloscope or the battery in the amplifier was dead. \r\n\r\nThe TAs had no idea what was going on and Prof Keshishian gave help to only some students. He never stopped by my lab station once throughout the entire semester even though I asked him to do so multiple times. He did not seem very engaged in the course whatsoever and was often late or stepped out early. Since none of the equipment worked well, Prof Keshishian would often spend time fixing it rather than answering our questions or helping with the lab itself.\r\n\r\nProf Sukhanova was even worse. I honestly didn't even know she was a professor until halfway through the course because she would answer questions incorrectly and didn't know how to do some of the dissections. She didn't speak English very well and didn't understand it either so you would ask a question and she would answer something completely different. She once wrote the quiz that we had to take and it was clear that no one looked it over because some of the questions made no sense, which is not very fair when it's a part of our grade! She was very rude and would get mad at you if you weren't performing the dissections properly even though Prof Keshishian said multiple times that doing perfect dissections was not the point of the course and it was more important what we did with them. Even though she didn't really speak English she still managed to make multiple racist comments to my lab partner. \r\n\r\nThe expectations for the work was absurd - you would get points off on the quiz for the most meaningless things and you would get points off on the lab notebook if you didn't complete every task listed in the lab manual even if it was physically impossible to do so because your equipment was broken or you didn't have the time to do so after the three hours of preparation.",
                "Lab courses are always tough because they're so long and only half a credit. At least this lab was not very much work outside of lab. The quizzes are easy (usually) and the lab reports have absolutely zero structure/guidelines.",
                "I would definitely recommend it but I would also suggest to not let the reports until last minute",
                "In theory, this lab is super cool and you do really awesome things, but in practice most weeks you are sitting around waiting for Dr. Keshishian to help fix your oscilloscope or something else. It would be very productive to have the TFs really understand the procedures and equipment beforehand so that they can help more.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are really interested in neuroscience. The experiments were really cool as we got to work with different organisms and measure the potentials from the neurons of these organisms. However, the class is a bit unorganized and unclear as to what is expected. It gets really frustrating at times when the class is confused about what to do or what is expected. Sometimes, no data is collected on a certain day because something goes wrong. I ultimately learned a lot of concepts from the course but think that certain aspects of the course made it difficult to get through.",
                "Sure, if you like neurobiology or need a biology lab credit.",
                "Do not take this class. Take any other lab. This lab was a waste of 4 hours every Tuesday. As someone who is premed I have taken 7 lab classes in my time at Yale, and this was by far the worst one. Every week it seemed like there had been no prior preparation before the lab so we had to waste time just waiting for the TAs and Prof. Keshishian to set up the lab. For instance we had 4 weeks of frog leg dissection labs and for 3 of the weeks we had to sit waiting for 30 minutes while the professor killed the frogs to give us the legs. This could have easily been done before we got there so as to not waste that time. For the demos themselves most were done under a microscope, but the way the camera was set up you could not look through the microscope while the camera was projecting, so Prof. Keshishian would turn off the camera and do the dissections and whatnot without us being able to see what was going on. We would stare at a black screen for 45 minutes and then be expected to know how to do the dissection. Then nobody would know what to do during the actual dissection and the Prof. would have to come around and help each individual group. He would usually get through less than half of the groups before the time ran out. The demos and set up time before we started actually collecting data were consistently over 2 hours and sometimes even lasted longer than 3 hours. Much of that time was just sitting and waiting, not even being taught anything. Due to this frequently over half the class would not have collected the data they needed to by the end of the class period but we would still need that data in the lab reports. Overall, I would recommend taking any other lab class to avoid this one.",
