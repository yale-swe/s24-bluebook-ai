The course is very hands-on, and I learned not only about the features of different sounds in language, but also how to produce those sounds myself! I also appreciated that we learned how to analyze sounds for ourselves, such as by using Praat."

                "Strengths: I really loved this class, and its hands-on elements made it super engaging. Pronouncing unfamiliar sounds is hard, but you feel a lot of pride when you finally get it. I also thought the lectures were really, really good. Professor Shaw makes great slides, and I appreciated having access to them later to review.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I struggle to think of any. Perhaps a little more guidance on the final project would have been helpful, by including a model student example in addition to the official IPA Illustration examples; the requirements between the two were a little different so I was unsure if I was doing too much or too little in some sections.",
                "You get real-world experience transcribing speech through the listening quizzes and guest speakers. By the end of this course you will know the IPA (both transcribing and reading), relevant theories in phonetics, how we produce the miracle of speech, and you will think of your mouth and vocal tract as a much bigger and more incredible space than before. Seriously, if you like languages or are at all interested in phonetics, this course can't be beat. The only weakness I can think of is that the learning curve is very steepbut once you tackle it, the course is so worth it!!"

                "Yes!! If you're a linguistics major, you should take this class, and I'm honestly surprised it isn't required; it adds so much context for subjects like phonology and just for having a deeper understanding of language in general. If you're not a linguistics major, you should skim the syllabus and see if it looks interesting to you; if you're not sure, I'd recommend at least shopping it. It's a really fun subject, and once you learn about it, you see it applied everywhere.",
                "Yes. This class is one of the best i've taken at Yale, truly life changing. If you are at all interested in speech production or languages, take this course!!!"
