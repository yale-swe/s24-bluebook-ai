Love the virtual format of the class.\r\nWeaknesses - You have to be proactive in staying on top of the content and not allowing it to pile up. Some of the content is not easy. The ULAs were the main weakness of the course - they kept cancelling their office hours and this made it hard to seek help. More stringent rules is required on this front.",
