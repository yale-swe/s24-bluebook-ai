            "comments": [
                "The strength is definitely Professor Valis. She cares so deeply about this class, this literature, and her students. I learned so much from her insights and the questions she asked us. I think one of the weaknesses is the fact that there is quite an uneven workload throughout the semester. In the beginning of the semester, we were reading very short poems, but then towards the middle, there were some weeks we were reading an entire novel. Also, at the end of the semester, the final homework was due directly after Thanksgiving break and the big final paper was due 1.5 weeks later. There just was not enough time to dedicate to each.",
                "Strengths: Professor Valis is BRILLIANT; she knows so much and clearly loves the subject matter. You get a pretty diverse smattering of genres which is fun, and you have plenty of opportunities to improve your Spanish writing. Weaknesses: the conversation was often dry and Professor Valis had to take the driver's seat (which she always did happily and gracefully!). We also read so much that it was hard for me to keep up as someone who is still learning the language.",
                "Professor Noel Valis is a clear strength of this course. She facilitated constant, enriching discussion. Often we would discuss literary works at a very high level, and I feel like we could have delved more into the writing style and analyzed individual scenes more.",
                "A strength of this course is the thought-provoking discussions that took place throughout our analyses of the texts; these discussions were facilitated through instructor and student engagement.",
                "I think that the syllabus was very well-designed and told a connected story throughout the course, with many of the texts building upon each other. I also appreciated the amount of context that we were given in our seminars about the writers we studied, I think that it really added to the discussion and reading experience. I will say that the class was slightly too large for the seminar format to work perfectly in terms of having a discussion that everyone could take part in.",
                "The main strength is Professor Valis. She will make sure that every student is heard and even if the student has a hard time expressing themselves, she is willing to help them out develop their thoughts. She is extremely understanding of any issues and willing to work said issues out with the student. She has very detailed feedback on essays that help students become better writers in Spanish. I would say that there are also a few weaknesses. There aren't many activities that engage the class, and many times, it affects the mood of the class, especially close to midterms. Many students feel no excitement for the class and only let a few people answer the questions that Professor Valis asks. I think that mainly it will change by group how exciting each class is, but I think that to prevent this from happening, there could be hands-on activities to motivate the students, other than feeling like they're just being lectured on something they already read.",
                "The topics were very interesting, although I wish wed spent more time on certain readings.",
                "Strengths: the choices for the readings were incredible. We touched many topics and many eras\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the structure of each class was rather loose",
                "The selected reading were excellent, and I always felt that the professor was highly knowledgable about the subject.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course is the low participation of students, which made in class discussion difficult. Participation was highest on student presentation days, so more of those could help address this issue, or more cold-calling.",
                "Awesome readings but the professor could have involved the class more in discussions.",
                "strengths: the reading and Professor Valis' discussions; could be improved with more specific feedback on essays",
                "The course was great in that it gave an in-depth look at a number of different works and writers without being too overwhelming. The workload was manageable and well-spaced and provided a helpful supplement to our in-class content. My only suggestion would be to add a bit more structure and variety to the class discussions - this could involve small group discussions, live readings (by students) of poems, etc.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfe. Valis is kind and easy to talk to, and the class discussions are engaging. She always listens for new viewpoints and considers what everyone says. The essays were short and a joy to write. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe midterm felt a bit forced (part of it was identifying authors and works), but it wasn't bad. Some of the book selections were a bit slower than others, but in all, the works that we read were great.",
                "Very organized, but maybe too large of a class to facilitate conversation between all students. Great texts and professor."

DO NOT TAKE IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE A BOOK A WEEK. If you do love Spanish lit though, you very well might find a happy home in this classroom :)",
                "Yes, you engage with the Spanish Civil War, metafiction, prominent women writers and poets of Spain, and the workload is low.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to become introduced with texts from the Spanish-speaking world. This course is also great for those looking to strengthen their writing skills in Spanish, as the essays are not too demanding and there is creative freedom.",
                "Yes, I would  I think that it was a great survey course of Spanish literature, with enough focus to not feel overwhelming. I feel that I learned a lot about the position of Spanish women in the arts and society in general throughout history, and I really did enjoy the texts we discussed.",
                "Yes, if they are willing to put in the work. I think the class has great potential, but a lot of it comes from the students. Some of the readings get complicated and you may think that you have the answer, but get ready to realize you were wrong when you get to class.",
                "Yes its a great L5 class!",
                "I would recommend any of Dr. Valis courses. She is very passionate about both the Spanish language and literature, and this is communicated well in her teaching.",
                "Yes, if they want a greater understanding of the feminist authors role in Spanish society all throughout history.",
                "I would recommend this course for the readings and the professor's expertise, but would warn a peer that discussion in this class had been slow in the past.",
                "Yes, especially if they have experience with the prof",
                "Yes! The readings and discussions are all interesting",
                "This course is great for upper-level Spanish students with a passion for literature. If you are a first-year or are looking to improve your grammar and speaking abilities in Spanish, I would suggest looking at 200-level courses because this course requires a lot more prior knowledge than it indicates.",
                "Absolutely, if they like literature classes and want to focus on European women's history for a semester.",
                "Yes! The readings are interesting and diverse, yet they work well together. Professor Valis loves to hear student opinions and is great at facilitating conversation."
