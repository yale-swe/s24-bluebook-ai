                "I found 267 to be a really helpful overview of paleoanthropology  both what we know and how the field operates. It was as much theory-of-knowledge (as in, \"how do we know what we know?\") as it was anthropology, and looking back I think that was rewarding.",
                "I learned a great deal about the fossil record and the current state of paleoanthropology. I learned about the classification system for ancestral hominin and what evidence we have that each existed. I learned about the anatomical differences between us and these ancient hominin as well as what cultural materials each was known to use. I learned about when each type of stone tool was discovered and which hominin were likely responsible for them. I learned about different dating methods for paleontology and their limitations. I learned about why it is so difficult to reconstruct our ancestral lineage, and why there is a so called \"missing link\". I also learned about the subjectivity of science. I think that lesson brought me some of the biggest insights because, as a scientist, I put a lot of weight on quantitative, objective data. This course taught me that it's really the interpretation of this data that matters to the outside world. Wrong interpretations from influential figures can cause a great deal of misinformation and can really hurt a fields overall image to the public.",
                "I learned a lot about human evolution and was able to squash a lot of my misconceptions about the field! We also got to do a lot of analyzing and putting ourselves in a paleoanthropologist's shoes.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of conducting paleoanthropological research as well as the current state of affairs of human evolution discoveries.",
                "I learned so much about human evolutionary history, and it was so interesting! I learned about different ways to do archaeological research. I learned about different specimens that help shape the fossil record. Sections were also interesting and gave us a very hands-on way of learning about the material in class.",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of human evolution, the human body, and history.",
                "We learned about techniques and concepts in paleoanthropology generally, such as how fossils & artifacts are dated, the importance of environmental context in building interpretations from hard fossil evidence, and the differing interpretations that can be obtained from the same data, as well as more specific knowledge about the evolutionary history of hominins."

                "I enjoyed this class because it was basically ANTH 116, just slightly more in-depth. We got to hear a lot of Dr. Thompson's stories doing fieldwork, which was incredibly interesting. However, if you've already taken 116 you might find some of it repetitive, which could be good if you wanted to take a lighter load.",
                "Extremely good professor - workload is a lot at times, but manageable if done in advance. Class is probably the most well-organized I have ever taken, professor puts a lot of effort into making high-quality assignments with guidelines VERY clearly written out. \r\n\r\nSection assignments are way too long though - please cut down on them. They are more often than not homework assignments, and most of the class felt lost at times with very little guidance from the TA.",
                "The class taught so much and the information was fascinating. Professor Thompson was really great and it was clear she was passionate about her work and educating us about it. She was a very big strength of the course. The biggest weakness overall was the time commitment this class had. Professor Thompson said she significantly decreased the workload for this semester but it was still a lot of work. It also felt like a lot because there were so many types of assignments- preparation and posting article summaries on canvas for three different debates, five different take-home assignments that each took several hours, two news article summaries AND a canvas post for each, all on top of weekly section assignments that would take at least a couple hours outside of section to complete. Honestly it felt like there should have been a lab component to this class just for the section assignments (sections were actually done in the paleo/anatomy lab too). There was a lot of work and I feel like it was more than most classic stem classes I've taken at Yale. I will say though, to defend the course, it was super nice not having any actual tests! As a student with test anxiety this class showed me that it really is possible to learn just as much, if not more, without tests. This is a lesson I will carry with me and advocate for in the future.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Prof. Thompson is INCREDIBLY approachable and passionate about work. She is very gracious and understanding and puts a lot of thought into what we do/discuss as a class\r\n- Lots of assignments mean we had lots of chances to engage with material and that one thing wouldn't make or break us\r\n- Really fair graders too- they understand this isn't our area of expertise and are genuinely interested in our thoughts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Section was a MESS. It was obvious that it should have been coded as a lab because there was not one week where we left on time and finished the section assignment during the allotted time. They usually gave us incredibly complex assignments (think giving us 150+ tiny pieces of paper with things like discoveries, tools, and locations on them and asking us to match them in less than 30-40 minutes. always a nightmare and us and our TA always ended up scrambling for time)\r\n- The amount of small assignments REALLY adds up. With news summaries, section assignments (we always had to put in 1-2 extra hours to finish these outside of section), debate prep, and take home assignments, it just stacked up to be stressful at times. Sometimes we'd have like 3-4 single assignments due over the course of several classes which was stressful. They weren't individually difficult but the volume and timing made them basically endless. On this note though, they are NOT impossible. The grading is SUPER fair",
                "Great class overall, though I think that it really should be made clearer that this is a class for people who want to be anthropologists, and seemingly not so much for the casual interested observer. Many of the assignments seemed hyper-specific to relatively uninteresting parts of the field, like budgeting and itineraries. Though of course these are very important skills for an anthropologist to have, they do not fall under the category of human evolution so much as they do field anthropology. I wish there had been more focus on human evolution and less on what it's like to be an anthropologist. Though take this with a grain of salt, as I am not an anthropology major.",
                "The topic is interesting, but the assignments are tedious and not especially well suited to encouraging student learning.",
                "The strengths of this course were the interactive assignments given by Dr. Thompson.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were the section assignments. As helpful as they were, they were often too detailed to be performed in the limited time we had in the lab. A shortened assignment or more time in the lab would've amended this issue.",
                "I think the entire class was taught very well, and it was very clear that Professor Thompson was very passionate about this topic. She would incorporate fun stories about her own experiences and other people's experiences as paleoanthropologists. She was very clear in her lecturing and had great energy. One weakness is that the sections could be a little overloaded at times, and it would be a little difficult to finish the assignment within 50 minutes, but overall sections were a good time.",
                "This is a great course. The material was incredibly interesting to learn and was structured progressively such that we first learned about paleoanthropological techniques and information generally and were able to apply that knowledge to more in depth discussions about specific topics later in the semester. The course is very hands-on and the assignments \"force\" you apply what you're learning in class, so as long as you are doing the work with your best effort you will succeed and learn a lot! Professor Thompson is incredibly kind and she was always happy to help. The only way I think the course could be improved is if it were split up into two semesters (though I don't know if that is feasible), as there seemed to be some information presented that we weren't able to cover in depth."

                "As an E&EB major, I found it fairly boring. but others in the class without extensive bio background enjoyed it I think",
                "Yes - Dr. Thompson is very good at what she does, and really puts a lot of effort into making sure her students succeed. If you are an anthro or archaeology major, would highly recommend you taking this course - if not, it's a very fairly graded course and extremely plausible to do well, but the workload is a lot. be prepared to work hard.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to another student but I would preface it with understanding that it will be a lot of work. It's a good class to Credit D if you're comfortable with that because the intellectual aspect is fascinating, but the workload is exhausting.",
                "I would recommend this if you are interested in the material and can handle a small continuous assignment-load (small essays, packets, preparation for debates, etc).\r\n\r\nIf you think anthropology and human evolution is boring then this might not be the class for you. It's easy to get disengaged and just work to the deadlines.",
                "If that student is interested in developing an intense understanding of the basics in paleoanthropology I would absolutely recommend this course.",
                "Yes!!!! 100% I never expected to enjoy this class as much as I did. I thought the content was so interesting. At times, the workload could be a bit high as there were five take-home assignments, which could be tedious, as well as section assignments, but everything assignment was straightforward and interesting. Everything is also graded really fairly and generously! The assignments also helped with material retention, so I ended up learning more from this class than any of my other classes without putting in extra amounts of work.",
                "Absolutely! This course was incredible. The workload was quite a bit higher than I had anticipated, however all of the assignments were interesting to complete and they force you learn a lot. Professor Thompson is also a really great instructor, I would really recommend any course with her! If you are interested in the material, this course will be great for you."
