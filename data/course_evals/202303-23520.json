Don't expect to have conclusions drawn for you or go into a huge amount of depth on any subject, but a lot of information is presented to you and it is up to you to take from it and learn what you want to learn. This is often in the form of statistics and graphs that present interesting and important information on energy and climate in today's world.",

Both of them had the class working together, researching deep into topics, and engaging with each other in class. Otherwise, the classes sometimes ended up just being 1 hour 50 min lectures.",

Oristaglio also cares about the subject a lot and knows a great deal. Weaknesses: It is hard to have a true seminar with the number of people who were in the class this semester, so it was more of a lecture course presented as a seminar and with group projects.",

Communication on details of assignments, or more accurately, any questions about them, were not clear.",
