                "I learned how to identify good papers from bad ones (in other courses we usually only read the good ones).  And that is really a valuable lesson. And the final grant really makes me feel that I am a researcher",
                "I developed the skills to read scientific literature at a higher level. I also learned how to properly criticize a piece of scientific literature.",
                "Before taking this class I had no idea how to effectively and efficiently read a scientific paper, understand its methods, and make a judgement about its conclusions based on the data presented. This class will truly teach you how to read papers in a critical manner and is unlike any other course at Yale. It was a huge challenge for myself, personally, as I was very new to many of the methods and cell biology-related background information, but if you have a chance to take it I would highly, highly recommend! You'll learn so much about many different cell signaling pathways, how to quickly read papers and takeaway the main ideas from each figure, as well as how to present on a scientific topic. Of course, the pinnacle of this course is the final grant proposal - you'll definitely learn how to struggle and grapple with the background research and legwork involved in proposing experiments and strategies.",
                "Learned about several pathways in cell biology and their intersections and applications to diseases/processes.\r\n\r\nLearned how to evaluate the merits of research papers and how to think like an editor of a cell biology journal.",
                "I learned how to read and be critical of research papers, as well as techniques in cell bio/what makes a good experiment. Also learned a lot about signaling pathways that I had only briefly learned about in my previous courses.",
                "youll learn how to read scientific papers more efficiently and critically, which has been super helpful for me in all other classes and in lab. by learning how to evaluate the actual science and methods behind papers, you will gain an invaluable understanding about research academia",
                "I am so much better at reading journals now. And I know scientific techniques and methods so much better!",
                "I developed a firm grasp of how to read technical scientific papers. Also, we deeply analyzed many signaling pathways down to the molecular mechanisms of how one protein interacts with another."

                "Strengths were definitely the interesting but specialized content and the small and engaging setting. The weaknesses were the stressful socratic environment (Crews cold calls people to explain parts of papers) and the hefty final report, which are not for the faint of heart. However, these are a part of the course and changing them would take something away that makes this course special.",
                "The course is so nicely structured that I cannot think of any weakness",
                "The small class size definitely benefited this course.",
                "Strengths: The cold-calling system ensures fair and random participation, and really kept me accountable in reading all the papers. I also think Dr. Crews is an amazing professor who encouraged us to make judgements of papers ourselves instead of offering his opinion upfront and influencing our opinions. He is also a fantastic lecturer and has the best anecdotes, and I loved learning about the biotech company development process.\r\n\r\nCons: The grant-writing could have been better supported, perhaps with the opportunity for peer reviews and more feedback. Dr. Crews kindly offered time outside of class to meet and go over the grant, but sometimes it could be difficult to coordinate these sessions.",
                "the cold calling system is excellent because it prompts everyone to be extremely prepared for discussion in class - sometimes discussion of readings in other classes are awkward because not everyone has done the readings",
                "The prof is great and the course format is great! The workload is manageable and intellectually stimulating. Everyone gets a chance to discuss making it a very interactive seminar.",
                "Strength: I now know about so many signaling pathways and experimental techniques. I really feel like this class dramatically improved me as a scientist. I was shaky coming in and was so happy that my whole class and Professor Crews worked together to diagnose the harder papers.\r\nWeakness: really none but there are a few assignments so they are a large part of your grade which can be stressful and a long paper at the end which you should start early. The cold calling in class was scary but i think it benefited the engagement of the class overall"
