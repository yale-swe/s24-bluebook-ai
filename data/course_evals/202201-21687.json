                "So much knowledge wow! Literally had no clue about how central banks worked, what crypto was, how inflation and interest rates were related, what was responsible for diff GDP's of different countries.. so much good stuff.",
                "I learned far more from this course than I thought I would I took AP Macroeconomics in high school, and at first wondered if I should take intermediate macroeconomics instead. I very soon realized that this course would teach me these same things at a far greater depth, and that these are concepts I genuinely want to have a deep understanding of. The ways this course diverged from econ 116 balance sheets, IS/MP curves were also the concepts I thought were most interesting.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Seminar format was very engaging, teacher explained topics well and held suitable OH and review sessions, psets were helpful\r\nWeaknesses - 9am classes are tough, professor sometimes talked fast (but often corrected for it), pacing of lectures, would prefer 2 midterms and a final versus 1 midterm, project, and final",
                "The strongest part of this class is that Prof. Hawkns clearly cares a lot about his students and he's very passionate about teaching macroeconomics. That said, this class has a lot of room for improvement. For one thing, the class moved incredibly slowly, largely because we got incredibly bogged down by questions - it's great that people are able to ask questions, but there was never a sense of urgency in the class and we quickly fell behind, resulting in us just not doing various topics that were covered in ECON 116. I also think the format of the class could be improved: the post-class practice worksheets are really excellent, but the pre-class prep assignments didn't really contribute anything to the class. The problem sets are fine, but I actually think they're less valuable because they're infrequent - there's no consistent practice of these topics. Finally, the group project at the end of the class was just awful: no one felt like it helped solidify topics, and it just felt like a lot of work with no benefit. Everyone I talked to said they would just prefer an extra problem set or two at the end of the class, especially given that the final project was in addition to a final exam.",
                "The lectures were excellent and very collaborative, the class discussions were engaging and there was always room for questions",
                "Prof. Hawkins is a rare gem of a professor and I just feel so much gratitude toward him. He works so hard for this class, it is astounding. \r\n\r\nI really liked the blue slides practices exercises interspersed into lecture. The class would not be nearly as effective without them. I also liked the worksheets on gradescope. I might lean in favor of having 2 midterms instead of one, so that each one counts a bit less. I was totally slammed during midterms week and couldn't give as much attention to econ as I wanted. \r\n\r\nI also love how prof hawkins answers questions in class. Most of the time, people ask good questions. Sometimes people have dumb questions that indicate that they just weren't listening, but I guess this is inevitable.",
                "Strengths - Hawkins. I think Hawkins was my favorite teacher I've had at Yale so far, and I say that after a lot of deliberation. I would say the main strength is just that the class is a very welcoming environment to learn economics. Lectures don't often create opportunities for students to ask questions, so I really love that this class feels like a very safe environment for me to ask questions when I'm not completely clear on a concept.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - This course was not the most organized course in the world, but very forgivably so.",
                "This course partitions the material really nicely so that it never feels like too much work while remaining engaged. I dont think that this class has any true weaknesses.",
                "No classes were recorded, which made it difficult to catch back up upon missing a class, but overall the class was able to provide a fundamental understanding of macroeconomic models and topics.",
                "Though the course was primarily conducted in lecture fashion, I liked how we were forced to correspond with a neighbor. I think this helped me stay engaged and think critically about the subject matter. Sometimes with long lectures like this, it is nice to break up the continuity and repetitiveness of the format. The peer tutor hours in Bass were also very helpful for me because the psets were difficult. They would make the topics more clear because it was hard for me to squeeze so much new information into such a short amount of time each week.",
                "Very engaging in that there were daily assignments. I felt caught up on concepts. It did feel as though there were one or two people that tended to extend conversation or ask very detailed questions that didnt contribute to others understandings.",
                "Hawkins makes me laugh very hard. Take this as both a strength and a weakness..."

                "Yes if needed for major/prereq. But it is a fun class to take if you like economics (and if you didn't necessarily click with micro)",
                "No, I don't recommend this class - take ECON 116 instead. 116 gives you assignments that are much less annoying, much more support (they have a whole host of TFs and peer tutors who have office hours, while 111 just has a couple of peer tutors whose office hours are infrequent), and a much easier curve. There's not much value in a 'seminar' format for an intro econ class, and I definitely regretted choosing this class over 116.",
                "Yes! Take the seminar over the lecture! I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned so much.",
                "yes, totally. Even if you are not required to for class, I think every person should understand a lot of the content in this course to be financially independent. Ex: knowing how to adjust your savings strategy when interest rates change, or your investment strategy according to inflation. Or how banks work. Just so much valuable info.\r\n\r\nCompared to intro micro, this class felt like a history class. There is very little math, which I enjoyed about micro. Studying for the tests is like big quizlet sets and lots of memorization. You have to get the economic intuition, but its a lot more memorizing than micro. I thought the psets were a lot easier than intro micro (took me like 1.5 hours compared to 6), but it's because the course is really different. There aren't like \"hard\" problems in macro; either you get how to do something and have memorized the steps, or you haven't.",
                "Yes!! I took this smaller seminar at first only because the macro lecture didn't work with my schedule, but I'm so glad I did. Hawkins is amazing, the class is amazing, and the material is interesting. That said, this class is definitely student motivated, so if something isn't clicking, it is the students' job to slow him down.",
                "Definitelythis is a great alternative to the lecture, and the material is engaging and taught well.",
                "I would absolutely recommend that everyone take this course! Macroeconomics is fundamental to understanding society and critical to be an educated person. The seminar version of macro allows for a lot more engagement with the material and is much more fun than the lecture!",
                "I would recommend this class to someone interested in Economics, however, I would not recommend it to someone who dislikes quantitative reasoning or is looking for an easy class. Though this course was difficult for me, I think others could greatly benefit from it.",
                "Yes! In depth but expansive. Super aplicable!",
