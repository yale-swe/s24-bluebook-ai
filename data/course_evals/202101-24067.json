The readings really do a great job at prompting you to think about things in new ways and from different angles, so it really feels like you are developing and learning 'tools' of queer science and what queer science might be, instead of just learning content/information.",

                "more conversations about the co-constitution of race and queerness and how this plays out in medicine/science -- maybe reading rod ferguson and other queer of color critique",
                "Strengths: Built up a strong community in this class  this was a class I really enjoyed showing up to; Joanna and Beans were also incredibly accommodating and supportive of us and the interests we wanted to explore in this class and were open to shaping the course with us based on our feedback throughout the semester. This class was also incredibly forgiving and understanding of student circumstances during the pandemic it is simply a class taught by kind people. Assignment feedback was also always insightful and I got many helpful further reading recommendations.",
                "Strengths- professor flexibility, tight-knit community of students, insightful readings\r\nWeaknesses- Yale won't let me take it again",
                "This course was a godsend in an especially challenging year. Its biggest strength was fostering a community of support and solidarity with which we could discuss the course content but also, delve into other topics as well. This made the learning enjoyable where I was genuinely excited to go to class each week and read the incredible pieces we came across.",
                "STRENGTHS: This class has so many strengths! The syllabus is really broad but allowed us to focus in on specific topics relating to historical sexologists, race and colonialism, indigenous kinship, queer animal studies, cyborgs and queer futures, and more. The weekly reading response was very flexible and helped organize thoughts about the readings. \r\n\r\nJoanna Radin is probably one of the best professors here. If you don't take a class with her during your time here, what are you doing???? The selection of readings is always amazing and are always thought-provoking and interesting when put in conversation with one another. Also, she and Beans made sure to write detailed feedback for our reading responses weekly, providing encouragement and suggestions for what to think about next. She and Beans created a classroom space where we could learn without feeling the stress and pressure of the rest of the semester's classes, where we could all be vulnerable with our peers and just be humans struggling together and learning along the way.\r\n\r\nAlso, Beans is an ICON! An amazing teacher who is great at guiding discussions around the readings while also being humane and compassionate. They are also really helpful if you need help with assignments and homework, and they're also basically a leading writer on some of the topics covered like the history of cisness and sex. Hopefully they come back to Yale to teach in the future, and if they do, add that class to your coursetable IMMEDIATELY and apply to it, because you. will. not. regret it!",
                "This course was the most empathetically designed course I have ever taken at Yale. The professors were so incredibly kind as people and forgiving with deadlines, which was invaluable in this pandemic. They were also willing to adjust the syllabus with student input midway through the course. It felt more like a collaboration than a strict teacher-student power dynamic, and I feel that I learned way more as a result.",
                "Joanna and Beans are awesome - so kind, generous and intelligent. I loved our readings - they were so well-chosen and insightful, and complemented each other beautifully. I do sometimes wish our discussions could have been more rigorous, but it was tough to enforce that without putting undue pressure on a lot of us who were struggling with the demands of the pandemic."

If you want to think about your life and experiences as a queer individual in a community of kind and generous thinkers take this class. Beans and Joanna are the absolute most wonderful human beings and generated such an important community for me especially during covid. yale has been deeply in need of this class -- it does critical work of critiquing stem/medicine/science, yale stem and makes space the urgent consideration of queer futures and queer possibilities for science.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students looking for a science studies community on campus and who want to explore the intersection of science, queerness, and society.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This class was absolutely amazing, and I could not recommend it enough. Joanna and Beans were fabulous instructors who were so willing to listen to students and work with us to make sure we met our goals as learners in the class. They also did such an amazing job of facilitating a class community that felt so welcoming and insightful; I can genuinely say that our meetings were one of my weekly highlights. This is all in addition to the deep discussions that we had. I learned so much from the readings, my classmates, and my instructors. 500/10 course",
                "Yes, 100%. This course was a true highlight of this past semester. The community that the course fostered is unlike any other I have been a part of on campus, and considering this was accomplished completely online is remarkable. The topics we discuss are fascinating and always stayed with me after class.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone who is a STEM student, a history or arts student, a humanities student, a queer student, a trans student, or anyone who is remotely interested in exploring and speculating about science, what science could do better, whether science can be ~queered~, what kinds of power dynamics have shaped the construction of 'biological sex', 'cisness', 'transness' and 'queerness' as concepts, and ways to think about the future of science. You will learn a lot without even feeling like you're having to memorize lots of things or revise content, because the course allows you to think about and sit with new and interesting concepts throughout. You will not regret taking this class (or any class with Joanna Radin). SO GOOD! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                "Every single student at Yale who is studying in a STEM field should take this class. STEM classes do not put enough emphasis on the history of our field and the ways science has supported and upheld systems of oppression. If we want to be better scientists, we must understand this history so that we arent doomed to repeat it.",
                "Without a doubt! This is a low-pressure high-reward course with lovely peers and instructors that can teach you to think critically about science, technology and queerness."
