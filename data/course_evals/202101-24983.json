Since we were engaging with material that was very new to most people, I would recommend giving passages to focus on in the readings, which were sometimes quite dense, and starting off each discussion with a series of ideas or questions to think about during the discussions. Sometimes the discussions felt a bit flat. I would have also loved to engage with the visual material more. I felt that we often just brushed through the visual materials - that had been discussed in length in the readings - in our discussion.",
