                "KNOWLEDGE: The course moves epistemologically from revisionist Marxism (trying to salvage Marxism in the Soviet Union), to a variety of perspectives on dissidence, truth, and responsibility, towards a discourse about the current moment, feminist care ethics. Major themes include responsibility, intersubjectivity, dissidence, and truth. Lots of great authors you don't typically see in Western canons that were very productive for class discussion and my own thinkingmuch of these thinkers can be translated to other societies, such as China, the United States, and others.\r\n\r\nSKILLS: I got a lot better at reading philosophy. There are some very difficult texts in this class, but there are lots of articles and other writing styles too.",
                "We read widelyfrom Revisionist Marxism to the philosophy of dissent to Professor Shore's own writings on the Maidan (Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014), and beyond. We engaged these texts with Kant, Heidegger, Arendt, and Marx within our discussions, as well as contextualizing the intellectual currents of the time with the historical developments of Eastern Europe from 1968 to the modern day. I have gained so much from the readings, yet all of that pales in comparison to walking out of our seminar discussions with new insights on history, on the meaning of dissent, and revolution in the present day. Although the discussion explores the evils within human nature, unbearable alienation, oppression, and our unwitting proclivity towards totalitarianism, I cannot help but walk outhopefulafter every seminar because of the new clarity and new questions I have gained. Our seminar's students are from diverse backgrounds and speak a variety of languageswe are always connecting the readings to our own country's political situations. Therefore, although this course focuses on Eastern Europe in late 20th century, the takeaways are global and timeless.",

                "Strengths: The syllabus is excellently structured and Professor Shore is greatshe really obviously cares about the subject matter and makes class really interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the course would benefit from a bit more history, even if it's just asking Professor Shore about the historical context during class. While the texts clearly have a pretty consistent temporal linearity, and there's a general vibe of authoritarianism during the period and in the place, it's not exactly clear what the specific historical context is in a many weeks if you don't ask.",
                "Please take the course no matter who you are or what you want to do, as long as you want to be a good human being. Being in a 15 people classroom with Marci is really an experience that I believe will generate lifelong impact in you.",
                "The readings and conversations were very engaging, but without a good background in philosophy and comfortability with philosophy essays, I dont know how much you could get from it as the material is unabashedly specific",
                "Strengths: The readings for this course were phenomenal. We read from Kolakowski, to Kosik, to Patocka, to Havel, to Mamardashvili, to modern-day Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian thinkers. I never felt like the readings were a burdenI often rewarded myself with an afternoon to myself, reading for this class after a busy morning finishing other work. You could tell that everyone in the course was genuinely interested in the material, and seminar discussions were very engaging and fast-paced, well-directed by Professor Shore. I also loved our tradition of starting every seminar with a cheerful anecdote before we began to talk about revolution and totalitarianism. The seminar discussions never failed to engage me, and I usually found myself continuing the conversation with other students in the class and my other friends in other disciplines because I wanted to keep thinking about them. \r\nWeaknesses: I only wish Professor Shore had a little more availability for office hours, but I completely understand that she has so many engagements this semester. No weaknesses otherwise.",

                "I would absolutely, without reserve, recommend this course, as well as any course taught by Professor Marci Shore, to any studentin the humanities or otherwise. There is nothing quite like the experience of this course. It makes you see so much more clearly the patterns of authoritarianism, mass media falsehoods, consumerism, and nationalism present in all governments and societies across the world. And you will also learn how revolutionaries and those who refused to stop writing as the regime threatened their lives stood up against those forces. It stunned me, during the first week of the course, that a third of our readings were obituaries. They were obituaries of intellectuals who stood against their regimes, and often paid the highest price, sometimes with their lives. I would only not recommend this course for people who don't have a few hours a week in their schedule to fully do the readingsit would truly be a shame if you don't have the time to devote significant effort to getting the most out of your time in this seminar.",
