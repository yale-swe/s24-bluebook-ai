Molly and Emily are so lovely and helpful and provide very good feedback on essays/field journal entries. \r\n\r\n(Small) Weakness: Discussions often didn't get to all the readings, but we'd frequently be told which readings to prioritize, so that is somewhat mitigated.",

                "Yes, b/c of the creative freedom. You are free to do literally whatever in this course that you want that is in line with your academic interests. The meat of the course is your ecology-related creative field journal, and you can do literally anything. It can be a series of essays, or paintings, or a podcast, or related to photography, film, translation, etc. You can even just go for walks and document it somehow, or do a diary. Some made ecology-related instagrams documenting their experiences throughout the course. The other work involved (outside the field journal) are a bunch of wonderful short stories and novels, which you only read and discuss in class (no writing assignments related to these), which is great. The only academic paper is the midterm. For the final, you can write an academic paper if you want, or do a creative project. Some students made an ecology-related documentary about Russia for their final, and the documentary was literally iconic (these same students did podcasts for their field journal, which were all epic as well and I always looked forward too). So if group work w/ friends is what you want to do in the course, it's possible, or you can work alone if you want. Finally, the readings are INCREDIBLE! Best course at Yale. ALSO... Hamid Ismailov (Future Nobel-prize-winning author) also came to speak!",
                "Yes! Take it if it's offered! You don't need to know anything about environmental studies or Russian literature to take it (though both would certainly help). Really interesting and interdisciplinary approach to ecocriticism and ecocritical literary theory",
                "YES. Everyone must take this course.",
                "Yes absolutely, the course created an amazing community and has been one of my favorite classes to date.",
                "Yes but not to all students because of how specific the subject matter is.",
                "One of the best classes I was fortunate enough to be able to take. Class meetings were always rich and engaging, tending and doing justice to the assigned material whilst weaving in broader outside contexts. The professor and TF were dedicated to ensuring that the topics of the class resonated beyond the classroom and they definitely achieved that. This class was a complete pleasure to take, I can't recommend it enough."
