                "1. Precision of language: Bromwich is a master of the English language and will not hesitate to point out imprecision or bad habits. You will be much more precise in the construction of your sentences after this class.\r\n2. Lincoln the politician: This course will expose you to so many nuances of Lincoln's character and decisions in the Civil War.\r\n3. Writing quantity: You will learn to write papers of all different lengths, from 1 to 5 pages.",

As such, I had to learn how to read efficiently. \r\n\r\nI was also able to develop my writing skills. Professor Bromwich taught me to embrace deviating from the \"introduction, three or four body paragraphs, and conclusion\" format of a high school paper. While I still sometimes fall back into that, I learned that I don't have to follow that format to be a good writer!",

                "Prof. Bromwich is absolutely awesome. His knowledge of Lincoln is incredible, and he manages to keep an interesting and comfortable discussion setting while still not holding back any disagreements or constructive criticisms of students' papers or of what students bring up in discussion. The reading, for me, was really interesting and fun to talk about during the class meetings. The reading load was very high, however, which sometimes made it difficult to keep up.",
                "Strengths: This course will teach you so much about Lincoln's nuances in character. The depth of analysis reached in each seminar is astounding. Especially as a first-year, you will emerge much better prepared for English.\r\nWeaknesses: This course has a huge workload, especially relative to other seminars. The papers have difficult topics, and this course has definitely given me the most difficulties during my studies.",
                "A strength is definitely that it is easy for everyone to engage and participate. It can be improved by making some of the essay assignments a little clearer. Also, I think it may be beneficial to have optional writing seminar days or something where we critique each other's essays or past essays. I was hoping to focus a little more on English and writing skills than we did.",
                "It was a very interesting course with a good discussion format. Reading was very heavy so it was hard to read it extremely closely. More direct writing instruction wouldve been good.",
                "The Professor was really good. He was very passionate and engaged in the material. Also as this is a small seminar, we got very detailed feedback on our writing. A weakness is that the material, at times, can be very dry.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe ability for Bromwich and the rest of the class to interpret preciseness of the details of Lincolns writings.\r\n\r\nThe ability for everyone to share their own interpretations of the works of the period and ground their arguments in Lincolns works.\r\n\r\nIn- class reflections with Professor Bromwich\r\n\r\nThe fluidity of the \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAnalyzing all of the readings necessary for the course on a per week basis.\r\n\r\nThe ability to follow the importance of the writings relative to what can be included on the essays.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially a student interested in improving his or her writing, reading, and discussion skills, as well as learning about Lincoln as both a politician and a writer. Additionally, you get to work with an awesome professor in a small class that is full of only first-years. The class focuses very tightly on Lincoln, but also includes readings from other relevant people from the time period, like Douglass and Whitman. The reading load is very heavy, but as the semester goes on, you learn what readings to focus on closely and what readings to read a little more quickly. The class helped me work on my writing skills without including a huge amount of writing  just five short-to-medium length papers. The longest paper I wrote was six pages. Bromwich is absolutely amazing. His knowledge of Lincoln is incredible. He manages to create a fun and comfortable environment in class while still never holding back from providing constructive criticisms on what students say in class, or on their papers. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, this class had to be conducted on Zoom, but it was still super fun. I can only imagine how great it would have been if we could have met in person. The class is a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. If you don't put in the effort, the class will be nowhere near as good as it is if you do put in the effort, so just be aware of that.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a special experience and will teach you so much about Abraham Lincoln's depth in character. The workload is no joke (based off discussions with my friends, the amount of readings and essays is up there with taking a Directed Studies class) but you will emerge a stronger writer with a sharper view of the world.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in history and our democracy. Not only does the class force you to think critically, but it provides you with a basis from which to look at our government and race relations today.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in American history or political science, this is a great course that exposes you to political thought and Civil War history. You pick up lots of reading and writing skills that (I'm guessing) will be very helpful for the rest of college.",
                "Yes, it was interesting and a good experience as a writer.",
                "Yes absolutely. The selected readings are interesting every week. Professor Bromwich is excellent both with insight and facilitation of discussion. Essay feedback is also very detailed.",
                "If you are very interested in Lincoln, this is the perfect course for you. Also if you want good feedback on your writing, take this course.",
                "Yes, if the student wants to learn more about the structure of the Civil War through a political and presidential view this is the course to take. Also a must for learning how to write more concisely, precisely, and coherently.\r\n\r\nThe ability of Lincoln to overcome the greatest challenge (slavery as we see it today) known to man is amazing. The analysis of his life through professor Bromwich who has dedicated his time to studying him is profound.",
