                "From this course, I learned a much more effective way of approaching an essay and writing a research paper. More specifically, I learned how to properly analyze and incorporate evidence into my writing to prove a claim and how to structure an essay.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge and insight about how I think about the concept of home in conversation with other writers. This is excalty what I had hoped coming into this course. I also learned how  writing a longer form research paper.",
                "I was clearly able to develop writing skills in an academic paper that was extremely helpful for my first semester here at Yale.",
                "I learned how to write quality essays and the overall research process for a research paper. I learned how to deep read various texts.",
                "This course challenged me to reconsider my definition of home and comfort on Yale's campus, as well as in regards to other spaces with which I am affiliated. The most notable skill I gained was how to write an argumentative essay. Professor Baynes-Ross challenged us to deeply engage with the sources rather than synthesize them. Additionally, she encouraged us to oppose the arguments of other sources if we found a conflicting tension. In high school, I was encouraged to abide by what leading scholars say, but she taught me that is not necessarily the best route. My definition of home was further expanded by my classmates and the readings. The readings were thoughtfully assigned, as they ranged from the theoretical meaning of home to what home actually means. My classmates provided diverse perspectives and the environment was a welcoming environment for those who chose to share vulnerable experiences.",
                "This class made me grow as a writer by making me think critically about how to be an EFFECTIVE writer. The course is structured to allow you to practice several different styles of academic writing including putting sources in conversation with each other, research papers, analyzing literature, and more, as well as leading you through the process of these assignments.",
                "I feel that I have learned how to better analyze topics when writing papers and elaborate coherently through my essays",
                "This course helped me deepen my analysis and further my arguments when writing academic papers.",
                "In this course, I explored to the different components that influence a person's perception of home. I gained skills within my writing and learned how to plan writing a research paper. I also learned much from the experiences and thoughts of my peers in the course.",
                "I learned a lot about writing, and not just essay writing. the class really helped me recover my writing skills and improve upon them a great deal. I also learned a lot about the complexities of home that lies beyond nostalgia.",
                "I developed my ability to analyze texts and write at a college\/ Yale level."

            "comments": [
                "The course's readings\/movie were engaging and fun to consume. Discussions in class were always conducive to further thinking that extended beyond the class. Reading example excerpts of good and bad writing helped us understand how to improve our own writing.",
                "This course is fantastic for learning how to craft a compelling argument, and I believe this skill will be fundamental to my Yale experience going forward. I really enjoyed this course overall. I would not change anything, as I believe some of the negative experiences I had were due to external factors, not Professor Baynes-Ross's instruction.",
                "Completing the variety of writing assignments for this class held incredible personal value and facilitated so much intellectual growth because of the source material chosen by Prof. Baynes-Ross. We saw home from every angle and were able to use personal stories, relevant films, as well as famous essays that I was able to connect to my other courses to expand and enrich our own ideas of home through our writing. Class discussions weren't as rich as they could've been, likely at no fault of the professor, but the course would've benefitted from more lively discussion during class.",
                "The way the course was structured was great in always keeping us engaged and busy but not overwhelmed.",
                "Strengths: Received lots of feedback and advice throughout the writing process\r\nWeaknesses: At times the readings felt unrelated to what we were writing about but the discussions helped me interact with the material.",
                "One strength that I believe contributed to the richness of the understanding of home is the diversity of authors that I studied. By reading authors from different time periods and countries, I could see how home is similar and sometimes completely different for different people. Additionally, the variety of texts we studied (poetry, film, photography) also presented new perspectives.",
                "one thing that i had constant trouble with is knowing what reading was up for homework. the canvas page was not organized by date but rather by units which intellectually makes sense but for the students it doesnt really help with organizing workload.",
                "The readings weren't too engaging, but the topics discussed naturally in class were very engaging. The topic of home and community is something that every college student should discuss with their peers in order to have a broader understanding of the space they take up."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student since it allowed me to not only learn more about myself and my home but the factors that are often ignored or overlooked in the greater scope.",
                "Yes, anyone who wants one on one feedback about their writing as well as to learn how to become a better academic writer should take this course.",
                "I definitely would! ENGL114 in general is a great introductory course that I think all Yale students should take. However, home was especially amazing .Every class was filled with new readings, and the assignments allowed for lots of improvements to be made.",
                "Yes! The course material and discussion was very valuable in my overall learning experience at Yale.",
                "I believe this course is foundational to any student's experience. Beyond learning to craft an argument, learning to define home is crucial for college students. Regardless of distance from their previous residence, Yale students go through a lot of transitions during the first semester in regards to identity, comfort, making friends, and independence. This course explores the roles of all of those things and more, and it has shaped my thinking as to how I make Yale feel more like a home. The readings are diverse in thought, allowing students to develop a well-informed definition of home. I also find it nice that the goal of the course is not to achieve a universal definition of home, for the class slowly realizes that no such thing exists.",
                "Absolutely. Especially compared to what I heard from friends in other English 114 classes, Prof. Baynes-Ross's class was a fantastic experience and opportunity to improve your writing while growing, challenging, and expanding your own ideas. You get to write about things and concepts that are important and relevant to you, and get out of the course a new understanding of yourself and your experiences.",
                "Yes. I think prof did a great job teaching and explaining to her students the different aspects of how to write an essay.",
                "Yes, this course helped me develop my arguments, something that will be extremely helpful in later courses.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially during my first semester of college, I found it nice to reflect about my conception of home and learn about this conception for others. This course also greatly allowed me to improve my writing skills and notice patterns within my writing that may be destructive. I believe that this course allows students to feel invested in the material for the improvement of their writing and their personal beliefs, and I think that connection is great to experience.",
                "Yes, the topic of home is an essential one, especially if you are from out of state. And the writing seminar aspect is something to consider as well, because my ability as a writer has greatly grown."
