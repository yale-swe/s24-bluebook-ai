She has very high expectations of her students, but she gives them all the support necessary for us to reach them.",

(This attention to detail also almost certainly helps make learning the material easier.)\r\nI preferred the initial flipped format for this course, but I understand why it seemed necessary to switch to a live-lecture format."

Everything is well-written, thoroughly thought through, and well-organized, and problem sets provide a lot of good practice in using numerical methods to write programs that solve simpler (but not necessarily less interesting) math problems."
