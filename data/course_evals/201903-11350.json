    "I learned about various model organisms. I gained fundamental skills in laboratory procedures and techniques.",

    "Background on important lab techniques as well as how to write scientifically.",
    "How to approach writing a lab report, how to perform many basic biology laboratory skills, how to think critically about how our experiments apply to the real world",

   "comments": [
    "The expectations of the course could be more clearly organized.  I often did not know when things would be due until coming into lab and due dates changed a lot.  That being said, they were very flexible and usually the due date was moving later.",
    "The teaching staff of this course is incredibly dedicated. This class has introduced me to more resources than all of my other classes at Yale combined. You will get to use very cool technology. You will receive an incredible amount of attention and feedback. You will learn a lot, especially if you put in the time.",
    "There were no weaknesses.  The strengths include: detailed packets for each experiment that make the scientific questions more comprehensible and provoke deeper analysis of biological models, a great professor and TA, and a small setting that made the lab atmosphere more inviting and collaborative.",
    "Dr. Moreno is awesome. She helped me learn so much. The one improvement would be if there are clearer requirements for the assignments.",
    "I learned a lot of basic skills and the lab reports helped me think about the big picture of the experiments we were performing. Dr. Moreno gave us enough information to perform the preliminary parts of the experiment knowledgeably but also let us think critically for ourselves in order to design our own experiment to answer a bigger question",
    "I thought the organisms used were very relevant to biological research, but there was little feedback from the professor and TAs. Also, assignment due dates were not clearly posted, and there could have been better communication.",
    "Strength: Professor Maria. She is knowledgeable and genuinely cares about her students. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly--none."

    "I would recommend this to a student who is interested in biology and who has time to dedicate to a lab course. Realistically, the lab reports do take many, many hours to complete, and for the first weeks, you will be struggling to understand what is expected of you in the lab reports. However I really enjoyed the content of this course, and it was the first lab experience that I looked forward to each week. The professor and TFs dedicate so much time and energy to your learning that you can always go to them if you need help. They are also really understanding if you need more time on assignments. If you are doubling up on a science and looking for a second lab, this is probably too much of a time commitment for you. But if you are a pre-med first year (or upperclassman) looking for a bio lab, and have time to spare, this could be a good option. This class is a bit more like \"high school\" in the sense that you have to spend a lot of time on homework each week, but you will get a lot out of it if you put in the effort. Hopefully you will learn a lot, too! I learned so much over the semester and actually enjoyed lab for the first time in a while.",
    "Yes!  I learned how to write a scientific lab report, which is completely different than anything taught at high school.  I also learned how to think about scientific problems in a way that also caused me to ask more questions that would expand my scientific knowledge.  Beyond all this, the course was fun, and I looked forward to the lab every week.",
    "Yes! A lot of work but so rewarding.",
    "Yes definitely take it, best lab that I have taken at Yale",
    "Definitely. Dr. Moreno is very committed to helping her students learn",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. It is a lot of work and the lab reports were not returned in a timely manner to make corrections for future lab reports.",
    "I highly recommend this course. I am not a STEM major, but Professor Maria made this course accessible, fun, and I feel like I learned a lot. Don't trust previous years' course evaluations. You will learn a lot in a low stress environment, especially if you are an underclassman. If you read through the protocols and think critically before you start the reports, they should not take you that long (the longest lab probably took ~10 hours, but I took an average of about 2~4 hours on the lab reports)."
