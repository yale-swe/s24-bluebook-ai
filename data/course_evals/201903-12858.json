    "I learned a lot about history and social movements and the power of literature in telling these stories.",
    "I believe my writing has improved.",
    "I mainly learned how to read more closely, analyse text and formulate a claim, both during class discussions and for written assignments.",
    "This class has been invaluable in teaching me how to really read and discuss a novel. More than just improving my writing (which this course definitely helped me do), I greatly increased my ability to glean meaning from a novel and understand its place in its historical context. The final paper, connecting a novel with the social movement it comments on, was my favorite piece of academic writing I have produced, and writing and revising it was incredibly rewarding."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were that the readings were very interesting as the professor let us decide which literature we wanted to be part of the syllabus.\r\nThe weaknesses are that the readings in between Tuesday and Thursday (two nights) were the same length as the readings in between Thursday and Tuesday (five nights) which made it overwhelming at times to engage with the content while getting the reading done (in between Tuesday and Thursday).",
    "I enjoyed this course. It was engaging and interesting.",
    "strengths: engaging discussion about our current reading assignment, students had a say in the syllabus, feedback from classmates for our essays\r\n\r\nweaknesses: course sometimes felt chaotic, prior knowledge of how to write literary analyses\/close readings was simply assumed and we only briefly reviewed, but were never really taught how to write\/structure our essay",
    "This course excelled in its organization and environment. Its small size and amazing, friendly professor made me feel comfortable sharing my ideas at any point in class; I think I learned how to express my ideas through speaking as much as I did through writing. This is an invaluable skill. I loved how the professor allowed the students to have input in the novels we read over the semester, and the reading load was not only very manageable but was fun! I found myself productively procrastinating on homework for my other classes by reading ahead. The class masterfully connected literature and history through its focus on social movements, and I find myself wanting to take more English and History classes because of this class. The only weakness I would say would be that the class could focus a bit more on writing skills throughout the semester; it seemed to be mainly at the end."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The class size was small which made the conversations very intimate. We were able to ask any questions we had and get helpful responses.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to improve their writing and enjoys literary analysis.",
    "If you enjoy reading and have prior knowledge writing literary analyses\/close readings, then I would recommend this course. If, however, you are looking for a course that really teaches you how to write from the beginning, this one is not for you (unless you are very determined and actively seek help, but just don't expect to be taught how to write well).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student! To fully appreciate the course, a student should probably like to read novels. The discussions we had in class were some of the highlights of my semester, and the small size facilitates friendships between everyone in the class!"
