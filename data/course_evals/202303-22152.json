                "Comprehensive introduction to philosophy up to Aquinas; basic yet important philosophy vocabulary; and I suppose just realizing that there are so many ways at looking at the structure of the world I have certainly become more open-minded as a result of this course.",
                "I learned how to do philosophy, and how to get important information from texts.",
                "I learned so much about Philosophical thinkers and their thoughts. I also learned about the importance of supporting arguments with examples and I practiced coming up with unique examples of my own, connecting abstract thought with reality.",
                "I became a much more capable critical thinker through a series of intense readings and essays. Being placed face-to-face with some of the most influential thinkers of the ancient world and reading what they think for yourself teaches you to credit and criticize their thinking where due as well as recognize your own biases and implicit ideas in how you view morality, ethics, and creation. Above all, I gained a strong foundation in philosophical thinking that would serve anyone well in future studies, no matter what major.",

                "I think that DS Philosophy is the weakest of the three tracks in the Fall, simply because most students are new to Philosophy, meaning that much of seminar time is spent explaining concepts rather than having discussions. To me, the value of DS is in lively debates and discussions among students in seminar; philosophy largely lacked that for me this semester. Philosophy in particular is a discipline where discussion and debate are extremely valuable, so I think placing a heavier emphasis on this in seminars would greatly improve Fall Phil.",
                "Legitimately perfect; no improvements",
                "The strength of this course is that the syllabus encompasses the most influential philosophers.",
                "Strengths: seminar format oriented around discussion, Prof. Grimstad's smart engagement with the students (offering guidance when needed but not overpowering discourse), reasonable lengths for readings from challenging texts that cut to their most relevant cores\r\nWeaknesses: readings could be posted earlier to enable students to get ahead",
                "In general, I wouldn't change much about Directed Studies except for the fact that I personally prefer more books though less time for each over less books but more time for each. In regards to Dr. Grimstad's specific section, I believe that the professor is easily followable and greatly comprehensive. It is evident that he cares deeply about the material and about his students caring about it as well. While I might have appreciated more student-leading on occasion, I understand how this might be difficult with varied foundations in philosophy amongst students."

                "Yes! It was one of my favourite classes- not only eye-opening and educational, but also engaging and enjoyable :)",
                "Absolutely! I came into DS Philosophy scared by my lack of experience and emerged with a confidence in my own thinking and a passion for philosophical inquiry. No matter what you intend to study, reading and discussing philosophical thought can be illuminating for all, not to mention quite fun. 100% recommended.",
                "Dr. Grimstad is a fantastic professor who is greatly knowledgable in a wide range of topics. He is extremely good at explaining philosophy at whatever level you are at currently. He will also go as broad or as niche as his section desires though he holds a special place for specific thought experiments. His lecture-style seminars are easy to follow, and he is quite friendly during office hours."
