We learned how to notice more in the world around us, and take that interesting thing or feeling and write about it.",

                "The course has an excellent structure. The workshops are productive and helpful, the anthology we created is an amazing tool, and the poets we discussed severed as great examples for imitation. The only improvement I can think of is having a syllabus with the dates and requirements for the course. Somewhere that tells specifically outlines that there is: one anthology poem due each week by Monday night at 6pm and it needs to be posted on canvas, and 12 copies need to be printed out with your own name somewhere on it. one original poem is due each week by Monday night at 6pm and it needs to be emailed to professor Zarin in the thread and if it is being workshopped 12 copies printed out, etc. and an outline of the paper we wrote, the memorization recitation assignment, the final revisions with a due date, and the two required office hours meetings with the poems printed out and emailed. There were a lot of moving parts in that sense, and it would be helpful to have all of that listed out on one piece of paper, because at the start it was a bit difficult to keep track of everything! That's all simply logistical, I have no recommendations for the content of the course itself or the assignments. It was wonderful!",
                "Strengths: Workshop style, weekly poetry assignments.\r\nAreas of Improvement: Needs to work on broadening student's understandings of what good poetry is past the white canon. Needs to work on valuing student work even if it doesn't contain themes that the professor necessarily values. Needs to work on providing more structure, syllabus, and defining assignments.",
                "I wrote more below.",
                "The central strength of this course is Professor Zarin: her comments are incisive and productive. The central weakness of the course is not getting enough time with Professor Zarin: apart from meeting twice in office hours and receiving her comments at the very end of workshop, I did not get a lot of individualized feedback on my poems. A student who was more proactive may have succeeded in meeting with Professor Zarin more than the two course-mandated times (and some did). But students who are not as proactive (or are shy, or scattered ... some qualities shared by many great poets) tend to not find the same success. Professor Zarin's lack of individual availability does not reflect her lack of investment in the course: she clearly cared about us all and wanted us to find value from the class. It just seems that she is very busy. I wonder if more individualized feedback could accordingly be built into class time, perhaps by ocassionally having small breakout workshop groups (something we did during our final class that I found quite helpful) that Professor Zarin can move between, offering feedback as she goes."

Professor Zarin is great and the class environment was very conducive to open and constructive discussions of each others' work. I highly recommend this course. One of my favorites I've taken at Yale!",
                "Unfortunately not. Even if you love poetry this class can make you hate it. Specifically the professor creates an environment where a lot of students don't feel seen or valued. Through the poems that are discussed in class and the themes that are included it is clear the the class/professor has great discomfort learning about or including themes of race, gender, and identity. This results in some people feeling limited in what they can write, for example, I was warned before taking the class that I shouldn't write anything about race/class/gender because it would open me up to hurtful/ignorant comments from the professor. Save yourself the pain and don't take this class with this professor unless you only want to write poems about nature/dead birds.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. This class made me stop wanting to write poetry and encouraged me to stop continuing poetry education at Yale. \r\n\r\nThere is a very particular style of poetry which is encouraged in this class - poems with tight diction, tight form, usually short poems, and especially poems about nature, poems about rich white people. If you enjoy that style of poetry and do not try to do anything else, you will probably enjoy this class. You should not write about any kind of marginalized identity for this class; it is not welcomed, and you will likely find this class a hostile environment. I wrote more below.",
                "I would. I learned a lot about poetry, which was what I wanted. Prof. Zarin's taste can feel limiting sometimes, but those limitations could also be taken as an opportunity for growth. A mixed review. Find someone who's taken this class and ask them about it.",
                "Yes! This is a great seminar if you are looking to focus your writing practice.  Professor Zarin has created a safe, work focused space for wonderful workshopping and writing community over the semester. Take Advanced Poetry!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. You will grow as a poet, and, in that process, you will grow as a person. And you will be able to experience that growth alongside a community of poets. In many ways, taking this class was like reading a good poem: it sharpened my awareness of life. (This sounds overdramatic, but it's real! Anyone who has done one of Professor Zarin's \"moment of being\" go-arounds knows this.)"
