                "I was first introduced to Middle English, and after this course, I feel so much more comfortable with approaching Middle English writing. Greater context on the Middle Ages is also provided, specifically with information about scribes, manuscript formation, and religious background to lyrics. We spent a lot of time going through impact of word choice and sound, word placement, the nature of lyric, the implications behind the existence of written music with a given piece from the period, and more.",
                "Learned more about the intersection between text/object/image and about medieval culture.",
                "I really learned how to read and understand Middle English. Professor Butterfield is a wonder.",
                "An understanding of European medieval poetic and musical styles, and an appreciation for medieval art more generally. I gained relative fluency in reading Middle English, and deciphering handwritten script.",

Weakness is analysis was kind of all over the place and not very much guiding theory or concrete answers, we modify just approached the text from our modern perspective guessing at what the original authors could have meant.",
                "strength: very good overview of the genre, supplementary materials facilitated learning \r\nweakness: we maybe needed more pointers on how to read medieval texts at the beginning, since it's so different from modern English"

                "This was an unexpectedly fun way to accomplish the medieval requirement for the English major, as no one knew what we were doing but laughed awkwardly together until we ended up becoming comfortable with Middle English and engaged with the poetry. Reading load wasnt too heavy, especially since we re-reviewed most of it slowly together in class. Ardis was an absolute delight, very kind and enthusiastic and encouraging. Wasnt super organized and couldnt tell you exactly what I learned though.",
                "Yes if they are interested in a different sort of English class, where the texts feel like a puzzle that need to be deciphered.",
                "Absolutely take this class!! Ardis is a wonderful professor and she facilitates a fun and engaging discussion every time. You can go into this course knowing nothing about the subject matter and it will still be fun and accessible. In my opinion, it's a really great choice for english majors who are looking to fill their medieval requirement. I didn't know what to expect from this class but it was a lot of fun and I strongly recommend it."
