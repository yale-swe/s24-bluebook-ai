Issues of restitution and representation extend back in time to the very first cabinets of curiosity, begging the question; how must we go about changing the museum, when the museum itself was built on enterprises of colonialism?",

We learned about such fascinating and important topics in this class, including the origin and history of museums and crucial topics in contemporary museums, such as de-colonialization, modernism, indigenous art curation. I really enjoyed all the assignments, including group and individual presentations, critical comparison of museum websites, and exhibition proposal. I learned so much in readings and class discussions that I can never look at museums the same again.",
