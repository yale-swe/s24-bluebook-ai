            "comments": [
                "More live coding together would be helpful. The section activities were kind of difficult to complete in the 50 minute period. Maybe making the materials available earlier so we have more time to look over it before we have to do it will help.",
                "You learn a lot, but it is extremely time intensive.",
                "Lack of acknowledgement for the fact that majority of students taking course have little to zero experience with programming. Should not have to learn through the TA every week.",
                "Weaknesses\r\n- Not enough ULAs. Also, I would have preferred graduate-student TAs. ULAs sometimes did not have a good understanding of how to help. Their ability to teach in section was weak. Some were better than others. (Rohan, Perry, and Ann were outstanding.)\r\n- Not enough office hours. They were scheduled perfectly to work against my schedule such that I was not able to attend them as much as I needed to.\r\n- I did a lot of work but have very little confidence in my ability to code because we sped through so many difficult concepts with so little *structured practice.* I don't have a firm enough grasp of the tools at our disposal to put them together in creative ways.\r\n- Because the problem sets were so time-consuming, I did not have time to actually learn and understand, i.e. to work on examples from lecture, finish section activities, read the textbook, or rewatch lectures (although I briefly referenced all these from time to time). Many students spent way more than 10 hours per problem set. I needed to attend office hours daily (though I was unable to).\r\n- The proper way to teach is to fully explain how to do the thing being learned, to practice the thing repeatedly, and to gradually remove parts of the instructions at each iteration. This course, in contrast, gave partial (or confusing) instructions in the p-sets and expected us to figure things out that I could have never figured out on my own. (The p-set instructions were somehow both very long and yet not complete enough. The walkthroughs were helpful but could have been more so.) I would have preferred *small exercises* that built toward a larger task--as in foreign language grammar classes. As it was, I needed a ULA to walk through the problems with me and hold my hand. With scores of students and only a few ULAs and office only 2 hours at a time, it was impossible to get sufficient help from the ULAs.\r\n- The p-sets expected us to have good knowledge of physics and trigonometry. I haven't studied those subjects in years. Some (not all) equations were given, but they should have been spelled out more clearly.\r\n- The course was very disorganized and the communication was poor. We often received last-minute announcements and changes. The syllabus was updated without any special announcement. Announcements and important information that were verbalized in class were not also emailed. Every announcement or change should be communicated both verbally and by email.   \r\n\r\nStrengths\r\n- My favorite part of the course was the fair. That was fantastic. The exhibit format and the lunch provided a great way feel a sense of accomplishment, to see what my peers had created, and to celebrate our achievements. \r\n- Pair programming was my lifeline. Without it, I would have failed or dropped the course.\r\n- The lecture recordings were helpful. I attended lectures and found it helpful to rewatch them (though I seldom had time to actually do so.) I would highly recommend that future iterations of this course continue to record the lectures.",
                "PSETS were very cool because they were all very different and incorporated physics, music, animation, weakness are that when things like physics and music are used in PSETs it is particularly difficult for students with little/no background since in-class / DS explanations are not well done ( these TFs are cs students not physics or music theory teachers...) Also there is huge learning curve the first few weeks, and tons of student drop due to the high workload and use of math and phsyics which are not pre-reqs and scare off a lot of people from non-stem backgrounds who want to learn to code. It is a real shame, worst part of class by far is that professors don't seem to care. It feels like class would be a perfect summary of early CS concepts, but rarely feels designed to INTRODUCE CS to people from different backgrounds (which is what it advertises itself to be).",
                "The strengtrhs swer e ythat  the class had saved the lctectures online. THe weaknesses were that I didn't know there was a downloadable file for an assignment so i tried to code the assignment from scratch without the file that gives the structure and so i got 0 partial credit when i feel like i should have gotten some partial credit because i still did work but i just wasnt using the file structure because i didnt know it e=xisted, if you feel",
                "hood class with fun prohects but the grading was so strict and the psets took so long, id get 70s and 80s for missing really small oarts of the overall solution, and some of the psets were more math focused than CS focused which was frustrating. i think a lot of us took the class to be a fun intro to a new skill, but these things made the class overly stressful and i think a lot of us have been turned off from taking more CS courses",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the fact that there are so many resources to help students, and things like the daily office hours, sections, and ed discussion were very helpful. However, as someone who has zero experience with programming, I struggled a lot with the difficulty level of the course despite the statement that no previous experience was necessary. The jump between the lectures and problem sets was too great. I think having designated sections based on previous experience could be helpful.",
                "One less Pset to give us more time to work on our final projects. I think the final projects couldve been far better if we had one more week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Barron is a great lecturer, plenty of office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were often wasted because material was way too complex for the time allotted, and we never finished.",
                "The pace of the class was very good, allowing rapid progress to occur within a relatively short time. The activities in section were good at reinforcing concepts taught in lecture, but sometimes that could get a bit confusing. Grading was very fair, as I was able to keep up and do well as someone with no prior coding experience.",
                "Often there was not enough TA's/ULA's on office hours so often we didn't get the help we needed in order to do the problem sets. Furthermore, I wish more information was in the syllabus, such as how many assignment we will have, more info about the midterm, etc.",
                "This class is A LOT of work. I took this course as a non-CS major interested in taking a programming class since I had not taken one before, and it kind of overtook my semester. The psets can be enjoyable, but you must go to office hours every day or most days of the week to feel good about them. I appreciate that there was a collaborative nature to the course with the option of peer programming and working together during office hours. I think that the jump in difficulty in psets between the first two to the third/fourth is a little much.",
                "Strengths: I liked the opportunity to apply what we were learning in section\r\nWeakness: For the final project, it was difficult to apply GUI frameworks because we barely went over it.",
                "It is a very difficult course if you have not taken a programming course before. Many students have a background in CS, making it not exactly a beginner's course because it is graded on a curve.",
                "Strengths: TAs were incredibly helpful, most psets are objectively really cool and give a wide range of applications of computer science, and lectures were clear and easy to follow along. They were also all recorded and posted on canvas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Huge disconnect between the lectures and the homeworks ---- you can follow along on the lectures and feel like the content is manageable, but the psets are insanely difficult, like 15-20 hours a week most weeks (except for the first few). The challenge wouldn't have been that big of a deal if it were easy to get help---by the middle of the semester, when psets were increasing difficulty, it was impossible to get help. Although there were office hours every day, it wasn't uncommon for you to have to to get to office hours BEFORE they even started to be guaranteed to receive help---which is obviously ridiculous and unacceptable for a course with such difficult psets. The section activities were usually a waste of time unless you're able to learn new concepts and immediately apply them to a pset (I was never able to do them because I'm a slower learner). Also, the grading of the psets felt so random all of the time---on two psets I went to office hours to have my code reviewed days before it was due and TAs told me that it looked perfect, but when I submitted it, I got 60s. It's extremely upsetting and discouraging how difficult it was to receive help and feedback for this class. There were many times (almost every week) during this class that I was confused as to how I was expected to do well, despite me spending almost all of my free time studying the material and doing the psets.",
                "very hands on. the psets are great unfortunately the lectures are practically useless",
                "I like the focus on one language and I like that they allow pair programming. Very interesting and diverse focuses from each PSET.\r\nAs hard as they try, I think more TFs being available at office hours would be helpful.",
                "There is a big lag between the content learned in lecture and the content in the psets. However, ULAs are extremely helpful in office hours.",
                "The strenght of the course are the ammount of work that has to be put into the course, which at the same time allows you to get a lot of learning out of it. Similarly, thanks to the smaller Sessions we had, and the many TA meetings, it was quite helpful when I needed feedback and didn't know what else to do. \r\n\r\nWhat could be improved is the way in which the classes were actually structure. Rather than just look at powerpoint slides that explained the code, it would have been more helpful to actually have VSC open and work through it together. This would have made the course more interactive, and allowed me to learn more easily.",
                "It's an overall good course. I would say the pacing was a bit fast and office hours could be more efficient but other than that it's good",
                "While the course material was interesting and engaging, I unfortunately feel that the structure and rigor of the course was too demanding and at times completely unsustainable. The material in the lectures was presented in the usual slideshow format, but with a focus on screenshots of code. I found that the lectures really struggled to maintain engagement when the professor veered off and began talking about the screenshots. It was hard to understand what the code in the screenshots achieved when we just went over a definition in the previous slide. I was further disappointed with the realization that the discussion sections, which were designed to help review the lecture material, were not helpful because they did not function as promised.\r\n\r\nWe were required to attend discussion sections where TAs were supposed to review material covered in the bi-weekly lecture. Instead, we were given crash courses on material that was required to understand and complete the weekly homework assignments. This material often was not included in the lectures, defeating the purpose of reviewing anything. Even so, the material in these crash courses were presented to us in abstracted and high-level examples that often took the entire scheduled time to go through. This left us no time to actually practice or apply the material. Since the discussion sections were not functioning as promised, the meetings became more about getting attendance points than reviewing class materials.\r\n\r\nTogether, the rapid lectures and poorly structured discussion sections fostered an environment in which the material failed to adequately prepare students for the weekly assignments. The assignments would increase in difficulty and complexity, but more and more students would fall behind. For example, towards the end of the semester, office hours became so clogged with students who did not understand the assignments that it was very difficult to receive help. On many occasions the TAs could not help everyone, and many students were forced to take late days. Between going to lecture, sitting through discussion section, then having to teach ourselves the material that both the lectures and sections were supposed to teach us, and then working on complex, time-consuming assignments, it became incredibly difficult to complete the assignments on time. Personally, the course load became so demanding that I had to miss my other classes just to squeeze in extra time to work on the homework. The course load was unsustainably demanding because the material was not covered in an effective way. Had the lectures and sections functioned as designed, I would not have had to waste precious time having to research and learn the material on my own. In fact, I believe that having to sacrifice other academic obligations and risk other course grades to teach oneself material that should have been taught in lecture or section is a hallmark of poor course design."

It will teach you what you need to do if you have a decent math/stem background and/or are willing to struggle and spend hours every week at office hours while Cody repeatedly says all over the videos and assignments that they \"are giving [us] so many hints\" and that the PSET concepts are really easy and well explained (which they aren't especially when you are expected to use kinematic equations and trig and other non-CS concepts ). Despite all that -- yeah sorry if you can tell that I wasn't a huge fan of the organization and teaching staff (THOUGH THE TFs ARE AMAZING!!

                "If you want to see if coding and CS is right for you, this course will be the perfect class for determining that.",
                "After considering my own experiences and struggles with this course, I do not recommend this to other students. I especially do not recommend this course to students with little to no experience in computer programming. The course description and syllabus promise that interested students do not need prior coding experience to do well in the course. Due to the disorganized nature of the course and, as a consequence, its incredibly demanding course load, I recommend that students with no prior coding experience think critically before applying to this course."
