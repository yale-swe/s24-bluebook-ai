    "The course really opened my eyes as to how much the political debates of the French Revolution are still the same ones that we are having today. It really helped flesh out the foundations of the Revolution, and how it really wasn't some singular ideology and really all of our modern ideologies stem from the Revolution.",
    "This course is a great overview of many different conflicting forces and political views during the French Revolution. It offers a wide-ranging view of the causes, competing interests, contexts, and legacies of the French Revolution.",
    "This course was fantastic. Not only did I learn the history of the French Revolution, but we connected this to debates over inequality in the nineteenth century, chattel slavery and the Haitian Revolution, and the struggle for women's rights. Nakhimovsky stresses contextual readings without losing sight of what makes these texts brilliant. The French Revolution is vital for understanding subsequent debates amongst political theorists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as many of these arguments are carried out on the terrain of Revolutionary history.",
    "The French Revolution from a not-so-historical-here-are-the-facts-have-fun perspective. More of a deep dive into political commentary and philosophy of the day.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about the French revolution, particularly about the underlying forces which drove the French Revolution as a whole. Professor Nakhimovsky's focus on the underlying tensions of inequality and state centralization helped cast the Revolution in a different light and draw connections between the disparate ideas of the initial, liberal revolution, the Jacobian takeover and the terror, the Thermidorian Republic, and Napoleon's coup.  Between all of these are important lessons in constitution-making, democratic structure, and the role of the state."

   "comments": [
    "Readings were really well-chosen, and discussion in seminar was truly enjoyable, and well-led by the professor. Also the freedom and flexibility the professor gave for writing paper topics was really great, and helped me supplement knowledge in the course through my own research. The paper workshop and the presentations we did were also super helpful at developing our own writing, but also hearing about other topics that others had chosen. I feel like that should be something in really every class, where everyone mentions something about their own paper; it genuinely helps the writer as well as enriches the learning of the whole class.\r\n\r\n\r\n Really the only thing I would change would be to perhaps add in more readings from Royalists or Counter-Revolutionaries, as that was not covered much, but I wouldn't know where to put them, or what to take out in its place. All that was there really fit well. I guess the biggest weakness was that it only met once a week!",
    "While it's nice to dive into primary and secondary sources, the course really assumes a strong historical knowledge of the French Revolution. I only vaguely knew the exact history of what had happened, and that proved a real barrier throughout the class. Would 1000000% recommend taking a survey lecture class on the French Rev before taking this one. Nakhimovsky is definitely a \"strength\" of the class. One of those professors who will call you out for saying something stupid in class just to get participation points, and given that you do need said participation points, it forces you to walk into your 9:25 am class with at least one intelligible\/vaguely articulate thing to say, which is ultimately for the best -- both for you and for your classmates.",
    "I very much enjoyed this class.  I think it may have been better if it opened with an overview, looking at commentaries on the revolution first instead of diving straight in.",
    "I think this class did a very good job looking at the French Revolution from a variety of perspectives and in a way that helped me understand it in a broader context. Not only did I learn a lot about the French Revolution, but I feel I much better understand how to approach historical studies as a whole. The questions we approached in discussing democracy, equality, government, etc... felt relevant not only to our understanding of the 18th century but clearly relevant to our political situation today. Professor Nakhimovsky is a very engaging professor with a lot of knowledge of and interest in the subject matter, and he made each discussion really interesting and not simply a rehashing of the reading."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah definitely take this course, even if you're not into French or European history at all, or history in general. You learn so much about just how our society functions through analysing the events and philosophies of the Revolution, and even if thats not your thing, take it for the writing part. The final paper and associated assignments really were so great in enriching my writing process.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student looking for an in-depth exposure to the different political philosophies of the French Revolution.",
    "This is a fantastic course, and if it's offered again you should definitely take it! It's essential for any history or political theory students, and Nakhimovsky is by far the best professor I have had at Yale.",
    "Yeah; the French Rev. is arguably the moment we fell into modernity, and understanding the revolution helps you understand the next century and a half of rebellion and uprising in Europe. And while a nice survey course is fun, given that revolutions are interesting topics to learn about, Nakhimovsky really does a good job of offering you a new perspective on an old tale.",
    "This class fundamentally changed my understanding of the French Revolution, and I'd highly recommend it.  Professor Nakhimovsky is in his element, as he studies this era, and he is a wonderful classroom presence.  The readings are also well chosen.",
    "Yes. Professor Nakhimovsky is a great professor and clearly deeply engaged in the material. He is always available to meet and talk about the class and the papers, and he allows a lot of freedom in paper topics so you feel very invested and interested in your subject matter. The discussions in class furthered my understanding of the readings while placing them within a larger context, so that each week felt relevant to the discussions we had had and to the discussions to come."
