On the assignments, we applied the principles learned from class in order to code segments of a real operating system, the development of which is led by Professor Zhao. I now know significantly more about how operating systems work than I did before, and also feel that I have obtained a substantial amount of general computing knowledge that is essential to any student of computer science (such as how to ensure shared data stays synchronized)."

                "Strength: you learn a lot, from class and from PSET. the textbook is super helpful\r\nWeakness: Professor Zhong goes over the slides very fast and often doesn't explain them very clearly. So I relied a lot more on the textbooks than the lecture.",
                "The course was taught well by the wonderful Professor Shao. The TAs were also very helpful with homework.",
                "strengths: Zhong Shao is AMAZING\r\nweaknesses: none I love this class",
                "Really fantastic problem sets -- just enough is left for you to actually figure out the crucial components, and a lot of the filler is done for you. You're not really building an OS throughout the course, but you are implementing some of the most important parts.\r\n\r\nLectures followed very closely to the textbook -- less valuable. Reading the textbook prior to the exam solidified concepts much better, imo.",
                "Lectures were confusing and hard to follow along, material was good but it was difficult to understand everything during lecture; had to learn a lot during review of slides",
                "This course is very hard, and I assumed it would be boring. In actuality it was incredibly interesting. To improve the course I think there should be more clarity about the types of questions that will be on the midterm and possibly more TA hosted office hours the week psets are due.",
                "This class was great! It is pretty well organized and you learn a lot. However, the assignment specs need to be less vague... I spent too much time on Ed trying to clarify what the specs were asking for.",
                "The course is pretty well organized. lectures are useful and provide a lot of helpful examples. Professor Shao is a great lecturer. The problem sets all provide excellent practice and applicaiton to what we actually learn in lecture, and while very difficult, are a great way to learn and get better with the material. My one criticism is that lecture content really ended right before Thanksgiving break with the midterm. We then moved into security and distributed systems discussions which I feel were less related to operating system design. I would have apprecaited the course moving a little slower, or tailoring those extra lectures to what the class was most interested in.\r\nThe teaching staff was also super understanding and flexible when it came to psets, work, and deadlines. They realized the class was a lot of work and made sure that everyone got the support to complete it successfully.",
                "Really well taught.  Zhao is a legend. Projects are really engaging + demand a fair workload. You will learn a hell of a lot even though the work isn't outrageously demanding  def certainly less than 323, but still as challenging as most CS classes tend to be.\r\nAlso pair programming  is really clutch if you have a partner with whom you know you'd work well. Makes the class far more enjoyable / less solitary than other CS classes. Also makes it less stressy.\r\n\r\nLack of past exam practices and the heavy weighting is def a weakness. Should be split up into 2 exams imo. \r\nAlso the work ramps up a bit too much. The class starts off suspiciously easy and then gets a lil crazy. September and October: you're vibing. November and December: no joke. (Don't let that scare you off though. As mentioned this class isn't as attention-seeking as 323)",
                "Strengths: the projects are generally well-designed (though I thought the spec could be clearer in some places), and pair programming is an excellent feature of the class. The course is also very well-organized. Weaknesses: I felt that the lectures could have been more engaging, and some of the topics could have been introduced/motivated better.",
                "This was a wonderful course. The lectures and PSETs are aligned, and the problems learned about in lecture and tackled in the PSETs are very interesting and applicable. Prof. Shao's personality enhances the lecture.",
                "I think that this course should move at a slower pace as we learn so much content in the duration of one semester.",
                "Strengths: labs, supportive TAs. Weaknesses: lectures don't always reflect lab schedule, could be more hands-on and engaging",
                "The lectures are a bit hard to follow, and most psets really have little to do with the lectures.",
                "Overall great course, but I wish there was a bit more time spent on schedulers.",
                "The labs are very interesting and really help grasp the material",
                "Strengths: content feels very relevant; the starter code for the programming assignments is well organized; only one exam\r\nWeaknesses: I think we can spend less time on memory management since it's covered in the new 323 curriculum",
                "This course is difficult. I think the sequential structure of the assignments is a big plus, as well as being able to work on them in pairs. I think the course ramped up heavily near the end and lectures did not correlate with assignments as much. After the exam (2/3 of the way through the sem), lectures were not really relevant to assignments and the difficulty increased a lot.",
                "Problem sets are interesting to complete. Pair programming helps alot",
                "I enjoyed the problem sets",
                "The class is very well organized. The materials are cleanly divided into sections to facilitate learning. The staff also provide a lot of resources to help address any questions.",
                "Lectures were kind of dry. Professor just read slides. People kinda just stopped attending midway through semester. Would have liked more examples vs theory.",
                "The strengths are the teaching staff and the level of detail of the assignments. The weaknesses are that one wrong line of code can result in a C on an assignment, which isn't entirely the fault of the graders, since this is an OS class and it is hard to debug and find the root of the problem. But, it is very unfortunate that partial credit isn't as fair.",
                "Strengths are definitely in the professor and overall content of the class. Professor Shao is really knowledgeable on the topic overall, and is great at explaining the concepts in the course. Topics are interesting and useful for any CS major--really helped solidified info that was just briefly touched on in 323. One main weakness is the course schedule towards the end of the semester. While it seemed like we had adequate time for the first 4 labs, the most time-consuming part of the course occurred in the last 6 weeks of the semester: a 30% midterm (which was basically a final exam), the longest (by far) lab in the course (which effectively had to be completed over Thanksgiving), and the final project. In the future, I think it might be better to have labs 1-4 due earlier in the semester, in order to give more time for the final assignments.",
                "I think the design of the course is a significant strength, as you learn both the theoretical principles behind good operating system design and how to actually put these principles into practice through the assignments, where you build up a real operating system kernel over the course of the semester. This might sound daunting, but a lot of the code is already done for you, so you only have to do certain segments. You are also able to use the staff solution for the previous assignment in every subsequent assignment, ensuring that any problems you encounter aren't due to bugs from code that you wrote outside of the current assignment. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class is that you can work in pairs, which can make for a more effective learning experience overall, as you're able to compare and contrast your own code with your partner's. It also tends to lessen the amount of work you have to do per assignment.\r\n\r\nThe teaching staff were reasonably helpful throughout the course, but I'm not sure I'd describe them as one of the course's strengths, as some did not do very much to try and point you in the right direction if you were feeling lost. I also felt there were relatively few teaching assistants for a course of this size."

I came out of it feeling like I had a much stronger knowledge base about computers, and feel a lot more comfortable with systems programming + optimizations. I was also able to use a lot of this on conceptual interviews, even after just a month or so.\r\n\r\nIf you're just trying to get through the major, it's fine to not take this, but this is a necessary component of a rigorous CS education. I'd also note that your choice of partner is very important.",
                "Perhaps, only to truly call yourself a computer science graduate. The course itself wasn't ideal given the difficult to listen to and follow along lectures that made me sleepy in class, but the content itself is important. The projects are very difficult but forge your training in systems programming where ideas are difficult to understand and test.",
                "This is fantastic course! I originally took it only because I thought I would need it for my career after graduation. Along with looking good on my transcript, this class just made me feel more confident calling myself a computer scientist. I can now say I know how computers work. The course material is interesting and taught in an engaging way. The psets are challenging but force you learn the critical material. I would recommend this class as long as you dont take it with another demanding CS course.",
                "Yes! This is one of the essential classes every CS major should take. Prof. Zhong Shao is kinda a legend too (you know zsh, yeahhh... thats him...) You will learn so much so quickly and the assignments can (AND SHOULD) be done in pairs which makes the entire experience much more enjoyable. I will say that some of the specs are a bit vague and should be clarified. This made grading pretty opaque and sometimes unfair.",
                "Yes, every computer science major should take this class",
                "This is not an easy CS elective by a long shot. The psets are roughly as long as 323 psets, if not longer, but the intellectual difficulty is much greater. There are also fewer office hours due to it being a small class, and it is difficult to get rapid help because problems tend to be esoteric and require a lot of work to debug. However, working with a partner makes it a lot easier and tolerable, but does not diminish the work. However, it is a super rewarding elective. The challenge is because the content is hard, but you end the class having an excellent grasp on a lot of the concepts that are improtant for other CS classes. You become a much better programmer and debugger. The teaching staff is also there to make sure you succeed, and if you put in the work you will. It is not a class to take lightly, but if you are interested in good electives where you learn a lot, and were interested by material in 323, I cannot recommend this course enogh.",
                "Certainly. Pair programming + actually interesting material. Great way to consolidate everything you inevitably forgot about after taking 323. \r\nHonestly embarassing that Yale hasn't made it a requirement for the CS major. You learn so so much, yet don't need to put a crazy amount of time into it. \r\nWould go as far as to say that if you graduate with a CS degree without having taking OS, you've done yourself a disservice.\r\nFr just take this class.",
                "If you enjoyed 323, definitely take OS. Otherwise, it's hard to sayif you didn't like 323 you probably won't like 422, though the topics are interesting and it's probably a good idea to have a general understanding of how operating systems work as a CS major. I would recommend taking this class if you have time in your schedule for it; if you have a busy semester and are not particularly interested in systems programming it's probably not worth your time. Keep in mind that you can work on the projects with another student, so it's helpful to have a friend who's taking the class at the same time (or you can make a new friend!).",
                "If you enjoyed the systems programming of 323, you'll enjoy this course. It's all C and a little bit of assembly. I highly recommend this course, and to some extent I agree with the notion that this should be a required course - the topics covered in this course are fundamental to problems in CS as a whole. No doubt that taking this course will enhance your viewpoint when you consider other problems, even with more typical full-stack / backend projects.",
                "Yes. If you're a CS major, this course offers lots of opportunities in low-level kernel system programming, which is great to have under your belt. The lectures are decent, but you will get the most out of the labs",
                "Definitely if you are a CS major. Solid material, just need to put in work, but the workload isn't that bad overall.",
                "Yes, I believe I grew a lot as a programmer because of this class.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! I learned a lot throughout the semester and the programming assignments are manageable with a partner. There is a lot of options for the final project, and we had a lot of fun with the graphics project",
                "I would recommend this course under the condition that you have a lot of time and energy to dedicate to it. Ideally, you enjoyed 323. You will get a lot out of it if you put 25-30+ hours into each assignment, but if you don't have the time to devote, it will be a big drag and time sink.",
                "Yup, especially if there's an interest in lower-level code.",
                "Yes, it is a great, challenging, gratifying, high-level computer science course.",
                "Yes. This should be a required course for the CS major.",
                "Yes to anyone who took 323 and was comfortable with it. Some topics in the first half of the semester are just a review of things covered in 323. The rest of the topics such as synchronization is definitely rewarding to learn for people who are interested in systems.",
                "Yeah. Professor is great and concepts are super cool. Psets are tough but gets you good at collaborating.",
                "yes! it is definitely a fundamental computer science course. I am also biased because I like low-level systems, but I think it is important for every CS major to take it. this might sound crazy, but I also think it is a cool course to audit if you aren't CS (or even vaguely related) but want to know how a computer works.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yeah, I would. This is probably one of the best CS electives you can take in terms of actual learning; the topics are genuinely useful and you really solidify your understanding of system topics that 323 briefly introduces. That said, this class is definitely a good amount of work--especially in the last ~6 weeks of the semester. While the first 3-4 labs aren't too bad (about the same or less work than 323), the last assignments take a significant amount of time (especially  lab 5), so be aware if you take this class. Overall though, I'm definitely glad I took it!",
                "Assuming they are genuinely interested in learning about operating systems, yes. However, I would caution students thinking about this class to consider whether they are just generally interested in how operating systems work or whether they are truly willing to try to code a real operating system. Even though most of the code has already been written, and there is support in the form of your partner, Ed discussion, the teaching staff, and the assignment specifications that lay out what exactly you are meant to do, sometimes what you are supposed to be doing is still unclear. Also, as the operating system kernel gets more and more complex over the course of the semester, bugs become more and more difficult to understand and deal with, and the TAs will not always be able to help you determine the source of the problem. That being said, I think overall the course is not as challenging as, say, 323."
