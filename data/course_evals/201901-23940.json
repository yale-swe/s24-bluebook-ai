    "I learned what political targeting for persuasion and turnout looks like from the end of the data analyst. I learned about factors than impact turnout and persuasion, and how hard it is to determine what those are. I learned basic programming skills in Python using NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib, and how to google to figure out what I don't know.",
    "I learned a significant amount about the application of data science in the political realm. Professor Kallas exams were adapted from real scenarios and our work always felt applicable to political campaigns. \r\n\r\nOur final project was rewarding to work on and complete because it exemplified how much data science we actually learned throughout the semester.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: practical application, professor's research background. Talk with actual political data analyst. Professor's availability for help with homeworks, project, etc, alike.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could have been more engaging and could have had more specific connections to the readings. Also, two midterms and a final project seemed kind of excessive for a half credit class. Though, midterms were very well connected to the content and made me feel like I had learned, despite how little time was actually spent in class. Also, I feel like explanations of models \/ how they are generated could have been clearer.",
    "Professor Kalla works really hard to make sure hes available for his students. I really appreciated all of his advice and guidance on our assignments, and final project (which involved analyzing a real campaign)!",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Teaches info that does a good job of preparing us for life outside the Data8 datascience module\r\n- Interesting lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Major lack of communication between this course and the main YData course\r\n- We had to learn a lot about Python on our own, searching for our answers online\r\n- Strong swings in difficulty from one lab to another\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure a half-credit, once a week structure is what's best for this course. Maybe if the workload was less, but as it is, I had to do more work for this class than for the main one (at some spots). Maybe it's a half credit because our lectures weren't that long, and they only took place once a week? I don't know, it just didn't feel like the right balance.",
    "more time spent teaching python would have been nice; maybe having the same type of code in the main ydata lecture and this seminar",
    "This was a very fun and engaging course, well-fitted for the length of the semester and the half-credit. Professor Kalla was very professional and approachable.",
    "I think the strengths of this course is that anyone wanting to learn about politics and data science can, regardless of background. I think a weakness of this course was that the data packages between this course and the general YData class were different, and the professor should have spent more time explaining the differences between these packages."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It helped me learn about what it means that politicians are interested in data & how they are interested as well as how they use it. It also was a good transition away from the YData datascience import, although I was confused at first about the different methods.",
    "Absolutely! Its a wonderful way to develop quantitative skills and learn about really interesting concepts behind political campaigns.",
    "I would recommend. \r\n\r\nUltimately I had to put in more work for the labs in this course than the main YData course, which is strange considering that this course is worth only a half credit. That, on top of having to teach ourselves Python, made the course a little bit frustrating. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I learned a lot in this course and I feel that I'm probably more prepared for actual data science work than anyone who just took the main YData course. Lectures were interesting and informative, and I definitely feel that the work I put into the course was rewarded with fulfilling understanding. I also think that over time the wrinkles in the course will be ironed out - both this course and the main YData course are brand new, so hopefully issues arising from a lack of communication between the two courses will fix themselves over time.\r\n\r\nFor anyone looking for a challenging and fulfilling (albeit sometimes frustrating) course, this is a good class.",
    "Yes, great way to learn useful sills",
    "Yes, the course taught me what I wanted to learn and the readings were always interesting and well-curated.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the intersection between data science and politics."
