                "I got so much out of this course, particularly from the readings. The course itself is not really about \"meanings of life\" (and the instructor, Evan Goldstein, was also clear about this in the beginning) but rather biopolitics and power. Foucault starts the course before it moves into tons of other great topics, like Black life and imagination, pandemic life, STS, trans life, debility and disability, life and work, and a lot more. Learned how to read better, think about the world a bit differently, and how to ask better questions. Learned a lot about different frameworks for problematizing the normative world, which is often daunting and difficult, but rewarding as well.",
                "This is the first class that I have taken (as a first-semester senior) that I felt really got into what exactly all of these scholars are saying. Never have I interacted with Foucault in a more digestible and enjoyable way. Berland and Butler are also taught with such ease that you can't help but wonder if Professor Goldstein has superpowers. Even Haraway and cyborg theory was manageable. The style of doing one scholar for each class and following themes as we traveled through the theorists helped tie the class into one cohesive unit.",
                "Through class discussions of the readings, I feel like I was able to further my critical thinking skills.",
                "This class made me expand my horizons in philosophy.",
                "I learned a great deal about life, death, and the theory surrounding different ways of thinking about how life and death interact in various settings/readings (Blackness, disability, pro-life/anti-abortion, and COVID-19, etc.) This class was very interesting and provided a lot of insight and tools for thinking about life and death (biopower, biopolitics, etc) in a very different way than I have ever thought of before. Learned so much!",
                "This was a think-outside-the-box class and that is a skill in and of itself. To appreciate and see the value in work that isn't logical but is instead deeply emotional and that is how it conveys its message. To bring curiosity to unfamiliar and challenging texts instead of settling on the idea that there is one right way to read them.",
                "I learned about what biopolitics and biopower are, how sovereigns and other powerful actors (institutions, media, other people) shape, regulate, and destroy people and populations, and how biopolitics can be seen in every aspect of our society, intersecting with Black studies, queer studies, labor, the pandemic, and more. It changed how I critically view politics and political actors.",
                "how to analyze difficult text",
                "This course helped introduce me to giants in the world of philosophy like Michel Foucault, Achille Mbembe, and Jasmine Puar in a way that provided an incredible foundation for not only viewing material in other classes/disciplines but how these ideas could be applied to how I viewed life itself. Strangely going over these philosophers week after week opened my eyes to similarities and conflicts that emerged as I navigate life as a yale student. Some of this included analyzing the way that social structures within healthcare and policy that may seem invisible are actually working for and against me in many ways.",
                "I developed a literacy on a lot of important philosophers I've always wanted to explore (Berlant, Foucault, Agamben, Mbembe, Haraway, etc.) and was able to unpack their texts/philosophies in a communal setting. I gained the ability to close-read these authors and extrapolate my own questions from them."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Readings. Readings. The readings were great and included authors Foucault, Puar, Asad, Mbembe, Arendt, Berlant, Butler, Stryker, Moten, and many more. They were hard but good. If you're interested in critical theory but don't know how to start, this is a great course for it. I'd also say the assignments were pretty good too, and we did a reading collaboration for the first paper which helped me generate a lot of thought for the second paper. Evan was extremely thoughtful and great at leading discussions, which took up the vast majority of class time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class had a weird structure, aka it was a leminar. To be completely honest I didn't always understand the lecture part that Evan gave and sometimes I literally zoned out. If the course were intentionally either a lecture or a seminar, it'd have been better. You really do have to get through the first few weeks of the course as wellthey're a bit hard because you get thrown into just really intense theory and I wish some of it was explained a bit better, but once you get through it, the course becomes really good and you retroactively are glad that you had to do those readings, because it would be difficult to have discussion without them, especially without them coming first.",
                "No weaknesses. Weekly reading responses are essential to understanding the material and are graded on completion, so you really know they are there to help you understand the work and not as arbitrary assignments/busy work.",
                "A strength is the way assessments were designed and the syllabus. I wish there could have been more participation from students during the seminarslike maybe making a student lead a particular discussion for 30mins. I guess sometimes some cohorts are quieter than others, but it would be nice to hear more from peers.",
                "Strengths: amazing Professor, great content",
                "This class was very on philosophy. For a seminar, the professor talked a lot but still made sure that the class was engaging. Not really any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: incredible professor who truly cared about all of the students, readings were always very interesting & professor was understanding even if sometimes readings were not as accessible at first, course structure and discussion posts were a balanced workload. The final paper assignment was a great way of showcasing connections to the material, and the close reading and reflection, and follow-up assignments were awesome exercises that allowed us to actually talk with people in the class and recommend different readings that were super helpful in developing new ideas, and also facilitated creating a great classroom community. Weaknesses: none. This class was great!",
                "I loved the split of 1/3 or 1/2 Prof Goldstein talking and sharing insights and context on the text, and then the rest discussion with the class. This worked well. \r\n\r\nMaybe a bit more class time could be dedicated to covering: ok what do you guys think was said in this piece? what is the plot summary in 10 mins and then we can move to deeper discussion?\r\n\r\nProf Goldstein is so open to feedback and questions and I cannot think of anything else.",
                "Strengths: Evan is so knowledgeable about these thinkers and how they relate to one another. He's a great facilitator and makes everyone excited to discuss these thinkers. The syllabus is incredible. A who's who of important authors, who are all in conversation with one another. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings are dense, so sometimes the class discussions are difficult to follow. But that's about it.",
                "it was like a small lecture I would have liked more group work in this class",
                "Strengths: all the readings were incredible (especially once you made it through Foucault in the beginning), the professor knew what he was talking about and knew how to make it feel relevant\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish people were more engaged with discussion in the course, I'm not sure how this could be improved because contributions were certainly asked for, but I feel like it took most of the semester for all of us to feel familiar with each other and I wish that process could be expedited somehow.",
                "Strength: Prof Goldstein did a fantastic job of breaking down the dense texts that were assigned each week. At first it seemed a bit daunting to have to read a 20-40 page analysis from thinkers that talked about life before I was even conceived. Still, he was able to introduce a contemporary aspect to the text that showed that these ideas translate over time into present circumstances. I am now able to use some of these observations/personal observations made as a foundation for my thesis, which I didn't expect when signing up for the course and really grateful for! \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish that specific texts/passages could be highlighted or collected for later review or reflection. At the end of the semester, I spent a lot of time reviewing passages and only really having my notes to reinforce class discussions. I loved how the class is centered around these in-person discussions that are heavily reliant on the interpretation that other class members bring up, but maybe some clarifying points after the Thursday class would have been very helpful.",
                "It was an incredible class. Structurally, the curriculum was consistent and repetitive which made it a very reliable class. I think it became a classroom that I could always rely on when the semester became more intense for other courses. The lectures were always really interesting and inspiring, and the asynchronous discussion posts that preceded each class were very useful. Engagement was very easy (I felt that the class size was perfect) and I really appreciated how thoughtful Professor Evan's lectures were and his humility when engaging with us. It really made the dense material feel approachable and I am inspired to keep exploring these topics and ideas beyond the class. I can't really think of a weakness! I really liked the papers we were assigned and the expectations around them!"

The course is not necessarily devoted to death, but one cannot talk about critical theory or biopower without talking, at some point, about death. The first few weeks were rather sad, in a good way, but sad nonetheless. I was glad that Evan did not make light of these topics.",

                "Yes! Though this course is not as much physical \"work\" in terms of completing a lot of written assignments, it is a lot of intellectual work and I found it to be very interesting -- the class allows you to apply the theory from what we read to concepts that you are personally interested in, and I found that that personal connection makes the course very fulfilling even if sometimes the material is a little bit complex. At first I did not think I would enjoy the class, but I think there is something for everyone and the material can connect to anything that interests you, which can make the class very very interesting once you find that connection for yourself and examine it through all of the different readings that we do.",
                "I would. The class was overall a great vibe, and I loved the learning environment that Evan created; he was so validating and was great at making everyone feel heard. The readings are dense and difficult to understand which could be frustrating, but we all were struggling together and trying to deepen our understanding. They did make me rethink many things, such as the role of work, the experiences of trans people, and feminist theory.",
                "YES. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm a humanities major who has taken a ton of great classes. The syllabus for this course is second to nonethe way you think about the state and politics will never be the same. The reading for a humanities seminar is very lowonly about 50-75 pages a week. And the papers are both engaging and flexible. Evan is also such a passionate teacher!",
                "yes, it was interesting",
                "absolutely. The assignments exist to help make sure you're getting something out of the class, not to kill you or because they are unnecessary. I found them all good ways to facilitate engagement and usually pretty fun. Also, the material was not something I'd encountered before, and I could listen to Evan eloquently discuss the human condition any day. He is great.",
                "Yes absolutely! if not for the prof but for the level of engagement one will encounter in the niche world of 20th-century philosophy. This ended up being *that* Yale Philosophy course that radically changed my point of view especially in reinventing my opinions on the History of Science and Medicine along with its limitations and capabilities.",
