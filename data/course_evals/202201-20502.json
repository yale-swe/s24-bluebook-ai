                "Through this course, I learned in detail about some of the Russian literature written by Vladimir Nabokov. Each text that we read is a sort of exploration of people who have some connection to art and the creation of art, and through this, I learned to think and examine the concepts of art and talent in a different way. I also gained knowledge about the various literary devices and themes that Nabokov employs in his text, which helped me understand the texts in much greater detail. I also think that my writing greatly improved in this course because Professor Muravnik provides excellent feedback on reading responses and exams and because through the study of Russian literature and some of the vocabulary that appears in it, I was able to learn how to express myself more eloquently in the language.",
                "Learned a lot about Nabokov's literature, Nabokov himself, and insight into Russian emigrant spaces of the time. Improved skills in reading in Russian, especially when it comes to more sophisticated literature works.",
                "I developed literary analysis skills in Russian through the course.",
                "Major themes and analysis of Nabokov's major novels. Learned things about what constitutes art that I didn't even know in English. Invaluable opportunity to listen to highly educated discourse in Russian and test myself with the written assignments.",
                "Learned about the philosophy and aesthetics behind Nabokov's Russian works that structure much of the narratives. The supplemental poetry and philosophy texts throughout the course illuminated how Nabokov was thinking and who he was inspired by. Despite being an 'anti-historical' writer, the course gave good insight on the political and cultural background of which Nabokov was writing and living."

            "comments": [
                "This course is extremely well designed in its curriculum and in the material that it covers. Each subsequent text that is read logically complements the text before it and builds on our understanding of Nabokov's literature. The course is split up into four units, each centered around one of Nabokov's major Russian works: \"The Eye,\" \"The Luzhin Defense,\" \"Invitation to a Beheading,\" and \"The Gift.\" In each unit, you write a reading response once you are close to finishing the discussion about the text and there is a vocabulary quiz that includes vocabulary important to understanding the literature and an exam about the important themes. There are also guiding questions included with each part of the text that we read, and Professor Muravnik also provides supplementary materials that can really broaden your view and understanding of the deeper themes in the books that you read. This structure really allows for a full understanding of Nabokov's texts. I also think another strength is Professor Muravnik himself. He truly makes the class enjoyable and he is a wonderful professor with a great breadth and depth of knowledge on this subject and Russian literature. He is incredibly passionate about what he teaches and there was never really a dully moment in class because of all of his explanations and how he led the discussion. There really were no weaknesses.",
                "Strength: open discussion each class that really clarifies the sometimes confusing readings. The way class was structured was great; it really felt that it reinforced my understanding of what I have read without too much stress.",
                "Most of the people taking the class are heritage speakers or straight up Russian, and as one of the few non-heritage students, it was a great opportunity to listen to actual Russians discussing literature in Russian, and improve my listening and speaking abilities.",
                "Professor Muravnik is the biggest strength. He makes this class. His insights on analysis and leadership during the discussion were just so wonderful to absorb. Course is extremely well-organized and there are plenty of materials to help guide understanding. The questions per chapter are particularly useful. \r\n\r\nThe drawback is just the volume of material. It's very easy to get behind and once you do, a daunting task to try and catch up. Also just difficult to squeeze so much into a single semester. I don't think that I'd change the format though. Possibly just removing the first text that we read () or asking us to read just selections from that so that we can cover it faster. Because  takes forever to read and discuss properly. \r\n\r\nWould also appreciate more of an opportunity to speak in class. Or maybe designating a day when we need to come prepared to discuss. Professor Muravnik did a good job of flexing by giving us specific questions to answer. I think that kind of targeted questioning was really useful. Would've appreciated more opportunities to speak up a little bit.",
                "I think the only weakness would be the structure of class time-- we sometimes did not get through all the discussion questions or chapters we needed to discuss because of lengthy commentary on the first couple questions or the epigraph. This isn't necessarily a weakness, as the discussion we would have that would take up a lot of time gave me an incredible insight onto the minutiae, details, as well as overarching themes in Nabokov's novels. These discussions arise in part, thanks to Constantine's deep knowledge of Nabokovian devices and tactics that would elude even the most versed Nabokov scholar. I think the class as a whole just might need to be a bit more mindful in terms of how much time we discuss each question/chapter/ or section of the text so we can get through everything within the constraints of class time."

                "TAKE THIS COURSE! Nabokov is a great writer and Muravnik is a great teacher. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You will learn a great deal about Vladimir Nabokov and his art, and Professor Muravnik is an excellent professor. If you are interested at all in this writer or in Russian literature, this will be a very fulfilling course. However, I will say that this class should be taken with a very strong background in the Russian language, after a number of advanced courses in the subject. There is quite a bit of reading at times and the texts can be very difficult to understand as they are full of subtleties and difficult language.",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in the subject, this class and the discussions are great!",
                "I would recommend the class to only people studying Russian, as a good amount of knowledge in Russian is needed.",
                "Yes!!!\r\n\r\nInvaluable practice for Russian, Professor Muravnik is outstanding, and the material is really interesting. It's a lot. Like, a lot. But Professor Muravnik recognizes when you're trying. And he allows for that in the grading and in the feedback. It's overwhelming in a good way. There's a lot to come back to in this class, even after you finish out the semester. Both in terms of the language and the literature itself. Would highly recommend if you're looking to ramp up your Russian in a major way.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course to another student. I thought it was extremely interesting, fueled by close-readings of complex texts and  intellectually stimulating discussions. We got to the heart of Nabokov's aesthetics and view of the artist in society, pulling from his works written in Russian. I think the reason this course is so good, is not only the professor, but also the streamlined syllabus. We read in order, the first period of Nabokov's career, so it felt that there was a natural progression of the course that followed Nabokov's own progression of ideas and style. The cross pollination in this course between philosophy, prose, and poetry was another positive factor-- we drew from multiple secondary sources that illuminated the original text in a way that would be impossible without them."
