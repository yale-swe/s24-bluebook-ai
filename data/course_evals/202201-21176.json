Although visual thinking is required for art majors, I felt like as a student who was more serious about art-making that the class was not challenging enough. Assignments were very flexible, which is a strength, but critiques were not rigorous, and it was on youas a self-directed studentto challenge yourself. On the individual scale, this system works, but when you are expected to be in the same class with a lot of other students who arent as serious, its disheartening and un-motivating.",
