                "Absolutely, and I would also recommend going to Wang Laoshi's office hours, because she will read over drafts, but more to chat and learn from an incredible person and gem of an instructor. She studied Chinese literature in Taiwan, has been at Yale for decades, and has such a wealth of knowledge about teaching and the Chinese tradition.",

                "Yeah definitely, I think this was a great class and the community of this class is also great. The instructors force the students to interact and encourage the students to hangout outside of the class. It was one of the few classes where time genuinely flew because I was either learning about Chinese culture or listening to Wang Laoshi's funny ass stories.",
                "Yes! Since this was a heritage class, many of peers come from similar background as me, and we were able to build a very strong and supportive community through this course."
