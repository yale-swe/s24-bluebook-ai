            "comments": [
                "We were able to go through a lot of different texts about immigration which aren't usually touched on and just critiquing the systems the United States have established to criminalize immigrants.",
                "I learned so much from this course! I was able to engage with a lot of histories of US immigration that I honestly had either not heard of or dived very deeply into before through this class. It was really great, though, to see how there are a lot of patterns and parallels throughout history which I think is helpful when trying to think about immigration in a policy sense today.",
                "Through this course, I learned more about the history of US immigration, especially the biologization of race and the construction of the racial \"other\" as well as the various xenophobic arguments that have been used over the decades to justify the exclusion of certain populations of people. Additionally, this course highlighted how the existence of any border implies the violence of its maintenance. What does it mean to construct a border? What does it mean to deem someone a criminal? How are restrictions on immigration connected to the prison industrial complex? How are the gender and sexuality of immigrants also used against them in justifying their detainment and abuse by associating migrants with contagions?",
                "Strengthened skills in primary and second source analyses; learned how to present, lead a discussion, and summarize\/analyze texts; learned how to work on a semester-long project; had an in-depth overview of (Im)migration policies and histories in America",
                "This course provided so much insight into immigration history and how intertwined it is with race. It brought to light many different issues that so many of us in the class have either never learned about or knew very little. This course has by far been one of the most informative classes I have ever taken and provided a solid foundation for understanding race and immigration in context to U.S. history. Overall, this course taught me to be more critical of the readings we are presented with, even if they have great arguments as there is always likely to be some nuance.",
                "Learned nuances and connections of immigration policy to systemic racism, capitalism, and white supremacy. This course, through exploration of immigration policy throughout chronological time periods, effectively enlightens students on how US agendas have gatekept US citizenship and limited \r\n nonwhite immigrant mobility through the use of \"criminality\" and \"illegality\" ascribed to \"alien\" immigrants in order to preserve a white America.\r\n\r\nExtensively built and refined historical analysis skills: identifying the role of biases, perspectives, and backgrounds of primary and secondary sources. Primary sources included government reports, art pieces from different eras (visit to YUAG), political cartoons, newspapers, visual media, etc. Weekly student presentations allowed the class to analyze authors' proximity to their work, diverse student perspectives on each week's readings, and the context in which each reading fit into the overall \"big picture\" of America. \r\n\r\nFurther, the course culminates in the \"final project\" which allows students to begin researching a proposed topic early in the semester (though at a manageable pace). The segmentation of this project allowed me (and I believe I speak for most other students as well) to deeply explore a topic in immigration history while implementing the themes I encountered in class into my work. This work took the form of either a traditional history paper or a project allowing students to express their creativity while retaining the formal academic expectations of an upper-level seminar. The end result is a project that demonstrates your efforts throughout the semester and is incredibly rewarding and satisfying. \r\n\r\nThis course has allowed me to feel closer to the History and ER&M departments at Yale and allowed me to emulate historians' practices in my own research and comportment.",
                "I learned a lot about how white supremacy and capitalism have influenced immigration policy since the founding of the United States. In class, we also analyzed how intersectionality plays a role in the experiences of immigrants and how history is told from multiple lenses.",
                "I learned a lot about how to think deeply about the purposes of media, especially placing them within historical contexts as part of political missions. I learned so much about immigration in this country and how immigration has never not been racialized.",
                "I learned extensively about the intersection of race and immigration in the United States. Spanning the entirety of U.S. history, we covered topics from racial capitalism to drone surveillance.",
                "I gained an overview of immigration patterns to the US and how the US governmental aparatases treated these groups differently. I learned how media and American film is intertwined with these stories. I also learned how to effectively analyze primary sources beyond using them as sources for literature reviews.",
                "I learned how to properly conduct research, write an academic paper, and synthesize information.",
                "I learned so much about evaluating primary sources, creating research projects, and participating in productive class discussions. I think this is one of the best humanities seminars I have been in at Yale."

            "comments": [
                "There were a lot of readings and the Professor was very understanding. There are no weaknesses at all with this course.",
                "Some of the (many) strengths of this course were the schedule, the class discussions, and the research feedback and other support. For one, the way this course was structured was so helpful to balancing such a big project with the rest of my classes. By giving us small assignments to get started on our final project from the beginning of the course, I felt much more prepared by the end to write my paper. We also got time in class to work on it which was very helpful. There were also very flexible deadlines which made weeks where I was loaded down with lots of other work much easier. The class discussions were also a highlight. I felt like everyone was really engaging with the material and having conversations, not simply trying to get \"participation\" points. I think this speaks to the way discussion was structured and introduced from the beginning as well as the variety of ways discussion was led throughout the semester (big groups, small groups, etc.). Lastly, I thought the research support and feedback was really great. The comments (and releasing grades after comments) were very useful and once again, the extra time in class to work on the projects was so helpful. I also appreciate when scheduling an office hours is a requirement early on in the semester because it encourages me to go and interact with my instructor throughout the semester.",
                "Honestly very few weaknesses. In terms of strengths, the readings are incredibly interesting and not too dense, and you can skim them and still contribute during class. Additionally, the assignments are extremely doable. Lastly, Monique gives SUCH GOOD FEEDBACK. For each large assignment, she provided almost an entire paragraph of hand-written feedback.",
                "Strengths: weekly individual presentation is a good refresher for the weekly reading, the final project allows us to delve deeper into a topic of immigration history of our interest, Monique is extremely kind and understanding when it comes to giving deadlines, and her feedback on my writing assignments are very helpful. \r\nWeakness: this class is a broad overview of immigration history, and sometimes I wish we could have delved deeper into one sub-group for more than one week. Otherwise, I really enjoyed learning in this class.",
                "Strengths: Monique does an INCREDIBLE job at facilitating discussions during class and is very understanding of the needs of her students. Monique truly makes the class a space that is conducive to learning and establishes community guidelines with everyone in the beginning.  Truly one of the few instructors that I have met so far at Yale that I know will become an amazing professor. Other strengths include the variety of readings. It wasn't just purely academic works but the readings also included graphic novels and lighter pieces. Another strength of the course is the variety of topics it covers within such a short time frame and how it continuously draws back on ideas from earlier classes. \r\nWeaknesses: Overall, I can really only say that the weakness I think this course has is the amount of readings. While I understand the importance of doing the readings and the fact that the class only meets once per week, it still felt very heavy piled on top of other classes. Something that I think might potentially remedy this and something that Monique started to implement towards the end is highlighting certain readings that are important for our understanding of the topic that week.",
                "Strengths: Monique as an instructor alone is an incredible strength of this course; she is incredibly knowledgable concerning immigration policy and one of the most approachable instructors I have ever engaged with. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the course is very accessible but also very thoroughly engages with the subject material. Monique ensures that every student understands the readings, higher-level vernacular often employed in academic works, and the implications of every government action on the large-scale narrative of the US citizen and the US \"other\". Through presentations, her own and students', each week's readings are rigorously examined and interpreted in light of the era's popular culture and legislative trends. I came in with limited knowledge of US immigration policy (not much more than my high school history courses) and am leaving well-versed in different theories and perspectives regarding US immigration. This course's accessibility to students willing to learn about the topic is immense, and I am grateful to have had such a marvelous instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "This course creates a safe space for students to analyze and understand something as hard as immigration policy and the experiences of immigrants. There was definitely a sense of community built amongst the students and with the instructor as well. Something that can be improved is that the assignments be handed back just a little bit earlier so that students can look at that feedback before completing the next assignment. Overall, this is a great course that everyone should take.",
                "The class was so well-organized and the readings were chosen so well. I also liked how transparent and understanding Monique was. Class time was always used differently which kept the conversations interesting. The class also felt incredibly student-led which is difficult to come across.",
                "This course was thoughtfully organized. The assignments were helpful and the readings were insightful. I could not have asked for a better course both in terms of content and organization.",
                "This seminar worked well through its somewhat-flipped-classroom approach; we did readings for homework, then each one of us presented a summary of the reading and posed discussion questions. After the discussions, Monique led us in a short conversation\/gave a short presentation, using media (political cartoons and films) to guide our final discussion. This format allowed for a very structured and organized course that facilitated retention of information, while avoiding long, monotonous rambling. The only improvement would be to incorporate some kind of interaction with local immigrants New Haven (although this was not possible due to COVID this year).",
                "This class was great! The seminar format was conducive to student learning and Professor Ulyssess led discussions that were fruitful. The readings were interesting and I genuinely looked forward to going to class each week.",
                "Strengths - flexible deadlines, fantastic professor, lots of really interesting material and opportunities to engage\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a very heavy workload"

                "Yes! This was a great course if you are even the slightest bit interested in immigration history in the US. Not only did I learn a lot but Monique made it a very welcoming and supportive environment where I was able to enjoy my work. Its also a great class to get a writing credit (and work on those skills) since there is so much flexibility and support along the way.",
                "YES. Monique made this class as wonderful as it was. She created an environment that I looked forward to entering every week and where students felt comfortable sharing their thoughts on quite personal and political topics. I feel as though I have a much better understanding of how immigrants have been classified over time to excuse their exclusion and abuse. I was a prison abolitionist before taking this class, but this course clarified how the abolition of prisons is deeply connected to the abolition of borders. Both inmates and immigrants are classified as contagions in various contexts, and crossing a manufactured division should never be deemed illegal.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn more about immigration history and read really interesting texts.",
                "Absolutely; the content that we learned in this class was so enlightening and changed my perspective on contemporary immigration issues; I loved how the topics covered many different communities of color and their stories, and different time periods.",
                "YES! Especially if Monique is teaching this class. It truly has been one of my favorite classes here at Yale and one of the most important ones you can take within the ER&M field regarding immigration. This course really opened my eyes to the erased history of immigration and provided a wide range of readings to learn about it. If you are worried about the writing aspect, don't be !!! This class is conducive to bettering your writing and working with Monique will give you the opportunity to grow as a writer. Additionally, the workload isn't too much to handle. Overall, an unforgettable course with such an amazing instructor.",
                "Absolutely! This course was truly transformative to my Yale experience, and I hope every student gets the opportunity to interact with Monique. \r\n\r\nAcademically, the course forces students to question and analyze how the justice and legal systems are used, and even designed, to purport the archetype of 'White America'  exploring how nonwhite folx have historically and are continuously excluded from the narrative of US citizenship. The themes throughout the course are pivotal to understanding the structural violence that exists against immigrant and marginalized communities even today. \r\n\r\nThe course is very accessible to students wishing to either further develop or understand for the first time the role of law and government agendas in shaping a homogeneously white population. The course exposes students to a myriad of primary sources (including nontraditional sources like film and art) to build analytical skills that are imperative to historical research and writing. The reading workload is very manageable and engaging for students interested in this field. Weekly presentations further allow for these readings to be applied to course themes and for other students to share diverse takeaways from an author's voice and perspective. \r\n\r\nMonique is extremely perceptive, understanding, and accomodating of students' experiences and backgrounds. This fostered a very healthy learning environment where learning and growth were emphasized. As a student of color, I felt that my opinions, thoughts, and comments were always respected and empowered through this course. I never felt uncomfortable disclosing personal experiences, unlike many other seminars I have taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nThis course is immensely gratifying, and I hope you choose to take it and are offered a seat!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the instructor is amazing and very sensible about how we discuss hard topics and understand how things happened in the past relative to us.",
                "Definitely. The course is so interesting and Monique is such a great instructor.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially if Monique is the instructor for it. The content is interesting and important to think about in the context of today's immigration debate. I enjoyed seeing the parallels between each week and the course covered an expansive list of topics.",
                "Yes, by all means to all students. This course has encouraged me to consider pursuing ER&M and has made me excited about pursuing immigration law in the future. The course is well-organized, thoughtful, and considerate of the sensitive and personal nature of the histories discussed.",
                "Yes! This class focused on so much untaught history. It truly has been one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes - Monique is fantastic and she organizes the course in a way that feels as though you get to speed run all of US immigration history. The final project feels rewarding, and you have something to show for it. There is a lot of flexibility and you constantly have opportunities to be curious about all kinds of stuff."
