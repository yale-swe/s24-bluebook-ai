                "I saw no strengths to this course. The lectures were occasionally interesting with the professor giving tidbits of information that one wouldn't find In a textbook. However, he seemed to be more interested in talking about his experiences and visits to the places related to that week's lecture than he was in actually teaching. I think a recorded lecture would have been better because it would have ensured that prof stayed on topic. The discussion sections were terrible...The TA sent out a document with questions the night before, students answered the questions in the doc, and on the day of the discussion section just read out their answers. WHAT A HUGE WASTE OF TIME!!!",
                "Weaknesses: The lectures aren't based off of the reading material so it's not really anything that is particularly important or useful. I think talking about the reading material could help the lectures, but it kind of forces you into doing the reading if you want to get anything out of the course. The paper assignment felt really vague, and the discussion sections weren't really that structured, although that can also be a strength. \r\n\r\nStrengths: The paper assignment was also part of our midterm, which was honestly really great because it gave me an advance on the writing process that I otherwise definitely would not have had.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the professor and TF's were absolutely wonderful, and the content covered was very interesting.",
                "strengths: interesting material, assignments helped learning\r\nweaknesses: lectures were disorganized and I felt like a lot of the learning came from the textbook",
                "I thought that the course was very interesting and also casual, so it was easy to take for a good foundation of European history. I loved the professor and my TA and thought that they were very invested in our learning, which I very much appreciated. However, it was relatively disorganized, as I had no sense of my grade or even what the final would be like until right before it. I enjoyed the course but would have appreciated a little more structure.",
                "Strengths: Prof Merriman is engaging and fun, and very knowledgeable about every subject you can think of in the class. Also, he would send out a list of key points before lectures with which we could follow along. The TFs were kind and knowledgeable as well. My first survey course at Yale, but I enjoyed it.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes a bit hard to follow. The readings were long and full of information, which is to be expected, but it was difficult to know what information needed to be retained. Only 3 main assignments to be graded.",
                "Only having a final paper and final exam make it difficult to determine how well you understand the material, not a lot of feedback",
                "All you really needed to do was to read one textbook he provided, so it was a pretty relaxing course. Sometimes the lectures can feel a bit off topic because the professor veers off into whatever he likes the most, but his passion can make such tangents fun. The sections also do a surprisingly good job of keeping one engaged with the material.",
                "The course is disorganized and the reading load is unreasonable for an introductory class. One of the assignments is a 10-page research paper, which is not specified in the syllabus (it is only referred to as a 'short paper'), so students had no idea about this when they enrolled. Besides the fact that this was not mentioned anywhere on the syllabus, expecting students to write 10 pages of original research seems contrary to the very idea of an introductory lecture course. I have taken a few introductory level courses at Yale in different departments, and none of them have ever asked their students to complete such a substantial assignment. It would be all well and good if it were an advanced seminar, but it's not."

                "Yes 100% this is a great class and the real gem is listening to Merriman's stories during lectures. He is absolutely incredible. You don't really get any actual historical content from the lectures  those are all from the readings  but the classes are very entertaining (be prepared for many tangents, though). Honestly, a lot of this class is very social so having friends in the class + in your section can make or break the experience. If you took AP euro in high school then you really don't have to do the readings at all to understand what's going on for section, and the only work you have to do is one 10 page paper and the final, which is super manageable.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you just need a credit. You are better off just reading the textbook than wasting your time attending lectures.",
                "Unless you need to take this as an intro class or want to sit in lectures with Prof Merriman, I wouldn't take it.",
                "Yes. This was a wonderful course. Each lecture was better than the last.",
                "Unfortunately, probably not. I was very excited to take a survey course in European History, and this seemed perfect, but it fell short. The main issue for me was that lectures were all over the place and mostly the professor talking about his personal experiences with French history\/living in France. I have heard amazing things about Prof. Merriman as a lecturer, so perhaps this was just due to COVID-related difficulties in adapting his lecture style, but I found lectures disorganized and confusing, and mostly him listing place names of towns he visited in France. I learned very little from the lectures, and Prof. Merriman would often finish a lecture by saying, \"eh okay just go read the book.\" I don't think he did this because he doesn't want to put effort into teaching and would rather us learn from the textbook, as some professors do, but rather I think this course tries to cover a LOT of material and Prof. Merriman wants lecture to be a fun, interesting discussion of more specific themes and events that we already have a good background in. So at the end of the day, this might work well for those who already know European history well and just want to hang out with Merriman (that was the vibe I got from the group of students, with a lot of history majors). However, for me, a STEM major who never took AP Euro, it was disappointing and I really didn't learn that much at all. That being said, it is an ok fifth class with a very light workload (midterm paper proposal, 10-12 page paper, and pretty easy final exam). TF Paul Seltzer was AWESOME and since it was a laid back virtual semester this worked okay overall. Just don't expect to learn a ton or be all that engaged.",
                "Yes",
                "This is a great intro history course",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a foundation in European history and a more relaxed class. It is definitely not the most rigorous course that I took at Yale, but I enjoyed that because I was able to enjoy the professor, my section, and the history without the same level of stress.",
                "Yes, great introduction to European history with interesting lectures and assigned readings.",
