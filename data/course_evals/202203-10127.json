Topics included elasticity, stress-strain relationships, viscoelasticity, classical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and how micro-scale properties of a system translate into macro-scale properties.",
                "I learned that mechanics can be applied to biology in a way that relates previous knowledge of statics and thermodynamics. In particular, I gained insight into understanding the ways that subjects can integrate into one another. Specifically, in terms of skills it was mostly conceptual and there was minimal skills developed.",

The application of math to biological concepts was something new to me and I loved professor Murrell's way of doing so. This class taught me so many concepts that, even if I forget the math behind them, will be extremely useful to my career."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: learned a lot, prof. Murrell is always receptive if you have questions\r\nweaknesses: sometimes there are inconsistencies between what we are taught in lecture and what the notes actually say, which can be a bit confusing sometimes. Also I personally don't see a point in not offering some form of notes or recorded lecture, even if it's made available upon email request. I walked to class with a splinter in my foot so I wouldn't be late to lecture.",
                "The requirement to sign up for office hours 24 hours in advance was restrictive. Also, reducing office hours during the week of both midterms wasnt great.",
                "Strengths: Murrell did an AMAZING job of lecturing. Everything was so easy to follow and the notes he gives are so easy to go back and refer to. He was also just an awesome person as well. \r\nWeakness: The TAs genuinely had no clue what was going in the course",
                "I liked that the psets and daily quizzes were ungraded. I also liked that psets resembled exams, so I knew exactly what to expect going into exams.",
                "Strengths: Prof Murrell is a wonderful lecturer and keeps lectures engaging! I loved his recaps at the beginning of each lecture, as it helped orient myself as to where we were in the course. I also though the topics we covered were interesting and relevant to biology, especially biomechanics and biomaterials.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The support system for the course could be improved. The sign-up policy made office hours very inaccessible, and the TAs were not allowed to give us help on the process behind some of the pset problems. Additionally, as most of the exams were just pset problems, it rewarded those who memorized the pset processes and solutions as opposed to those who actually understood the course materials and were prepared to apply it to new scenarios.",
                "I believe that the course is a mixed bag in that the course has great content and has a terrible execution of evaluating intellectual growth. In particular, the exams were all problems that were the same from PSETs which rewards and trains a student to memorize the PSETs. The course itself has content that is extremely niche and highly relevant to academia only; there should be an effort to create more content/skills that can be applicable to industry such as prosthetic design or heart valve creation.",
                "Weaknesses: not posting solutions to PSETs, not having flexible office hours, not willing to review math concepts, not correcting mistakes in class, saying that something would not be on the exam and then putting it on the exam, not posting solutions to midterms until the last week of class, not allowing TAs to go over quantitative problems, not understanding that when students' ask for help it's because they need help, having just exams make up the final grade, not giving enough time to solve the quantitative problems on exams, not providing students with sample midterms, not providing literally any resources for this course so that students can struggle on their own, not doing enough quantitative problems in class and barely covering differential equations in class even though it's on the exam\r\n\r\nStrengths: peer tutor (specifically Aiden)\r\n\r\nImprovements: Include PSETs as part of the grade. Create original problems for the exam and provide step-by-step solutions for the PSETS. If we aren't able to learn how to do the problems and how problems are rewarded points, how are we expected to do well on the exams? Offer more office hours and make them more accessible by removing the sign-up requirement. When students ask questions, don't shut the question down by saying we should already know it! Why would we ask if we already knew the answer? We don't want to waste our time as much as we aren't trying to waste yours. Include practice exams so that we can challenge ourselves. The point of exams shouldn't be memorization, and I feel that students who did well on the exams used memorization to their advantage since it's impossible to remember every single strategy taken on the PSETs to complete the problem perfectly in the time frame given on the exam.",
                "I wish the psets counted toward our grade to lessen the stress of tests and to pace the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Murrell is a really great lecturer -- very engaging, talks slowly enough for you to comprehend, explains things in different ways that make them easier to understand. The exams were a reasonably difficult challenge. There is amazing support if you need it! I genuinely have never had a more knowledgeable and helpful pair of TAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exams were extra stressful knowing that they were the only thing that counted for the grade. I think it would have been nice if the PSETs were graded, because everyone did them anyways.",
                "Strengths: pace of the course \r\nWeakness: many of the equations and example problems in the lectures were incorrect, so it was very difficult to figure out problem set problems or to know which formulas to memorize",
                "Strengths were definitely in the instructionProf. Murrell is a fantastic instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were in the grading structure. Having only exams contribute to the final grade gave me more anxiety leading up to midterms and finals.",
                "This course was very well structured for learning. The lectures were engaging and interesting. The exams also were reasonable given the material.  The feedback given for each exam was very helpful for future assessments. The quizzes and problem sets were extremely useful and great study materials. I liked that the homework was not graded nor had a due date. This allowed me to take as much time with the material as I needed to. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course would be the small amount of exams, their time constraints, and the lack of lecture note accessibility. We only had three exams which counted for our grade. This made each exam quite stressful as it was worth a lot. The time given for the exam often felt very tight. Finally, it would be lovely if the lecture notes were posted as sometimes it was really hard to get a cohesive understanding of a lecture if you  missed a small portion of class.",
                "There werent that many office hours and they were at hard times as well as there were never solutions for any of the hw so it was hard to learn from your mistakes unless you could go to office hours",
                "Overall a terrific instructor and TAs",
                "This course provides many opportunities to learn the information in the course, with problem sets, quizzes, and tests. One area in which the course can be improved is that sometimes the information in class is incorrect or inconsistent with other assigment answers.",
                "The fact that the class had ungraded homework was something I did't anticipate liking as much as I did. It emphasized the desire to learn for its own sake and made me be much more engaged since I knew I wasn't constantly getting feedback, I knew I had to put my part to get it. This may seem like something many people would dislike, but I think it was crucial to removing the stress of learning and infusing it with genuine curiosity, which I find infinitely more valuable. The drawback, of course, was that the entirety of the grade was based off exams, which can be very stressful. However, the professor made the exams very approachable and something that, if you understood the concepts well enough, was very doable. I talked to some other students who took the class before and seeing the difference makes me extremely glad the format was changed and this was the class I got to take."

                "Yes, this class seemed daunting at first given the diagnostic exam. But the content was very organized and structured. The Professor really knows what hes talking about and can communicate excellently. So it was easy to follow along. Actively paying attention in class is the most important key to success in the class, as he works out most of the types of exam problems right there in front of you in class. The class is kind of difficult conceptually but again, the Professor makes sure everyone is clear and on the same page.",
                "This is one of the required courses for BME students, and I would say that it is one of the better requirements! The material is super interesting and it's a great way for BME majors to get an intro to some of the more niche topics in physics and chem, such as thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.",
                "If you are BME you have to take, but if you are thinking of taking this as an elective for another major like MechE do not do this course. There are better courses out there that will teach useful skills.",
                "This class is so poorly taught and there are no resources for students. You are on your own. I understand that biomechanics is essential for BME, but until another professor teaches this course or until this course is designed in away for students to actually learn, it should be removed as a requirement. \r\n\r\nMurrell drastically changes the design of this course every year, and after speaking to several different students who have taken it different years (including grad students), this course never improves. I honestly think the MechE students who take strength and deformations learn more and better than what we did in this course. \r\n\r\nDO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO !!",

                "If you need to take biomechanics, I would absolutely recommend!! The professor is very accessible and the material is really interesting. In addition, this class is used as a foundation for some of the other BME electives.",
                "This course was really frustrating clearly prof murell cares and he does try and help you but it was really hard to learn from my mistakes and I felt a lot of prior math knowledge was needed and not gone over in class.",
                "Yes very interesting",
