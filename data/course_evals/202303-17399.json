As someone who came into this course knowing little about wetlands in any technical sense, I am coming away from it with a deeper appreciation for wetlands everywhere but especially for the wetlands I personally know and spend time in.",

                "Strengths -- professor and TF's feedback are frequent and helpful. Lectures engaging and often fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- readings sometimes felt unrelated to course content. In class discussions felt unnecessary at times.",
                "I thought the curriculum was very well structured; though I was dubious at the beginning of the course when it felt like we were spending ages learning just about wetland definition, I was later glad that we spent this time developing the foundations of knowledge necessary, and I felt the course proceeded very well from there, going from the ecological principles of wetlands in the first half of the course to more applied use of knowledge in the latter half. I thought the readings were interesting and effective and not too onerous, and I liked the wetlands in the news component. I appreciated the structure of the class too, and that each meeting was broken down into WiTN, a lecture, and then discussion. I really enjoyed our two field trips and our trips to the Peabody, which I thought all complemented the content of the course really well while making for fun excursions. Lastly, I thought that the dispersal of assignments (problem sets, field trip write-ups, quizzes, and exams) was excellent, and I thought the two exams were decently challenging but also very effective.\r\nThe one weakness I can think of was that the problem sets often took me a very long time, but this was actually already remedied in a way: I appreciated how the third problem set was shorter, and a word limit was imposed for each question. I would recommend taking this approach again in the future.",
                "Strengths: clear learning expectations, interesting readings and material, engagement with readings during class, and class field trips helped apply class concepts to the real world. The classes held in the Peabody were very interesting and furthered applied class concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: expectations weren't always clear, and some background knowledge is assumed such as how to cite work.",
                "I think this course was very engaging and interactive, although it could have been better organized to facilitate more discussion",
                "High workload, but interesting and moves at a good pace. Loved the fieldtrips",
                "Strengths- I absolutely loved the class trips. Being fully immersed in the wetlands themselves and seeing the fauna and flora in their natural habitat, applying what we learned in the classroom to the outdoors experience was very eye-opening. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I felt that a lot of the lectures had breezed through key material without explaining their meaning. This class is not for wetlands ecology beginners as I often felt very behind compared to my classmates. Also, the problem sets were not helpful to prepare for the quizzes and there was a lot of grey area when it came to that."

                "Yes, I would! This class has a very effective mix of ecological learning and learning of management strategies which allowed for a comprehensive overlook of the topic. Professor Freidenburg has clear expertise in the topic and works her knowledge of field work and conservation into class. There is an active effort to engage student learning on multiple levels, from individual quizzes to class group work. The field trips were some of the most fun I have had in a class at Yale. The Peabody trips allowed students to handle the specimens that we learned about in class. For the most part, learning expectations were very clear and I was able to succeed in the class by following these expectations.",
                "Absolutely! Such a fun class!",
                "Definitely, but only if interested in wetlands or an Environmental Studies major. Not a very general course.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in this topic, but be prepared to have a lot of work. Definitely not a science a gut.",
