                "This class provided a really strong basis of knowledge around the scientific research being done with autism today/in the last decade. There's a good opportunity to practice research skills with the final paper and you can go really in-depth with what you want to talk about and potentially use that to make up for what the course doesn't cover.",

                "strengths: Professor Volkmar is an incredible resource and THE person to learn from about autism. Course is organized by lectures/topics which felt thematic and easy to follow along with. Workload wasn't too heavy. \r\nweaknesses: Very little/no feedback on assignments (although they don't really matter much). Final paper turnaround is quite short considering that you still have to do classwork during the last week in addition to writing 10-15 pages. Some of the neuroscience readings are a little jargon heavy and can be difficult for those not from a hard STEM background to grasp.",
                "Strengths: This course was very engaging! Prof Volkmar made each session fun and interesting with his deep knowledge of the field. The response papers kept us engaged with the material as well and was very freeform, which I liked. Weaknesses: It was too short! But that's understandable since it was the summer.",
                "I honestly didnt think there were any weaknesses. I wouldve liked a tad more feedback on my response papers.",
                "The class focuses exclusively on a medical model of autism and doesn't delve at all into social/disability/political models. Many of the researchers that the course engage with explicit profess a hope that a cure for autism will one day be discovered/they're working towards that and the harm that stems from those beliefs is not touched upon. There's similarly little engagement (besides one guest lecturer for half of a class) with autistic people (the semester course is better for this in some ways since you're volunteering at the same time at Chapel Haven). \r\n\r\nThere wasn't a lot of feedback given at any point. My final paper got a generic sentence of comment and a grade. None of my reading responses were ever engaged with. I sent several emails to the TF/Professor Volkmar that either got no or a very cursory reply. There were a few times when we were told we'd be emailed follow up resources and simply weren't. Similarly in class there was never an opportunity for real discussion - which I think helped to prevent any going into non-medical models of autism and other theoretical interventions on the issues - questions were asked from reading responses and then answered in semi-lecture style by Professor Volkmar with occasional factual questions going the other way. There was little to no interrogation of the material we were reading really. \r\n\r\nNext time the course is taught there also needs to be coherence on what readings are actually assigned for each class (the Canvas modules, the pdf syllabus, and the drive folder of the readings all pretty regularly disagreed. There's already a high volume of reading so not knowing what to look at and having more was overwhelming at times.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Volkmar is a very good lecturer, and the open nature of the discussions allowed for unique conversations to occur. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There could be a little more support for the term paper",

                "Yes! This was a fun class to a very niche field in psychology and there isn't a better teacher than Prof Volkmar. He really knows this field like the back of his hand and Luke was also great with communicating and supporting the students if they had any questions.",
                "One thousand percent.",
                "Maybe. If you are autistic or neurodivergent/have suspected that at any point, I'd think really carefully about it - I was really struggling the middle three weeks of the course because of the way the class talks about autism and views it as disorder/defectivity and only got out of that by delving into my final paper. But I think it can be a good jumping off point and knowing the literature is important even if you don't agree with it - the paper was really rewarding for me because I was pushing against the dominant narratives of the class. If you're allistic/neurotypical, only take this class if you're going to engage with social/autistic interventions on the material outside the class (or ideally bring them in) otherwise I suspect you're going to walk away with a very narrow perspective of the disability/current though on it.",
