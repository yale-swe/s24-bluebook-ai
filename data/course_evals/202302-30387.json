I would have liked if maybe we had 45 minutes of lecture and then 45 of discussion and questions.",

I also liked that the main assignments for the course were team-based.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although I liked the team component of the assignments, they frankly felt a little bit bland. The three homework assignments were somewhat interesting, but the midterm and final assignments were just reading and summarizing papers which got pretty old after a while. I suppose I felt like I learned the reviewed topics in depth though.",
