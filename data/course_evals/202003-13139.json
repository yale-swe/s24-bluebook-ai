It totally changed my conception of the Civil Rights Movement, and basically questioned everything I'd been taught in high school or middle school about the civil rights movement and its prominent figures. Feimster approached the course material from an angle of representing the underrepresented, the forgotten, the mistaken, which made the course material all the more interesting.",
                "I learned a large volume of information about the 1920s-1950s Civil Rights Movement. I am much better informed about the history of Civil Rights and the unspoken heroes of Civil Rights (both from the dominant narrative and the less conventional ones). My writing skills improved greatly with clear feedback from my TA, and my understanding of how exclusive history is deepened as well.",

                "A greater understanding of the civil rights movement, beyond the study of key figures typically taught in K-12.",
                "This course was great for learning about the Long Civil Rights movement from the 20s\/30s to the 80s. There is so much to learn that is normally overlooked in history classes!",
                "As the title of this course implies, this class covers the long civil rights movement, not just the \"classical phase\" that dominates most conversations. Because of this, I learned about the aspects that are less talked about, such as the Black Power movement and grassroots organizing. I learned how important local organizing was in this movement and learned about civil rights activists who played an important role (e.g. Ella Baker, Pauli Murray, Florynce Kennedy). Even when we learned about popular activists like MLK and Rosa Parks, we talked about their entire stories and beliefs, not just those that are portrayed in the dominant narrative of the civil rights movement. Finally, I learned how the dominant narrative was used, and continues to be used, by people to justify that equality has been achieved when in reality, there is much work that remains to be done.",
                "I learned about the figures and events in the civil rights movement that are often overlooked. I also learned how these events affect movements today and how certain strategies and tactics are still used today.",
                "I learned a lot about the Civil Rights Movement and how it fits more generally into the black freedom struggle. Specifically, I learned a lot about the Black women who kept the movement alive and how their contributions are often forgotten.",
                "This is a fantastic course, and Professor Feimster organized the class in a way that greatly promoted student learning! We gained an in-depth perspective on so many incredible civil rights activists, from Ella Baker, to Diane Nash, to Rosa Parkss activism beyond the Montgomery Bud Boycotts. \r\n\r\nAll the assignments were very creative (letters to specific people, zine, podcast), so this class also helped me practice the skill of making history accessible and engaging to a widespread audience.",
                "I learned so much about the long civil rights movement and how our perceptions of it are not the most accurate.",
                "I gained a new perspective on the extent of the civil rights movement in America. You learn so much more than you did in high school and in other settings. You explore how the narrative of the civil rights movement that we do learn about is full of half-truths and erasure. It was a great introductory humanities course as well with a manageable workload. No matter what you are majoring in, Professor Feimster and her course are inspiring.",
                "I learned more about how posturing and respectability politics played a large role in the Long Civil Rights Movement. I also learned a lot about women in the Civil Rights movement and the intersection of Women's Lib and Civil Rights.",
                "I gained a broader understanding of the civil rights movement and figures of the CRM who frequently go unnoticed. I learned more about why America is the way it is today. I learned about why we perceive the civil rights movement to be a short period and how that perception is not accidental.",
                "Learned so much about the Civil Rights Movement that isn't traditionally spoken about\/taught",
                "I learned how to contextualize the Black freedom movement within a longer period of labor organizing, WWII politics, Black Power, and women's rights. This course challenged me to disrupt the common notion that the civil rights movement only consisted of the 1954-1965 \"classical phase\"; it also exposed me to many civil rights leaders and community organizers (particularly Black women) who I didn't learn about in my high school U.S. history classes.",
                "I was able to reflect on my own prior exposure to the Civil Rights Movement and understand where there were gaps in material and where some portraits of individuals were incomplete or wholly omitted in my own education. I learned to consider the sanitization of historical events and individuals and the importance of grasping a whole, true history of the CRM that extends beyond its classical period. I learned how political strategy plays a role in the way movements or individuals are portrayed.",
                "I learned to expand my understanding of the periodization and contents of the civil rights movement, to see beyond the revisionist way it's taught in school.",
                "I gained a much better understanding of the civil rights movement. I learned about activists never discussed in high school and came to appreciate the incredible grassroots organizing that is often overlooked.",
                "This class offered me new perspectives and new ways of thinking about the past.",
                "A much better perspective on the Civil Rights Movement, both in its breadth and length.",
                "I learned a lot about the Civil Rights Movement. I thought I knew a lot about it, but I was totally wrong and this course made me painfully aware of that. This course made me realize that I knew less than 10% of what I thought I knew and it was very eye opening.",
                "I learned so much about the Civil Rights movement, leaders, and ideas. A lot of this was contrary to what I had learned before, and so important to know",
                "I have learned to challenge the narrative of a short civil rights movement. I have learned important people, places, and events that existed before the 1960s that set the stage for future Civil Rights work. I learned that I can still be an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement today.",
                "I learned so much about the traditions of the Long Civil Rights Movement and deeper insight into the continuities of strategy over time. In fighting the struggle, activists built off one another and this course revealed that a lot of the boundaries that modern narratives about the civil rights movement try to imply are false. I also appreciated that we looked at figures more holistically and deeply.",
                "I learned about civil rights organizing in the United States from the 1930s through the 1970s. I would say that this course focused on the 1940s-1960s, and we learned mostly about the South for decades prior to the 1960s (although we talked a lot about NYC when learning about the 1930s). This course fit into relatively recent historiography that frames the civil rights movement as a decades-long struggle that was broadly concerned with economic rights and community self-determination, rather than a shorter movement from 1954-1965 that was mainly concerned with desegregation and voting rights. We talked a lot about Ella Baker, and I think this class stressed the importance of local community organizing that's suited to the needs and goals of residents in specific communities. Especially for certain parts of the course, Prof. Feimster used the careers of specific activists (like Baker) to emphasize these ideas.",
                "Along with the expansive knowledge on everything you didn't know about the Civil Rights Movement, you also become a better writer and historian.",
                "We learned a lot about the history of civil rights organizing. We also learned about periods of backlash to civil rights gains, which directly affect the way many of our institutions (don't) serve us today.",
                "I learned a lot about the civil rights movement and how historical narratives have been mobilized to condense and distort it. I learned how to keep my writing concise and accessible through projects that didn't resemble traditional academic papers much, like letters, a zine, and a podcast. This course told history through a fairly large emphasis on biography as well as general histories.",
                "A broad look, and an intersectional look focused on widening the timeframe and actors of the Civil Rights Movement, with a focus on the women, working class, and leftists. An understanding of how learning about a LONG civil rights movement is relevant to today.",
                "A broader knowledge of the civil rights movement outside of the common tropes we see",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of historical mindedness and how we cannot take history for its dominant narratives. Alongside gaining this profound new understanding of history, I also gained more experience with reading historical sources (e.g. documents, journals, etc.).",
                "I learned and relearned information about the Long Civil Rights Movement, specifically about key figures that were overlooked in my high school education.",
                "Long civil rights movement. Fascinating material. Lots to learn beyond the basics of the civil rights movement.",
                "Knowledge about important civil rights leaders that are often overlooked and the events of the civil rights movement that extended beyond the classical period of 1954-1965",
                "This course gave me a much better understanding of the Civil Rights Movement, beyond just MLK or Rosa Parks. I learned about many great activists I had little to no knowledge of.",
                "This class gave me a new light to look at the historical civil rights movement and the contemporary black freedom struggle.",
                "The class gave an expansive history of the civil rights movement, particularly with key players who are often overlooked in the historical memory.",
                "I was able to learn about the multidimensional nature of the civil rights movement and the ways it stretches way beyond the snapshot that is usually presented to us of the mid 1950s to the end of the 1960s.",
                "SO MUCH! This country does a frankly horrible job of educating its children on its history of mistreatment of Black people, and this course wholly fixes and repairs that education. Theres so many people and places and things that are glossed over our traditional education of the Civil Rights Movement, and even though its impossible to learn about all of those that are removed from history, this course does an excellent job of trying to show what really happened and what was happening.",

I learned that despite our societal emphasis on figures like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. and on a short narrative of the civil rights movement from 1954-1965, grassroots organizing starting as early as the 1930s and 1940s was an essential part of the movement.  Also, I learned about the Black Power movement and the differences between nonviolence and self defense.  Overall, this course filled in many gaps in my knowledge and helped me develop a much better understanding of the trajectory of the movement.",
                "This course makes you relearn the history you think you know and dive deeper into the intricacies of the civil rights movement. You come to realize that history often teaches us dominant narratives without telling the stories of grassroots organizers and egalitarian and empathetic leaders. This course takes a great arc starting with the early years of the civil rights movement that we often ignore but that set up what we often describe as the civil rights movement (1950s and 60s), then moves into the traditional (and clearly flawed) definition of the civil rights movement and makes you rethink what you thought you knew about nonviolence and many other areas, and finally makes the very clear connection to contemporary inequities and the modern fight for civil rights.",
                "I developed a greater understanding of the civil rights movement in the decades preceding and following the 50s and 60s. We covered topics, themes, and figures that were important throughout the movement.",
                "I learned how to think critically about history tellers and black history. Who writes the narrative? What does the narrative work to do?",
                "All about the long civil rights movement",
                "This course was amazing. I learned about so many important figures in the Civil Rights Movement, and basically I think many of us learned that we previously held very limited understanding of the Civil Rights Movement - such as its timeline, its key activists and leaders, and how organizing actually occurred. I truly think this class was so important - I have begun to understand the threads of racial injustice and the roots of white supremacy through an economic and social lens, as well as much more. It is an important class, it is curriculum that all students in this country should be learning. Plus, the assignments are engaging, self-reflective, and just very cool and well thought out. Fantastic course all around.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of the civil rights movement. Learned about more than the years that are typically thought about when discussing the movement. Delved deeper into the role of people that are not as well known, learned about modes of activism or strategies used over the years, and the movement's relationship to other movement's such as labor organizing or the women's rights movement.",
                "I learned so much about the Civil Rights Movement. I already knew about so many of injustices inflicted, but I learned so much more beyond the surface level and it was incredibly enlightening. I learned about so many overlooked people throughout the movement, especially women. I also learned that the movement was far more complex, and focused on far more issues, many economic, than I previously thought. Overall, I gained a much deeper and broader understanding of the Civil Rights Movement and I'm incredibly grateful for it.",
                "A comprehensive understanding of civil rights struggles from the 1930s through the 1970s. This may not be the most challenging\/ interesting class if you're well-versed in these histories.",
                "I learned so much about the civil rights movement. It really broadened my view of how much time the civil rights movement actually spanned and how many people were involved, both in front of and behind the scenes. I loved this class!",
                "This was the course I possibly learned the most in. The course concentrated on elongated the Civil Rights movement to include in depth analysis on multiple, relatively unknown, activists.",
                "I learned a lot about the civil rights movement and leaders of the movement who frequently get overshadowed.",
                "This course expanded my knowledge of the traditional Civil Rights Movement in the United States (1960s) to an understanding of the \"long civil rights movement\" (1930s-1970s). To do so, the course foregrounded women of color and queer activists often obscured by traditional history (i.e. Pauli Murray, Ella Baker, and Shirley Chisholm). We analyzed mainstream figures (Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr) and iconic events (The March on Selma and the Civil Rights Act) through more critical lenses, demonstrating the shortcomings of U.S. collective memory of the movement. \r\nStudents not only connected the events of the domestic Civil Rights movement to international and transnational liberation struggles but also connected the notion of a \"past\" struggle to the current Black Lives Matter movement. This skill, in situating our own education in contemporary society, is one that is critical to a college education.",
                "Learned so many new things about the extent of the civil rights movement as well as developing critical analysis skills with primary documents.",
                "SO MUCH new knowledge about the Civil Rights Movement!! As someone who knew next to nothing about the movement, basically every class offered Like illuminating and sometimes shocking knowledge!!",
                "This class helped me understand the Civil Rights Movement in a much broader and deeper sense than I ever had, giving us a frame to view both history and the present",
                "A much more in-depth understanding of the entirety of the civil rights movement and its complexities.",
                "I gained insight into national and global political forces shaping the civil rights movement, and worked to place the civil rights movement in its proper historical context. I also got the chance to engage with some lesser known figures in the Black freedom struggle and do some primary historical research.",
                "I learned a lot of insights about organizing and the long history of racial organizing in the United States, particularly around civil rights in the 20th century. It expanded my view of how the movement was built and its hidden longevity.",
                "Learned about many unsung heroes of the civil rights movements and events reaching beyond the common scope of the era which we were taught in high school. Also some connections made between past and current events",
                "This course built on my previous knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement but taught me so much more. I learned about the debates and controversies during the movement and among its leaders, the main players and leading advocates (especially Black women and the important role of young people and grassroots organizers), and the lasting legacy of the movement and its impact today. I also better understood this notion of a long civil rights movement that extends beyond the classical phase that we usually learn about to refer to the era from the 1930s through the 1970s. I appreciate that this course challenged certain things we are commonly taught and encouraged us to be critical of history and think more critically about what and how we learn. This course also emphasized the importance of history, especially at such a critical moment in our present day. I gained overall skills in reading, writing, and synthesizing research and readings into a cohesive shorter piece (like the letter assignments).",
                "The course is extremely well designed to learn about the long arch of the civil rights movement. Both the course and professor challenge preconceived notions and myths regarding the civil rights movement. I now have a broad view of the movement and can better historicize this integral aspect of American history."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths were that the assignments were fun, the lectures were engaging, the costume parties were amazing, and I felt very supported. I only wish that it had been in person :(",
                "No improvements necessary!",
                "Strengths - Professor Feimster is an amazing lecturer and captivates the attention of students as well as finds way to engage students even remotely\r\nWeakness - Not much direction for assignments",
                "Could be improved by shortening the readings or only having one reading. because there isnt a midterm or final, there are not many incentives to read. \r\n\r\nStrength was the engaging lectures. I loved the themes every Wednesday and the professors' high energy level and kind spirit. I also liked the eyes on the prize movies, and the letter assignments.",
                "The strength for me was the depth of the material we learned. I felt like I got to know so many civil rights activists and organizations closely through Professor Feimster's talks and the readings. I also enjoyed the different formats of assessments, which ranged from letters to zines to podcasts to reading analysis. I always got to use my mind in different ways for the assessments, and I learned how to present information in different formats while still getting the themes\/story I want to show across.",
                "Strengths: good content which makes the lectures engaging, focuses on individual activists (by the end of this course I had a pretty good grip on a wide range of activists), caring and knowledgeable professor, readings are manageable and very interesting, assignments are fun (especially the midterm zine we created)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of!",
                "Professor Feimster is an amazing and engaging lecturer. The readings and discussion sections were helpful for interacting with the material in the course. The assignments were fun, creative, and used materials we learned in class in a different way.",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging lecture, creative assignments that were fun to complete, connection to present-day was made clear \r\nWeaknesses: none; I loved the course!",
                "Strengths: Professor Feimster is such a charismatic, caring, and fun instructor. The readings were my favorite readings of any of my classes this semester (even in comparison to three other history classes I took this semester!). The assignments (letters, zine, podcast) were manageable and creative.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the only weakness is that the topic covers so much, so I feel that there is a lot I dont know about the Civil Rights Movement. But I dont think its the fault of the course itselfrather, the more you learn, the more you dont know!",
                "I liked being able to attend one live lecture a week. The assignments were enjoyable and I liked that there were no exams to cram for. However, I felt the readings were a little too much some weeks.",
                "Strengths- \r\nProfessor Feimster's personality, teaching style, and ability to lecture in an engaging almost story-telling way\r\nCreative projects in place of midterms or finals which are just as educational\r\nInteresting readings\/course materials and manageable workload allow you to spend more time learning, less time stressing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- \r\nReadings could have related more to lecture material, but usually section took on the role of explaining connection and significance",
                "Great lectures, but honestly could use more specificity. I felt like sometimes the information in lectures was very vague.",
                "Strengths: really passionate instructor and TFs! All of the TFs were super engaged and were all extremely knowledgeable in different areas of Black Studies. Professor Feimster genuinely cared for her students and TFs and continually tried to engage her students in virtual lecture by holding theme days (Pajama Day, Yale Spirit Day, Hat Day, etc.). She's a fantastic storyteller and lectures were always very illuminating. Another strength is the workload and difficulty of the class; I never felt overburdened by the class and it was clear that Professor Feimster's priority was to have her students learn and be motivated to take action. \r\nOne weakness, if I had to nitpick, is that sections sometimes felt like a regurgitation of the readings' information and there were days when discussions felt like everyone kept agreeing with each other. This wasn't a super frequent occurrence, and was sometimes justifiable (eg. the section the day after Election Day).",
                "Strengths: Dr. Feimster is amazing! Such an engaging lecturer and a super approachable, welcoming and encouraging presence. The material in this class was incredibly interesting. In my four years at Yale, this is one of few classes where I feel I genuinely learned something new every week. I also loved that we spoke about a lot of Civil Rights figures my large, underfunded public high school had never even introduced me to. As a STEM major who had never really taken an AFAM course, I was afraid this course would be hard for me to follow. However, it turned out to be the perfect pace and rigor. It's not a super slow course, but at the same time it is a survey that assumes no prior knowledge and is accessible for everyone. Workload is quite light -- and the work you do do is actually interesting. My TA was absolutely incredible. That made for great sections -- often better than the lecture itself. I also loved the assignment structure. It was great having a deviation from the traditional paper writing format. In particular, I enjoyed making the podcast. I researched Gordon Parks who was such an incredibly accomplished photographer, director, author and more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were very long at times. As a result, you could tell most people hadn't read in section and that led to less riveting conversations. Lectures slides could be better organized. Some slides literally just had a name while others had so many words you couldn't even read them all. Lastly, clearer feedback\/expectations on assignments would be nice. Most of us didn't know our first letter needed to have an argument. After that first letter, we were able to fix that issue.",
                "Professor Feimster is an incredible lecturer; even though I had to watch the recorded lectures, she brought so much energy and enthusiasm to each class. I also think that the course was organized and paced really well, and it was nice to have various projects that weren't just research papers. You also get a mix of assigned readings and documentaries to watch, so the weekly workload was very reasonable. Can't think of any weaknesses except that it might have been nice to receive multiple options for the final project because creating and editing a podcast with little to no background experience was harder than I thought.",
                "Amazing lectures but I wish there were some sort of physical accompaniment or summary that we could read over at the end of the course, because I fear I've missed much of the material that I didn't have an incentive to review for exams or major essays. I'd have really appreciated some kind of synopsis of the content Professor Feimster went over to fully appreciate her brilliant lectures.",
                "The assignments were unconventional and fun: through the letters, zine, and podcast, I felt like I was producing knowledge that others would actually enjoy consuming. I wish more of my assignments were this purposeful and creative! Course content was also supplemented by video clips, which made lectures more engaging and digestable. The readings were excellentinformative while also enjoyably narrative. The sections were always a helpful review of important themes\/historical continuities.",
                "The lectures and readings were very powerful and relevant for offering new insight for the class. The relevance\/actual discussion about some of the documentaries could be improved.",
                "My section TF (Da'Von) was delightful. I have never looked forward to section in any class, but he made the material interesting and approachable. I cannot imagine a more perfect individual to lead a section. Both he and Professor Feimster were excellent teachers in this class.",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely the instructor and TFs. Professor Feimster was a joy to listen to and she was always very animated. You really just wanted to pay attention when she talked. The TFs were always typing something in the chat during lecture to provide clarifying points or just provide food for thought. The readings were also very interesting, but there was quite a bit of it.",
                "The pacing of work was really good and never felt overwhelming. The assignments felt meaningful and nothing was just busy work. The structure of lectures could be made a little more interactive just to maintain engagement throughout the semester.",
                "Strength: Teaching was spot on, readings were interesting, section was enlightening. I loved this class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think one less assignment would be maintainable. Sometimes it was like every week their was an assignment due. I think one less letter would be an improvement.",
                "I appreciated the lecture format of the course and the chronological display of information. Some of the themes were a bit repetitive at times. I felt the video content helped support the main topics.",
                "Micah was a fantastic TF! She did a great job leading discussion during our sections--she always posed interesting questions that helped us critically engage with the readings and rethink our prior assumptions about the civil rights movement. I also think that Prof. Feimster was really kind and caring towards all of us as students, even in a virtual setting. I really appreciated that for this semester, and it definitely helped improve engagement with the course.  \r\n\r\nI really would have appreciated fewer documentaries. Please. Watching virtual lectures + having to watch recorded documentaries was too much, especially because Prof. Feimster sometimes replaced readings with documentaries. I would have appreciated it if we could have kept the readings instead of the documentaries, and I also think it would have been great if some\/all of the readings could have been available as a printed course packet for us to buy (while also still being available online for students for whom that isn't accessible!). During the virtual semester, it was REALLY helpful when I could step away from the screen and read a paper book for class. Idk if other students will agree with this, but that's my take. \r\n\r\nI thought it was a little strange that this course argued against the personalization of the civil rights movement (focusing too heavily on individual activists, such as Martin Luther King, Jr.), but that most of our assignments were about specific people. Sometimes I wondered if the focus on individual people was a little constraining and if we could have learned more about the movement as a whole if we looked more broadly and had more readings that tried to give overviews or analyses of specific organizations\/themes without becoming biographical. Somewhat relatedly, I thought some of the readings were good at giving background and helping us understand the movement during a certain period of time, or with regards to a specific theme. (I remember the Charles Payne and the Peniel Joseph reading being really good for this.) But some of the readings were less helpful in this respect. I think this course could be strengthened by replacing a few of the readings that were very specific. \r\n\r\nI also think that this course had a lot of assignments for one semester: three 600-800 word letters, a zine, and a podcast. Instead of 5 short assignments, I think I would have preferred rolling two of those together into a slightly larger\/longer assignment. Also, I liked the idea of having the final assignment be something creative, but I would have appreciated it if we could have chosen between making a podcast and something else. Maybe that would also give some variety for the TFs who have to grade the final projects!",
                "One of my favorite classes I've taken here. The format was great, the prof and TF's were fantastic and engaging, the assignments and projects were creative yet individualized, and the course overall was a great experience. No weaknesses. :)",
                "Strengths: Professor Feimster brought so much warmth, passion, creativity, friendliness, and expertise to class! Her actions showed how much she cares for all her students, and I liked that each class started with a song or other art or video clip. The themes of sexism, labor organizing, grassroots activism, respectability politics etc were prominently woven throughout lectures, readings, and projects. I also really liked how the projects (3 letters, a zine, and a final project) were not like typical classes with reading responses and papers; the projects all ended up being pretty low stress for me at least. This let me think about expressing whatever I wanted to focus on through less academic routes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I guess I knew more about the civil rights movement going in than I thought I did or something? She sold it as if this course would change everything we knew, and while I certainly learned new things, I wouldn't say it really went that far. I just wish she went a bit deeper at some points. We also kind of stalled out pretty close to the classical phase of the civil rights movement -- we got a little bit into the 70's, but I wish we'd spent more time in class on the ramifications of the movement. After this class, I don't feel I have a great answer to \"when did the long civil rights movement end?\" at all. It also might have been cool to have more choice in some of the projects and at least one be less biographical -- I still think she could ask us to keep them focused on a single event or town or something, but focusing on single figures did get a little old by the end.",
                "COVID made it difficult but generally this course was fantastic",
                "This course was incredibly interesting, and every lecture felt purposeful. It is genuinely one of the most engaging classes I have ever taken. As for how it could be improved, I think sections could be a little more productive in discussing the pieces we were assigned to read over the course of the week, but overall, they were still incredibly open spaces for us to have conversations regarding important and contemporary topics.",
                "The readings were very interesting and discussion sections were enlightening. Lectures were also interesting but often times I would get lost because of the speed of the information delivered and the manner of its delivery. (Sometimes there were powerpoint slide notes to follow during lecture, other times there weren't)",
                "Strengths - professor, content, TFs\r\nWeaknesses - wide variation in reading amount, some weeks none or a video, some weeks 100+ pages",
                "I liked the assignments like the zine and the podcast because they left room for creativity which was nice in place of traditional papers. The letters were also a good assignment but the length was short so it was difficult to fit everything. Professor Feimster was an excellent lecturer; I can't think of any weaknesses in her lectures.",
                "Professor Feimster was very engaging and informative. The assignments were fun and different from typical essay\/exams.",
                "It was flexible and engaging, perhaps could have lighter readings",
                "This course has no weaknesses it was amazing.",
                "Professor Feimster is an incredibly engaging  lecturer! I was always excited about what I was going to learn in class. However, the load of reading felt a bit high for a 100 level class, and there was a large discrepancy between the teaching and grading styles of the different section leaders.",
                "Strengths: The way that everything was presented; the course was just highly engaging, from the start to the finish. There were a bunch of different non-traditional projects that were really fun to do, while still being educational (a zine, a podcast)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: were there any? I dont know if I have any meaningful feedback here.",
                "really great lecturers and TAs, amazing with any issues students are dealing with",
                "This course is truly great. We not only enchanted our knowledge about famous figures of the movement but learned about so many crucial figures who are commonly forgotten by history.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Incredibly engaging discussions in section about the reading\r\n- Fun lecture format\r\n- Encouraging professor and TAs\r\n- Creative assignments that weren't just plain old papers or exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- NONE",
                "The course was nicely balanced between the survey style lectures and the more in-depth discussion sections.  The assignments (letters, zine, podcast) were also unique and rewarding to complete.  It's hard to label a weakness when for me personally the main weakness in my engagement was Zoom fatigue.  I suppose the readings were sometimes too long, though.  For me, the longer the reading, the less encouraged I am to read it.",
                "It can be hard to stay fully engaged with a course through big online lectures. I thought this course did as good a job as possible doing this and Professor Feimster was always interesting, empathetic, and funny in her lectures. The real highlight was diving deeper into the material through sections which were fantastic. Every student seemed engaged and excited to be there. The only weakness would just be the format but I think this is more a product of the times than the course itself. However, it was one of my favorite courses I've taken and I would highly recommend. It makes you rethink so much and connects deeply with our current times. You can't help but notice the cyclical nature of inequity and discrimination. Everyone should take it!",
                "Strengths of this class were the sections. Our TA was very engaged and always came to class with interesting questions. I also liked how the class was structured so that the students could be flexible and engage w\/ the material at their convenience.",
                "This was an excellent course taught by an incredible professor and teaching fellow staff. Professor Feimster was by far the most engaging zoom professor I have had  or even heard about  this semester.",
                "Lectures sometimes random\/disorganized",
                "Truly there are only strengths. Professor Feimster is amazing, I feel lucky to have taken this course and to have learned with her. The assignments were really fantastic and engaging, as are the readings. It is all well thought out and poignant, and the lectures always flew by and were fascinating.",
                "The professor is the primary strength of this course. The way she goes about lecture captivates you to want to keep learning more. Although I am not a humanities or history major, I was intrigued by this class and actually enjoyed the course. Prof Feimster is dedicated to connected with students and making the importance of learning this history will have in allowing us to be the change that is so needed.",
                "Overall it was a really great class. The professor was incredibly engaging and material was discussed in a really fascinating and poignant way. However, I wish the powerpoints were slightly clearer. There was often a lot of text on them, so it was hard to pick out important points, and it was also hard to read that much text while listening to the lecture. There were also points that weren't included in the powerpoint, so I think refining the slides so they expressed the main ideas would be really helpful. There were also one or two weeks where the readings were too long, but overall they were very reasonable. Also making it slightly clearer when we were transitioning topics in the lecture.",
                "professor feimster and the TAs are phenomenal",
                "I really loved all of the creative assignments but was often lost in connecting lecture materials, readings, and section discussions together. Some creative assignments, like a timeline of the entire movement, or group projects or the sharing of individual creative projects in section might have encouraged more big picture thinking outside of lecture.",
                "In my opinion, this course's reading load is far too heavy for a 100-level. Because of this, we hardly ever discussed all readings in section. I'd also add that sacrificing a few dozen pages here and there won't do much to the learning experience. As someone who did nearly every reading, I found myself overly inundated with the same information that was covered in the sometimes-assigned documentaries and lecture itself.",
                "I love the use of videos, pictures, personal accounts, and other forms of primary and secondary sources to tell the story of the civil rights movement. It made the class really engaging. It made it feel like you were there during the events being spoken about. I also loved the assignments, which is not something I can say for many of my classes. Professor Feimster found a way to make the assignments fun.",
                "As a seminar course that must be taught online, this course cannot be improved much. My engagement was high in both the live lectures and especially my discussion group. It might be because my interest in the topic was so high, but I thought both the professor and the TAs did an excellent job.",
                "None",
                "The strengths of this course are the pedagogy, course organization, and teaching charisma of Professor Feimster and the Teaching Fellows. Prof Feimster and the TFs create a welcoming and intellectually vigorous learning environment in which students from a broad range of comfort levels can come together to discuss social justice. It is a rare blessing to find yourself in a class environment like this (especially on Zoom) and the interpersonal and intellectual growth was tremendous.",
                "Da'Von Boyd is a huge strength! Amazing TF",
                "Awesome class, loved the engaging assignments and readings",
                "Strengths: I loved the creative assignments and I found the readings to be absolutely generative. Prof. Feimster has a wonderful personality and the material she taught is essential for anyone who hopes to understand American politics, past and present. Weaknesses: Due to the circumstances of remote learning, Prof. Feimster changed the syllabus (readings and course format) twice on the fly. The changes she made enhanced our learning experience but made for a somewhat disorganized semester. The pacing of the course was a bit off, the lectures did not always correspond with the readings, and I sometimes lost track of where we were going with the class and why. I do think all of those issues were specific to the challenges of teaching and learning amid COVID.",
                "Overall, a fantastic course. My only real complaint was that the lectures\/assignments\/readings were not always correlated. For example we would talk about Ella Baker in lecture one week and then do a reading about her in another week and an assignment another week. This didn't always negatively impact my learning, but it was hard to keep track of the chronology sometimes.",
                "Strengths: breadth, creativity of assignment formats (letters, podcast, zine) which allow you to communicate your research and learning to a wider audience, fascinating and interesting themes looking at leftist politics, gender politics, and more within the Black freedom struggle, professor Feimster was knowledgeable, engaging, enthusiastic and compassionate\r\nWeaknesses: None, although the Zoom lecture format made it slightly harder to talk with Professor Feimster",
                "Crystal Feimster is an incredible lecturer. I appreciated that the assignments were geared towards conveying information to others rather than just exams and academic essays.",
                "The readings are well curated and interesting. The professor and TFs were knowledgeable and approachable. A strength and weakness, depending on the student, of the course was that the assessments were often untraditional and more reminiscent of high school assignments than college ones. That can be good for a student who needs a break from the paper-exam cycle, but can also often lead to unclear expectations and can inadvertently incentivize sloppy work.",
                "Strengths: super engaging and organized with interesting assignments. Amazing prof\/TFs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe more structure on some of the larger assignments would have been nice?",
                "Although the lectures contained interesting information, it felt like the readings were not always connected to the lectures and the lectures not always connected to the assignments. I think section was the strongest part of the course, where we got to dive into material in a smaller setting. That being said, some weeks there was so much reading that in order to really analyze a piece we would only get to talk about 1\/4 of the readings in section.",
                "One strength of this course was Professor Feimster. She is an incredibly knowledgeable and engaging lecturer and excited about teaching the course. Another strength was the mix of films\/documentaries plus readings which allowed us to learn the material in different ways. Finally, the assignments (letters, zine, and podcast) were more original than typical papers and exams and more creative and fun to do. There was also an extra credit opportunity where we got to listen to interesting and engaging conversations and write a short reflection. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was that lectures sometimes went too fast or felt rushed in order to fit a lot of material into a short period of time. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I think having a summary or highlighting the key words\/ideas\/people at the beginning or end of lecture would be helpful to guide us so we know what to pay most attention to and not feel overwhelmed. My TF, for example, had guiding questions for the weekly readings which were helpful. So I think doing something similar for lecture would also be beneficial.",
                "The course is perfectly designed, every aspect is well-curated for learning. From the professor's lectures to the sections with the TFs. Additionally, the assignments make you think about the different aspects of the civil rights movement and force you to examine people that are often neglected in the classical telling. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale."

                "I thought it was great how Professor Feimster called on people and how our TA used break out rooms to keep people engaged",

                "engaging lectures. I loved the themes every Wednesday and the professors' high energy level and kind spirit. Doing live \"competitions\" in class encourages live attendance.",
                "Lectures were live but also recorded which was helpful.",
                "I thought that the dress-up days were great for virtual engagement.",
                "I enjoyed having the creative assignments rather than traditional papers. School was a great source of stress for me this semester, so having non-traditional assignments helped a lot. \r\n\r\nI also loved Professor Feimsters contests! They were a very fun way to build community in our virtual lecture.",
                "Live lectures were well organized, as well as section.",
                "Professor Feimster had themed classes and other methods that she used to keep us engaged and wanting to have cameras on and participate on zoom.\r\nI liked the mix of synchronous and asynchronous activities.",
                "Very interesting creative projects, which were a great break from other classes' papers and from thinking about COVID in general.",
                "I liked that all instruction was synchronous with accessible options for international\/remote students. I think if there were more opportunities for discussion during lecture that lecture could be more engaging (eg. break out rooms, questions that people could answer in chat).",
                "l really liked the one in-person, one virtual structure of lectures every week. It kept me accountable but also allotted some flexibility. I also thought section functionally worked well.",
                "It was great to have the option to watch the recorded lectures for those unable to watch them live because of time differences.",
                "Professor Feimster livened up Zoom lectures with her various contests (e.g. best Halloween costumes, most Yale spirit, best hoodie, best PJ, etc...), which kept things fun and light even in such a dreary time. I really appreciated this.",
                "I think having breakout rooms during the general lecture would keep more students engaged throughout the class and help them retain more of the information.",
                "Great engagement by Professor Feimster!",
                "I attended all of the live sections so it felt like I was essentially just in a normal lecture.",
                "I appreciated that the lecture videos were recorded. I also liked that since it was a lecture there was not as much pressure to have the camera on, and as someone who was struggling with getting headaches and sore eyes from looking at the screen so much this semester, I was glad to be able to just listen and take notes in my notebook.",
                "Our sections were still very effective, and I think I liked that we only had to attend lecture live once a week. As I mentioned above, I didn't really like replacing some readings with documentaries. I think that was intended to give us a break, but I thought it was too much of the same sort of screen time, at least for me personally.",
                "This class was a prime example of how to tackle the obstacle of online learning during this time. From the spirit days to the engagement of the TF's during lectures and discussion (and the utilization of the Zoom chat), this class made this time feel a lot more personalized\/understanding of the circumstances.",
                "What worked: live but recorded lectures that did feature participation and interaction so there was a point to them being live, Professor Feimster's flexibility and openness about changing the course format from podcasts to all lectures, her considering where we were at and cancelling class and readings once to make up a tiny bit for Yale's lack of a break\r\n\r\nWhat could have been better: sometimes Professor Feimster would spend a lot of time not screensharing, which I understand from wanting to see us, but then she might skip through a bunch of slides and since it was live it could be hard to catch much of the information from her which could make focusing tough as a more visual learner. But, at least it wasn't like I was missing something for any exams so it's not that big a deal.",
                "section was very helpful here!",
                "I liked the in person lecture component of the class",
                "The lectures were live but also recorded, so we could revisit any one of them. The sections were also helpful with breakout rooms where we could discuss in smaller groups.",
                "The Professor and TAs are so extremely compassionate and understanding during COVID-19. I am grateful for them being understanding during a very stressful semester.",
                "I thought Professor Feimster was very accomodating and understanding of the unique circumstances. There wasn't anything I would change from a structural standpoint.",
                "It was helpful to have all the lectures recorded. I cant think of any improvements.",
                "Our class was conducted entirely online, making it very covid safe. There was also a lot of flexibility with due dates in light of the pandemic.",
                "Course accommodations for COVID-19 were SO HELPFUL. Professor Feimster reduced the reading load halfway through because she was worried that there was too much going on with the election and the world as a whole, which made school this semester a lot easier to handle and shoulder.\r\n\r\nHowever, I dont think there were any accommodations in place for time zone differences, beyond the fact that lectures were recorded. But even lecture attendance was required, along with virtual seminars, which probably prevented people in really different time zones from fully engaging with the course.",
                "virtual overall is just tough but really was run super well",
                "I definitely feel like both the virtual lecture and virtual discussion section did completely fine given the circumstances!! Lecture was still really engaging and I felt very involved in the discussions during section",
                "Breakout rooms during discussion section were helpful, but the occasional cold calls in the large lecture format were stressful.  Maybe even the lectures could have had brief breakout room sessions to discuss key concepts (and get to know people better).",
                "I really liked when Professor Feimster was animated and personal even though it's difficult during covid. The sections helped to go deeper into what we learned in class. I think Prof. Feimster did a great job catering the workload and class time to this strange new time. I felt like the Zine didn't really work online and felt like I was just going through the motions, but overall I still got a good amount from the course.",
                "Professor Feimster did an excellent job engaging the zoom lecture audience in a personal but inviting way.",
                "Could speak about assignments more in depth. Some of the requirements \/ how it was being graded were kept in the dark.",
                "It was all fantastic during covid because the course was engaging all around, lecture and sections. Plus, Professor Feimster really cared about the challenges we faced as students during this time and made the course the perfect thing for us to learn and really dive in to the subject matter in a productive way.",
                "I think that the live lectures succeeded more than the original plan for podcasts.",
                "Overall I think everyone involved did a good job transitioning. I liked that we had to attend one lecture but we got to watch the other on our own time, it made it a lot easier to stay engaged but also not get overwhelmed.",
                "stop forcing us to do these to see our grades <3",
                "I thought the frequent sharing of video and audio clips during lecture and section was very effective.",
                "My discussion group was very small, usually only 3-4 other students. This proved to provide really amazing conversations and allowed the students to ask as many questions as they needed. I know other groups werent as small, so possibly consider adding more discussion sections or limiting enrollment.",
                "Thought it was well done",
                "The combination of synchronous and asynchronous options for lectures made this class very flexible for remote students. Professor Feimster and all of the TFs were transparent throughout the course about their care and valuation of students outside the classroom. During the pandemic, election week and the personal crises of this semester, students were cared for as people. This pedagogy, above any technical adjustment, made for successful learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "I loved the way that Professor Feimster lectured and how she tried to engage people during lecture. I also loved the way the assignments were adjusted to fit the virtual format.",
                "Success: readings mostly available online, lectures easy to access, assignments clear and syllabus frequently updated\r\nCould be improved: some readings were difficult to access, instead perhaps they could all be uploaded to Canvas to ensure everyone has access to them",
                "Prof Feimster did a good job making the class atmosphere feel like a community even over zoom, such as by having dress-up days and other fun things.",
                "At the beginning of the class some lectures were offered in podcast form without transcripts available, which is a major accessibility concern. Thankfully this was dropped pretty quickly.",
                "I liked the structure of watching one recorded lecture and attending another live. The process of going to office hours was kind of confusing though.",
                "Since all the lectures were meant to be accessible either in person or recorded, even the live virtual ones did not have much student participation which I think they could have benefitted from. I think section succeeded",
                "Having live virtual lectures but also recording them was helpful in case I wanted to go back and rewatch a part of a lecture I missed or didn't understand. Also, having live lectures twice a week but requiring attendance at only one was helpful in terms of scheduling and allowed me to be more flexible. Virtual discussion sections I think worked pretty well. Breakout rooms in section were especially helpful to talk through topics in-depth in smaller group settings."

Some lectures are a little more dry because she is getting the basics across but you will 100% come away knowing much more and many more historical actors. There are a lot of assignments but they are all pretty fun!",
                "ABSOLUTELY",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, even if just for the experience of having Professor Feimster. I adored learning from her. I would also recommend the course more generally because of the unmatched amount of knowledge I acquired via its readings and lectures.",
                "Yes it facilitates wonderful discussions about the racial divide in America throughout history and still today",
                "I definitely recommend this course! Professor Feimster is so kind and engaging, the assignments are interesting and not time consuming, and movies are sometimes assigned instead of readings. Low workload class with intellectually stimulating (and important!!) material.",
                "Yes! Any and everyone should take this course. I am very much a STEM person, but I enjoyed learning in this class.",
                "As someone who's interested in this subject, this course was very enjoyable for me! Even if you aren't interested in the subject, I would still recommend taking this course because it provides a lot of insight into an important historical movement. Everyone should know more about the civil rights movement, especially topics that aren't discussed in the dominant narrative. The workload for this course is very manageable and the readings are very engaging. The TFs are also very understanding and discussion is always interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone to get a better understanding of the civil rights movement, as what we are taught growing up is a washed out version of it.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to any student. I learned so much about the history of our country and how people have fought against the inequality within it. Additionally, I learned a lot about organizing practices and grassroots movements. I'd specifically recommend this course for people looking to gain a historical perspective on modern-day racism.",
                "Absolutely! I learned a very sanitized history of the Civil Rights Movement growing up, so this class is a great way to unlearn many of the myths associated with the movement. Professor Feimster and the TFs are also incredibly lovely people, and their care for student wellbeing really shows.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to everyone since it's so relevant to today.",
                "Yes, everyone in every major should take this class! Great intro to humanities and great course experience even on zoom.",
                "Yes! Great if you want an easy class, but also one that will teach you a lot.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Feimster is incredible. There are very few professors who can handle and create an inclusive environment conducive to learning during a pandemic, and she is one of them. She is so thoughtful and deliberate with her assignments. No busy work and all of it were very formative. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
                "Absolutely! It's so important to learn about the entirety of the civil rights movement, and it's not a super difficult\/heavy course; it would make a perfect fourth course.",
                "Yes!",
                "YES I would 100% recommend this course to other students. Dr. Feimster is amazing! Such an engaging lecturer and a super approachable, welcoming and encouraging presence. The material in this class was incredibly interesting. In my four years at Yale, this is one of few classes where I feel I genuinely learned something new every week. I also loved that we spoke about a lot about Civil Rights figures my large, underfunded public high school had never even introduced me to. As a STEM major who had never really taken an AFAM course, I was afraid this course would be hard for me to follow. However, it turned out to be the perfect pace and rigor. It's not a super slow course, but at the same time it is a survey that assumes no prior knowledge and is accessible for everyone. Workload is quite light -- and the work you do do is actually interesting. My TA was absolutely incredible. That made for great sections -- often better than the lecture itself. I also loved the assignment structure. It was great having a deviation from the traditional paper writing format. In particular, I enjoyed making the podcast. I researched Gordon Parks who was such an incredibly accomplished photographer, director, author and more. Overall, this is a great class to round out your schedule. A gem where you learn a good amount with a fairly light workload (three letters, zine and podcast).\r\n\r\nThat being said, my one caveat is that this course may not be great for people who already know a lot about the Civil Rights movement. This course is a survey and really goes through everything from the ground up.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this as a low workload course that feels immensely meaningful and informative, and of course is incredibly pertinent to the world we live today. Professor Feimster is a master lecturer and I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to be in her class. The projects and short essays she assigned were far more engaging and exciting to embark upon than a traditional essay format would have been, and made me want to share my work in the class. They were still very challenging- in a different way- which was refreshing.",
                "Yes, definitely, especially if they've never taken a History class before, or are looking to repair gaps in their knowledge of AfAm history.",
                "Yep, it's a great course to help right wrongs in your own life and to demonstrate just how much you can learn from a powerful course.",
                "Absolutely. As a senior, this is undoubtedly one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. If I knew that everyone would have the same experience as I did, I would petition to make this class required for all undergraduates.",
                "I would 10\/10 recommend this class to anyone. It is easy, insightful, and an overall good time.",
                "Yes!! Prof Feimster is an expert and just a wonderful person to learn from and the content is so important!",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take this class!",
                "Yes! I think if you are interested in having a stronger background in civil rights struggles and understanding how it relates to modern day fights for justice this is a great class to build that foundational knowledge!",
                "Yes, I think I would. I don't think this course was a comprehensive overview of the civil rights movement, so I wouldn't recommend taking it with that expectation. But for anyone, this course will help you learn new things and ask interesting questions while realizing what you don't know! As a TF, Micah was really great about making our section discussions suitable for students with different levels of background knowledge.\r\n\r\nI'm glad that I took this course during this semester in particular because this was a really nice community to have in 2020. I'm glad that I got to think and learn about the civil rights movement with other people while also considering how the questions we ask ourselves about the movement are important to modern anti-racist work.",
                "YES!! Everyone should take this class.",
                "Yes, this class was incredible. Professor Feimster is amazing, and the TAs all seemed to really care about the topic and the students. The subject is really important and well-taught.",
                "Yes! I'd really definitely recommend this course if you don't know much about the Civil Rights Movement, or if you're really interested in learning more about it. This was a truly crucial time in this nation's history that can tell us a lot about today. Professor Feimster knows a lot and really cares about her students. I wish I'd had the chance to take her course in person! I feel like that could only make this into even more of an engaging lecture and a relatively strong community sense for a lecture.",
                "YES! I turned down several seminars with 50+ student waitlists to take this lecture, as a senior. This course is FANTASTIC, and honestly should be required for students. It is a brilliant introduction to African American studies through a historian lens, the assignments are really thought-provoking, especially for a student who has only done psets\/tests or essays, and the reinterpretation of the Civil Rights Movement, something every student has learned incorrectly, to incorporate black women, working-class blacks, and Communist movements is so timely and relevant to shaping a worldview that I feel is crucial to tackling today's political and structural issues, but also any job or position a Yale student holds in the future.",
                "Heck yeah, although we in a pandemic so it was a bit tough trying to pay attention this semester, but Prof. Feimster and Michelle (TA) did a great job!",
                "100%. I would recommend that every student take this course, if possible, because it is truly amazing in adjusting our lens regarding American history and history in general.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course with Professor Feimster if you get the chance and drop by her office hours sometime during the semester. She is very approachable and understanding. I loved how she utilized different modes of learning throughout the semester (documentaries, podcasts, zine, essays, letters). It made the content even more interesting and accessible and engaging despite the different levels of education or exposure you may have had with LCRM material.",
                "Yes! Important content. Great prof and TFs.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it is important to learn about the civil rights movement and debunk some of the common misconceptions about it. And this class is a great way to do just that!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The assignments were fun to do and you'll learn a lot more about the Civil Rights Movement than you may have done in prior education.",
                "Yes, if the student is interested in the material.",
                "Yes it is interesting for people interested in the course material, it does heavyish weekly reading though.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot and the course was very engaging even over zoom.",
                "I think this course is great for someone just getting their feet wet to the notion that the struggle for civil rights was and is more than MLK and Malcom X. There are also many opportunities to delve deeper for people are are more comfortable in this realm as well.",
                "YES YES YES. Professor Feimster is fantastic, and the course itself is necessary. One of my suitemates first year said that he thinks that every student should take an AFAM course in their time at Yale, and after taking this course and learning about how much is ignored in the traditional narratives of Black history, I have to agree. Really, you should take this course if you can.",
                "yeah so important for current political and social climate, makes you more well-versed and active in movements",
                "definitely! This is a great course for anyone interested in the history of the civil rights movement",
                "YES ABSOLUTELY!! Professor Feimster is absolutely amazing and her passion shines through and makes the content extremely engaging. The workload was really not that much: three short letters, a zine, and a podcast. They were perfectly spaced a part, and it was completely manageable with my four other classes. PLEASE take this class because it is important to think about the organizing methods they used in the 1930s and 40s and how it can apply to the future moving forward as we combat racial injustice.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course; I believe that this is essential material to understand as the civil rights movement continues today.",
                "Absolutely! The topic is really interesting and helped me connect history to the present. I really think everyone would get something from it and it was well organized and very realistic in terms of what people could get done and work through. There was a lot of reading, but it was mostly to inform discussion not something you had to know every detail from. Section was incredible as well which made it especially impactful.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student. Beyond being flexible and relatively easy to manage, I think that this class offers something for every student, whether you study history or not. It also provides some insight on historical events and themes that are very relevant in our current day.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to others students of all backgrounds. I took this course with no previous experience in AFAM courses and greatly enjoyed the course's content, the community of learners it fosters, and the critical thinking we acheived.",
                "If you need to take humanities. But it does not not feel like an intro.",
                "I would absolutely take this course. Seriously, take this course. It is so imporant, and the topics are things you really need to know and understand to better understand the challenges we face today. It is fascinating, and also a call to action. I now feel so much more comfortable and confident speaking on subjects around injustice in America, I see the threads throughout history and have learned about the Civil Rights heroes we have never acknolwedged or truly understood. It is such an important course, please take it.",
                "Amazing class and professor. One of the best at Yale. The subject matter is so important and the assignments helped further the major themes of the course while tying in personal experiences and interests. Professor Feimster is such a dynamic lecturer that this class cannot be missed!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is very engaged with her students and aims to make us feel heard. Her teaching is very animated. Beyond this the subject material is one that is really important to understanding how it is that we got to where we are today regarding civil rights and race relations in the United States. So much of the information presented is completely new because our education system fails to portray the complexity of the civil rights movement, so this course is great to get a comprehensive understanding of it.",
                "Wholeheartedly. I learned so much in such an interesting and insightful way. The professor was great and I really feel more knowledgable and more engaged with Civil Rights and the world around me.",
                "yes. if you want to educate yourself about this country and the way things are in the US then take this class.",
                "Yes! Every assignment was geared towards internalizing the information and strategies to enact real change in our communities. And the professor and teaching staff were all incredible.",
                "Yes and no. This may just be a virtual thing, but the themes\/ revelations\/ material became redundant very quickly. Felt like I would have enjoyed the course more if I hadn't previously studied the civil rights movement in both life and college.",
                "Yes! If you can, take this class! It's interesting and Professor Feimster is a great teacher.",
                "Yes! Not only did I love the people who taught the course, but the topics were so interesting. Plus, the workload was very manageable even though it was a easy class.",
                "Would definitely recommend",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to all students, regardless of familiarity with social justice\/civil rights. If you are a STEM student looking to \"gut\" a humanities class or an ER&M major seeking novel intellectual vigor, this is a rare space in which a very wide range of learners can grow together. Prof Feimster and the TFs foster a dynamic, generative, and supportive learning environment unlike many classes anywhere. You will learn to position the value of your education outside of Yale and learn to question how you remember history.",
                "Definitely would recommend - you will learn while being engaged in the material and discussion the entire time",
                "Yes. Take this class if you are interested in American politics. You cannot begin to understand contemporary American politics without an appreciation for how the history and memories of the long civil rights movement have shaped our political discourse and divisions. The subject matter is essential, the assignments are fun and unique, and the readings are accessible and generative. The course had some pacing and organization issues, no doubt, but those only marginally detracted from my learning experience. Excellent course, one of my favorites through five terms at Yale.",
                "Everyone should take this course! Theres so much about the Civil Rights Movement that has been forgotten, erased or remembered wrongly. Prof. Feimster does an incredible job of disarticulating the classic civil rights narrative and invites her learners to ask important questions. If you want to deeply appreciate the long history of Black liberation struggle and how to connect it to todays world, definitely!",
                "YES! Should be required for all students\/people of good will.",
                "Undoubtedly!! Take this class and you will not regret it; the amount that Professor Feimster managed to cover is incredible; you will gain a much greater understanding of various ideas, narratives and competing ideologies within the CRM and how it unfolds today",
                "Definitely. Everyone at Yale should take a course on the Black freedom struggle, and this is a really good one.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in a survey of the civil rights movement, or students interested in history who need a break from some of the rigors of the history major. I would not recommend this course to a student interested primarily in primary historical research or writing rigorous works of academic history.",
                "I would! It's really important history that I think would an asset to any student.",
                "If you are interested in learning more about the civil rights movement, yes. This is the type of class where you will get out what you put in time and effort-wise",
                "Yes!! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Feimster is such an amazing professor and her lectures are always engaging. Whatever you think you know about the Civil Rights Movement, Professor Feimster will challenge you and teach you even more. If you are interested in US History, social movements, etc. (or even if you're not), definitely take this class.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This was one of the best and most memorable courses that I have taken thus far and will surely stick with me long after I graduate. Professor Feimster was one of the best professors I have ever had and she deeply cares about the material and her students. If you are considering a class that is outside your major and want an exceptionally great experience, take this course."
