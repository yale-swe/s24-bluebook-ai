   "comments": [
    "I learned how ethnographies look different and how to apply those methods to our own topics.",
    "In this course, I learned to look critically at the conventions and standards in the disciplines of both anthropology and latinx studies. I learned the different ways ethnographies can be done and developed insight into the ways in which one can use ones position to increase awareness on certain issues.",
    "This class taught me all about ethnography strategies and we were able to read many examples of scholars who have written ethnographies about Latinx communities. We were able to engage in conversations about what a researcher's place and responsibility is as well as the moral concerns of certain practices.",
    "The course will significantly deepen any student's breadth of knowledge about ethnographies regarding Latinos and Latinas in the US, seen through the lens of critical discourse and across time, all the while considering parallel concepts which can be easily linked to many ongoing discussions and research topics. Thus the course provides you tools to both deepen that understanding of what it is to be Latinx in the US and with an invaluable reading selection that can be cross-referenced to other areas, in a seminar setting with weekly reaction papers required (see strength\/weaknesses below)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were the structure of the course. I enjoyed how the class began with a brief lecture by the professor framing the conversation and then moved to a discussion. The weekly responses were great but I would have preferred a different format than summarizing the arguments of each. I think it would have been more engaging to have required 2-3  readings in the responses followed by a more critical analysis of those few pieces.",
    "In regards to they way class was structured, it was helpful to hear a bit about the theme and texts for the week, seeing videos was good too, and then to go into discussion was good.\r\n\r\nIn regards to course level work, definitely less is more. In every discussion I felt that not enough time was dedicated to really discussing each rich text, there were times we had to read a text and not even discuss it. \r\n\r\nWas introduced to some of the most amazing books I ever read, but it would have been better to read some chapters of the book and take our time with those chapters as opposed to reading whole books.\r\n\r\nThe final assignment should be shorter, maybe 10-12 pgs as most finals are, and if we are doing an ethnography it would have been helpful to do practice assignments or get more guidance as to how to complete the project and do ethnographies.",
    "This course is very strong in giving a good amount of readings that give a diversity of opinions. It is also nice to have a short but involved reading response each week because I found it helped me make connections between the readings I would not have seen otherwise. A possible weakness might be that there were not short assignments other than the autobiography because that was a very helpful assignment and it would be fun to explore more methods in that way.",
    "I think this course was organized really well thematically and included an interesting range of scholars and topics. I liked that we studied many different types of material including film and visual mediums. My only suggestion is that because there were usually so many different readings each week it was hard to include them all in the readings responses and be able to dig in. I think that our responses might have been more detailed an insightful if we could choose to respond to fewer papers.",
    "Perhaps, on the weeks that there are heavier readings, to give less readings because it's more difficult to get the work done when this is the case. This class is incredibly engaging and the material is AMAZING. The readings had me shook and they cover a depth of topics.",
    "While the main strength of this course is its reading selection and the themes around which it is structured, the main weakness of the course is also within the selection itself, in the sense that a better selection can still be distilled for the student's best performance and apprehension of course themes and lessons. The main challenge this presents to the course is that little or no time is actually left for the student's own concerns and projects given the copious amount of readings required, which at many times can be overwhelming. Even more so, there is often little or no time dedicated to in-class discussion of readings that otherwise take up huge amounts of time to adequately complete. While this can be frustrating in itself, what can really disappoint many students is their pretension of taking an ethnography course expecting to do actual ethnography. This will not happen and the present structure of the course cannot allow this to happen. The required textbook on ethnographic research methods is hence seldom referenced in class and much less used, although vast amounts of chapter readings are also required throughout. See below for recommendations."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is like no other offered in the field of Latinx studies and anthropology.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to those in related disciplines or with an interest in the subject. The readings are lengthy but really interesting. The reading responses are reasonable. You get out of this class what you put into it but definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. professor Ramos Zayas is basically a legend. She is really knowledgeable and has tons of hands-on experience with this type of research to share. The workload is manageable: weekly reading responses, a short autobiographical paper, and a final project with lots of options for the format.",
    "Yes, definitely! This is a rigorous course, but what you learn is very eye opening and engaging.",
    "It depends on the student's expectations and motives in taking the course. If he or she is interested in learning about Latinx ethnographies and the historical construction of identity and related concepts among latinx in the US and abroad across time, definitively. If the he or she is interested in doing actual ethnographic work during the course and\/or immediately applying course concepts on concurrent courses, then no.",
