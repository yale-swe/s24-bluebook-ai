                "This class was great. I came into it not really loving Shakespeare and wanting to try something to make me at least appreciate his work, and Professor Bromwich certainly helped me achieve that. He is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about not just Shakespeare but also how Shakespeare's plays engage with other works (for instance we read essays by Montaigne and Bacon to accompany some seminars) and how his plays connect with each other. I felt like I didn't just close-read each play but also gained an understanding of how the plays fit with each other. Professor Bromwich draws your attention to certain scenes, and even if you don't understand them when you read by yourself, after seminar you surely gain an appreciation for their emotions and language. His seminar was also one of few that worked over digital format; since he gives a lot of his own insight and formulates interesting questions, we never had awkward silences.",
                "I think that there were perhaps too many plays to be reasonably read in one semester, especially online. We move very quickly through each play, and it can be hard to keep up, especially if a paper is being assigned. However, I think the opportunity to study w\/ Bromwich is a great one. Being able to talk with him one-on-one in meetings was rewarding and he is very encouraging about papers. I think that discussion was a bit stilted, but that might be the online aspect.",
                "The strength of this course is Bromwich's expertise; he really has a fascinating way of reading and interpreting Shakespeare that is fun to dive into. This is one of those seminars where you get the privilege to see text through the eyes of an expert. Don't expect it to be about you.",
                "strengths: covers wide ground, characters in different plays are put into conversation, bromwich rigorously edits papers\r\n\r\nweaknesses: moved to quickly, felt we'd be better served by cutting one of the first three plays (henry and Richard) and devoting more time to the heavy hitters like Hamlet, lost sight of political side of things, plays should be put in THEIR historical context, students should talk more",
                "this course didn't necessarily follow with the course title. We didn't talk about political themes in the plays all that much.",
                "In taking a Shakespeare course I expected to focus on the writing of the plays themselves, but this course was much more centered on the abstract concept of politics in each of the play's themes. I think for someone who wants to grapple with the complicated question of what Shakespeare might have meant when writing and how his opinions are relevant in the present day, this class is a great fit, but it falls short in the discussion of writing as artistry.",
                "Professor Bromwich dominates this course, and so the strengths and weaknesses are all his. He dominates each seminar, often speaking for well over fifty percent of the time. He should work more to incorporate student interpretations and analysis (or at least questions) into each class. The supplementary essays he assigned as readings were among my favorite parts of the course, and I think I would have enjoyed the course even more if we had spent more time on them."

Maybe if he utilized the raise hand feature in Zoom or used breakout rooms people would feel more involved, but it often felt like a select few students spoke while everyone else listened.",

I think that the course is a true junior seminar -- there is little hand-holding and you are expected to have a very strong background in literature. But Bromwich is responsive to emails and meetings outside of class, which was helpful especially for the long final paper.",

                "Depends on what you want. If you want to learn how Bromwich sees the world (which I did, and continue to do, because it's fascinating) I highly recommend the course. If you want Bromwich to learn from you and come to knew paradigms together, that probably won't happen.",
                "moves a little quickly but solid survey of Shakespeare. I think people respond to Bromwich differently and it's worth sitting in on a class to sense whether you like the way he runs his classes.",

                "Again, I would recommend this course to someone interested in reading a few Shakespeare plays and discussing the philosophical and political ramifications of the ideas and themes, but not necessarily for someone interested in taking a \"Shakespeare class\" at Yale.",
                "Professor Bromwich dominates this course. If you like him and think he has smart things to say about these plays (which he often does!) you will be happy in the class. But do yourself a favor and read some of Professor Bromwich's writing, including his most recent piece in Harper's magazine, to make sure his are the kinds of insights you're interested in. English at Yale is not for everyone, and the word \"political\" means a very specific kind of politics. In the end, while I was often frustrated by this course, I found plenty to appreciate about it."
