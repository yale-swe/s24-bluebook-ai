I am a graduate student and my program is quite unrelated to comparative physiology, but I decided to take this course out of genuine interest for the subject matter and to aid with medical school preparation. While the majority of the course was shaped around animal physiology, it was great to be able to see the parallels in body systems and evolutionary processes between different species and humans. Even for students who are not studying biology, this course helped me understand evolution through many different lenses and the professor made it easy for me to recognize comparisons and similarities in biology across the animal kingdom.",

                "This course was very interesting but everything was weighted very highly for example, if you get one point off of a hw assignment, now the highest grade that you can possibly get is a 99. I felt as though this hindered me from actually understanding the material and made me constantly question my ability in the course.",
                "Professor Munoz is amazing. She's clear in the concepts that she explains during lecture, and is very open to helping students with more examples\/explanations during office hours. I think a strength of this course is that the material, at least the way the professor teaches it, is so interesting and the professor is so passionate about the material that it makes you excited to learn",
                "Professor Muoz is a gem. Take any of her classes that you can. She is knowledgeable and organized, yet approachable. As far as weaknesses, the class sometimes felt repetitive if you came in with a strong background in biology or anatomy. Also, having quizzes worth 2% of your grade each, without a curve meant that the single question could potentially alter your final grade.",
                "The greatest strength of this course was Dr. Muoz. Her teaching was engaging and her passion for the subject was apparent.",
                "Strength: both Professor Munoz and Brooke were extremely willing to help, very friendly, and always making an effort to accommodate to people's individual circumstances, which made it a great learning environment",
                "Strengths: Both Prof. Muoz and Brooke were very sweet and responded promptly to emails. The material was fascinating. I thought the flexibility in answering 5 out of 6 questions was really refreshing in a biology class, and I appreciated Prof Muoz's understanding of the complex situation this semester raised.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In its totality, the questions were poorly worded and vague. I think the vagueness of the questions negatively impacted my ability to showcase what I knew, and I think contributed to the significant exam stress (particularly in the second midterm) because I wasn't sure from what angle to approach the question. This was only compounded by questions that asked us to comment on the evolutionary origins of things that are still not fully explained in the literature. Additionally, I felt like the system of assigning partial credit was opaque and often seemed extreme, especially because literally any deduction on an assignment or exam could be directly tied to the final grade (e.g. a deduction of 0.5 would mean your entire grade in the class was docked 0.5 percent). I wish that we could see a rubric for how credit is assigned like in other classes which would help improve my understanding of the material for the future. Also, I wish that the class went over experimental design in much more detail because a significant portion of the final grade was dependent on designing experiments that we never really discussed how to design. Also, I felt like the homework itself was not particularly helpful for student learning because a) the questions for the assignment were often very vague, and b) only tangentially touched on what we discussed in class. It would have been far more helpful to have homework assignments geared towards to the material we learned in class, and perhaps don't grade so rigidly on correctness or allow for collaboration between students because so much of my time was spent not actually digesting the information, but rather trying to figure out how much to include or exclude in an answer because I didn't want to lose half a percent of my grade for an otherwise perfectly correct answer.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Munoz! She is such an engaging instructor, and I learned a lot\/was more engaged just by the way that she taught the course. The material that she chose to highlight in lectures was also very cool--never boring! A challenge for this course (which I think was just a product of us holding the course virtually during 2020) was that the entire course was out of 100 points, so the grades you made on assignments directly impacted your overall course grade. In the future, it would be so great to have a little cushion in case someone has a bad experience right before an assessment that would negatively impact their performance.",
                "The homework assignments could be completed without knowing any of the lecture material (they were short response questions to a scientific paper), which can be a strength of weakness depending on how you view it. A definite strength of the course is Professor Munoz-- she is so enthusiastic and excited to be there during the lectures, which is a totally different vibe from most Yale STEM professors.",
                "strengths: lecture topics ranged widely in subject, numerous guest speakers presenting their own research in physiology, homework and exams had fair material and format (open book, untimed, relatively short), Prof Muoz's familiarity and engagement with the lecture material and taking questions\r\n\r\nweaknesses: grading system is somewhat punitive in that each point on a homework assignment or quiz or exam corresponded to a whole point on the final average, and the sometimes vague or misguiding wording of questions only compounded this issue. textbook not helpful for the class material",
                "While virtual learning is certainly not ideal for any course, I think the professor and TF made the virtual format for this course as engaging as possible. The powerpoint presentations were extremely easy to follow, and the professor always seemed extremely well prepared for each lecture. It is difficult to say how this course could be improved in any ways that are not directly related to the online format, which is out of the professor's control.",
                "Lecture is extremely engaging where the speaking is complementary to the slides presented. The professor has done great preparation work. The professor combined the historic information and the up-to-date study of the field very well, and she is equally eloquent in teaching both of them. The assignments are appropriately assigned and the questions are carefully devised.\r\n\r\nThe assignment feedback system was hard to engage in. Sometimes remaining questions about grading to particular questions were unaddressed as the course moves fast. I wished the TA and professor can gather common questions from the assignment and address them quickly over the lecture.",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Muoz. She made the course accessible, engaging, and filled with energy. Every topic she spoke on had me rapt with attention, furiously scribbling notes because it was all so interesting! The set-up of the course was great, the pacing was like other classes (which is too fast for me, but that's because of my attention issues). The guest lectures were outstanding, and truly elevated the course to a new level. The only weakness I can think of was the lack of reminders on when work was due: there was inconsistency on whether there would be a reminder in class or not. Several times I looked at the syllabus and realized there was work due THAT DAY. However, this may be more of an organizational challenge for me, although other courses were on top of reminding the class. Something that can be seen as both a strength and a weakness is that the exams draw from the material, but apply it in ways that you have not done before."

                "open book and untimed assignments",
                "I found it extremely helpful that each assignment was made available for several days (e.g., we had a three day period during which we could view, complete, and submit the midterm and final exams). Given the online format of everything, the extended time periods for every assignment certainly eased any nerves about having tech issues during assignment periods. Also, while in an in-person course, it is easy to ask the professor clarifying questions during an assignment of exam, this is obviously not quite as simple in the virtual format. Having several days to complete assignments gave all of the students a better chance at understanding the questions being asked, and gave the professor and TF time to answer questions over email- this made the course much more fair and made it so that the students could maximize their successfulness on each assignment. As for improvements, there were a few lectures that were not recorded, that were then missing from the Canvas page and could not be referenced for study purposes, so it would be beneficial if lectures could be automatically recorded so that no lectures are lost.",

                "Physiology is a pre-req for many graduate programs as well as the E&EB major track 2, but overall the course material was interesting and Prof Nuoz communicated it well. I have qualms about the grading style (each point on an assignment = a point on your final average) and how it makes it hard to recover after one bad grade, but it also really makes you look over your answers. \r\n\r\nI took this course after Anatomy because it has a higher course number in the E&EB curriculum. In hindsight I would recommend taking this course first before anatomy, since there is a lot of overlap and my already learning material from anatomy definitely helped in this course. Still, you would probably be just fine in physiology having taken anatomy or not.",

                "I would most DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. The exams take you by surprise sometimes, but reading the textbook may help with that (I did not, which probably led to my surprise). This course is stuffed with info, and with about 6 assignments, 6 quizzes, and 2 exams, it is definitely manageable as an extra course. As a chemistry major, the material was very accessible, and even delved into some chemical concepts like diffusion (and some biomechanics which is AWESOME), so that was a major plus. I also took E&EB 290 before this, which helped a little. However, this course would not have helped if you took E&EB 295 after it, and so I recommend taking E&EB 290 first (it is strange this course is taught in fall and E&EB 290 is taught in spring)."
