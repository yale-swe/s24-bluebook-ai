                "There wasn't too much speaking\/interpersonal practice, but that can be expected from an L1 course. Overall, I think it teaches the basics well. There isn't a huge focus on actually learning the characters per se, but I think a part of that is due to the online format.",
                "The biggest weakness is the speed at which this course moves. For an actual beginner in the language it requires hours and hours of time outside of class just to try and get caught up. Each lesson was rushed through, thus by the the time you complete the next lesson, you already forget the one before it. This course moves too quick for an actual beginner to master the concepts being taught.",
                "One of the strengths is that due to the very high engagement levels of the course, I get a very good grasp of the language. However the workload is quite heavy because we have homework that is due everyday.",
                "Really good at drilling reading and writing skills, but sentence structures were not reviewed often.",
                "The strength was that it was highly interactive.\r\nThe weakness was that there were some lags on Zoom.",
                "Curriculum and syllabus were very clear",
                "The biggest weakness for me was in terms of logistics: we would check the \"weekly schedule\" to see what assignments we have to do and the plan for this week. Instead of concentrating everything on Canvas, we would have to go to Quia and do workbook exercises too. I feel like it could easily be organised in a more straight-forward way. This also impacts the final grade. It is kinda difficult to understand what went into the evaluation.",
                "Strength - very engaging professor, daily homework to keep you in check, and very good TAs and resources\r\nWeakness - A LOT of daily homework and quizzes and can get overwhelming at times. Also, you don't really know your final grade until the end of the term."
