   "comments": [
    "The course was great overall.",
    "A strength of this course was that the content was more challenging than that of L2, meaning that I felt more pushed to learn. The passages were especially helpful. I also appreciated the cultural studies that we did, especially of proverbs. Structurally, I like that we had take-home exams, since they take some of the edge off the class and emphasize learning and practicing concepts (even though they de-emphasize memorization, since you have all your notes with you). A major weakness of the class was the lack of homework. Obviously, it made the class easier, but I also felt like I learned a lot less without mandatory practice. Bringing back weekend homework, at the least, would be great. I also wish that we were forced to speak Yoruba more, though hopefully that will happen in L4 since that class is not mandatory for people like L1-L3 were.",
    "-felt like there were no enough resources\r\n-expected to make language without having all the knowledge to do so\r\n-fun professor but feels like sometimes he just throws work at you for doing sake instead of learning purposes  \r\n-literally zero feedback is given \r\n-but easy language credit",
    "It does a great job of interacting with students and keeping them engaged.",
    "organization and frequent canvas updates could be improved.",
    "Strengths: Lenient on homework and allows us to do it when we have the time, Also he gives good feedback when the student is looking for help, Tries to accommodate the students\r\n\r\nWeakness: Doesn't give enough time to truly master any one section or focus, Learn a lot of stuff so only some can be retained"

    "I would. Yoruba is fun and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, this class is an absolute blast learning under Professor Seye.",
    "Absolutely! Its a cool way to keep learning Yoruba if youre interested. However, the courses free structure, though chiller than courses like Spanish, does put more of the onus on you to learn. You can learn A LOT if you put effort in, but you wont learn much if you dont try.",
    "-recommend for a easy language credit but if you care about learning Yoruba you have to apply yourself more than the class allows you too",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, If one is interested in going to Africa or about the Yoruban people this is a great course to enhance their knowledge."
