So much of what animated this course was a sense that our current way of construing the relationship between the study of empirical reality and projects of social change need to be inverted: speculation, perhaps, can help us find a way out of the many intersecting crises that exist in the present moment.",

                "This course was pretty experimental (by design), and so it was inevitably going to be a bit rough around the edges. The first half considered different forms of speculation, while the second half was an extended group exercise. I think that specific weeks of the first half of the course will appeal to different people based on the interests they are coming in with: given my academic background, I was much more interested in the week on speculative fiction, for example, than I was on the week on speculative design. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest way the course could be improved is by rethinking the second half creative project. Ours ended up being quite improvisatory, as we (including Professor Messeri) collectively decided we didn't want to take part in the project that Professor Messeri included on the original syllabus. So I think that ideally the course could formalize a more specific version of what the creative project looks like.",
                "incredible course concept. Prof Messeri really expanded what I thought a class could be like. I think finding clearer parameters for the collective world building would have helped a lot. Constraints help my creativity a lot more than open freedom."
