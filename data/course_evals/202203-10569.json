I learned a lot from reading the comprehensive Canvas posts from the other students.",

                "Strengths: Prof Franks and Prof Stern are a dynamic duo and complement each other so well with their specialty areas. Everyone I know in the course learned so much and was able to explore their personal interests as they relate to broader Idealism. I could not imagine a better curated or more holistic course, as we examined both the thematic, historical, theological, and rhetorical aspects of thinkers.",
                "The syllabus for this course was really great, and I loved how the professors engaged with students during the class (ie answering questions). I also liked how paper topics were centered around specific quotes from the readings, which made us really dig into the text while writing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course's lecture format was disappointing. The class was originally listed as a seminar, and I wish that the professors had limited enrollment so that there could be more discussion and close-reading around a seminar table. As taught, the lectures often felt dry (or just long), and mostly recapped the readings themselves rather than broadening into a more synthetic group discussion. Doing the course as a lecture made it hard to really feel engaged in the course.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I feel that the course's emphasis on Luther and Kabbalah could have been more clear from the get-go. I was under the impression that the course would be more of a \"survey\" of the religious underpinnings of German Idealism, and instead it taught a more specific set of connections. These connections were, however, fascinating, and certainly worth studying."

Interest in German Idealism is definitely needed to put in the thought to tie the readings together and approach conclusions independently, but this is the type of course that consumes one's excess intellectual energy to the point of seeing the whole world in terms of Idealism, and its very exciting.",
