We addressed questions about revolution, the role of political thought, and many more, including criticism of modernity itself. I enjoyed the way the course was reflexive in that way  our later thinkers were very much in dialogue with the thinkers we studied at the beginning of the semester and last year.",

Being able to place these authors in conversation with each other and see their analysis of questions which are still being explore in contemporary politics was very interesting, and I look forward to being able to revisit this content further in my academic career.",

I thought they paired very well with their placement in the syllabus, but some readings, like Hegel or Kant, felt a little gratuitous without extra context.",

                "The discussions were all very intriguing and examined each text deeply, and the lectures were very informative. However, lectures at times were lengthy and posted too late for me to watch them before my first class which was Monday morning, so in the future perhaps lectures could be posted a day or more in advance for students who have monday morning classes.",
                "I can personally say that I struggled with the later portions of the syllabus - though I did the readings and payed attention in class, I still found it hard to grasp the overarching themes of the later authors and their relationships to each other. I think that if we were able to spend more time on those authors or discuss more of the connections between them, I could've gained more from that section.",
