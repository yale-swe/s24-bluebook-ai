It provided different methods of learning and opportunities to speak/present/listen/discuss/read/write/etc through projects and assignments. I loved the themes of the class (there were five) and how they gave us complex and interesting things to discuss.",

All the presentation and speaking opportunities provided the time I needed to improve. Additionally, the exchange program was great in terms of comprehension and helped me gain insights into Latin American culture.",

                "This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale thus far. The unit projects were excellent, and Prof. Leon guided in-class discussion in a way that yielded a lot of critical thinking and interesting perspectives being shared.",
                "Strengths: engagement with a variety of Spanish-language sources such as films, articles, and novels; abundant opportunities to build Spanish reading, writing, and speaking skills through projects, presentations, essays, and classroom discussion; super clear feedback from Profesora Len. Weaknesses: I feel like the grammatical review could be emphasized more with possibly more review resources offered, since some students like me may be slightly rusty on Spanish grammar going into the class",
                "Strengths:\r\n-great themes\r\n-generally good amount of homework and project work\r\n-great to have class three days/week for under an hour (frequency helped with practicing my spanish more often)\r\n-it was cool having conversation partners in Peru to talk with every week\r\n-the guest speakers were also so interesting\r\n-I loved having small group and large group discussions with my classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-sometimes the requirements for assignments were not as clear as they could be\r\n-I think there could be more instruction on grammar if it is going to be tested (often the one page explanation of the grammar concept wasn't enough)",
                "Strengths: great field trip to YUAG, two amazing speakers (Roy Brown and Alberto Belaunde), and a Peruvian Zoom Pal (I learned so much!), class taught entirely in Spanish; each unit deals with a very interesting different topic and each contains different types of assignments; project-based assignments; professor accessible during office hours. Weaknesses: high work volume, could have used a few more lessons about grammar prior to online grammar homework assignments.",
                "This course had a variety of opportunities to practice different skills relating to the Spanish language. There was some confusion about where homework was posted at times but other than that I enjoyed the content and projects.",
                "Strengths: student participation-oriented, professor was great (also so sweet), taught in Spanish so your command of the language improves through the constant practice, covers lots of different areas"

                "Absolutely-- it is a fair bit of work and you'll need to be pretty engaged with the class to get a lot out of it, but in my opinion it is totally worth it. I was not at all bothered by the fact that it met three days a week, and looked forward to this class a lot because of the variety of fascinating topics covered.",
                "Absolutely. By emphasizing engagement with native material (articles, novels, films) rather than memorizing grammar and vocab, this class helped me grow my Spanish reading, writing, and speaking skills more than five years of high school Spanish.",
                "Definitely! It was a great way to practice and improve my Spanish for practical application, which was exactly what I was looking for.",
                "Yes, if you care about honing your Spanish speaking, writing, and comprehension skills and want to learn about Spanish culture and important social topics through project-based learning in a seminar-style immersion environment chock full with discussion, this is for you. I wouldn't call this class a gut.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in deepening their understanding of Spanish once they know the basics. I feel like I am almost fluent thanks to this course.",
