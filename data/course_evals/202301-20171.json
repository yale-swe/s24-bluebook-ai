                "I learned about several historical examples of activism in US healthcare.",
                "Learned a tremendous amount about health activist histories in the US, specific case studies (such as AIDS, women's health movement, disability justice) and developed skills in database research and primary and secondary source analysis.",
                "I learnt a lot about the history of various activism movements including how to analyze them. We learnt a lot about ways in which activism plays a role in society and intersects with both radical and neoliberal ideas.",
                "As a history major concentrating in science, medicine, and technology, I feel like this class really exposed me to the institutional realm of medicine - both in terms of the role of the state as well as how activists on the ground shape health politics. I also learned to write a research paper; this was my first time writing a final paper of 15 pages, and I found it to be an incredibly rewarding and challenging experience.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor O'Donnell is an incredible person and educator -- she clearly cares about the students and about ensuring that we really are able to learn from and with each other. She is no doubt the biggest strength of this class. The readings were largely wonderful, and even when there were some readings that largely felt out of place, I felt that that in itself provoked a really powerful discussion that I was grateful to have with my peers. Weaknesses: none.",
                "The class conversation sometimes stalled and wasnt as intellectually stimulating as it could have been. I felt like letting conversation flow more naturally or asking less abstract questions and focusing on what students found exciting in the readings wouldve helped with the lack of conversation.",
                "I enjoyed this seminar and Professor O'Donnell. However, I would've appreciated an overarching theme to tie all the cases we studied together. I feel like we just kind of touched on several topics without explicitly connecting them.",
                "This course had so many strengths! For one, our discussions felt very natural and the community was very welcoming and warm. The content itself was truly fascinating and allowed us to engage with health activist histories with both breadth and depth. Professor O'Donnell did a wonderful job of curating the readings, scaffolding the assignments, and facilitating our discussions. I cannot think of many weaknesses, but one possible one is that at times our class discussions would get a bit distracted/steer off from the initial points we were trying to address. It was fine, however, because the discussions were valuable nonetheless. It probably would have also been better to end with a reading other than Susan M. Reverby's Co-conspirator for Justice: The Revolutionary Life of Dr. Alan Berkman (as we discussed in class). It would have also been helpful to have more comments from Professor O'Donnell on my final paper draft, to supplement the peer comments I received.",
                "This class facilitated good discussions, and everyone's level of engagement made for a good discussion. Some of the class readings were hit or miss, but the discussion was always engaging. Kelly O'Donnell is good at leading discussions and welcomes many points and ideas. I also enjoyed that the whole class was building up to a final paper, which allowed me to deeply engage with the material.",
                "The readings are absolutely fantastic. Professor O'Donnell is also just wonderful, kind, passionate, and an excellent facilitator. I always really looked forward to class. I think this course would have benefitted from discussion posts or perhaps discussion questions to frame each class. I also enjoyed when Professor O'Donnell brought in other forms of media/presentation materials and would have liked to see this more often.",
                "I thought this course focused too much on a white perspective. The discussions weren't very interesting as the questions asked were super basic."

I really enjoyed the way that the course was structured and I felt that it helped provide a nice scaffolding for understanding how to write a term paper in preparation for a senior essay.",
                "No, I didnt sufficiently enjoy class discussions and the class readings to feel that it enriched my history of science knowledge.",
                "Yes - I would recommend this course to any student interested in the intersection of health justice and history! There is so much to learn and so many points of entry to get into these histories.",
                "I would! It was a cool seminar and a topic that is really important in the history of medicine. Also critical for anyone wanting to go into activism! I'm unsure if it will be taught again, but if it is, maybe look at the readings and see if they interest you because that was the only draw back to the class.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. The material was fascinating, the discussions were invigorating, and I came away from the class feeling inspired to apply my skills and passions to health activism in some way.",
                "Honestly no, unless its taught much differently."
