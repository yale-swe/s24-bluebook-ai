    "The ability for the teacher to guide students could be improved. His usual response to questions is I dont understand what you are asking.",
    "I think the material was not that difficult but the way we were taught made it very complicated and make it hard to learn. I think the way the Professor conveyed the ideas was fun and engaging sometimes but he would get confused and it was hard to volunteer.",
    "I think it would be useful to cover less topics and focus better on some of the more intricate and confusing ones.",

    "Yes. Helps in life",

    "I would recommend this course to others.",
    "Most likely no. The teachers style is scary for people scared of the QR credit.",
