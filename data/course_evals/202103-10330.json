I also learned so much about our the foundational arguments of abolition vs police reform. The works we read we some of the best compilation of authors as well as pieces from the other side of things meaning more reformist, government, and research views.",
                "I learned a lot during this course about my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. I think that English 114 classes are great courses to begin with as a freshman at Yale because of the focus on analytical writing, thesis constructing, and creating a coherent essay. These are all things that I had to confront last semester and I grew tremendously as a writer in this class. I developed better close reading, organizational, and time management. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in social justice and social justice in the US and who is eager to improve their basic essay writing skills.",
                "A focused examination into racialized, anti-Black police violence and strategies for (police) abolition; engagement with a variety of scholars and texts (from poems to novels to interviews to government reports); writing coherently and presenting our ideas in multiple ways (Kassidi gave us much flexibility with how we wrote our essays and did our projects, especially with the creative project at the end of the semester)",
                "Prior to taking this course I was unsure of what scholars to turn to for new perspectives or to substantiate beliefs that I held. Through this course I was able to read a variety of different types of literature and studies from black authors and activists and other people dedicated to the abolition or reformation of the police and prison systems. I also developed better close reading skills."

In addition, the readings were great. Finally, it was a very manageable class that genuinely took into account how difficult going to Yale is.",
                "This course was modeled as a typical undergraduate seminar at Yale with ample focus on weekly readings and class discussions, as well as writing assignments. The strengths in this course include extremely interesting and thought-provoking readings that are related to the general topic, and creative and challenging essay prompts. I only wish that we had more time to discuss the readings and have intense, in depth conversations about the concepts.",

                "Absolutely!  I think everyone would benefit from taking this course.  You'll grow so much as a writer and a thinker and you'll have an amazing time along the way.  I sincerely looked forward to this class every single time.",
                "I dont think I would. At times the class seemed a bit repetitive.",
                "I would 100% recommend it. It is an amazing course and so important to understanding abolition and policing. Especially is Kassidi teaches it again.",
                "Absolutely!! This class makes you think deeply and write purposefully about anti-Black police violence, systemic anti-Blackness more broadly, and abolition. As an ENGL 114 seminar that is intended to be an entry point for first-years, I came in as someone who knew little about police reform and abolition. After taking the class, I realize how much *more* I actually do not know  Kassidi and her seminar make you ask more and more questions. Everyone should take this class or a class similar to this one for its tight focus on racialized state violence and abolition as its solution. This was the best class of my semester by far, and I learned so much. I think this class made me realize my passion for racial equity work and solidified how I want to major in something like Ethnicity, Race, and Migration or Sociology, etc.\r\n\r\nDefinitely would recommend.\r\n\r\n*Note for trans and non-binary students: Kassidi does an amazing job at making her class a safe space. As a trans student who is early on in transition, I always felt respected and safe to share my identity with Kassidi (my pronouns, chosen names, etc.) and in the classroom environment she fostered. She proactively reached out to me too to check in\/make sure things were okay. All around, she made sure the semester was a really queer\/trans friendly space.",
                "Absolutely. The scholarship that was curated for us was diverse and stimulating. Class was engaging. Assignments were challenging but manageable. I learned a lot about police abolition and gained a much more solid understanding of the movement's history and contemporary challenges. This was, by far, my favorite class this semester.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only are the readings interesting but the subject matter is very important and relevant."
