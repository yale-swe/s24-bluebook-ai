                "Great class, maybe if we tried to study a few more non-traditional leaders that would add some depth.",
                "Maybe improved by having students do small presentations on a leader/innovation of their choice in small groups. This would be fun if the students chose leaders/innovations  that werent well known or perhaps were in niche industries. I think this would give people an opportunity to get to know others in the class and be a fun way to start each class. The presentations could be laid back and creative",
                "Strengths are the reading materials chosen, discussions we have, and guest lecturers. Weaknesses are a lack of feedback on papers and some of the readings can be a bit lengthy.",
                "Strengths: I thought the concept of the class was really cool, and our discussions were very cool. This class attracts a very interesting combination of people, which definitely contributes to the positive environment. The guests were also fascinating.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to get more feedback on my writing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baldwin's personal experiences in the private sector and the U.S. Navy were extremely insightful. His selection of leaders were great as well. Professor created a very welcoming and inclusive atmosphere of free speech. Mentorship was evident and seminar questions were compelling. Class exercises from pitches, debates to self-reflection periods were awesome. \r\nWeaknesses: Cost of books acquired for the class amounted to nearly $200-250 dollars.",
                "Strengths: structure/readings, lively class discussion, wisdom and responsiveness of professor\r\nWeaknesses: think the leaders studied could be more expansive to include modern day",
                "Strengths: Prof Baldwin is a nice guy\r\nWeaknesses: the class is essentially a book club about white men. Not much you learn and very little case studies on leadership, which is what I was hoping for.",
                "Great readings and engagement in the class. Professor picked an active and diverse group.",

                "Yes! Its nice that its a small seminar and some of the readings were really interesting. You get exposed to some stories you may not have otherwise. I enjoyed the activities he had us do in groups. I also had a lot of fun with my two papers because I choose more niche innovations and leaders. This way its more fun so I recommend doing that",
                "Yes if you are interested in business, leadership, or innovation. The class is also very America-centric, so be aware that internationally acclaimed leaders are not studied in this course.",
                "Yes, this is one of those courses that I think will serve me far beyond Yale -- I'm really glad I took it!",
                "I highly recommend this course to students at Yale who have a difficulty to find classes dedicated to science and principles of leadership. The course evaluated political, military and business leaders. There were excellent speakers in the class and if you are interested in government and startups - this is a go-to seminar.",
                "For anyone interested in a more practical class, definitely! It was a very refreshing way of looking at things and gaining valuable insights on leadership and innovation. The class did feel a bit skewed politically to the right",
                "I wouldnt. Prof Baldwin was a relatively tough grader and provided no feedback, and made the class more of a course guided towards idolizing people like Rockefeller. I really wished it was more of a practical course, but that is not what you get.",
