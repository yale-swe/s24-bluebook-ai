    "I have learned literally so much in this course. Its insane how much information they fit into one semester and how fast paced it is.",
    "I went from knowing absolutely no Russian to being able to write coherently and speak. This course was fantastic.",
    "Five of the six cases in Russian, lots of vocab, and lots about Russian culture",
    "I learned the basics of russian language, grammar, and pronunciation.",
    "Learned more Russian in one semester than three years of Spanish in High School!",
    "Speaking reading and writing",
    "My knowledge of spoken and written Russian rose exponentially. I found myself able to understand basic conversations in Russian (one of my happiest memories of this last semester was overhearing a Russian family at a restaurant and realizing I was able to comprehend what they were saying). It's obvious to say that I fully understand the Cyrillic alphabet and thus can now read conceivably any Russian word; I also know the fundamental pronunciation rules (hard and soft consonants, vowel reduction, and so on). Taking this course also taught me some time management skills when it comes to balancing homework and other activities.",
    "Basic knowledge of Russian Cyrillic alphabet, accent, grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.",
    "I gained an intensive introduction to Russian. We learned tenses, 5\/6 cases, vocab, and pronunciation. I've started noticing patterns in each."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was super well organized and the consistent workload made it easier to manage.",
    "The combination of watching videos, doing textbook activities, doing worksheets\/working with partners and listening to Julia lecture was good.",
    "Strengths: Julia Titus, the textbook, and the structure of the class (largely discussion based).",
    "Workload is nightly, but only a couple pages. Pace is even, class is very structured. Julia is a great instructor; she is funny, engaging, and very clear. There are lots of opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nOf course, Russian is not an easy language, so there is a learning curve, but it is manageable!",
    "The work load is a lot",
    "The strengths of this course are the fast feedback, digestible amount of information, and abundance of learning materials.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are the lack of emphasis on pronunciation (most of the coursework is on writing and reading Russian) and the fact that once behind, it is very hard to catch up.\r\nI think the course could be improved by adding more quizzes.",
    "This course provides a very strong foundation for those wishing to study the Russian language. However, the textbook utilized does teach a lot of unnecessary vocabulary, while neglecting some more foundational vocabulary. Additionally, the pacing of the different grammatical cases was a bit erratic. I think that while the quality of instruction is very high, the course would benefit from teaching a different set of introductory words and phrases. Additionally, the quiz or test every week necessitated cramming concepts every week without having the chance to really build on previously tested concepts.",
    "I found this to be a very fast paced course. I would have benefited more from it if topics were reviewed and explained in more detail so we could have some time to think about the rules and ask questions later. In my opinion, there was too much emphasis on correct spelling (or rather, too great of punishments grade-wise when spelling was slightly incorrect) with a disproportionate amount of explaining and giving examples of the spelling rules. There was also more writing than speaking. I would also have liked to have some quizzes\/tests handwritten just for practice (if possible), even though I know typing is far easier to grade."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I loved this class, and Im definitely not a language person.",
    "Yes, again I learned so much in such a short period of time.",
    "Yes! Russian is such an interesting language and Professor Titus is an amazing instructor",
    "Yes, definitely! It is a great class with a great professor and interesting material. Much better than a basic language like Spanish! Tip: Study the Cryllic Aphabet before the class starts so you have a head start!",
    "It is a very time consuming subject",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The teachers are very willing to help students and are incredibly knowledgeable in all dimensions of the Russian language. There are plenty of office hours and there is definitely flexibility. Students will have to apply themselves, but hard work in this class will definitely result in a strong grasp of the Russian language. I find the teaching style very effective and I personally learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for those who are intent on learning the Russian language. This course is very rigorous and the Russian language is not easy, but the quality of the instructors makes up for the difficulty. Its important to note that this course is worth 1.5 credits for a reason, but it provides a fantastic foundation for learning Russian.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking Russian. It was a great introduction, and I have gained some confidence in my ability to speak and understand basic Russian."
