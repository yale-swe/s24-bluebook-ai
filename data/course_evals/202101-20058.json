                "Strengths: The professor is fabulous. She is extremely intelligent, provided thoughtful feedback on assignments, and brought in really interesting examples from her own research.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class structure made it difficult to engage with the topics at hand. Not sure if the structure was modified as a result of COVID, but it was all student-led discussions based on readings. If you read the readings, then class time felt kind of useless.",
                "interesting subject",
                "*Strengths: - Excellent professor and Teaching Fellow who were extremely kind, welcoming, and knowledgable. I really felt like they cared not only about the   subject matter, but also the students.\r\n- Interesting subject matter that was as broad or as in-depth as the students wanted to get out of it.\r\n- Interesting and engaging discussions about readings, made even more interesting by the fact that the class was composed of both undergrads and grad students, with different interests and backgrounds within Archaeology.\r\n- Accessible for students with any level of Archaeology experience (for reference, I had nothing but a passing interest in archaeology when beginning this course, and loved it).\r\n- Great variation of class activities and assignments; mostly discussions during class, but also presentations from the professor and TF, videos, student presentations, guest professors, etc. Also really fun and engaging assignments that were adapted to a virtual environment: virtual or COVID-safe viewing of artifacts from the Peabody, and virtual or COVID-safe pottery demonstrations, with project(s) and papers that connected to these activities. 1 project and 2 papers, all of which were interesting and different!\r\n- Students led discussions each class, which was great!\r\n- Assignment deadlines were manageable and explicitly respected the break days so that we didn't have extra work on days that were supposed to be break days.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses: - The only thing I can think of is that sometimes the readings were extremely long, but I suppose that's because it's a seminar that only meets once a week.",
                "The focus on discussion and having the chance to exchange so many ideas is definitely a wonderful  strength of the course. \r\nHowever, I think the course could benefit from having less readings to discuss from 5 to perhaps 3 or 4. This way, we could have more time to better go through each reading, and also to discuss all the readings in class without running out of time.\r\nIt would also be great to have more time for the presentations given by the Professor and TF in some classes, as those were always very enriching.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating content, incredible professor and TF. \r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading (felt a little unmanageable)"

Instead of the in-person pottery making and demonstrations of previous years, we watched videos in class and also had virtual or COVID-safe pottery demonstrations. We were also able to view artifacts at the Peabody: through the digitized database, on a Zoom call through a fancy camera at the Peabody, and/or COVID-safe in-person.",
