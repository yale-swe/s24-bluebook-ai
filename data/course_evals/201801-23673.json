    "Improved my spanish",
    "I think what I developed most my my Spanish speaking ability. I talked for almost half each class with a partner and this was very valuable.",
    "I didn't actually learn much. The curriculum is very similar to that of L2 and the professor was either incompetent or confused throughout the semester.",
    "I learned more Spanish grammar structures, vocabulary, and speaking skills.",
    "Improved my spanish listening and writing skills",
    "Reviewed many intermediate level Spanish topics. Also gained much more confidence in my Spanish speaking ability.",
    "My fluency, reaction time, and vocabulary improved tremendously.",
    "I developed knowledge in Spanish grammar, acquired more vocabulary, and learned about Spanish culture.",
    "This course really helped me improve my Spanish grammar and writing. It also presented cultural material that was both very interesting and relevant."

   "comments": [
    "Sebastian is an awesome teacher, but the course covers a lot of material and sometimes does not spend enough time to completely understand the topic.",
    "The curriculum went over too many things I learned in L2. I had to pay $250 for textbooks that weren't necessary and just re-taught me the same things I learned last semester. However, the worst problem with this course was the professor, who is an ASS.",
    "A strength was that there was a lot of time in class to speak with classmates. One area of improvement would be a more flexible homework schedule.",
    "The course needs more speaking practice. I feel that my speaking is by far the weakest relative to the others.",
    "The strength was the professor because he was hilarious, the weakness was the rigid structure of the Spanish curriculum.",
    "Strengths: The course operates like a well-oiled machine without any real hiccups. The course structure is well thought-out and definitely helps facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course materials for this class are UNREASONABLY expensive. The course materials for this class alone have cost me more than all my other classes together combined. There should be more affordable options for students who struggle to pay for such expensive course materials, which is a real shame because SPAN 130 is a great class.",
    "Strengths: partner activities, fast-paced in excitement but not too fast that the content got overwhelming, a friendly environment that made me feel comfortable speaking.\r\nWeaknesses: homework sometimes felt like busy work, often was given many practice sheets but rarely the answers to check them",
    "Professor did not clearly explain the grammar or answer questions clearly.",
    "Strengths: \r\n *course was taught in Spanish and students were required to communicate in Spanish\r\n *reviewed previously-learned grammar\r\n *new grammatical structures were taught very effectively\r\n *daily assignments and relatively frequent assessments made it easier to stay on track with course materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n *grammar is hard (general statement)",
    "This course emphasized grammar and writing. As a student who lacks Spanish speaking proficiency, I think it should incorporate more activities to improve speaking. The short videos, movie, and stories were all very interesting, and it was good and helpful to experience Spanish material that was authentic. It was a great learning and cultural experience."

   "comments": [
    "Good course, take it with Sebastian if you can, he's awesome.",
    "Yes, I loved this class and in general I am not a language person, but the teacher made this very enjoyable.",
    "No, this was a bad course. The books are too expensive and the teaching quality is poor. The curriculum is redundant and the pace is slow. I was able to pull good grades without trying and I do not feel like I've come out the other side of this semester much better at Spanish at all. But, if you like easy A's then this may be the language course for you.",
    "Yes, this class helped improve my Spanish grammar and made speaking more comfortable for me.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely a good class to help fulfill the language requirement. Take this class w\/ Professor Diaz! He is an absolutely fantastic person and professor. I had trouble always enjoying Spanish in high school, but Professor Diaz made this semester of Spanish super fun and enjoyable. The course material is not too bad if you took Spanish in high school, but moves fairly quickly for those who have not had previous exposure. Sometimes the assignments feel a little tedious, but definitely help build familiarity with the language. Overall great class though (especially if you're lucky enough to have Professor Diaz)!",
    "100%. I think the success of the class stemmed from the funny and welcoming nature of our professor, as well as the strength of the curriculum. You can definitely tell they have been working hard to make sure that we had the proper tools to master the content without having it get overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it teaches students about the language as well as some culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--I felt that it was much better than L2 Spanish so I strongly suggest that you continue with this course. The material is more interesting and it helps build your Spanish skills (a lot)."
