    "I learned a ton about the different methodologies within the field of Sociology and the concepts behind them. I also went through the process of writing a thesis proposal and presenting on it, which was super helpful.",
    "Learned the different approaches I can take for writing a thesis and doing more research",
    "How to design and evaluate social science research, especially in regards to ethics and operationalizing abstract variables with various research methods.",
    "It's a required class, but you get a good overview of the different sociological methods.",
    "I learned a lot about how to conduct social research. I actually hope I had taken this course in the fall since learning about research methods made me so much more interested and engaged when reading about sociology researches.",
    "Learned overview of sociological methods and read & analyzed examples of them. Learned general experimental design & what makes a credible\/not credible study. Heard from different professors in the sociology department and about their research\/experiences."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is that the teacher is engaging and down to earth, and it is kind of a survey course but also kind of goes in depth on each topic.",
    "It was a little boring, just the topic itself isnt the most engaging but was taught well and did learn a lot",
    "Does a great job with the assignments on getting students to engage with the material and apply concepts learned in class. I particularly enjoyed the senior thesis review because it helped me gain an understanding of what a sociology thesis is like and how research methods can be applied. A downside to the course is how reading intensive it is. It feels like all of the material we cover is learned through weekly readings.",
    "I think an earlier focus on a project would be good to try and develop an idea through different methods! The readings could be dense at times as well. But I really like Professor Menon, and she's a great teacher.",
    "I loved the way the course was structured, with a mixture of lectures, class discussions, and a lot of guest speakers--it was a great opportunity to get to know the professors in the Sociology department.",
    "Interesting concepts, but could eliminate the memos. Not particularly useful and graded harshly.",
    "The course is really well\/clearly organized and the assignments were short but useful. The final paper at the end is a good way of displaying what we learned in the course, but there could be more assistance given to developing a final paper topic (e.g. mandatory meeting with professor or TF) since it's supposed to lead up to a sociology senior thesis."

   "comments": [
    "This course was good. I dont think I wouldve taken it Id i didnt have toother sociology classes have had more engaging assignments.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class it's probably because you're a sociology major so you have to. It's a pretty good course considering its about methods which can be pretty dry and Professor Menon is great at making discussion and class very interesting.",
    "Definitely if you are wanting to conduct sociology research. Also, it is helpful if you are going to do a senior thesis, which we pretty much all have to do.",
    "If writing a thesis definitely. And take it before your senior year.",
    "Only if you are required to for the sociology major or if you are really interested in social science research design.",
    "I would only really recommend it if you were a Sociology major. Because then it's mandatory",
    "I would very strongly recommend taking the Methods course with Prof. Menon. I wasn't very excited about the course at first as this was a required course but the course was extremely well-structured and I learned so much about conducting social research. Prof. Menon is a dynamic lecturer who cares a lot about her students. She shared her own research proposal and anecdotes from her research, which I found really helpful in imagining what conducting  sociology research is like. I also loved that the TAs gave guest lectures, allowing students to learn more about their work.",
    "Helpful for sociology students to begin to develop their theses. Otherwise is largely review.",
    "Yes if you're specifically interested in sociological methods and want to do your own sociological study. The course is very attuned to practical applications."
