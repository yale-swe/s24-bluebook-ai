                "This course has really expanded my imagination and skill in painting. It really pushed my creativity and my personal boundaries in what is possible to express through the use of color.",
                "Throughout this course, I learned how to paint from visual observation, photo references (natural and digitally manipulated), and from imagination. I also learned how to build, stretch, and prime canvas. Most importantly, I learned how to improve in my painting through practice, practice, practice!",
                "Independent project management, observational drawing\/painting, art critique and analysis",
                "I gained a significant amount of understanding of how to approach the thought process required for art creation. In past courses, and even in the first part of this course, I had spent most of my time in the studio attempting to improve my technical abilities and my capacity to render my work as I wanted it to look. In this course, largely with the help of Professor De Los Angeles, I think I grew as an artistic thinker as well as an artistic creator.",
                "I learned how to use true oil paints for the first time, and I also improved my color matching, mixing, and usage. I learned to be more intentional with my works, and I created some of the paintings I am most proud of!",
                "Better understanding of color, texture, composition",
                "I really enjoyed learning from my peers and thriving in a positive environment. The professor was always supportive and understanding and I was able to experience a great seminar class."

                "The course is very flexible, but gives enough structure and prompts to guide assignments.",
                "The course is very unstructured, which made me like it less than other art courses at Yale. If you like freedom to pick your own projects, it's a good class.",
                "It is a fantastic course - it gives sufficient amount of independence and flexibility and allows for exploration to develop own unique style. Sometimes I wish though the course provided a slightly more prescriptive guidance on the techniques to explore. That being said, when I requested such guidance during my 1:1 interactions with the Professor and the TA, I always received very helpful tips and feedback - it was just more in an unstructured format and highly personalized.",
                "The strengths of this course are its professors  Prof. Maria and TA Daniela were truly amazing. They were so supportive and gave incredibly beneficial feedback, answering questions and allowing students to explore their artistic identities while also developing their technical skills through practice. However, direct instruction on those technical skills (beyond direct observation) would have been incredibly helpful. I'd also love to have learned a bit more about different media and how to safely manipulate the texture of oil paints.",
                "It is a lot of projects for not very much time but the instructors are aware of it and encourage students to present and critique even unfinished work. Because of this system sometimes its difficult to know when one project ends and one begins. Projects are also self driven and the prompts are incredibly open ended which can be both bad and good.",
                "Strengths: diversity of assignments, freedom in making work, structure of course (time spent painting vs. doing demos and talks vs. doing crits), and teaching staff.\r\nWeaknesses: few and far between, though the one that stood out to me the most at the end of the course was how we seemed to have a far shorter period of time to complete the final project than we had to complete the other assignments. This made it pretty challenging to complete as many layers of paint as my final required since I was using oil.",
                "The assignments were structured but open enough to allow for complete artistic freedom and expression. Additionally, each critique was kind yet helpful. I believe that in this phase of students' lives, when we are still learning whether we want to center our lives around art, encouragement is much more fruitful than criticism, so I am grateful that critiques led each student to feel more proud of the work that they had created. In terms of improvement, I think if future professors encouraged students to meet with them in office hours (for longer periods of time), students might feel even more supported throughout the semester.",
                "There was not much time to do each assignment, which lead to many rushed paintings that I wished I couldve worked more on"

                "Absolutely - to any student passionate about art.",
                "If you want to PAINT whether or not you're a studio art major  you should absolutely enroll in this course. You will paint often (i.e., for 10 hours a week outside of class), so you really have to be willing and able to put in the time into this class in order to get the most out of it. It will be exciting, frustrating, peaceful, confusing, engaging, and meditative. Although it's expensive to start out, if you're interested in developing your artistic abilities and expanding your portfolio,  I absolutely recommend this course. You will think of painting. You might even dream of painting! Take ART 331!",
                "Yes, if they need a place to be creative and supported. No, if they want to learn the more technical aspects of painting like priming, light, etc.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is seriously interested in improving their painting abilities and that wants to continue to feed off the studio environment to improve at painting.",
                "Absolutely! If you would like the time and space to create more paintings (oil or acrylic especially), then take this class! Aside from maybe the VERY first two assignments (in which we were creating paintings in only a couple days in black and white), the assignments were NEVER limiting. If you had a vision the night before, you could always fit it into the framework provided in some way. But the assignments were also not so open-ended that you felt lost or overwhelmed.",
                "Yes! Love Maria and our TA Daniela.",
                "Yes! If the student is interested in fine arts and painting, then this class will allow them to grow as an artist."
