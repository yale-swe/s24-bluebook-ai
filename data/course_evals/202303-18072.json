Only critique is that a decent number of homeworks were announced pretty late over email with tight turnarounds, and some homework assignments were pretty long (couple hours) for a 1 day assignment. I think if that same assignment was given 2 or 3 days to do and announced far enough in advance it would work very well.",
                "Strengths: very engaging with a down to earth professor and simple homeworks made to hit specific topixs that need more work.\r\n\r\nWeakness: canvas system could be better organized, wasnt sure when exams would be and how big of a percentage it was."
