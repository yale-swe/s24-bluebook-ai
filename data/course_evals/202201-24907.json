                "Overall, I think this course could be improved. I found that I was teaching myself the course more than having my teachers teach me.",
                "I enjoyed this course overall. I felt like it was well organized and have an acceptable, helpful workload. I particularly liked how the Problem Sets were a little delayed in comparison to the course content since it allowed me to take more time to deeply understand the topics and work ahead on the homework when I felt like I understood. Some weaknesses are that this course needed better remote options. I was in COVID isolation for 10 days and fell behind since no online options or even class notes were offered to me except the pre-existing videos. Although the material I was given was enough to learn the content, I felt like I was falling behind my classmates and not getting the same understanding they were. The course content also seemed to jump around a bit, and I wish we learned how to distinguish between concepts as we were doing them. For instance, I did not really understand the difference between the types of integrals we did until the final since they were all taught jumbled together.",
                "The course is thorough in its coverage of multivariable calculus, but a lot of the learning must be done independently to be successful in the class.",
                "I think the course was designed nicely, but the experience you have depends a lot of the instructors which leads to a lot of inconsistencies.",
                "A more defined set of rules needed to understand, we did a lot of examples of the problems on the tests but every one seemed slightly different and sometimes wasnt a clear pathway to get an answer",
                "Overall this class is very well taught. I think the pre class videos were very helpful though Im sure many found them to be too much time. The timing of the psets is good, though u would personally have preferred to have then due maybe 1 or 2 days earlier.",
                "Weaknesses: truth/false questions on the exams are the weakness of the course and some of the problem sets were unnecessarily long, felt like there was a little bit too much self-learning involved, the most complex material of the class was crammed at the end of the semester\r\n\r\nStrengths: material is interesting, organization of classes in sections, well taught by my professor John Hall"
