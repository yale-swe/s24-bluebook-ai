                "Strengths: Professor Wagensonner is polite and kind and extremely knowledgeable in his field. Every day he amazed me with how much work he has done in this area. I appreciated the opportunities we had to ask questions and how well he answered them. I also loved holding and examining the ancient objects--this was definitely one of the highlights of the course for me. It would have been interesting to go to the YUAG as well and look at the cuneiform inscriptions there (and any other areas where ancient writing is apparent). Weaknesses: I felt a little bit \"thrown into the deep end\" with the organization of this course. While we did touch on the technical terms like \"logogram\" and \"syllabogram\" and \"phonemic value\" a bit at the beginning, I felt like we didn't talk about them in depth. If I didn't already have some linguistics background, I think I would have been very lost. I know the decipherment unit used to be later in the course and was changed to be at the beginning, but I think I would have preferred if it were later. I knew so little at that point I didn't really understand what it meant to decipher a writing system, so it felt more like a big list of names of decipherers and I couldn't really appreciate what was going on. The course is also very lecture-heavy, which perhaps is unavoidable, but I would appreciate more opportunities for seminar-style interaction. I know my classmates came from a variety of backgrounds and I would have been interested in hearing more about their perspectives on what we were learning about and the connections they were making. The midterm assignment was also never graded or returned with feedback, so I had zero clue about my grade at any point in the class even as I was writing the final.",
                "Strengths: this is a lecture (though a very small one), so if that interests you, you'll probably like the way the class is organized. The readings are long but interesting, and I feel like I learned a lot about ancient history by the end of it, even though I went into the class with no experience in classical civilizations. Also, being able to interact with artifacts hands-on was absolutely incredible! I felt very lucky to have the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class could do with a little more discussion, especially since it's so small; it'd also give us more of a chance to test our knowledge and understanding."

                "Yes, definitely.",
                "If you like learning about ancient civilizations (especially if you already have a little background knowledge on Mesopotamia), I think you'll like this class. You'll also like it if you're looking for a humanities course but you usually struggle with traditional history classes. While this course is firmly rooted in the study of history, there's also a bit of a social science element in discussing the development of writing systems more broadly. However, I can't recommend it as a linguistics course, because the focus is less on orthography itself (that is, what differentiates writing systems) and more on the historical developments. Both are definitely discussed though!"
