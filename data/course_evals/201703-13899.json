    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Wild is very responsive and very engaged, so you will never feel lost with any assignment. The readings are not too complicated to read and the essays are interesting to write.",
    "Of course, it is one of the best English 114 sections.",
    "I thought this was a great way to work on your writing with the revision period on the essays. Also, it's really cool how they have so many different topics so you can find one that's interesting to you.",
    "Yes. It taught me how to be a better writer."
