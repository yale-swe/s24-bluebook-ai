    "My ability to speak Spanish improved drastically over the course of the semester. I gained confidence in my conversation skills through interactions in class with my professor and classmates.",
    "We learned a lot of Spanish rather quickly. however, due to Professor Ramos, we also learned a fair deal about Latin American and Spanish culture. She ensured that the language wasn't the only focus of the course.",
    "My Spanish speaking,  listening, and writing were all improved by this course",
    "I learned a significant amount of Spanish this year. I entered the class without experience in an immersed classroom, and was initially intimidated. However, it wasn't long before I became a much better Spanish listener. This helped me learn a great amount of vocabulary and grammar.",
    "Improved conversational skills, gained a more extensive vocabulary, and improved reading skills.",
    "Further comprehension and understanding of the spanish language.",
    "Good continuation of 110. Learned the imperfect preterite, the subjunctive, simple future, and the plusamperfecto.",
    "This course covers many gramatical concepts and works to develop vocabulary. There is an emphasis on learning to speak and listen in Spanish as well. The course is conducted completely in Spanish which really helps to develop fluency.",
    "I improved my ability to speak Spanish",
    "Beyond my immense improvements as a Spanish speaker, writer, and thinker, I have become an engaged student of the Spanish-Speaking world. I now feel a new zeal to explore the intellectual and cultural aspects of the Spanish-Speaking world. This new passion will stay with me for years.",
    "I really developed a larger understand of the Spanish language, while also learning a great deal about Hispanic heritage and culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include casual evaluations of learning and comprehension through in-class interactions.",
    "Although Ramos was an amazing professor, even she is unable to make some of the busy work in the class engaging. Assignments like Flash Cultura and SuperSite often felt like they were assigned for the sole purpose of having homework rather than to offer a meaningful lesson in Spanish.",
    "I found the course very good overall and have no suggestions for improvement",
    "The most obvious strength of this course is the professor. She is eccentric, engaging, and makes the class interesting for all of the students. She is readily available to offer extra help to students.\r\n\r\nOne downside to this class was there wasn't quite as much review of concepts from the homework in class as I hoped.",
    "The strengths are that it introduces everyday vocabulary and reading and writing materials. There are a lot of assignments and practice to ensure comprehension. However, it would be beneficial to include more practice and preparation before the more difficult evaluations, like oral and listening.",
    "The course covered a lot of material, but did not spend enough time explaining grammatical concepts in enough detail.",
    "Overall, very strong course. I think we could spend more time listening and speaking, and only weakness of this section is that Juliana lets out out late (class was supposed to end everyday at 11:20 but she always let us out at 11:25.",
    "The strengths of this class were the professor and the way past concepts were reviewed while new ones were learned. I never truly felt that the class was going at too fast a pace. The biggest weakness of this course was the workload. Sometimes, the work felt tedious and unnecessary, and the class would be just as good if not better without Supersite.",
    "Very good class! It was perfect",
    "I loved this course and would not change it. The grammar exercises, online activities, daily discussions, oral exams, tests, and quizzes all improved my ability as a Spanish student. In addition, this class opened me to the vibrant culture of the Spanish Speaking World. Professora Ramos exposed me to wonderful poetry, literature, paintings, and films."

    "I would recommend taking spanish 120 to anyone who is looking to round out their basic skills in the spanish language. I would suggest taking the course with Juliana because she is very energetic and flexible.",
    "If one would like to learn a new language, you can't go wrong with Spanish. Try to take the course with Professor Ramos if possible, however.",
    "If you are studying Spanish I definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a students who is looking to learn how to speak Spanish with more advanced grammar and vocabulary that is useful in everyday life. The professor is a lot of help, and the seminar-style classroom is a great way to learn the language.",
    "Yes, especially if you can take the class with Juliana she is the best!",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone hoping to improve their Spanish. The class is hard and has a heavy workload, but I have definitely improved my Spanish a lot over the last semester. Because the course is conducted completely in Spanish, I have become much better at comprehending spoken Spanish. Overall, this course wasn't the best but the brilliance and energy of Profesora Ramos-Ruano made it one of my favorite classes.",
    "yees",
    "Yes! This was the best Spanish course I have taken in my life.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it."
