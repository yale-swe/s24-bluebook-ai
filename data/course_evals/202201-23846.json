Not only did I learn more about quantum mechanics than I learned in my quantum computing class, this class was also a great exercise in philosophical argument. I gained skills as reasoning through difficult epistemological an ontological questions as well as approaching difficult texts.",

                "Too much math, but balanced by interesting philosophy papers.",
                "A difficulty of this course is the wide range of experiences with quantum mechanics in the class. To the classes credit, one of the strengths of the class was the clarity with which the difficult material was explained to get everyone up to speed. I feel like the instructor truly did the best job that could possibly get done bring people up to speed, but I think by virtue of the subject matter, the different levels of confidence makes discussions difficult.",
                "Strengths: Professor evidently cares about the subject material. Encouraged student engagement and collaboration. Work wasn't burdensome, and was typically engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: If you are a pure philosophy major, the material can be tough to understand at a deeper level. But everything was accessible depending on how much time you put in.",
                "strengths: incredibly well-organized, well-presented, good balance of types of readings and selection of readings\r\nweaknesses: honestly hard to think of any, but it may be nice to foster more class discussions early on to get the culture rolling. I know it can be hard to get college kids to contribute, so it's useful to start early with discussions of simpler topics before things get complicated so that students have the chance to get comfortable talking."

I would also highly recommend this class to any research oriented physicist as the class makes the case for thinking about the philosophical stakes of theories and how that should inform future experimentation.",
