    "I learned about 20th century Outsider Art, and I would say that I also developed open-mindedness, and seminar discussion skills.",
    "Learning about the exhibition process was incredibly valuable, and structuring the course to design an actual show in the future made the class feel much more hands on.",
    "I developed an intimate knowledge of outsider art as a field having studied individual artists and their work throughout the entire semester. I also learned a lot about what it means to exhibit work in a museum or gallery space effectively.",
    "It was a great introduction class to the subject of outside art.",
    "Outsider Art is a class that functioned around intentionality  we were expected to be very thoughtful in how we approached the material, the classroom setting, our assignments, etc. It was good to be challenged in that way, and I think Professor Mitchell was excellent at setting that standard."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed focusing on an artist a week, but sometimes that felt limiting, and I felt like there were additional highly relevant artists that we were unable to cover. I thought the assignments were all very well thought out and fascinating to work on. I was a bit confused however to what extend we were writing \"proposals\" (since the class was exhibition based) as opposed to actual papers. In fact, I think it might have been more effective had the final paper been described as a \"researched proposal\" as opposed to \"paper.\"",
    "I think the structure of assignments and readings made sense with the course. The strength of the course lay in its focus on a museum methodology. I do think the discussion wouldve benefited from a bigger picture discussion of theory surrounding outsider art.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the unique course materials and the opportunity to provide input to an upcoming exhibition at the YUAG.",
    "Strengths are that the class felt very practical in its aims, and the outcome of an exhibition made our work feel very worthwhile. Weaknesses might be that assignments could at times feel a little opaque, especially the shorter ones."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know if this course will be taught again, but I would highly recommend a course with Professor Mitchell. He is highly knowledgeable and leads enjoyable and engrossing conversations.",
    "Yes, because of the opportunity to learn about underrepresented artists and work on a real exhibition.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student since it is a wonderful opportunity to learn about art that is not often included in academic settings.",
    "I would. I enjoyed the material, the other students, and Professor Mitchell, and I would often leave class with a new way of thinking about something."
