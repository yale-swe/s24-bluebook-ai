                "Strengths: Prof. Lim Hyunsung is truly amazing! He made the class so much fun and was super nice to all of us. The powerpoint slides, study guides, and workbook assignments were all very helpful in learning and preparing for the tests. The tests were fair and graded generously. The homework is graded on completion, so even though it could be tricky at times it was okay to get things wrong which made it a lot less stressful. I really enjoyed the cultural presentation and presentation about an event in 2020. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the listening and occasionally the workbook assignments could be frustrating when they incorporated too many new words or grammar constructions that we didn't cover in class.",
                "Strengths: very thorough and organized, perfect balance between speaking and writing assignments, engaging lessons, a lot of time for practice",
                "This course was well structured, and the topics that we learned built upon each other. At the beginning, there were a lot of quizzes, but towards the latter half there was not as many. This was the only thing that seemed imbalanced about the class, otherwise the content was greatly presented and easy to understand.",
                "Amazing format and manageable workload! Prof. Lim is wonderful!",
                "the strengths were that it was very engaging and there were no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, fun and easy to understand class sessions, reasonable assignments\r\nWeakness: maybe too much time in breakout rooms"
