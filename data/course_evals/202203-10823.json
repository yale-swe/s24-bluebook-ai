This was helpful to begin in understand the material, but unfortunately sometimes I felt the videos were much better at explaining the content than my lecture.",
                "The pre-class videos were very helpful in providing an introduction to the content for the following class. I really felt like having that introduction made class easier to follow along. Considering that this course is the first experience to math in 3 dimensions, it was especially important to be able to take in information during class because the concepts were very new and a take a while to fully grasp.",

I would also advise that the student stays on top of the work from the beginning. Completing the problem sets while learning the material is the best strategy because the class is very fast-paced.",
