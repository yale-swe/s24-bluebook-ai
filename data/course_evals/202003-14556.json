All of the readings were so interesting, and really helped me build up a base of theoretical knowledge on these issues.

                "A strength of this course is that I got to see how the law interacts with different societies in different ways, which was very interesting, especially since a majority of the material focused on non-US contexts. It was great to really get an international perspective on law and society.\r\nA weakness was that there was very little guidance in the course, especially with regards to grading and the final paper. I felt like I didn't really know what was expected of me in the class or how I should write the assignments.",
                "The strengths of this course are the readings, and Professor Lazarev's passion for the subject. He is able to guide discussion really well, weaving in more empirical concepts into our debates about the concepts and theories we read. The main weakness, I think, is that the weekly student presentations often run out of time because they stick to a very set format. I think giving more students more freedom to explore a topic in the way they want (while still maintaining some ideas they should touch upon) while allow increased engagement. Sometimes, just going through concepts, arguments, alternative arguments, etc. was a bit monotonous.",
                "The class is designed to help you produce a final project in accordance with the law and society research framework. I genuinely learned a lot from writing my final project  it helped me identify new research interests. The readings are often fascinating. \r\n\r\nHowever, I had hoped to glean new insights into the relationship between law and society in general, and the class didn't really allow for that. A group of students led discussion on each week's readings, but presentations were expected to follow a very rigid structure which prevented free discussion of the relationships between readings. As a result, the readings often felt disconnected from each other. I imagine that this was also a consequence of the project-based structure of the course. \r\n\r\nThe class could definitely be improved if students only led discussion for about 10-20 minutes instead of the whole class, more opportunities for free discussion were built into the syllabus, each week's syllabus readings logically flowed from those of the previous week, and Professor Lazarev took on more of the discussion leading.",
                "Strengths: I think the framework for paper-writing is good (how to organize papers into sections: the sections are good). I think that we read a lot of interesting material. I think that we occasionally had fruitful conversations. \r\nWeaknesses: This class was quite confusing. At the end of the day the class was solely about the readings. Thats fine for most classes, as long as they figure out some way to bridge them or to piece them together to create a cohesive idea that they explore. Law and Society in Comparative Perspective was not one of those classes. Frequently, I would find myself asking what the class is about, or why we were reading what we did. I think we needed to bring this class back to a larger theme what was it about society that affected the rules that we create? Or how does law affect the societies we make for ourselves? Are they explicit or implicit? I would love to diagram these affects on a map, or learn some cool categorization method, or otherwise have some useful method to process how the pieces of the class fit together as a whole. Instead, we had (although I know Professor Lazarev probably spent a lot of time on the class) a class that seemed lazily put together, a cookie-cutter method of understanding lackluster readings, and a shoddy, loose canon of works with little reference to each other.",
                "This course does exactly what it should do. As with all courses that depend on the independent perusal of dense material, I think it could benefit from the occasional flipping of the classroom; students might do better in grappling with the material if first primed to look for particular patterns."

                "The weekly discussions and student presentations helped increase virtual engagement, but I think this engagement could be increased further by either cutting short the student presentations, or allowing more freedom in their format.

At the same time, some of my other classes really were able to strike a great balance on Zoom. This class did not live up to the standard I had wanted it to in the beginning of the semester. It was a combination of low-energy (which was exacerbated by the fact that we were all on computer screens), discussions led through questions that were too vague, too narrow, or on readings so long and\/or complex no one read them, and no help given to facilitate any human interaction or humanity. I didnt know any of my classmates by the end, and I think thats a problem. Class remained cold and unforgiving, and I hated it. \r\nDiscussions were led by classmates each week, which helped somewhat; at the same time, it would have been helpful to tie them in together to have an actual idea of why we were doing these exercises. Nothing broke the ice among us. \r\n\r\ntl;dr it was hella awkward.",

                "Maybe, if you're particularly interested in the law and society research framework and would appreciate an opportunity to undertake an independent research project. The class might also be better if it takes place in person in the future and allows more bonding between classmates?",
                "No, I would not. Are you looking for a law class? Go to law school. Are you looking for a society class? Take something in the Anthropology or Sociology department. Are you looking for a senior political science course that will rock your mind? This class is not it. \r\nUltimately, my critique of this class boils down to a few points. First, it was not clear in its thesis. Sure, there may be a Law and Society canon, but it would be helpful if we could have some clear understanding of the actual canon. We plugged and chugged, and our formula for digesting what knowledge I was attempting to glean did not sit well with my stomach. I dont know why we read what we did, and while they were cool articles, I feel like half of them were chosen because they had the word law legal or litigation in the title. \r\nAdditionally, I did not know my classmates well, and I dont think that the Zoom format was conducive for learning in this class. This class could maybe work (that is a tentative maybe) in-person, but Professor Lazarevs teaching style is not conducive to Zoom. The class felt low-energy and impersonal.",
                "This is a great course. One must be a comfortable reader of social science, and must be excited about the material. This course demands a high volume of reading, and it needs to be done relatively thoroughly."
