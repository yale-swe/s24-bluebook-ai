                "I liked the consistent homework with the French in Action method. Each night, I spent roughly the same amount of time working on French, which helped me form a concrete habit of working on French. The class time always had a nice balance of listening, learning vocabulary or grammar, and conversing--we conversed less than listened and learned vocabulary or grammar. \r\n\r\nThe slow pace of bigger projects and fast pace of daily exercises was beneficial for my scheduling and learning. This class was never overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThough the French in Action method has great acting, music, and enthusiasm for learning French, its objectification of Mireille and underrepresentation of the Francophone world out of France was frustrating. Madame Skorupa has told us that we were the last FREN 121 to use it, so this will be changed in the future.\r\n\r\nThe greatest strength of this course was the interpersonal bond formed between our entire class and Madame Skorupa. It was refreshing to come to class each morning, and conversation flowed more easily between the smaller class than it might have in a larger class.",
                "I think that the workload was very heavy, which made it difficult to feel that I was absorbing everything. I think the course should focus primarily on grammar and conjugation without adding additional vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. In terms of the strengths of the course, I felt that the emphasis on speaking and engagement with exchange students greatly improved my French speaking skills."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. Upon arrival at Yale, I heard many claims that the French department is harsh and their classes are overwhelming. Though the workload of this class was immense, our professor had consistent office hours and the work was manageable if you stayed on top of it. The grading was not too harsh.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are serious about taking French and are willing to put in the work. However, this course took the most amount of time out of all my courses, so I would recommend to the student that they set aside a lot of time for the course. I think Professor Skorupa did a wonderful job teaching the course and would highly recommend the course simply because she teaches it!"
