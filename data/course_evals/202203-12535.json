I learned to examine the implications of being a student at Yale, and what the purpose of a university like Yale is.",

This class completely reframed my understanding of the U.S. education system and transformed my approach to learning. The readings are absolutely fascinating, and it was wonderful to learn from/with my peers.",

                "I gained insight into the long-standing interest that empire has taken in projects of education in the domestic U.S. and abroad. I learned how the history of the relationship between education and empire is related to present-day classroom experiences for students and teachers. I developed the skill of participating in complex and engaging class discussions that allowed us to demystify ideas that were challenging and sometimes confusing. I also worked on the skill of communicating those ideas in writing, which often involved analysis of power structures and the relationship between history and current events.",

                "One of the biggest strengths is the professor!! Professor tzb creates a seminar environment that is supportive and caring. The course content is set up in an effective way and course readings are very engaging. Overall, class was very interesting and insightful. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "TZB is an INCREDIBLE professor!! Take any class with TZB you can. Seriously. TZB is extremely understanding and flexible with assignments, so you can write about any topic related to the class that you're genuinely passionate about. The final project is also super fun because you are able to approach it in any format (podcast, zine, dance, you name it!). The readings are incredible as well, especially the la paperson reading. There are no weaknesses to this course.",
                "This is an amazing course -- your view on education will be profoundly changed! The only thing I will say is it's a little heavy on the reading, but everything is engaging and Prof. TZB always takes time and care to explain the things that aren't immediately clear from the readings.",
                "Only weakness is the amount of reading which requires more time management.",
                "TZB is lovely. Incredible Professor, understanding and accommodating, and the discussions were great. I think more background and summary of readings wouldve helped make me understand better",
                "Strengths: The readings for this class, while sometimes very challenging, were consistently engaging, interesting, and highly relevant to our class discussions. Professor TZB does a great job of offering historical context at the beginning of each class, which helped make sense of some of the more difficult readings before we started our class discussions. Interjecting to offer new ideas, counterpoints, and guiding questions, TZB made sure discussions stayed on track and were incredibly thorough, at the same time as allowing us to lead the conversation in the direction of our interests. The essay prompts and especially the final project challenged us to think creatively and collaboratively about the content we were learning, draw connections between the past and present of empire, and acknowledge our own positionality in relation to empire. At the same time that many of our discussions were historical, Professor TZB did not encourage us to historicize the project of empire, and many of our discussions circled back to its present-day incarnations in the classroom. The classroom environment was collaborative and kind, even during disagreements or heavy discussions, and many people in the class became close throughout the semester. The final projects that were presented during the last day of class were thoughtful and touched on many themes from the class -- a great way to end the semester.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses -- this was my favorite class :)",

                "Yes!! This is one of the only classes at Yale where I've felt truly loved and cared for as an individual, not just seen as what I can produce academically. In this class I was able to learn for the sake of learning, rather than worrying about my grade. I left every class thinking critically, rethinking everything I knew about education. While we discussed heavy topics, professor tzb gave us the space to process and reflect -- and most importantly welcomed emotion in the classroom. Additionally, the final project was very rewarding and meaningful.",
                "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student who is considering taking it. TZB is the best professor, the classroom environment is so welcoming, the readings are phenomenal, the papers and project are meaningful to complete  truly everything you could ask for in a course.",
                "YES! Definitely take this course - even if you know nothing else about Ed Studies or the American education system, this class will totally reshape your outlook on your own educational experiences as well as those of Yale as an institution.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it's not only about learning how to navigate ourselves as educators and students in the classroom, but about how we navigate ourselves through life as people. It's a profound course.",
                "This was one of  my favorite classes. Even if students are not interested in education, the theory that we learned will make everything just click in their heads.",
                "Absolutely. Regardless of whether you have interest in pursuing the field of education after undergrad, I think this class challenges you to rethink your relationships and experiences throughout your schooling, and to reexamine the way you approach your relationships with others as a whole. I would have found this class particularly meaningful as a sophomore or junior, but even as a senior this was a really insightful class to take. It's also a unique classroom environment to experience. I feel like I learned as much from course materials as I did from watching TZB's teaching style and experiencing the unique classroom environment of ed&empire.",
                "Yes! Especially if you want to go into education. The context of where are schooling methods originate is important.",
                "Yes, definitely. Professor TZB is amazing, and her classes tend to draw some of the most thoughtful and kind people I've met at Yale. This is great example of a class that is very challenging but equally rewarding. If you are interested in education at all and ready to have hard conversations and be open-minded, I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to all my peers. The content disseminated in this class cannot be compared to that of any other class. It encourages you to confront your own positionality while also developing connections to what a true decolonial education can look like in our own communities.",
                "without a question, yes. it is what every yale student should take (or something of its sort) to really sit with what it means to be at a school like Yale.",
                "Definitely!! This has been one of my favorite classes here at Yale. I've loved every part of it, from the content and coursework to tzb to the connections made with the other students in the class. It's helped me understand the role the system of education plays in the U.S. all while being super engaging and interesting. If you are at all curious or interested in the education  (or even if you're not), you should definitely take this course!",
                "I have mixed feelings. The readings are usually excellent, and they often feel like essential readings for anyone interested in education or empire in America. The assignments are pretty relaxed and a fun way to synthesize knowledge. It's a well constructed course and syllabus. However, the actual classes often felt like they dragged on and despite the talk about classroom community, that aspect fell flat. It's a really interesting course, but I think it's best approached as a really cool seminar instead of the Yale-defining experience some people have hyped it up to be."
