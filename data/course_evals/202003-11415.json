                "This course was an extremely effective introductory writing course. Before this class, I was absolutely clueless as to how to conduct research and write research papers, but this course helped me do just that, and do it well. My writing skills have improved tremendously because of this course and it is perfect for any and all Yale students looking to learn how to write at the college level.",

                "I gained a much deeper insight into the genre of detective fiction and read many thought provoking readings that were also fun to analyze.",
                "By taking this course, I developed knowledge of how mysteries are structured and how they have developed over time. Through different mediums, I learned about how mysteries are portrayed in different countries and formats. The skills that I learned centered around close reading and essay writing.",
                "I learned about various forms of mystery\/detective fiction, including whodunit, thriller, suspense, hardboiled, etc. We also discussed some history\/psychology\/philosophy of puzzles and games. Although the course started with more secondary sources, we got to see some of the ideas discussed in these works first hand in the primary sources we reviewed later on in the course. I also learned various methods for introducing\/utilizing outside sources in my essays!"

                "Strengths: Interesting course material, amazing instructor for class, material gets interesting towards end of semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings in the beginning start off very academic (would love to have it more evenly dispersed), don't really know where your grade stands throughout the semester",
                "This class had a very interesting curriculum and the professor was always willing to cover topics that students were interested in. I think this class could have used breakout rooms more frequently.",
                "I love the order in which the assignments were scheduled. We started at a small close-reading essay, and worked our way out to an entire research paper, which was extremely satisfying in the long-run.",
                "The class was a little small and I think the discussions could be better if we had a couple more people.  Some people were shy so they did not want to talk much in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Micah was amazing, workload with reasonable deadlines\r\nWeaknesses: readings sometimes had no contribution to class discussion",
                "I think that more primary source material would have made the class more fun, albeit less \"academic\" in a formal sense. Also, I think less in class attention to writing would have made the class more enjoyable for me, taking the course as a senior, although that kind of writing focus may be necessary for first years. I really enjoyed how many different pockets of mystery, puzzles, and clues we covered and I also really enjoyed the final creative project because it gave some space to explore the less academic side of these topics.",
                "There were a lot of interesting readings but I especially loved how there was more media than just readings that we analyzed in the class (death note, clue, etc).",
                "A strength was the professor who was super engaging and encouraging! The assignments were all super fun and meaningful as well, making the course a great one to take. A weakness would be not having enough in class writing opportunities. There was definitely a balance between reading and writing but it would be nice to hear more feedback from the professor, especially near the end of the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the primary sources that we read this semester. I know this was technically a writing seminar (not a solely literature-based course), so the secondary sources were certainly still useful. As students suggested at the end of the semester, Micah is hoping to adjust the schedule slightly in future semesters to incorporate more primary sources side-by-side with the secondary sources, which I think will be great! Micah's kindness and flexibility were really a strength of this course, so I would definitely recommend taking a course with her even if the topic is slightly different than this semester's course!! She also incorporated our mid-semester feedback about having some breakout-room activities to help us interact in smaller groups, which I think would be another useful thing to continue if this course is taught virtually again."

                "The deadlines for assignments were very graciously fluid and extended to compensate for the various stresses during the pandemic. Weekly emails were also sent by the instructor which were very helpful in getting a sense of the assignments and classes that week.",
                "The discussion format of the class succeeded overall, but I feel like breakout rooms could have been utilized more.",
                "The virtual seminar style was a bit awkward because of how we would have our microphones muted. Conducting a discussion online is a bit difficult for sure, and definitely not as engaging as an in-person seminar would be. I think the course and all of its instructors should strongly encourage open mics throughout the duration of each class session as it would in turn encourage more participation amongst students. Overall, however, there was so much support and tutoring available all around, which allowed for us to improve our writing and get help whenever we wanted it.",

While I never attended, we also had out of class viewing parties which I assume were a fun way to do that screening homework. All of these worked well and helped build class rapport.",
                "We could've potentially had a few more breakout room discussions with small groups.",
                "It was helpful to have opportunities outside of class to meet with students and complete some of the homework. Breakout rooms were utilized frequently as well so I got to talk to the majority of the class multiple times. An improvement could be diversifying the assignments that we got. Most of them were just reading but they could have been much more engaging if they were combined with other assignments like short presentations or research projects in teams.",
                "This course was engaging since class meetings were seminar discussions and we were encouraged to talk to one another. The optional game\/movie nights were a fun way to collaborate on \"homework\"--I know it's sometimes difficult to coordinate schedules, but I think more of these could be great!! I also think the breakout room discussions\/activities were helpful, and it could potentially be helpful to do even more of the \"whiteboard\" activities."

The curriculum is super widespread so you get exposure to mysteries in books, papers, TV Show, and even movies. The professor was amazing and made the class so much more engaging and fun, even across Zoom. The workload is consistent but not that overwhelming. You definitely improve in writing and reading skills as well even though there was more reading than expected.",

Micah is very kind and caring and really wanted us to have as much fun and as little stress as possible. She was very receptive of our thoughts\/concerns\/feedback and was always willing to slightly adjust the schedule for us to accommodate our other obligations\/personal needs. We got to read\/watch some exciting bits of works like Sherlock Holmes, Alice in Wonderland, and DeathNote. Micah was always willing to read essay drafts and offer advice at virtually any time we wanted and her enthusiasm every class really made this a highlight of the semester!"
