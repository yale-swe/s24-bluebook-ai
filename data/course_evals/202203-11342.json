                "I am so glad I decided to take this course as it finally gave me chance to delve into the language my grandmothers and family speaks, but I could never truly understand, speak, or read. I was always frustrated as Korean should be a part of my daily life, but I never got the chance to formally learn it. Through this course, not only has my understanding of its grammar improved, but I was able to learn how to hold conversations, write a full kdrama-like skit, write paragraphs, and hold daily discussions. I also got better at listening to the language and figuring out what was being said.",
                "I was able to develop a better understanding of not only the Korean language, but also Korean culture, society, and dynamics as a whole. As a Korean American, I truly came to appreciate my roots and how Korean society operates as a whole. All in all, I hope to continue my involvement in the Korean program as I see it as an opportunity to learn even more.",
                "I learned the basics of the Korean language. From the alphabet to locational grammar structures, we covered many different topics and did many different activities to help apply what we learned. We performed skits, watched videos learned about the culture, and did dictation quizzes to practice our listening skills. I can now write and read Korean and am slowly building my vocabulary to be able to speak more fluently. I can form basic sentences and understand basic questions, thought I cant always fully respond in Korean (I often need to interject an English word as my vocabulary is not the largest yet)."

                "The course moves fairly fast, and in this class, many of the students had a lot of exposure to Korean/Korean culture already, and I think this made the class hard for people who didn't have that exposure. The finals are also a lot of work, even in comparison to other language classes or even other Korean classes. I felt that the final exams/projects in this class were not a good indicator of the things we learned in the semester.",
                "The strengths of this course was that there were weekly dictation quizzes that made the things we had learned previously fresh in our minds. We also had partner conversations that were able to truly help me apply what we had learned in class. In addition, it was great to learn through the textbook assignments and film audio portfolios that were able to show me how to best apply the situations and phrases from class.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it was engaging and fun to be in class, as there were several in-class activities that helped me collaborate with other students and learn the language in a more interactive manner. The weaknesses of this course are that there was more homework than necessary and there were more dictation quizzes than necessary. This course can be improved by perhaps going at a slower pace.",
                "I think some strengths of this class were the variety of activities we did and the multiple assignments. Though having many assignments does mean more work, it also means that each individual one does not carry as much weight in our grade which allows students to worry less about grades and focus more on and enjoy learning the actual language. The smaller class size and more relaxed grading system also encourages students to participate in class and improve their speaking skills, regardless of background or natural skill in the subject. One improvement that can be made in the class is the rather strict attendance rule. I feel that students should be given some leeway in attendance, considering how often the class meets. I believe that missing a few days throughout the semester should not affect the students grade in any way."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This was such a wonderful way to learn a new language especially for someone who has always been interested in the Korean language. Not only did we learn the ins and outs of grammar and the conversations that are common when in Korea, we were able to learn the culture and traditions in Korean culture. It was a truly immersive experience and it was a great learning environment as everyone in the class was eager to improve.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the learning environment and the professor were amazing, and I had a great time in class every time.",
                "Yes! I loved all parts of this course! From practicing grammar structures to performing skits with my classmates, we had fun while simultaneously growing our knowledge of the Korean language. I enjoyed all the ways Professor Back helped us learn different aspects of the language and culture. Though there were many assignments and quizzes, the large number of them means that each one does not greatly affect your grade. This allowed me to enjoy learning the language without the stress of worrying about my grade with every exam and assignment. I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is looking for a lower-stress, fun language course."
