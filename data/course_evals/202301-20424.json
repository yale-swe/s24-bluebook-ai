            "comments": [
                "I found the teaching and engagement to be a central strength of course. I found it very easy to learn the language with the way in which it was taught by going in with the grammar to make it a very logical progression from where we left off in RUSS 110 to where we are now.",
                "The teacher was very engaged, she made it fun and it was an all around a great course. No observable weaknesses",
                "very well organized and makes you stay on top of your work and learn and relearn concepts with daily hw, weekly quizzes, and biweekly tests.",
                "Strengths: Prof Titus and the TAs are incredibly well-organized and super dedicated to helping you improve your Russian. Russian has a reputation for being a very tough language, but the course is very well-designed to break things down in a way and at a pace that's surprisingly easy to digest. You have so many resources available to you -- the textbook, language tutors, TAs, Prof. Titus -- that you never feel unsupported. Weakness: the only thing I can think of is I wish we had a little more practice with speaking. To be fair, we do exercises everyday in pairs that involve speaking, but out of the reading/writing/listening/speaking categories of language learning, I think speaking got the least amount of attention. But then again, I was able to extemporaneously speak for 3 minutes in my oral final, so take that with a grain of salt.",
                "Strengths: Julia is a great professor and she really tries her best to make the class stress-free; Her and the TFs really care about the students; textbook is easy to follow; you become friends with the rest of the class; constant homework keeps you up to date on the material | Weaknesses: course moves pretty fast, so just be prepared for that; no actual weaknesses though",
                "It was a great course. It had a lot of engagement and I do not know how it can be improved. Perhaps more study material can be provided for quizzes."

                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I have found the Russian department to be incredibly accommodating and fun, as well as very good at teaching and really inspiring one to learn.",
                "Yes. Much much better than a standard language class like Spanish or French",
                "Yes, learning a new language is always beneficial and this course was very interesting",
                "Absolutely. I'm not someone who picks up languages very easily, but the Russian department is so well-structured and its students are so well-supported that I actually found learning the language extremely doable so long as I was willing to put in the time and work (be prepared, it will take a lot of time and work to do well). Academically, the language constructions you learn in L2 are very logical and fun to learn, and it's always really fun whenever Prof. Titus brings her love for Russian literature into the classroom. Socially, I absolutely loved my class, and the Slavic department hosts so many events throughout the semester that your section can attend together and bond over (we even had weekly Friday lunches). Couldn't recommend it enough.",
                "Yes; if they wanted to learn russian, I truly think this course is a good way to go about it.",
                "YES! Julia is great, and Russian is a very important language to learn for literary, cultural, political, and historical purposes; Yale has a really strong Russian program, so I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot",
                "I would. Russian is a great language and it's taught very well."
