                "I learned so, so, much from this class and I consider it the best course I've taken it at Yale. I learned how to read advanced literature with a really advanced eye/outlook and particularly how to connect between texts, even those that seem really distinct. It made me much more thoughtful about empire, migration, and identity. Plus you read some amazing books that will stay on your mind for a while. I really enjoyed this class."

                "Strength: Professor Phillips is phenomenal. He is extremely inspiring and encouraging, he taught me how to read this genre of literature and he is an amazing mentor and empathetic person. The class focuses on the big ideas in books instead of close reading certain passages, which in my opinion, is a huge strength.",
                "This is an amazing course and I really cannot think of any weaknesses. If you get in, please take it!! The readings are fantastic and Professor Phillips is one of Yale's best professors.",
                "Thought-provoking class discussions, the professor always showed a great insight and deep knowledge about the texts/writers. Very interesting books that I wouldn't have read on my own, but I'm glad I did through this class.",
                "Great readings and class discussions.",
                "strengths: Professor Phillips is one of the best teachers I've had and he is so amazing to learn from. He's funny, smart, kind and knows so much about this topic. i really felt lucky to be in this course with him-- he would often tell stories about his own interactions with a lot of the authors we were reading which was not an experience i've really had before at Yale. Also the books are really well-chosen and the other students in the class were great.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: honestly can't think of any."

                "Absolutely. This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. My only regret is not taking one of Professor Phillips classes sooner! The readings and discussion were something that I genuinely looked forward to every week. This class flew by every time, 2 hours often just weren't enough.",
                "Yes, it's a solid choice if you're an English major looking for a senior seminar",
                "Yes! Especially when taught by Caryl Phillips.",
                "yes 100% and I have. if you're at all interested in comparative literature, 20th century literature, literature about empire/identity/race/migration you should take this course. it's great books from a really interesting angle with intimate discussions and close reading that will really improve your ability to understand how/why people write about their homes and themselves."
