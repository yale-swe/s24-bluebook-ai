    "I gained the ability to speak, read and write to a higher level in Japanese. I became a more confident communicator and also learnt important Japanese cultural mores that will help me to navigate my time abroad in Japan this summer.",

    "Intermediate japanese grammar, vocabulary, and kanji. We also learned about Japanese culture and tradition, and modern pop culture trends.",

   "comments": [
    "I think that the strength of this class was the teaching. Saito Sensee is extremely engaging and puts so much effort into each class that the 50 minutes go by really quickly. I think the weakness of the class is sometimes the relentlessness of the homework. I think that the workload sometimes makes it harder to enjoy the content.",
    "Good way to improve Japanese, good follow up to L1.\r\nWould be nice to see more reading exercises and more emphasis on the direct style. Textbook is also very outdated.",
    "A difficult course, but classroom activities are very engaging. It's hard to keep up with the grammar structure if you haven't mastered previous lessons.  However, the teachers are very helpful and the amount of homework ensures you know at least some level of grammar well.",
    "Everything is good, except for the pace which is slightly too fast for someone who's already taking five courses. More reviewing sessions would be helpful.",
    "The major strength was how immersed in the language we were. From class to manageable (and effective) homework assignments, I felt that all of my Japanese language skills were being enhanced day-by-day. This course was the best language class that I have ever taken!\r\n\r\nNot many weaknesses to speak of, but students should know that this is a high workload course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Saito Sensee is one of the best language instructors I have ever had and the classes were always engaging. I could not recommend Japanese language and culture study more highly.",
    "If you want to learn Japanese and took L1, go for it!",
    "Yes, a good follow up to level 1 Japanese, very interesting and informative. Challenging but fun!",
    "Absolutely. However, Saito Sensei is leaving. It's such a pity that Yale loses such a brilliant teacher.",
    "Absolutely, if you want to learn Japanese, take this course. You will see your skills grow immensely from the start to the end of the semester."
