This course provided a thorough overview of the entire medical software development process, from initial design to final implementation. \r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable aspects of the course was the emphasis on regulatory compliance. We learned about the various regulatory bodies that oversee medical software development, such as the FDA, and the specific requirements that must be met in order to gain approval for a product."

                "Being able to work closely with a mentor and draft the documents you would need to develop actual medical software provides a lot of useful practical experience. You get to think about product design and also have the opportunity to practice writing clear and concise documents. Lectures were also very structured and worked well with the assignments. However, some of the lectures were a bit boring if they covered the regulatory process in detail (but that is simply the nature of the topics). Feedback is also given thoroughly for each assignment!",

                "This course covers an important aspect of medical software design that is often overlooked - regulation. However, the teaching style may not be the most memorable. The majority of the course is delivered through lectures, which can feel like a checkbox exercise rather than a hands-on design experience. As you work on assignments, you may feel like you are simply ticking off boxes rather than creating a comprehensive design document.\r\n\r\nThis course is an ideal class for seniors due to its extremely chill and relaxed atmosphere and generous pacing. One of its core strengths is the relaxed environment, which allows students to learn at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed."

The semester long project can be as programming intensive as you want it to be, but overall, it is very manageable and the workload mostly comes from writing and brainstorming assignments.",
                "Yes. It was an amazing opportunity to crossover the BME and CS worlds. The work was very manageable and the teaching was fun and relaxed. Overall it was one of the best electives I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in how medical devices and software get developed, I think it's a great course. While there's not much programming, it's also just as important to practice writing and thinking about system design.",

                "Absolutely. You get to tour really cool medical facilities, meet amazing professors/medical experts, and involve yourself with the med school.",
                "I would recommend this course if a student is looking for a very chill class or gut. However, if you're looking for a course that focuses heavily on coding, this may not be the best fit for you as there isn't a significant amount of coding involved."
