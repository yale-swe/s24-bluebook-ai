                "I learned a lot in this course. I did not expect it to be generally useful in life, but Professor Peters teaches it in such an engaging and thoughtful way. He presents issues of media as fundamentally linked to global power structures and bias, providing a new lens through which I can begin to understand the world I live in.",
                "I learned how to defamiliarize myself with what I thought was film and media and look outside the box. This class allowed us to look at different objects that seemingly would not be considered a medium and examine them in a media history perspective to see how they have had an effect on our civilization.",
                "I learned about media theory and mediums anywhere from modern ones like Facebook and the Internet to more primitive, founding ones like fire and doors. I learned how to write a book review for the midterm and also write a media theory paper on a medium myself.",
                "I learned how to think critically and creatively about the world around me. I learned to think about the \"familiar\" and if it were strange and unfamiliar.",

                "The course covers SO much about media theory",

                "Insights into how media impacts all aspects of life and society as well as how to better interact with the media that surrounds me.",
                "I learned history and critical thinking skills about various media, which I have used throughout the year and will continue to use in critical writing, creative writing, and day-to-day thinking.",

                "I learned about media theory- the history of the world through media. I broadened my definition of a medium to include anything that regulates time, space, and power. we talked about stuff like the ocean and the weather as media, not just writing, tiktok, and tv etc.",
                "Not much, the course was way too disjointed and abstract it was hard to create any connections with the material.",
                "Learned about what media theory is, along with a lot of fascinating ideas about how technology develops and plays a role in our lives",
                "Learned how to think critically about modern media through the lens of the history of media.",
                "I developed a completely new understanding of media and, in many ways, how my entire understanding of the world is a reflection of the media I use to process it. This is the kind of class that will open your third eye and show you things that you didn't see before, kind of like when Neo sees the 1s and 0s of the Matrix for the first time. In 2021, I think this class should be required for every student at Yale. It is packed with essential knowledge for staying afloat and alert in this media-saturated world.",
                "The thought level demanded from this class really made me take the familiar aspects of the world around us and make them, to coin a phrase from the class, unfamiliar. My analysis skills and close reading abilities were also heightened in this class, as well as my comfort in sharing my thoughts with others.",
                "I don't know - media theory was presented as very vague, as JDP argues that everything is a medium, including this course evaluation which influences the decisions of future students. Neither the main ideas nor expectations of this class were ever elucidated to us, who were struggling to find a reasonable writing credit.",

                "I learned about some of the key insights and perspectives of media studies, focusing on making the familiar aspects of our media and technological environments strange and interesting. As media scholars for this course, we were challenged to rethink the conventional ideas of what media arepast and presentand what they mean. We learned how to write a book review and an original paper using knowledge gained from the course.",

                "I really enjoyed the readings and the discussion sections with me TF.",
                "The class was great in the content of the class, but I believe the class could have used a few more videos to display more mediums.",
                "The readings are quite interesting and not excessive and the lectures\/sections were engaging. I really liked the class!",
                "The course examines a wide variety of topics every week, so it is never boring and easy for the student to stay engaged.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peters in lecture is super personable and inserts all these funny anecdotes from his daily life. He goes off on stimulating tangents that are interesting but always manages to bring the lecture back on point and re-emphasize the main points and arguments to get at the end. And, obviously, he's brilliant and one of the experts in the world of media studies. Also, he's incredibly empathetic and really cared about his students, which really showed. \r\n\r\nThis class offers a lot of opportunities to riff and customize it to your own interests, which is surprising for a 100+ person course. The topics of the book review and final paper are up to you, for example. It also offers a lot of opportunities in section to riff and connect ideas in ways you haven't thought before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures starting getting less engaging halfway through the semester, and while I don't think there's a more conducive way of breaking it up for a class of this size, it might have been more stimulating to include some activities or breakout rooms. After all, there wasn't really a difference between listening to the lecture live versus recorded, which is why I think half of the class dropped off on the live lectures halfway through.",
                "John Peters is a wonderful lecture as he is a wonderful human. To be around his thinking and the ways he sees the world and \"webs\" personal experience and academic literature is inspiring. You learn not necessarily what to think but how to think!",
                "The course is a bit disorganized. The professor's lectures are just him giving a stream of consciousness monologue making it very confusing and hard to follow at times.",
                "I think the course material is very interesting to discuss about overall and there was lots of freedom to think about topics in abstract ways. However, for a media class, I think there was too much focus on readings and written media.",
                "strengths: valuable analytical skills learned, sometimes intriguing readings\r\n\r\nweaknesses: volume of readings, sometimes content is boring, i can only so much close reading in one semester",
                "Strengths:\r\n-JDP is so interesting \r\n-Great spread of readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-insanely high workload",
                "The actual content of this class is highly abstract and is hard to comprehend at times. The readings are also quite convoluted at times because of their dated nature combined with their abstract content. To improve the course I would say try and make the readings a little bit less abstract sometimes in order to contextualize the abstract.",
                "I was excited about all of the assignments for this course, but I wish they were spaced out more -- as opposed to book report\/midterm around the same time, and final essay\/final around the same time.",
                "The breadth of media theory topics was really neat. JDP covered a ton of ground.",
                "The class was really insightful and I learned that there exists media theorists!",
                "The course was incredibly abstract to the point where it frequently became unclear what the course was about. Lectures were hard to follow and, while interesting, it was hard to know what was testable material.",
                "Lectures felt too abstract at times",
                "Strengths: prof Peters is amazing, so smart, and a really nice guy. His lectures were super entertaining and interesting. I now think about media and society in a new way, and I'm more aware of all the media around me. Weaknesses: SO MANY ASSIGNMENTS and the topic is very broad. I felt like I was BSing all the assignments instead of putting thought into each one. The class had a midterm exam, midterm paper, final exam, and long final paper - more than I expected from what I thought was a gut. Since the scope was so broad, it felt like my classmates and I were just BSing discussion points in section.",
                "A more historically grounded through line, some type of coherence in the organization. The professor was obviously interested in the material which was greatly appreciated but I feel that kept him distanced from the very real feedback students were giving that the material was hard to follow.",
                "This was a great course! I loved it!",
                "The material was really interesting overall, and section discussions were engaging. Some of the more academic readings were at times a little bit difficult to read though -- perhaps a little less of those could be used.",
                "I think that section was incredibly engaging. It was also a course that prompted a lot of cool questions, thinking, and discussions. The readings assigned for the course were also very interesting and well balanced.",
                "Strengths: A nice with a great syllabus. Weakness: The decision to let TAs grade our midterm, final exam, and final essay without giving any comments whatsoever. I have no idea what I got right or wrong. I also have no idea why I got those answers right or wrong. What is the point of an assessment if you don't learn from your mistakes? I respect the professor's choice to honor the mental health of the TAs, but the significant lack of feedback in this class on the majority of our assignments was pretty disappointing.",
                "Strength were definitely the material, readings, and my teaching fellow, as well as Professor Peters lectures. All made the class engaging and the content fun to learn. Weaknesses were the usually inadequacies of online learning, but not much could be done to solve that. Also, the reading load could be too high, on occasion.",
                "The strengths of this course include semi-frequent interesting readings and freedom granted for essay topics. The greatest weakness of this course was disorganization - expectations were never clear on assignments (directions were very vague and had to be clarified or resent), my TF never responded to emails at the end asking for help, and I never understood what I was supposed to get out of the long-ranting lectures. This class would be greatly improved by having clearer expectations and including summaries of the main ideas of this class (which I still do not know).",
                "Its a great introduction to the various media out there and how theyre related to space, time, and power. The professor is really passionate about this and has knowledge on so many things. I think sometimes lectures felt a little too casual.",
                "Very interesting and engaging lectures. Not enough guidance on papers.",
                "I would take this course off of the required list of courses for Film and Media students.",
                "Lectures for this course were engaging and well organized, and the discussion sections did a great job of enabling students to work through the ideas we had learned. Occasionally, discussion sections felt as if they were attempting to do too much in a limited time framenarrowing down the topics\/work\/activities in discussion sections could help to make them more productive.",
                "This class had some interesting lectures, but overall everything was so abstract and vague that it was difficult to take much from the class. I kept waiting for things to become more grounded, but that never really happened.",
                "Strengths: it presents a really new way of thinking about media and the world around us\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe less a criticism of the class than of the field, a lot of time is spent speaking in metaphors and analogies. But the metaphors and analogies are rarely fully explained. They don't seem to clarify arguments but actually further muddy them.",
                "The class was well structured and followed a chronological and thematic timeline. The live lecture format over zoom made it difficult to stay engaged sometimes, but Professor Peter's passion and deep knowledge of the subject is apparent in every class.",
                "Strengths: really interesting lectures and readings; Weaknesses: some of the readings were hard to grasp"

Rather, we were forced to listen to him go on long rants about many things which did not necessarily pertain to the readings, not furthering our understanding of his eccentric choice of readings. This could be improved by having lectures in person next year.",

                "All Covid practices worked for me.",
                "The use of Zoom during lectures for slideshows and screensharing was very successful. Although the use of digital resources\/visualizations could have been more prevalent, it was limited as a way for students to focus less on the \"glitz and glam\" of media and more on the important concepts being learned, which I think was a wise decision. I think that giving more non-traditional assignments which require students to apply their learning outside of the dorm room\/computer screen would be another helpful technique both during and after COVID to keep students engaged.",
                "The \"podcast style\" of lectures made engagement difficult. When Professor Peters used presentation slides or visual aides during his lectures it helped and made it easier to visualize the ideas or objects he was talking about. In our section, we had individual weekly presentations that also helped introduce the week's topic and allowed each person to provide their perspective and ask questions to facilitate discussion."

                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although the workload is not too bad for the course, the class itself is very abstract. I have learned a lot about different topics, but nothing in the class feels concrete. The instructions for things are often very vague and can be left up to interpretation and we did not receive any feedback on our midterm grade, making it hard to understand where we should improve on.",
                "Yes, I feel like I've gotten a great overview of media studies from one of the experts in the field. It gave me a new way of thinking about the world and contemporary events from this analytical perspective. It's also generally a fun class because it's an association game, challenging you to connect ideas to ones you didn't think of before (e.g. fire as productively destructive, TV as a war machine, etc.) Lectures are like podcasts (which Professor Peters explains at the beginning of the course) and more relevant and interesting. I was not originally planning to take this course as a STEM major but am glad I did, because it's one of those classes that's relevant no matter what you're doing at Yale.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this to a student who likes to draw connections in the world and find metaphors. This is a great class for you if you like to think imaginatively and creatively.",
                "ONLY IF YOU NEED TO! As a writing credit, this course requires much more work than other writing credit classes, at least for this semester. In previous semesters, the workload was much less so I don't understand why it was changed this semester, especially during COVID. The course's content verges more towards the history of media technologies and philosophy than what you might typically consider as media (radio, TV, internet, etc). The readings required are also hard to follow simply because the writing is bad. The professor's lectures are just him giving a stream of consciousness monologue making it very confusing and hard to follow at times. In terms of feedback, I honestly don't know how the essays and exams are graded. Sometimes it seems like the TA's just use a random grade generating when assigning grades because it is so inconsistent.",
                "I would recommend.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to other students, because it doesnt require a deep knowledge of any specific concepts. Theres lots of free thinking involved.",
                "only if you like readingsit was very hard to keep up as my other classes amped up.",
                "This course is the definition of lofty intellectual nonsense. If you like that, youll be fine taking this course. If youre unable to grasp larger concepts well and need something more concrete like I do, this course will come off as just a load of BS.",
                "Only if you are really interested in media theory or need it for a requirement",
                "No I would not. The content is very abstract and unless you enjoy that, this class can be highly taxing.",
                "Yes! The information is accessible, but at the same time, you are given the means to dive deeply into topics that interest you especially. I think about the things I've learned in this class on a regular basis. It's given me new ways to look at the world.",
                "If the reason you are considering this course is because you're interested in modern mass media, this course may not be for you. I would recommend this course if you want a grabbag of interesting ideas to ponder.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, its a great course to take. Its a podcast style lecture, so its really interesting to hear the flow of the argument the professor makes. It challenges you to think outside the box.",
                "No. The class was way harder than it needed to be and incredibly confusing.",
                "If you get a good TA, yes.",
                "Yes and no! It's super interesting with really fun lectures, but it was more work than I wanted to put into it.",
                "No, not if the syllabus remains the same.",
                "Yes if you're looking for WR credit",
                "Yes! I loved this course! Very interesting topic . 10\/10 recommend",
                "Would recommend the course -- the ideas were very eye-opening and shaped the way that I think about technology and the world at large. Some of the topics can seem a little random at the beginning but by the end of the course you see the general theme.",
                "Yes I would recommend to other students, especially those that need a writing credit and are more intimidating by WR classes.",
                "Yes! No joke: This will fundamentally change how you see the world. Taking this course will help you see the invisible frame that surrounds all of our digital and analog experiences.",
                "Yes, 100%. Very interesting material and wonderful professor. I think its a wonderful class, probably my favorite Ive taken at Yale so far.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student - I honestly don't think I learned very much and I was expecting a massive \"gut,\" but we instead had to write a 7-9 page book review, 10-12 page final paper, and take 2 1000-word + 4 quotes exams. In short, we did the same amount of writing as other writing classes but did not really learn much in terms of writing or media.",
                "Sure, if youre interested in what media studies is all about take this course. Otherwise maybe not.",
                "Yes. It is interesting subject matter.",
                "Definitely not. This course is garbage, and I feel bad for all Film and Media Studies majors like me who will be forced to take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students, regardless of their academic paths. The perspectives and insights of media studies that we learned are essential for all people who engage with mediawhich means everyone. Students going into the course need to be prepared to think abstractly, and avoid coming in with preconceptions of what media are. They should be ready to think historically and broadly about media as things that manipulate time, space, and power and to explore them from a variety of angles and cross-disciplinary perspectives.",
                "I would recommend this course only to someone who doesn't require concepts to be grounded in reality. Too much of this class dealt with abstract, vague ideas that were hard to grasp fully.",
                "Recommended for everyone who is looking to work with media in the future. This course is quite suitable (and necessary) for students from all majors.",
                "If you're interested in film and media studies, then yes. If not, then no. I think the field often uses vague academese that makes it hard for someone who isn't super interested in the field to stay engaged.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy reading and dissecting theoretical and philosophical readings or have to take it for a requirement.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Peters alone makes the course worth it, but the content of the course is super interesting. It reframes how we view and interact with our world through media and you really leave with a different perspective on things."
