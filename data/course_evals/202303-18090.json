We learned alot more vocabulary and went more in-depth into the preterite. We also learned about past and present participles, which were pretty cool."

                "I've taken language classes from kindergarten through 12th grade and this was by far, the best language course I've taken. In my experience, language courses tend to be super repetitive but this course was very engaging. I think the main downside was the speed of the material. We would often learn complex material in just a couple days and then move on but I think to learn it for the long-term, it would be helpful to spend more time in each unit.",
                "I think the logistics of the asynchronous day could be improved, in terms of clarity of assignments and expectations for the asynchronous day. I also think that the supersite could have been better aligned with the materials we were discussing in class.",
                "I wish that the professors had more autonomy on how to go about the course instead of having to strictly adhere to the online setup of this course. I like profe Mayte's teaching methods a lot, and I think I would have been able to learn more through her instead of the egg man of VHL (no offense to him). I asked for extra credit, but that is not allowed. If it was up to her, she would have let me do extra credit. Also, I was in a section where we had a little bit more extra work since we participated in a study, and it would have been nice if we could have received some form of extra credit for that (but of course, we did not). I love Spanish, but I miss how I learned it in middle school. It was more effective, and more stuck. The Spanish here is way more intensive and crammable, which is not the best as far as retention of content goes. Instead of focusing on what was being taught, I found myself just scrambling to get the big load of homework done, even if that meant to understanding everything the way I would have preferred. The actual content is not hard to learn, but the format is what makes it intensive."
