                "I gained new knowledge about the experiences of sexual minorities in the pre-modern era across a variety of cultures.

I now feel I have greater insight into the ways we subconsciously allow personal misconceptions and beliefs marginalize and condemn others.",
                "Understanding of the perspectives and approaches to what our society now perceives as homosexual activity. Social norms and deviances that arose across different cultures over time, and how the concepts of gender and sexuality changed between them.",
                "I left this course with a new understanding for what we consider sexuality today. The sex lives of the generations that have come and gone are seldom thought of, yet this class showed me how important it is to have an awareness of it. It was fascinating seeing how the attitudes surrounded sexuality have evolved through time. I learned to analyze texts and extract important historical contexts.",
                "I learned a lot more about the history of sexual minorities in the ancient times. This was not something I had considered much before but it was very interesting to consider how sexuality as a concept was totally different in many different societies\/cultures and how modern interpretations differ."

            "comments": [
                "The class is very explicit on its scope and what it intends to illustrate through the lectures. However, there were times where i desperately wanted to explore other aspects of the material",
                "STRENGTHS: Interesting readings, engaging lecture style that isn't just reading off slides, well-run sections that encourage thoughtful discussion, diverse range of cultures and religions covered, comfortable environment to discuss sensitive topics, accessible to those not familiar with gender theory, intellectually stimulating, unique content compared to other Yale offerings.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Almost entirely focuses on male sexual minorities, particularly male-male sexual partnerships. Even when discussing those with unique gender presentations\/trans-like individuals, it was primarily males who cross-dressed or weren't traditionally masculine. This isn't necessarily a weakness, and Prof De Souza was up front about this emphasis early on, but some may be a bit disappointed with the lack of female discussion (though this is partially due to a dearth of historical sources and De Souza's own research expertise on men)",
                "One of the strengths of this course was definitely Professor De Souza. He was extremely accommodating and took many steps to make sure that everyone was engaged and not overstressed. The class really felt like one in which we were free to voice our concerns, whether that be with grading, workload, subject material or otherwise. On that note, the reading was a little more than originally expected, especially in the second half of the semester (where we were once or twice asked to read 200 pages a week), but that was all balanced out by excellent lectures and supportive TAs.",
                "Strengths - Igor was a wonderful professor and a joy to learn from every day. The class, which I took partially for self-growth and to learn queer history, contained some of the most interesting subject matter ive ever learned. The TAs were very supportive and made section feel like places we could succeed, and the assignments were graded very fairly. The readings were also interesting and the lectures were formatted wellI found myself taking notes based on what was said, and not mindlessly jotting down the presentation slides, which was a strength in and of itself.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Unfortunately, this was tainted by the class structure itself (though I admit, Im a little biased given my experience in the class.) There were two exams and two paperson the surface, not too bad. The issue is that the exams were both online, 10 and 20-question multiple choice assessments that encompassed 45% of the grade. Because it was incredibly difficult to gauge how difficult the exams would be before taking them, we ran into a situation where the midterm was much harder than anticipated and the final was much easier. Because of this uncertainty, and anticipating a final that was on par with the midterm, I took the class pass-fail. Of course, with the final being much easier, I would come to regret this, as I feel that ive wasted a credit\/d opportunity and impacted my GPA negatively as a result. \r\n\r\nAll this is to say that i fundamentally disagree with short multiple-choice exam formats, especially when the scope of the exam content isnt given. It led to a lot of uncertainty, at least in my experience, and I ended up making the wrong choice. Maybe this is more of a commentary on the credit\/d system as well, but I thought it wouldnt hurt to include my experiences here.",
                "Genuinely can't see a weakness that this course had. The structure of it was great, and the professor was passionate about his course which was evident in his style of teaching.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, small lecture vibes makes it feel more real\/personable than a larger lecture, extremely manageable reading\/workload, grading is not a major concern for the course\r\nWeakness: course material\/lecture can be a bit repetitive at times and the lecture format makes it hard to stay engaged with material",
                "I think this was not a bad course but it could definitely be improved in some ways. Since the course is about sexual minorities it would have been nice to talk more about non-men. I also think there could have been a more rich discussion on sexuality in general and why we feel the need to label things now when in the past labels functioned differently. We did talk about this somewhat (in distinguishing acts vs types of people) but I feel like the discussion could have gone further than just noticing the difference. The first exam had many confusing questions on it but I think there was a lot of improvement on the second exam which was much more straightforward. The essay prompts were sometimes confusing in that it was unclear how much of our own knowledge we were supposed to bring in and personal experience usually isn't enough to make generalizations. The lecture was pretty clear and engaging, although some units went on for a long time while others were only one or two classes."

                "Absolutely! This class is truly unique and the content is incredibly interesting. Prof De Souza does a great job of introducing complex topics and intricate theories in a way that is understandable to non-humanities\/non-WGSS\/intro students. The readings are really entertaining and informative, and you will probably walk away understanding something new about yourself. The assignments are well-spaced out and not too strenuous. As long as you stay relatively on top of readings and attend lecture, you will do well in the course.  Sections are also actually enjoyable and thought-provoking. Overall, great course that covers a broad range of topics and cultures with care.",
                "Most definitely. You should take this course; you will have fun when getting to discuss topics that seem taboo and do not really get any coverage outside of an environment like this.",
                "If this topic interests you, and you're down to take on a new perspective when analyzing queer history, then I'd definitely recommend this course.",
                "Yesbut with the caveat that the tests should be organized better and test more of our direct knowledge through written responses.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. I already have since the course ended. The content of the course was unique, captivating and Professor De Souza's lectures always left me wondering more about the history of sexuality. We covered a huge amount of history, yet it was done in a clean, organized manner.",
                "Yes! In the lecture format it got to be a little boring and monotonous at times but the material is very interesting and engaging on its own especially if you're interested generally in \"queer\" history, queer theory, and what it means for a person or action or behavior to be non-normative\/queer. The class is very manageable! There were two papers and two exams and as long as you get clear guidance on the papers and do all the readings you will be very prepared for the exams. The course readings were actually interesting (if repetitive at times) which was a nice change to a lot of other classes!",
                "I would recommend this class only to someone who is very interested in thinking about the history of sexual minorities since the topic is pretty niche. It wasn't a class that was super tied to engagement with modern critical analysis it was mostly just a survey about different historical time periods."
