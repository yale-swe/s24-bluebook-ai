                "The course is structured to facilitate independent research: That is both a blessing and a curse. The class gives you the space that you will need to research and write your thesis. But it also demands that you be organized and self-motivated along the way. Most people, like myself, have an amazing experience taking this class. If you pick a topic that you are genuinely curious about and one which you love researching  and if you have an adviser you get along with it will be the best course that you have taken at Yale. If you are not committed to your thesis topic or if you don't have a good relationship with your advisor, it can be a painful process. Luckily, you get to shape your entire destiny in this class. There is no single experience, and in the end, HIST 496 is really what you make of it.",

I barely used the assignments (like the primary source analysis) in my final paper, and instead spent a lot of time formatting, citing, etc. each assignment. For my own thesis, it would have been more helpful to start writing the actual thesis earlier, as opposed to the small assignments from the first semester.",

It also took a very long time to get our reports back.",

We could form writing groups or something for example maybe based on topic so people can build ideas off of one another and have a set time to work on their senior essays during the week, especially could be useful for those who struggle with time management."

Definitely take the two-semester senior essay (HIST 495 and HIST 496) rather than the one-semester senior essay. Two semesters give you the time that you need to properly research, engage with, and write your senior essay. On the whole, it is a more rewarding experience, and the end result is something that you will be prouder of. At the same time, it is easier to work on your (longer) essay over the full year. The two-semester essay also makes you eligible for various distinctions in the major.",
