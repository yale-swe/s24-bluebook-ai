                "This class reviews a variety of lab techniques including mutation via PCR, gel electrophoresis, gel extraction and purification, transformation, DNA isolation, sequencing analysis, protein purification, SDS-PAGE, and activity assays. The protein work seemed really rushed and sort of tacked on but ultimately useful. The class also tries to teach how to write a proper lab report which is helpful practice especially for those who have never done so.",
                "Better hands on experience with biochemistry lab techniques such as gel electrophoresis, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc.",
                "I learned how to write a scientific lab report that contextualizing consequence and findings in the literature. I gained a lot of experience with experimentation, learning about experimental design, and identifying errors in assays.",
                "During this course I learned a number of modern lab techniques that can be used to assess the impact of changing amino acid composition on the packing of the protein core.",
                "Various biochemical techniques (PCR, total protein assay, E. coli transformation, gel electrophoresis, etc.)",
                "I learned several important lab skills, like gel electrophoresis, agar plate growth, and purification methods. I worked a lot with my classmates and got to write a formal lab report.",
                "I had the oppurtunity to learn the theory behind, and perform, many of the techniques most commonly used in a biochemical laboratory. Though my prior lab experience meant that I had previously performed most of these techniques, this was not universally true, and I learned a lot about many biochemical concepts I had previously never encountered."

                "This class was kind of a mess. I had to take it because I forgot to get the proper waivers for the MB&B major but I figured it would be helpful for learning protein work which I had less experience with. Unfortunately, they had just changed the teaching staff which made everything a bit chaotic. The class could have benefitted from maybe a run-through of all the procedures\/ actual experiments so the kinks were worked out before students tried to run them. I'm not sure if this was more or less noticeable to students who came in with no prior experience, but I found it a bit frustrating. Additionally, the canvas site is very messy and disorganized which made things more confusing. Again, I am sure this was due to the change in teaching staff but it would have definitely benefitted from some clean-up prior to the semester starting. However, I don't have a doubt that the class will be much better moving forward if the teaching staff stays the same because the saving grace of this class was how much they all cared. It was very obvious that once the professors noticed something was confusing or not helpful for student learning\/engagement they would go out of their way to fix the situation, ask for student input on how to best support them, and truly consider what would be best for teaching the information rather than what would be easiest for them.",
                "The strengths of the course were the teaching team. Christian, one of the TAs, and Professor Schilling were incredibly understanding and caring despite the chaos that ensued. However, the course was incredibly disorganized and none of our experiments went as planned. While that is to be expected in science, the mishaps encountered caused complete confusion and frustration for the students.",
                "The openness and kindness of the teaching team was an incredible strength. They went above and beyond to make this course accessible to all students, which was palpable in every part of the course. In terms of improvements, more clarity at the onset about assignments (lab quizzes, the lab report) and more timely grading of lab notebooks would be great.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the teaching staff was very receptive to questions and presented information in clear ways.",
                "A bit disorganized! But I sincerely appreciate the professors dedication to flexibility, intentional pedagogy, accommodations and thoughtfulness. by far one of the kindest STEM classes I've taken at Yale because of Dr. Schilling and Christian.",
                "I liked the format of it, and the teaching staff worked hard to minimize unnecessary outside work which was super helpful of them.",
                "The class was a bit disorganized. I felt like I wasted a lot of time in lab, and I didn't really know what was going on or if there were results. There weren't a lot of assignments due so the class lacked some structure.",
                "This course benefitted tremendously from the passion its instructors had for the process of laboratory research, and their desire to pass that passion on by demonstrating the process of analysis and discovery. However, it suffered for their inability to convey that process and its difficulties given the limitations of the classroom environment. At many points throughout the course, small errors, committed by students or instructors, resulted in poor results, low quality documentation, or confusing mismatches between intent and final result. Yet where in a normal research lab such errors would be corrected by redoing the work in question, the limited number of class hours and strict requirements of the syllabus meant that when such errors occured in this class, they were hand-waved away, often without regard for the potential impact on a student's grade in the relevant assignment and the resultant effect on morale. This mismatch between expectations and reality could often leave students feeling that their actions were both required to proceed and completely irrelevant to the overall project."

                "If you have never worked in a lab before it is a good introduction to many basic lab techniques. This is probably best suited to sophomores or juniors who are anxious\/ have not had the opportunity to do research in a wet lab. Otherwise, I think the info would be equally learned in an applied setting.",
                "Yes and no. It became very hard when instructors were out with COVID and students were left to figure things out. However, you learn a lot about scientific writing with the final report and are exposed to many different lab techniques.",
                "Yes! Dr. Schilling has done a fantastic job at making this lab course interesting and accessible and meaningful.",
                "Yes. The instructors do a great job at guiding students through the experimental progression.",
                "If you enjoy lab classes then yes, it was pretty fun to do the experiments, plus it didn't require a ton of work outside of class like other labs did",
                "No, I really didn't like the structure of it and how there was only one big assignment at the end. I felt like the experiments were kind of boring and didn't produce many results. For a premed class, there are better options that are more engaging.",
                "Anyone who has taken a lab course at Yale (with the possible exception of Organic Chemistry lab) has already experienced this class's ups and downs several times. Though it is very exciting to be able to actually perform the techniques we hear discussed in lecture courses, the combination of strict guidance via rubrics, a reliance on the teaching team to perform parts of the experiment, and an inconsistent approach towards teaching the science behind our actions and our reasons for learning it can often lead to the situation where an individual student is required to work far more than they anticipated, whether staying late in lab or scrambling after learning that a quiz is on material not yet covered or carefully detailing every possible fact in a lab notebook, to avoid failing to hit some critical but obscure milestone and recieving a poor grade on the assignment."
