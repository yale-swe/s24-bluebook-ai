                "Strengths: I made many different styles of movies and got to experiment with filmmaking techniques. I received a lot of feedback from both the professor and the other students in the class. Received a filmmaking kit that was helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Andrews' expertise and ability to give critique to students that range in skill and level. Furthermore, the weekly assignments, though challenging, proved to force us to create and overcome the creative hump, something I think is ultimately the most valuable aspect of any class. The biggest weakness of the class was the readings. I found Geuens interesting but not very applicable in practice.",
                "Prof. Andrews is a very attentive and passionate professor that cares about all of his students. He is willing to answer any questions you may have and is understanding of students' circumstances.",
                "I don't know how it could be improved honestly. I thought this class was so enjoyable. The hardest part for me was finding people to act in my films because of covid but other than that, this course was very well taught. I even enjoyed the readings because it opened me up to interesting viewpoints of film attributes that helped me to learn more about film."
