   "comments": [
    "We read a bunch of poetry collections that were all so beautifully written and insightful!",
    "I learned how to read and analyze poetry and connect the collection to a larger social\/political context.",
    "I don't even know where to start. This course has been one of the best classes I have ever taken in my life, and Professor Hickey is one of the best professors I have ever met and certainly one of my role models. I feel like a much stronger writer and I feel much more equipped to discuss complicated social issues from a wide variety of perspectives. I also feel much more comfortable dissecting complicated texts.",
    "I learnt how to analyse collections of poetry and also individual poems. It was a great class for discussions about larger social movements and I gained a lot of knowledge and other perspectives that I hadn't seen before.",
    "how to have a critical understanding of poetry and its importance",
    "I learned about how to evaluate and contextualize poetry written during 21st century civil rights and protest movements. I also learned how to write an academic essay and I think this was a fantastic course to help me realize my passion for poetry and to start out my Yale academic career with.",
    "I learned how to close read poetry and think critically about what role poetry takes in disturbing the status quo (or otherwise doing work). I also read quite a lot of poetry that I wouldn't have otherwise, which has made me excited to read more in the future. Finally, I learned how to write analytical essays about poetry collections and individual poems.",
    "I learned to love writing and how to write in a non-formulaic manner allowing myself to feel like my writing actually represented me.",
    "Absolutely wonderful course that helped me not only  close really poetry or appreciate it, but value its immeasurable importance. The material was incredible but Prof. Hickey teaching the material is what really helped it hit us as students.",
    "I greatly improved on my ability to critically \"close read\" and analyze poetry and other creative writing. I also improved my writing ability, both in terms of organizing my writing and developing more sophisticated theses. Finally, I learned about a lot of individual authors and how they have contributed to various social movements.",
    "Fantastic course that integrates poetry with personal identity and how we interact with the political - truly makes the poetry feel alive",
    "I learnt about different modern poets, how to analyze poetry and how to write essays analyzing literature using secondary sources. This class was highly informational as not only did I learn a lot from the readings, I also learnt from the discussion on them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The poetry was amazing, and the class was just discussion of all the works we had read, which was very engaging and my peers are all so smart! wow go Yale students. Also Professor Hickey is just so sweet and let us modify the syllabus to focus on collections we cared more about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I became less engaged later in the semester when I didn't read the collections all the way through (which is my own fault). The class is a little less structured than other classes because it was such a tight knit seminar.",
    "I really loved Professor Hickey's teaching style. She is very excited and engaged in class always. I would have liked to read more Asian American poetry.",
    "I honestly cannot think of a single way this course can be improved. The discussions were always super enjoyable and insightful and I always felt like I learned so much after each class, and yet I also always felt that my opinion was valuable and contributed to the discussion. The essays were wonderful and engaging, and the class was very close--you could tell that everybody actually cared about each other. \r\n\r\nOf course, if you don't like poetry, you wouldn't enjoy this course because there's a lot of poetry to read (though always a fair amount).",
    "One of the strengths was definitely the professor as she has a high level of engagement with her students and really pays attention to what they are interested in etc. The content was also very interesting and very relevant to the present day. One of the weaknesses was perhaps the level to which the professor let the students dictate the conversations and the classes. This could also be a strength, it depends on the perspective.",
    "Strengths: Professor Hickey is amazing, she makes the classes an engaging, open, and comfortable space for everyone, the readings were amazing, the poetry collections covered different topics from a diverse and multi-faceted set of groups and ideas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the poetry collections were difficult to interpret (however, the professor did a great job of helping to analyze the pieces), delayed feedback on papers",
    "No weaknesses! Professor Alanna Hickey is my favorite professor during my time at Yale so far and is a phenomenal instructor. I felt that she was very considerate of the time constraints students are put under without the course being too easy. Another strength of the course was student-led seminars and how Professor Hickey allowed us to formulate our own discussions but also provided her feedback to our commentary. I felt that I learned a lot about how to empathize with experiences unlike my own and never felt like I was being judged in any capacity. However, my writing and speaking abilities were challenged and definitely improved with Professor Hickey's detailed feedback and support.",
    "The strengths are in the variety of works we read, spanning civil rights movements, time periods, and genre. All the collections we wrote essays on were recent though, allowing us to see how they directly related to modern society. The only weakness is that we sometimes discussed the same poem for the majority of class, which means there were a lot of poems we didn't get to discuss. However, there were weekly responses that let us go into more detail if we wanted.",
    "It was a very relaxing and helpful class in easing my way into Yale writing. I loved the professors way of engaging everyone in the conversation, articulating upon students' responses, and providing a welcoming environment. The class allowed the students to view certain works with different analytical lenses.",
    "I loved the flexibility of the curriculum. Prof. Hickey put pieces that fit our class in particular. All the readings were interesting both the essays and poems.",
    "I think the biggest strength is Professor Hickey, she was kind, flexible and extremely adept at leading discussions without getting too involved. The books she chose were amazing and really impacted me personally (I still find myself reading them). A small weakness I found was it presumed a little knowledge of American History especially related to slavery and Native American History that I did not have a background in."

   "comments": [
    "If you thrive under less pressure then this is a great writing class for you because you get to explore so much poetry. However, if you need strict deadlines in order to really focus on the material and be attentive then this seminar may not be as well suited for you. Either way though, if you love poetry and political poetry I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "If you love poetry and politics, this is the class for you! This is a great class to broaden your horizons as a reader if you are not familiar with poetry. It teaches you how to close read and write essays on poems or collections themselves.",
    "I would give this course my strongest recommendation. It went far above and beyond my expectations in every possible way. If your goal is to learn more about social movements, about protest, about poetry, and about how to think about these things with nuance, then this course is perfect.",
    "YES, I loved it!!",
    "Yes I would! This has been my favorite class so far and I genuinely wanted to go to seminar each week. If you are interested in poetry and how to use poetry as a vessel for spreading social change, I'd really recommend taking this class.  I improved my writing but never felt overwhelmed with any of the material we were learning about or writing about.",
    "Yes! It's essential to know about the ways people have historically challenged the system, even by just living their lives. Protest is a crucial piece of America. Poetry is a powerful way of bringing it about.",
    "Yes I would, because the course fosters a productive and welcoming environment. Students are immersed in different types of writing that are not really seen in popular media.",
    "Yes! Professor Hickey is the best. This class really expanded my love for poetry and ability to comprehend it. Experienced and new poets and non writers can all get something out of this course.",
    "Yes, this class is perfect for any first year who wants to improve their writing and be in a learning environment in which they can engage directly with the professor and their fellow students.",
    "Absolutely!!! Professor Hickey is an absolute gem.",
    "Yes, without doubt. Professor Hickey is amazing and I learned so much about not only poetry but also the world."
