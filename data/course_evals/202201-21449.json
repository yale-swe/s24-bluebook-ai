Prof. Richards did a wonderful job of justifying each work's identity within the curriculum and of describing its influence and importance, not just through her knowledge but with her presentations.",

                "It was more structured than the American Literature course, and that really helped, especially to introduce its students to something as broad as world anglophone literatures. It also really helps you develop as a writer, especially as a close-reader.\r\n\r\nI think there's just too much reading. I had to look up summaries many times, not because I didn't want to read but because I simply didn't have enough time to read 300-400 pages a week for one class. Taking out one or two books would be enough.",
                "Strengths: Good and interesting variation of novels, small seminar makes it easy to stay engaged and create strong classroom community, lots of intellectual freedom within discussions and within papers, Professor Richards is absolutely wonderful\r\nWeaknesses: Reading a novel per week is a very fast pace so sometimes you don't get to analyze each novel as in-depth as would be helpful",
                "Im not sure how I feel about the syllabus and the general structure\/ethos of the course. It seems a bit cobbled together, and its intent is muddled."

                "Yes, especially with Professor Richards! The reading material was really engaging, one of my favorite English courses Ive taken so far at Yale.",
                "If you like English classes, then yes! Out of the foundational English courses I've taken, this one has definitely been my favorite. The novels are very interesting, and class discussions were productive and helpful toward understanding. Although the pace of the class is quite fast with the heavy reading load (a novel per week, about 200 pages), the papers are not terribly difficult or long, so I found that the workload wasn't terrible overall. The class mainly focuses on close reading and coming up with your own interpretations of a passage\/text, and I really enjoyed having this freedom. I do think my very positive experience with the course has everything to do with Professor Richards, who runs by far the best seminar at Yale that I have ever been a part of. Professor Richards comes into class every day well-prepared, organized, and ready to teach, and it was always clear that they had put a lot of effort into making sure class has a nice mixture of instruction, small group work, and guided discussion, which made class engaging for the entire hour and fifteen minutes. If you take this course, take it with Professor Richards!",
                "YES",
                "I would certainly recommend professor Richards, but Im not certain that Id recommend ENGL 128 to anyone but an English Major."
