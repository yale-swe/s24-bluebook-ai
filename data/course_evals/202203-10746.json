                "You definitely come out of this class with a new perspective on medicine and sociology. Medicine is not what is social identity portrays it to be. Not angelic, always righteous cause which will forever be correlated with human progress.",
                "Fantastic introduction to the field of public health, health sociology, and historical background on healthcare",
                "I learned how to read academic\/scientific papers. \r\nI also learned about a variety of statistical methods and sub-fields of sociology and public health, like network science.\r\nI incorporated knowledge about medicine, biology, anthropology and demographics in new ways.\r\nMost of all I gained an overview understanding of the state of public health in the US and what could be done to improve it.",
                "The social contexts of health and disease; the limited role that medical care plays in health; the roles of structure and agency in health; a multidisciplinary perspective on public health; burdens of illness and death; longevity; inequality; social construction and distribution of illness; harms of medical care; health behaviors; the role of social networks in health (Prof. Christakis' specialty); the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between genes, environment, behavior, and health; and public health policy implications.",
                "I had very minimal knowledge about Public Health before taking this course, so I gained a basis of understanding. I learned about many of the big issues and themes in Public Health. I also learned about research and how certain experiments about public health are performed.",
                "I learned about the social determinants of health and the ways in which social factors such as social networks drive public health rather than medicine. We explored the conflicts between structure vs. agency and collective vs. individual.",
                "I came away from this course with a much better understanding of all of the factors that influence health beyond actual care. As someone interested in becoming a doctor it was eye-opening to discuss the limitations of the medical profession as well as how it can even sometimes cause harm.",
                "knowledge about the definition of health and disease, epidemiology, systematic errors etc",

                "This course taught me so much about the ways in which our environments and the societies we live in influence our health and the care we receive. During the course we covered a LOT of social science literature, gaining various perspectives on pertinent topics like COVID-19, the ways we define disease, and the prospects of biotechnological advancement.",
                "Professor Christakis and our TA, Eric, have the most brilliant minds. YOU LEARN SO MUCH FROM THIS COURSE! It's truly one of the few classes at Yale that I genuinely look forward coming to, even at 9am in the morning, because you come out of it with so much added knowledge and excitement for the public health."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Christakis is very passionate and obvi the foremost authority on many of these topics. THE READINGS ARE GOLD. I have never been so interested in doing the readings for any other class despite the fact that it's mostly research papers. \r\nWeaknesses: seminar pilot may have had too much of just students inserting random points while Christakis waits for somebody to read his mind and say the main point we should have taken away. I do think the class could def work as a seminar though, just needs a bit of tweaking. Not too much info\/examples given about exams\/papers so the format\/rubric for the first midterm was a shock. They don't look at how long your argument was or how complex it was or how many examples you could bring up. Argument must be extremely precise and well analyzed.",
                "Loved the discussion format of the course this semester. There was certainly a lot of reading but they were all clearly chosen with care and had very interesting results\/messages. The books were especially interesting. I was very happy I bought all of them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Christakis is an enthusiastic and engaged teacher who really cares about his field and wants students to learn. Discussions are active and participatory. The workload is very manageable. And the content is genuinely interesting and relevant.\r\nWeaknesses: This is not really a weakness, just a fact about the course: it is an overview, not a deep dive into a given topic. To go really in depth you would have to take a more advanced course.",
                "This course provides a very unique and engaging set of readings and concepts that touch on many aspects of health and disease, including ones outside the traditional scope of public health. It completely transforms how one perceives medical care and disease in our society. This course is typically taught as a lecture, but was a seminar in Fall 2022. The discussions were mostly spent summarizing the concepts from each reading, but we often went on in-depth tangents related to Prof. Christakis' experiences as a physician and sociologist. Completing all the readings, attending each seminar, going to office hours, and studying is not sufficient to earn an A in the course. The assessments are graded with scrutiny, and it is often unclear how to improve your writing for future assessments.",
                "This course was very engaging and I enjoyed the readings. Overall, the content was great and there was a wide-range of topics. A weakness of this course is that I didn't feel very comfortable speaking. I don't think that the seminar\/discussion environment was very good. I often felt judged based on how I responded to things.",
                "This course was amazing  it completely changed how I think about public health and health policy. The class was always engaging and I enjoyed discussing the readings in a seminar style. This class could be improved by having a shorter final exam. I felt the final exam did not challenge my knowledge of the material as much as my ability to produce two substantial essays in a short period of time. Maybe having one essay and some short answers would be a better way to evaluate students. However, overall this course is one that I will remember as one of the best I took at Yale.",
                "One major strength of this course is how carefully the readings are selected to build a broader point each week and shape the discussion. All of the readings connected to one another nicely and taking this course will teach you how to read and digest quite a few readings each week and synthesize them for discussion. Another major strength of this course is the importance placed on nuanced discussion of the different topics. This allows for an appreciation of the complexities inherent in health and public health to be developed. \r\nAs a seminar, a major weakness of this course was that sometimes it felt as though we glossed over major points or didn't cover a topic as thoroughly as it should have been covered since students somewhat led each discussion. Many classes were rushed at the end as Professor Christakis tried to cover a topic in less time than he had planned.",
                "Strengths: Prof Christakis is a great lecturer and has so much experience in the field. Its a reading heavy load but all of them are worthwhile and the class is very well set up\r\nWeaknesses: the seminar style should be organized to facilitate discussion rather than leading to a specific answer, which is what it felt like. Also the final take-home exam was excessive and an unrealistic amount of work.",
                "The class material is great, but I felt like some of the organizational aspects of the course really hindered my ability to learn and engage with the course. The readings for each week were often very overwhelming, consisting of 100-200 pages of dense scientific language that was difficult to parse through. The classes themselves consisted of a lecture\/seminar hybrid, where it was difficult to get a word in because of the relatively large size of the group. In general most of the class consisted of students talking over each other\/participating in what felt like a very forced discussion. The demographics that made up our class also meant that a lot of the conversations were led by my white peers, which made me feel uncomfortable especially when we discussed healthcare issues that primarily impacted POC communities. While this is no fault to the students or the instructors of the course, I think that more of an effort could've been made to acknowledge the privileges we had speaking on these issues. There were very few assignments throughout the course, which placed even more emphasis on the midterm and final grades, and the few assignments we did have we received very little feedback to help us improve in the future.",
                "The materials of the course and its deliverance by Professor Christakis is phenomenal. You'll love this class! Never gets boring!!!!! It teaches you so much more than any HS level courses or generic information about public health found in the web \/ online courses.",
                "Strengths: Productive group discussion, interesting and fun tangents, important and clear critical points from each lecture about the role of public health, varied and diverse reading (though heavy on Western medicine). \r\nWeaknesses: Seminar structure didn't quite facilitate interactiveness between students. Perhaps an opportunity for a group project\/presentation would have driven learning and encouraged students to research the concepts more closely. Lack of open office hours. Grading can appear arbitrary."

                "Absolutely. Should be a requirement for pre-meds. Be prepared to have your ideals challenged. Sometimes I think Christakis is provoking us even if he doesn't believe in a certain idea himself. His main goal is that physicians should know their limits. Don't be arrogant, maintain humility, and contribute to public health and social causes.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. It challenged me to think and made my jaw drop multiple times. Certainly my favorite class this semester.",
                "Definitely! Exciting, interesting, not too much work, relevant to a variety of fields in medicine, social sciences, econ and others. Do note that while the workload is low, it's not a gut; grading is definitely on the strict side, so put effort into studying and writing for papers and exams.\r\nThis is a class where the professor genuinely wants you to learn and cares about your participation, and is also a leading researcher in his field. \r\nTake this class!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in public health, medicine, sociology, statistics, or illness and disease in general. Prof. Christakis is one of Yale's best professorshe has a wealth of experience in so many fields and is appointed in 5 departments at Yale. This course offers a very unique and valuable perspective on health and disease; the readings are long (often 100-200 pages per week) but very engaging if you enjoy reading papers from scientific journals.  No experience in quantitive methods is required, though the studies themselves often rely on complex statistical models. Do not expect an easy A in this course. Grading consists of an in-class essay-based midterm, a take-home essay, a long take-home final (2 essays), and attendance\/participation. You are expected to know how to effectively synthesize course concepts in writing; understanding the takeaways from the readings (which there are many) is not enough. Overall, Prof. Christakis is a joy to learn from, and this course provides exposure to his lab (humannaturelab.net)a very unique hub of research in biosocial science. I left each class with an entirely new perspective on health and disease and am inspired to go further in this field.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it were a lecture class. This was the first time it was taught as a seminar, and I don't think it was done well. The content was very interesting and engaging which is why I think it would be better as a lecture.",
                "Yes, as I described above, this course will change your perspective on public health and policy in addition to your own concept of disease and illness. I would highly recommend it.",
                "yes, it was my favourite class I have ever taken",
                "Yes, if they are interested in health and medicine and comfortable with a heavier workload in terms of reading and writing. This course introduced lots of new ideas and changed my perspective on the topic of health, but it is a challenging class to take, especially with the readings and papers.",
                "Yes. It was a lot of reading and you definitely have to do it all to stay engaged, but its worth it. Far and above my favorite class that Ive taken, the material was so interesting and I learned so much about the social background of our healthcare system. 100% recommend!",
                "While I think the course material is very important for anyone interested in healthcare or pursuing a career in health, I would not recommend this course the way it is currently being taught. I think that overall this course felt more like an effort to cram existing opinions on healthcare issues rather than teaching students to synthesize their own ideas from a foundational background, and the organizational issues with this class certainly affected my ability to learn throughout the semester.",
                "YES 110%!",
                "I would recommend the course as a seminar as I felt there was a more personal element and connection to the material with a small class size. Otherwise his lectures can be found online and are similar every year so there is less of a need to take the course as a large lecture since the workload can be overwhelming (2 5pg single spaced final papers)"
