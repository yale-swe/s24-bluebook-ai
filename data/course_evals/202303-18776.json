I liked how lesson videos were posted online, it helped a lot with staying up to date with the course. However, the pre-quizzes before every class were often 2-3 weeks ahead of what we were actually covering in class so sometimes it felt extremely disjointed and I didn't fully focus on the pre-quiz material because I knew we would not actually cover it for a long time.",
                "Strengths: office hours, review session and peer tutoring were extremely helpful when I had questions about content\r\nWeaknesses: material in class didn't always line up with other sections\/pre-class quizzes, and often we could have spent more time covering difficult topics",
                "Strengths: The pre-class videos are very helpful to have beforehand with the lecture\r\nWeaknesses: The psets were too difficult to even grasp certain concepts, at one point you get burn out and instead of trying to understand the problem you are just focused on completing the problem. Also the final exam was not like the practice exams on Canvas.",
                "strengths:\r\ntopic progression was helpful in reinforcing learned skills and grasping new skills\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nimproving the interface of the canvas website + making grades viewable to see our progress"
