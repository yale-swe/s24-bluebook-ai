Amand gives you detailed sets of feedback on your policy memos - one for the rough drafts, one for the final drafts). Economic concepts that are practical in understanding international relationships within and involving the EU. EU history, structure, mechanisms, strengths, weaknesses, perceptions, role, etc.",

                "We covered the history and institutions of the European Union, the causes and effects of Brexit, and the intricacies of international trade controls, monetary policy, and interests rates. We learned to write policy action memos that were concise and effective.",

                "This class provided a holistic overview of the historical, political, and economic integration of Europe and the EU since the 1950s. We started with a brief overview of Europe at the time of the ~WWII era and covered topics until present day, including Brexit, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and the Greek debt crisis. We also talked about the history of the euro and the implications for future integration. I came into this course with literally 0 knowledge about the EU, and I am much more familiar with how the EU works, its institutions, and its history.",

Can't think of anything.",
                "Strength: the readings and method of teaching. Gave good background regardless of how much expertise people came into the class with. Also the one-on-one feedback on memos.\r\nWeakness: too long spent on initial structure if EU that could have been spent on the later half of the course",
                "Strengths: Flexibility to pursue current events or other topics students find interesting, assignments designed to prepare students for the real world, and depth of understanding of the topics covered.\r\nWeaknesses: We got slightly behind schedule which led to us moving assignments around and the readings not always lining up with the class day, which was difficult.",
                "Very much an excellent lecture/seminar hybrid, the readings could be a bit dense but worth it to stay engaged with the course.",
                "Professor Amand is a great professor who really knows what he's talking about. The course is structured very well and the feedback is good. The readings are also interesting. Sometimes the format is quite lecture-heavy, but it's a lot of content to get through and Professor Amand is very knowledgeable.",
                "Strength = Marnix is an amazing professor who is super knowledgeable about economics in general and more specifically the EU. He speaks super fast, but he knows so much and is very willing to share his ideas. Definitely go to his office hours if you need help but also if you want to chat more about stuff you have been covering in class -- I had some really great debates with him. Also, I liked writing the policy memos, as those were actually super realistic and practical and really forced us (my group mate and I) to apply what we had learned in class to a real life exercise. Finally, I surprisingly enjoyed the oral final exam -- do not be intimidated at all! I was definitely super nervous going in and wasn't sure what to expect, but it is actually a really great exercise (it is more like a conversation on the EU than getting grilled on it) and I realized I had learned a lot more than I thought I had which was super awesome!\r\nWeakness = don't get grades back right away, but also don't worry about that as long as you are doing the readings and putting in the work on the pset and policy memos and in class you will turn out fine grade-wise (I promise).",
                "The lectures were fascinating and the readings usually were a great supplement to them.  No real flaws.",
                "-Professor Amand is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in European economics and diplomacy. He always asked questions that made the seminars very interesting and interactive and talked about recent developments and news of the European Economy. He is definitely a great strength of the course. \r\n- the assignments helped us understand the content in depth and critically think, preparing us for assignments in our future professions\r\n-the discussions in class were very engaging and well-rounded \r\n-no weaknesses!",
                "It's an amazing course! The readings can be a bit technical at times, but Prof. Amand really just wants you to have a solid grasp by the end--he's not out to trick you. He really is the biggest strength of the course."

This class is also super practical, he doesn't make you learn for the sake of it but so that you could reproduce it in a realistic scenario. The feedback on the policy memos is very helpful and the oral exam is probably the best final I've taken at Yale.",

                "Yes! I would definitely recommend to another student. Marnix is an awesome professor and you will learn so much from him -- this is my second class with him and I still love him. I would recommend this class to students who are interested in the EU, and would definitely recommend to those who do not know anything about the EU. You don't have to know anything to take this class, Marnix will teach you! I came into this class knowing nothing and I have walked away with a much better understanding of the history of the EU and how it works. Now, I feel I could have an intelligent conversation or read the news about the EU and understand what is going on/what is at stake. Please take this class if you can get in!",
                "Absolutely!  If you have any interest in Europe at all and have studied some economics  during your Yale career, you will learn a lot and really gain expertise on the EU.",

Speaking from personal experience, it is a particularly interesting class also for people who are European or have some personal experience with any of the past events the class analyzes. It helps students understand how the European market works by also focusing on how the EU works, which is unique to the whole world as a structure and thus interesting to everyone.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in having a working understanding of the EU, the Euro, the history of EU debt crises, etc., this is a great class. Don't worry about not being good at econ!"
