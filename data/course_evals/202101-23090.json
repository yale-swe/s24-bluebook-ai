Lectures became extremely hard to follow toward the end.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\nPerhaps doing only one lab based on the IR sensor.  Also please be much more specific in the lab instructions exactly what data we would need for our lab reports.  I had to redo two labs to get data.  It wasn't fun.",

Also super great professor who makes lectures engaging and was really good with technology use\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - this class honestly could not be done well with a pandemic. It is a class that has to be held in person",
                "This course is very knowledge heavy. While all the information is relevant to success in the class, it's a lot to pack into 1 semester. It might do well to either cut away some of the material covered in this course, or split it into 2 separate semesters.",
                "I loved the TA's.  Everyone's learning style is different and I personally benefitted from asking the TA's questions in addition to reading lecture notes.  I would say that any weaknesses from one style of teaching are compensated for by the additional styles that professor Venkadesan employs.",

                "I felt that it went too deep into theory and barely into practice. I feel like it turned into a math class instead of teaching me how to efficiently use a microcontroller. I would like it if they did guided code walkthroughs and taught us about various things you can do with the microcontrollers. Also, the virtual labs felt like treading water for 3 hours, with unclear instructions that constantly contradicted themselves. More careful planning of labs would be greatly appreciated."

Almost all of the parts were faulty, the guidance (despite the diligent work of the TFs) was not enough to ensure that we were doing the lab procedures correctly. I spent more time debugging than actually working on the lab procedures and reports. Also, as a nitpick, there was a big disconnect between the lab procedures and the deliverables at times, sometimes leading me to do hours of work in accordance with the lab procedure with no deliverable to show for it.",
                "I honestly think virtual lab was awful. The TAs did their best but two people troubleshooting individual code and hardware for 20 people was just not realistic. There is nothing that can really be done about this, but I would advise waiting to take this class if it is not going to be in person.",

If you are ABET MechE, you have to take it, and even if you are not ABET/have an interest in robotics it is really useful and is taught well. I personally just didn't like the content that much. If you like robotics, control systems, and want to get good at working with microcontrollers then you definitely should take it. It is a really hard class though and be prepared to deal with some weird code.",
                "Yes. While it is a very difficult course, I feel that I actually learned useful information regarding the operation of mechatronic systems and tangibly applied them during the final project. It's also super rewarding to see how some of the previously covered material from other classes contributes to the overall field of mechanical engineering through this class.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Not only is the material interesting, but this is also one of the few classes in the MechE curriculum that centers practical application of every theoretical thing you touch. Beyond that, the teaching team are INCREDIBLE. They all handled my issues, questions, and mental health struggles with compassion and grace. This class was difficult but it was never because the teaching team made it so. I can not express enough how much love I have for all of them.",

If it's taught by Prof. Venkadesan, don't hesitate to take it. If you're considering taking it as an elective, i highly recommend it. You will learn actual useful skills in mechatronics and practicalities of design and analysis. It's also a great introduction to robotics, which is an otherwise lacking field at Yale in MechE.",
                "I would recommend this to another student who is interested in control systems, not afraid of math, and prepared to put in the work.",
                "No. I would only recommend if it is a requirement of the major. It is not worth it. I felt like I would have learned more useful in an online Udemy course, with less work and less stress."
