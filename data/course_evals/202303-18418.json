I felt like being compelled to learn to read and write them really enhanced my overall understanding. I loved the final paper assignment. It was a great culminating assignment and a good way to show what I'd learned in the course. Professor Chinchilla was clearly very knowledgeable and I enjoyed him as a professor. Weaknesses: I would have liked some more emphasis on the nuances of Maya grammar, but we were never tested on this knowledge so it wasn't a big deal."

You won't have many other opportunities to learn this sort of content, so I would say that you should definitely take advantage."
