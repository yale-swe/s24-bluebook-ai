                "This course was based in translating Ciceros Pro Caelio with periodic grammar reviews of certain concepts, but this text is really a medium to discuss grammar, literary themes and Roman culture, all of which come very interesting to light.",

                "I would have preferred a variety of texts as we had toward the end of the semester instead of staying with Cicero for most of the time. We could have gotten a good sense for his writing from 10 chapters instead of 60-70. I liked the variety of assignments; the papers and projects were a nice break from the weekly translation quizzes which kind of stressed me out.",
                "Honestly there were basically no weaknesses. Loved the course!",
                "The strengths are definitely Prof. Bell and the way she engages her students! I enjoyed coming to class on MWF because there were added components (mini presentations on Roman culture, mini lectures on cum clauses, innovative graded assignments, etc.) that sharpened my knowledge on the language and the ancient world. I'd say the only weakness is that it's a morning class, and sometimes it took a few minutes to get in the groove of translating sentences.",
                "This course was structured incredibly clearly and efficiently for learning, and although it was quite a lot of work, the exams were fair and it was always clear what would be expected so that students could succeed.",
                "I though that this course was absolutely amazing and was really well taught. This course focused on understanding the Latin, but also made sure to discuss all important cultural and social problems that came up."

                "Yes, it is a good course to evaluate your knowledge of Latin and expand it. Also, you more out of it because there are fewer students so you can socialize and discuss the historical meaning of the Latin translation more.",
                "I would not recommend this class to people outside of the classics\/clcv majors. Latin is hard and not particularly useful, and you will benefit more from a different language class. The translations for class also took up more time than assignments for any other class.",
                "Yes! Its the next step in studying Latin, but its also a great class, especially with Treasa.",
                "YES, especially with Prof. Bell! She is kind and really engages her students interests. The workload is manageable and the graded assignments are fun! Amusement is also found when reading Cicero, who you'll find is shocking in many ways",
                "Yes I think Professor Bell was great and very understanding.",
                "If you are interested in further advancing your Latin skills, yes. It introduces you to longer and more complicated works as well as the associated analytical practices that philologists have used for generations.",
                "If the student intends on fully immersing in Latin, absolutely. The Pro Caelio is a fantastic read, and though it meant lots of work nearly every day, inside and outside the virtual classroom, it is extremely satisfying and immense progress in understanding Latin is inevitable.",
