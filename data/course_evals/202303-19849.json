I thought it was amazing how by the end of the course we were able to understand Spanish verb conjugations and participate in group thinking. \r\nI have no ideas on how this course could be improved! I enjoyed learning with my peers and appreciated the consistent help and advice that my professor have me to improve my writing and speaking proficiency.",
                "There is a lot of participation in this class but it is easy to participate because you are given resources before and then given even more time in class to discuss with partners or in small groups. I felt that there were appropriate amounts of speaking, writing, and grammar.",
                "Profesora Rubio is wonderful, and I would absolutely recommend taking the course if it is with her. Many of the strengths are in the diversity of assignments we completed and sources utilized. I thought my perspective was genuinely broadened in the process of taking the course, which was not the case in Spanish 130.",
                "Strengths: Workload is very manageable, it's very engaging as the class is structured as a discussion, and the topics we studied taught me new things about culture of Spanish speaking countries\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the work given on asynchronous Wednesdays was difficult to get done in a single day",
                "Strengths: the asynchronous day is good. Prof Rubio is FANTASTIC. The collaborations assignments really helped me learn because I didn't have crushing pressure to perform perfectly the first time.\r\nWeaknesses: no in-class writing assignments.",
                "This course was enjoyable due to the seminar-style and small class size, which allowed me to interact with others and engage with what was happening in class. I wish there was less pre-class work.",
                "Asynchronous work was very erratic in workload. Some days, I had to read an article... other days, I was required to write nearly page-long responses to either short films, artworks, or a combination of both. I think this variety of content was an asset to the course, but the variability in workload made it difficult to plan ahead and sometimes exceeded reasonable bounds: watching a two-hour movie only to discuss in for 5 minutes in class feels like a waste of time. \r\n\r\nRegardless, the course units were interesting and engaging and my professor did an excellent job at combining grammar studies with course content.",
                "It was a really well-taught class. I liked how the Canvas page was managed by a course coordinator to provide organization and continuity across sections.",
                "The greatest strength of this course comes from the amount of discussion and involvement with the Spanish language itself. Rather than testing a student's capabilities through testing, their Spanish abilities were evaluated through a large amount of discussion-based tasks and group work, which overall feels more effective at this level of Spanish. This course could be improved with a bit more exercises focused on speaking, as this area feels to be the least focused.",
                "Strengths: engagement with other students in a manageable group size, and a chance to converse in spanish in an informal setting. \r\nWeaknesses: homework often did not have logical connection with class work and as a result often felt extraneous."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as I believe that it is crucial to developing a strong writing, speaking, and cultural proficiency in Spanish. Working with my peers in group discussion forums on Canvas was very interesting as we got to share our ideas on art pieces. I also enjoyed the choice of pieces we were given from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York to interpret, such as the sculpture of a woman's face or a drawing by a woman painter named Rosalie Bonheur of goats (chevres), or a picture of two women (one pregnant and the other not) clad in blue two pieces next to the pool. The advice given by Professor Luca Rubio was very helpful and engaging, especially with regards to grammatical fixes in my writing and clarity of my work. I think one highlight of the class was the presentation in both groups and individually of the projects we worked on. In addition, the group interviews and discussion with the professor were very interesting, unique, and something I had never partaken in during my time in Spanish class before. \r\nI am so sad this is my last Spanish course! I am so grateful that I learned so much about Spanish and Latino-american experiences with migration, feminism, and cultural expectations and religious beliefs, as well as alongside my peers.",
                "Yes, this class explored really interesting topics and my instructor also did a fantastic job.",
                "Yes, if they are looking to learn a lot and fulfill their language requirements.",
                "If with Profesora Rubio, absolutely! I learned a lot, improved my Spanish, and engaged with fun source material.",
                "Yes, you gain a lot of speaking experience that will allow you converse much better with native speakers in Spanish speaking countries",
                "Yes! This class, especially with Prof Rubio, is fun! And you will learn Spanish.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student (especially if you are taking it with Professor Lucia Rubio). I took this class because I had to get my language credit, but I really enjoyed it.",
                "Absolutely! The Spanish department as a whole is fantastic, the professor was supportive, and I felt myself improve in both written and oral skills over the course of the semester.",
                "YES! If you can take any Spanish class with Professor Rubio, do not hesitate to enroll. She is legitimately the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. Professor Rubio knew all of our names the second day of class and really took the time to get to know each of us during the semester.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to other students wanting to strengthen their knowledge of the Spanish language and its culture. Evaluating my own abilities at the end of the semester compared to the beginning, I feel as though my abilities in Spanish have definitely improved, especially when talking and discussing more niche topics. Along with that, the amount of discussion activities in class has allowed me to not only feel more comfortable in an all-Spanish environment but also connect with other classmates as well.",
                "Yes! For anyone looking to improve their spanish language skills-- especially conversational spanish-- this is a great course."
