                "I learned the fundamentals of all major central bank activitybeyond merely monetary policy, which is where my previous knowledge lied. I think most surprising was the amount I learned about the financial and banking systems, which are intimately related to central bank activity but was something I didn't have much knowledge of before. I found the way it operates as a complex adaptive system very intriguing.",
                "Not only did I learn a lot of information on how central banks work, but this course also taught me how to think like a central banker. Monetary policy had always been an area of economics that I found a little confusing, but this course, through its challenging case studies and papers, forced me to dig deep into the logic of central banking. By the final tabletop exercise, I was very impressed with the grasp I now had on monetary policy concepts.",
                "High level central banking course",
                "This course gives a great overview of the various roles of central banks. You generally think about central banking = monetary policy, but there is so much more to it. The course is well organized where every assignment really makes you think and truly problem solve. Bill English is so knowledgeable. The Friday coffee chat sessions are a great way to pick his brain.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great organization (some of the best lecture slides I've seen), interesting casework, interesting teaching perspective (from a senior Fed official). The only weakness was the class discussion grading scheme: I would receive scores that were not equal to my contribution because the grade was entirely based on the delivery of the group's representative to the class. This felt somewhat unfair in certain cases. Besides this, Professor English makes it very clear he wants us to succeed by giving the opportunity for rewrites and supplying huge amounts of feedback to help.",
                "This course was very well-organized, and the sequence with which we went through the content made a lot of sense and enhanced my understanding of it. Professor English is also a very talented lecturer and is able to very clearly transmit information. Professor English also invited a few guest speakers, with very impressive qualifications, to come speak to our class. The assignments, particularly the case studies, can seem daunting, but they are quite effective in helping you understand the content on deeper level. In terms of weaknesses, I would have appreciated a bit more guidance for the case studies, given their open-ended nature. For Case 1, which was early in the semester, I felt that I didn't yet know enough about the logic of monetary policy to successfully complete the case. Maybe it would have been better to have the two papers at the beginning of the semester and then the two case studies later on.",
                "More basic background teaching to better understand bigger concepts and ideas of course",
                "Strengths: It is a really well structured course. It connects really well, and has cool speakers. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures can get a little dry where we are discussing topics such as how many members should we have on a committee",
                "Prof. English is an incredible teacher thats incredibly knowledgeable. He does a great job answering questions, giving students chances to engage with the course, and bringing in interesting guests. His feedback on papers is also incredibly thorough and it shows how much he cares about helping his students. However, the course felt inaccessible at times given that there were so many grad students that had worked at central banks, asking questions that were more complicated than anything we had learned. There was also a good bit of finance knowledge/vocab that was assumed in this course that should have been covered at the beginning. Lastly, I found it difficult to stay engaged with the lecture material since there werent any midterms during the semester that would have encouraged students to keep up with the lecture material more.",
                "Strengths were the professor (Professor English), who is extremely knowledgeable and connected in the central banking space. One weakness would be the group activities (e.g. the cases and the tabletop), in which students are assigned to groups of five or six to discuss cases in class. I felt the format didn't really allow us to express ourselves and that the grades for these activities were somewhat arbitrarily or unclearly assigned."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are interested in what the Fed does beyond just setting rate policy (though this is obviously included). You really come to understand the fundamental role central banks play in our economies and societies and learn from an incredible perspective in Professor English. We would work on cases that involved scenarios that he himself dealt with while he was FOMC Secretary at the Fed, which was really cool. The class was also very much grounded in reality rather than purely theoryas my first upper level economics class at Yale, this was very refreshing. I came away with a huge amount of knowledge and was constantly engaged by the lectures. I highly reccomend!",
                "Yes, especially if you have studied economics and have not yet gotten a full grasp on monetary policy. Many economics courses touch lightly on the subject, but it was not until taking ECON 424 that I could confidently say I understood most parts of monetary policy. It was very empowering in an intellectual sense and filled a gap in my economics studies at Yale thus far.",

                "Yes, but only if you have a decent background in central banking or are extremely interested in the subject. If youre iffy about your interest in the topic, dont take this course because you wont enjoy it/wont take advantage of the resources.",
