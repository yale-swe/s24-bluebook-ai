I learned a lot about Chinese culture, and though it was painful in the process I think the writing component of the class is a huge strength - I knew very little handwriting before coming into this class, but now I can handwrite entire paragraphs. However, I'd improve the course through a better textbook, as oftentimes the exercises were incredibly unclear and felt somewhat useless. I'd also implement more speaking opportunities - the speaking homework was ungraded, and sometimes I wish I had feedback to improve my speaking mannerisms and pronunciation.",
                "Strengths: discussions in class were very interesting and level of engagement was high. Definitely take this class if you are on the fence.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the in class tingxie should be taken after a lesson on new material, rather than before the words are taught by the instructor.",
                "The professor was very engaging, and class conversations were always interesting. I wish we developed more reading skills.",
