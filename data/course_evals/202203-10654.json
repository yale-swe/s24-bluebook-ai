The course also fueled my interest in East Asian history, and provided me with a great wealth of knowledge with respect to East Asian culture.",
                "I was able to learn much about the genre of New Wave, and by listening to weekly playlists I was able to further explore my interest in different music genres.",
                "In Professor Kaos class, I was exposed to the British New Wave, listening to new genres of music. I learned about the sociological phenomenon behind the British New Wave and Hallyu and found that the two are more closely related than I had realized.",
                "Through taking this course I was able to learn of the origins of both British New Wave and K-Pop. I also learned how to analyze the instrumentation, vocals, and visuals of a song.",

                "Through exposure to a great amount and wide range of music, I became more attuned to the nuances of musical instrumentation. I also learned about how music from one country can diffuse to other countries and cultures and how those cultures can in turn, influence the music.",

                "Strengths of this course include its general breadth  covering topics from reggae, to glam rock, to k-pop. However, I would have liked to see it either spend an equal amount of time on each of the genres, or simply focus solely on k-pop. At times, it felt as though the main focus was k-pop and the other genres were simply secondary.",
                "Through the instructor, the students in the course were able to have special learning experiences both in and out of the classroom.",
                "I thought it was really neat to have listened to hundreds of songs by the end of her class. I enjoyed the course very much and do not have any further suggestions to improve it.",
                "Strengths: The course is very engaging! If you have the smallest interest in either British New Wave or K-Pop, this class is going to be so much fun.",
                "Strengths: fun, improves reading and writing, teaches you how to present in a timely manner, engaging, discussion based, concerts!\r\nWeaknesses: we did not talk about the readings that much",
                "This course exposes you to lots of music; we listened to at least 300 songs this semester. While the weekly playlists can be long and tiring to listen to, they ultimate help provide necessary context to the content of the course. For a sociology course, the readings were comparatively light, though it initially may seem heavy. The readings were not discussed as fully as I hoped they would be in the class, though. The end of unit group projects were fun to work on, and I enjoyed exploring the topic I chose for my final paper, the prompt of which was broad but specific enough for us to work on interesting topic relevant to the class.",
                "Strength: Definitely a very interesting course in terms of the niche subjectwhen will you ever find a class that talks about K-pop? We also got to attend live concerts, which was an amazing experience. Dr.Kao was very passionate about the subject and understanding toward the students.\r\nWeakness: This course wasn't as \"seminar\" like as I expectedfelt more like a small lecture with projects\/occasional group work, and not really discussion-based. Doesn't necessarily mean a weakness, just something that I didn't expect."

                "I would recommend this course to students who are not familiar with New Wave and\/or K-Pop. I feel that by taking this class, students would be able to develop some sort of interest and find interest in music in general, even if it is neither New Wave or K-Pop.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who loves or is curious to learn about music.",
                "Definitely! This was my favorite course this semester because of how much the class bonds with one another over our shared love and interest in music.",

This class is also enjoyable if you are a music fan, especially of the New Wave or K-pop genre.",
                "YES! This class was very enjoyable. It was my favorite class this semester. You get to discover a lot of music and learn more about the time period.",
