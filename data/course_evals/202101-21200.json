                "In this course, I developed new writing skills and learned how to critically examine an album along with critical reviews of the music. Specifically for writing, I learned how to best structure and format a paper in order to present a clear and concise argument. Reading academic papers, I learned how to find the thesis in a dense paper. I gained new insights into how important music is in the wake of centuries of oppression on Black people and how it is used as a platform to spread a message.",

                "This course was great for allowing me to apply something I loved and found interesting (music) to a more academic context. Additionally, the albums and articles we engaged with were very well picked and greatly increased my understanding of Black history, race\/gender\/sexuality politics, and many more interesting topics. I am honestly not entirely sure how I would improve this course.",
                "I really enjoyed the topic of this class and how collaborative the seminar was. Jeong Yeon did an amazing job at keeping us engaged and helping us connect even though we were communicating virtually. Beyond the personal connection, a strength of the course was the amazing artists we listened to. We analyzed the music in accompaniment with academic essays. Looking at Black culture and history through the lens of music was powerful and beautiful. Another strength was that the workload was manageable specifically because Jeong Yeon checked in on us about how we were doing with work and with other classes in the semester. While still getting all our assignments done, we had space and time to fully read the essays, spend time and effort writing our papers, and listening to the albums multiple times without it feeling crunched for time or stressful. it helped me enjoy and fully engage in all the material we discussed in class. \r\nMy only critical feedback is to have more writing workshops. It would be helpful to have more guidance and advice about how to best write a paper, work on prose, structure a paper, etc. Jeong Yeon was always available to help outside of class, but it would be helpful to have more structured in-class periods where he can speak with us or do activities about how to work on becoming a better writer, particularly with trends he notices in our papers. Because everybody is coming from different backgrounds of writing from high school in this introduction writing class, this would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Jeong Yeon is a very kind and accommodating professor -- he understands the student experience and tries to make the class as low stakes and engaging as possible, the album assignments are super enjoyable and interesting, the class environment is relaxing, welcoming, and conducive to learning, Weaknesses: maybe not enough time devoted to learning how to write in class?",
                "I really enjoyed our seminars. I also liked reading articles in tandem with albums and felt that it gave me a lot to think about and reflect on every week. I also enjoyed the way the different papers were structured. I liked that our final was not the longest one, I think it helped me stay on top of my work. I think focusing more on artists instead of just individual albums would have been an interesting addition to this course.",
                "The course fosters intense engagement and interest in the content.",
                "Strengths: There was a lot of collaboration and discussion among students. I think the weekly album discussions and the accompanied readings were an important part of the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It may be helpful to have more writing-focused classes or workshops spread throughout the semester."

Additionally, he made it clear that he understood that during the pandemic everybody is overcoming their own individual obstacles and worked with us to make sure we could manage the workload and craziness going on this semester.",

I cannot speak for any of the other English 114 sections, but specifically In The Wake of Neo Soul with Jeong Yeon Lee is the course I have taken at Yale so far that I would most quickly recommend to another student.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course. First and foremost, Jeong Yeon guarantees that the class will be engaging and that you will get to know your classmates well. Secondly, the albums that we listen to and analyze in class are made by incredible artists and provide a unique and powerful perspective on Black history and culture. Lastly, you get exposed to many great writers by reading critiques on the artists or relating topics that help develop your own writing better.",
