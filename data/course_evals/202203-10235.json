                "Strengths: the classic American environmental literature was great, and Professor Warner is so knowledgeable and passionate about all of it, which really came across in his teaching. Weaknesses: class was not run as a discussion- Professor Warner basically guided us through passages that he found important/interesting and left very little room for us to talk to each other about the works.",
                "strengths - readings were interesting, profesor warner's extremely deep knowledge of subject material, good through lines delivering clear takeaways from the class \r\nweaknesses - definitely could use more non white man readings, Professor Warner talks for at least half of each seminar which makes cohesive discussion difficult",
                "The seminar format was nice. It was a good balance of Professor Warner talking and student discussion. \r\nI found it difficult to engage sometimes as I would have liked to linger a bit longer on the texts to properly understand them and their historical provenance.",
                "strengths: generally the readings were great and class discussion brought me lots of new ideas; Prof. Warner is so smart and gets deep into the material, often going off on very interesting tangents\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some people may be frustrated by how Prof. Warner runs a seminar - he has a clear direction he wants to take it and he speaks more than professors in most seminars. I actually found this really great becausein my opinionhard texts deserve to be explained rather than just halfheartedly probed at by undergrads wanting to talk in class more than they want to understand something. But for those that like a more open seminar atmosphere where the professor sits back, this seminar may not be for you.",
                "Warner is a really great professor, and his seminar discussions were really interesting. At times I wished the course was a lecture because I wanted to hear him talk about the books more."

                "Yes, tentatively. You get to read a lot of interesting stuff, but class time is closer to a lecture than a seminar and the selection of readings over all is not super coherent. The classic American environmental authors obviously follow clearly from one to the next, but we also read stuff that felt more random. That being said, Professor Warner gives great feedback on writing.",
                "Yes if you are interested in English and philosophy, and no if you are more practically minded when it comes to environmental matters.",
                "Yes, this was a really solid course for thinking about literature in the context of the environment, and the environmental humanities more broadly. The syllabus says that we examine literature through the lens of \"climate change,\" which I think is not quite right. We never really talked about industrialization or fossil fuels in any serious way. Rather, we tended to think about nature and environment (which for me is distinct from GHG emissions and planetary warming). This was not a negative, though, and if you want to think about what \"nature\" means and how we have positions ourselves within/against it in American history, this course is for you;",
