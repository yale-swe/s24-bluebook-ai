It was my first time taking a biology lab course and it truly went through almost all the necessary basic techniques needed for real life. For example, practicing micropipetting, gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, TOPO cloning, annotating using Lasergene, PCR amplification, Cas9 assays, and using electronic lab notebooks. These skills are essential to be applied to the lab.",

Even though it might have been our first time ever trying some of these techniques their patience and teaching was direct and detailed. The course was also able to give me insight into the mannerisms I need for the lab in the real world and how it is best to keep everything organized.",
                "A little disorganized. Did not know how I was being evaluated and assignments were sometimes a bit confusing.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot from the class. Feedback was clear. Teaching fellows were very supportive. Weaknesses: The syllabus could be clearer and updated more often; in the middle of the semester I didnt really know where the class was going.",
                "There was not much work outside of class but sometimes the class went overtime or there wasn't as much preparation for some of the parts like guide RNA design took longer than expected",
                "Pros: very useful and good feedback. Skills are relevant and well-taught \r\nCons: Disorganized, but this is the nature of such a class; providing a more detailed tentative syllabus would help",
                "While the content taught in the course is very valuable, sometimes the class could be difficult to follow and slightly disorganized."

It truly gives you the perfect insight into how real-life circumstances are in labs. The course is great for fully understanding the purpose behind each laboratory technique and is important to investigating the detailed procedures behind preparing a CRISPR/Cas9 assay. It was a course well designed to bring you into what is expected in a biology lab.",
