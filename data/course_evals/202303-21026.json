I also learned the importance of teamwork in digital humanities projects, and the practice of how a project would would in the real world where everyone contributes something to the project. I was not aware of how practical digital humanities projects can be, and how they can make a difference in the real world, such as the project we saw in class on ICE detention centers and how this was designed to meet the needs of vulnerable children and other migrants.",
                "Conceptual understanding of analog and digital archives, rudimentary understanding of coding for digital archives, skills for working within a team",
                "I gained deeper knowledge of how humanistic modes of knowledge are produced and the digital resources available for humanities scholars, as well as how to work collectively on a project with other scholars.",
                "The course was, as advertised, a useful introduction to the methods of digital humanities and the DH landscape as it currently exists in academia. I was able to substantially broaden my knowledge regarding the variety of forms DH projects can take; the key considerations regarding medium, audience, maintenance, and collaboration one should keep in mind when embarking upon a DH project; and the critical discourse that the digital humanities (in a variety of forms) participate in and perpetuate.",

                "Strengths: team work! I felt good getting to know and engaging with peers in a different way than the traditional seminars. Also the reading load was more than okay, it gave me the opportunity to truly engage with the readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness: maybe we started working on the final projects too late, we could have been introduced to them earlier on.",
                "The main strength of this course was the final project in which we got to work on a digital humanities project in teams, as this reflects how most digital humanities projects work in the real world. The requirement to look at examples of digital projects throughout the semester and their connection to the theme of the week was also excellent, as it illustrated the variety in DH projects and how each can be conceived of differently. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course was the presentations that students gave each week on the readings for the week. I wasn't entirely sure what was required of us in giving this presentation, and more often than not the discussion in these presentations felt dry and a bit static. It was helpful for the professor to jump into the discussion and give comments, but other than that, I felt that it was not really of use to the students themselves. If these presentations had more structure or if they could be tied into the final project, they would be much more helpful rather than just a check box to fill.",
                "Very interesting readings and a focus on real-world applications particularly with coding",
                "I enjoyed the theoretical discussions of the course which tied in to some of my existing coursework. However, I was hoping to learn more coding/HTML skills that would help launch a digital humanities project in the future, rather than relying on the students who already knew how to do so.",
                "Pros, cons, and other observations:\r\n+ Well constructed syllabus that provides a variety of interesting angles from which to approach the course's central topic\r\n+ Instructor eager to help students interested in further practice and/or exploration of the digital humanities\r\n~ Relatively light reading load\r\n- Relatively little class engagement in seminar discussion\r\n- Course feels pulled between discussion of the theoretical implications of DH and more practical training in skills helpful in its practice"

                "A useful course for students with a background in literary criticism interested in utilizing the digital humanities in a future academic career. Somewhat less so for students without that background or future interests outside of the academy."
