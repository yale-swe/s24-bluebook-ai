    "My writing improved vastly through the opportunity to workshop pieces every week, plus write 3x a week. The place-based assignment were helpful as exercises in both writing and seeing.",
    "We worked a lot in this course on connecting readings to place and then using that link to extend our own practice of writing about place. We had weekly creative writing assignments and in-class workshops."

   "comments": [
    "The assignments were fun and very self-directed, which was great, and the workshop really helpful. The readings were great too but I think could've been better used - we didn't really talk about them thoroughly, which is fine because there wasn't necessarily time, but maybe having a student present the reading each week could've facilitated\/guided the conversations a little more, and ensured that people were really engaging with the texts.",
    "This course was good because it adapted with the class itself. Our class size was small and thus Professor Zarin worked with us, it felt like a personalized tutorial."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course, or its equivalent, to anybody interested in writing consistently and getting consistent feedback. It's a class that's all about observing, then producing an extensive body of writing samples - the emphasis wasn't on revision, but rather on writing, getting feedback, then writing some more.",
    "Definitely! Professor Zarin is amazing, and it was a pleasure and privilege to learn from her! She gave attentive and helpful feedback on my writing and editing.",
    "Yes! It was an amazing part of my study abroad experience."
