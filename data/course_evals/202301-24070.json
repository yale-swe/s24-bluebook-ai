                "Ive learned how to read difficult texts, how to discuss better, and write better.",
                "I learned to more closely read the intents of political philosophers because sometimes what they plainly say is not what they are trying to communicate. Blatant logical contradictions or rhetorical signals may be aimed at communicating a hidden message or may meant to be understood as unreasonable in the long-run.",
                "In this course I think I learned to actually read well for the first time. Many times in class we would pause and spend a lot of time on a small passage in either Aristotle or Kant. This helped my understanding immensely. I also came away from this course with a pretty good working knowledge of Aristotle.",
                "Learned how to read Aristotle's writings (the Ethics and the Politics) and how to digest Kant (various political writings and the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals)."

                "This course is simply amazing. We get caught up in such discussions every class that we were forced to adapt up the syllabus a couple of times. The professor is truly inspiring and the reason the class is so great.",
                "Strengths: we read very interesting texts and our discussions were focused on the texts rather than our surface level opinions.",
                "Everyone was engaged and cared about the course (which is actually pretty rare in Yale courses). The course was overall very good. There were only one or two days where Kant got a little dry, but even then I think both Dan and everyone else in the course made Kant as not-dry as possible!",
                "This is a wonderful philosophy class. Strengths: depths of readings and discussions. Weaknesses: Seminars can get slightly off topic."

                "This course has value that stems beyond fulfilling a requirement. It builds upon questions of our morality, judgment, and what it means to live a good (and moral) life. I think anyone would benefit from taking this course unless they are a weak writer or do not want to put in the work of understanding difficult texts.",
                "Yes! To any student who would like to learn about Aristotle and Kant.",
                "Yes. If a student wanted to learn how to read and think about political philosophy ancient or modern, this class, or rather, this professor, is great for that. If the student went to office hours to discuss his papers and lingering questions as well, he would learn a lot about how to read the texts.",
                "Yes, take this course. I think you'll learn to write and read much better in a course like this than in an intro English course or something like that. Also, Aristotle is so strikingly right about so many things that reading him is a very intellectually enriching experience.",
                "I highly recommend this philosophy class if you want to take a deep dive into either of these two crucial thinkers in human history. And even if you don't personally like them all that much, you should give both Aristotle and Kant a fighting chance. Professor Schillinger knows what he's talking about, even though it's obvious he favors Aristotle, and it's an absolute delight working through these thinkers with him and the rest of the class. I came out of the class with a new perspective on both Kant and Aristotle and new friends."
