    "I have become more critical of Science and am better at making historical arguments.",
    "I   learned a lot about the european history of climate science, and also learned how to look critically at a professor's choices.",
    "This class sought to teach us how to think and research outside of the standard historical narrative, but I found that traditional and Western writing and thinking processes were actually enforced by the course, and I was frustrated by the lack of complex thinking that I encountered.",
    "I learned so much about historical climate knowledge! There's way more to climate knowledge than computer models and the \"standard\" narrative of who discovered climate change, and this class is basically a crash course in that.",
    "Learned about climate knowledge production in European countries. And learned that there is a lot of work to be done to highlight subaltern\/marginalized\/overlooked voices in this narrative of knowledge \"production\" (read: theft).",
    "Engaged critically with the process of knowledge production throughout history.",
    "In this course, I learned about the history of climate science and how alienating the science has become.",
    "I learned to be a lot more skeptical about science as this always ethical force. Looking through history, many expeditions and museum collections meant exploitation of indigenous people. I also learned how to better use Yale's resources such as the Peabody and library collections in order to create new knowledge. I also gained a lot more appreciation for the climate and weather data we have now and the sacrifices that had to be made to get to where we are now.",
    "I developed knowledge of the making of knowledge about the climate and about how perspectives on climate have changed over time.",
    "From this course I gains skills towards engaging with, discussing and evaluating historical, legal, scientific and other readings regarding the history of climatology. I gained extensive knowledge about how climate history became a study and the various methods of knowledge-making pithing the field.",
    "I learned about how people have known about their climate from the 1500s on, with a heavy focus on European and American knowledge"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was Prof Coen's first time teaching at Yale I think, so it was quite unorganized for a while. There's no final or midterm, which I think would have forced students to be more engaged than they were.",
    "The course had some really interesting concepts, but it was definitely disorganized at times. We ended up a full lecture behind at one point and had to rearrange assignments much of the time. I think that comes with a new course though, so I feel as though the class will be very successful in coming years.",
    "It could be greatly improved if it actually lived up to the syllabus, rather than being an entire course about white science and then having maybe two lectures about indigenous knowledge.",
    "This course seemed to claim that it would explore non-traditional narratives of climate change, but I felt that we really only explored the standard narrative and ideas adjacent to the standard narrative. I believe that this course could be greatly improved by exploring ideas of climate outside of Europe, North America, and colonial contexts. I also believe that the paper assignments could be improved with more detailed prompts and perhaps even examples, as the prompts felt a bit vague and difficult to decipher to me.",
    "I believe that this is the first year the course was offered, so while this class was interesting and had its highlights (the field trips), it felt rough around the edges in terms of organization and pacing. There were SO many readings, and many times they weren't explicitly referenced or reviewed in class, and I had trouble figuring out what the main takeaways from the reading should be. (Then again I did skip a couple of the readings, especially during times when we had papers to write, so... maybe my opinion isn't worth the most.) There were many times that we weren't able to get to everything planned to in lecture, and things like quizzes and paper deadlines would get pushed back. The pacing of the writing assignments was odd. I felt like there was too much time between our 1st and 2nd assignment, but not a lot of time between our 2nd and 3rd assignment, especially if you were taking the course for a writing credit. The syllabus said we would originally turn in an outline, then a rough draft, then a final draft, but we only ended up turning in a rough and final draft (no outline). Also we received the final assignment instructions during (or maybe right before?) Thanksgiving Break, which I thought was rude... we're on break... I'm kidding, but I do think the final paper should have been assigned WAY earlier. Overall this was a ridiculously chill WR credit though, to the point where I wondered if that was actually allowed by Yale College guidelines. (but um... you didn't hear that from me... I'm not complaining)  I also think this class would benefit from extra time. We only had two 50 minute lectures a week, which was not enough time to get through the ambitious syllabus our professor seemed to want. Either extending this to two 1 hr 15 minute lectures a week or cutting down on the syllabus would be helpful. Lastly I think section was vastly underutilized, as most of the times we just went over lecture content and didn't get a lot of opportunities for true discussion, which I personally would have liked a lot more. \r\n\r\nI know I just listed a ton of complaints about the class, but I do have to again emphasize that I overall thought this class and course material was really interesting and I liked the class! I just think it's rough around the edges right now.\r\n\r\nMy favorite thing about this class was BY FAR the field trips. I love it when a class gives you an opportunity to explore Yale and go to places I otherwise might not have. This class introduced me to the Yale Farm and Yale Peabody Museum, both of which I loved so much that I went back on my own afterwards!!",
    "Strengths: Professor Coen cares and her syllabus shows it. She is very receptive to feedback and not at all like other faculty I've met at Yale (in the best way).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures were a bit confusing and did not align with the syllabus. Maybe a seminar would be more appropriate for this content",
    "It was sometimes unclear what the professors and teaching fellows wanted us to take away from the course (especially the readings), which made quizzes difficult. Overall, though,  the course was really interesting.",
    "Strengths: interesting guest lecturers, interesting trips\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very eurocentric even though stresses the importance of common ecological knowledge- there's a real mismatch between what the class aims to teach and what it actually does. It very superficially addresses the importance of indigenous epistemologies",
    "Strengths: Covers topics that are traditionally underexplored and is really at the forefront of a budding field. The essays were really enjoyable and asked us to think outside the box. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is taught as a history course but is tested as a STEM course. The quizzes were extremely demanding and required definitions that were far more specific than those offered in class. The level of detail required in the quizzes does not show whether one is understanding big ideas, rather it is testing pesky details that are unimportant. I found myself successfully cramming myself full of random names and terms to do well on the quizz and then completely forgetting them only a few weeks later. There were simply way too many names and terms--it felt almost like having a midterm every two weeks.",
    "Focused too much on Europeans, neglecting climate knowledge in Asia, Africa, and South America almost entirely, and only spending a little time on indigenous knowledge that shouldve been central",
    "The strengths of the course were fascinating texts and gaining a comprehensive view of the subject, one which Professor Coen was very good at connecting with the present. Acknowledging holes in the knowledge-making process throughout history was another strength of the course. Speakers and museum visits which were part of the course added to our understanding of the material and were fascinating.\r\nThough Professor Coen's lectures were generally very good, sometimes they were difficult to follow and not very engaging.",
    "The strengths of this course are the unique assignments and the emphasis on earlier ways of making knowledge (before predictive modeling) and acknowledgement of the importance of indigenous knowledge. Weaknesses were the vagueness of the writing prompts (though I think this will improve, as this was the first year of the class and now there will be examples), limited notes and information on slides, making it difficult to deduce what was important to include in term IDs on quizzes, and repetitiveness\/dryness of readings. Additionally, while the importance of indigenous knowledge is stressed often, we didn't learn much about what that knowledge included and represented and how it was made until the very end of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, low workload and content is interesting.  Lectures were a bit disorganized for a while, but they got better over the semester",
    "I  could definitely see people being interested in this course material, but the way that it is currently framed in the syllabus feels like a completely separate course from what I   was offered. I'm honestly not sure that I   would recommend it as it stands, unless you want an easy work load for a writing credit.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course to another student because I found it difficult to structure my learning and I was disappointed by the limited scope of information we covered.",
    "Yes, it gave me a new perspective on climate knowledge and science in general, which I think was valuable.",
    "Yes! On the condition that it changes to be more inclusive of non-Western narratives (in a holistic way) and with the goal of actually putting in the work to decolonize the narrative, working with Prof Coen. It can and MUST be done! Calling all critical and thoughtful students.",
    "I would recommend this course only if one is super interested in the history of climate knowledge as the material can be super dry.",
    "No -- While I think the material is fascinating and the lectures engageing, this class is deceptively demanding. The quizzes don't just check if you've been paying attention in class and doing the readings, they are testing pretty esoteric pieces of information from lectures and readings. I feel bad writing this because Coen is seriously a brilliant and kind professor, but this class isn't organized enough to be as demanding as it is. Unless you have the time and are very interested in the topic, there are easier ways to complete HSHM\/HIST credits. That said, I'm sure the prof realizes this and the class could be great in coming years.",
    "I would recommend this to someone with interest in climate or history.",
    "A great writing credit if you don't like to write, as it is the same number of writing assignments for WR\/non WR, you just get more feedback and write an additional draft for WR. I think a lot of the issues with organization, vagueness in assignments, etc this year will be much better now that some of the kinks have been worked out in its first iteration."
