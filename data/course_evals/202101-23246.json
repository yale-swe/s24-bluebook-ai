                "it's your standard 300-level cs course. very useful and applicable to a lot of things you build.",
                "Strengths - material is super relevant to industry and feels immensely practical. Weaknesses - Professor Barron can be extremely disorganized which leads to assignments being pushed back and then bottling up at the end of the semester",
                "Genuinely fun homeworks, engaging lectures, great support staff. Not sure how this course could be improved.",
                "There are many weaknesses  teaching staff was poor and OH were almost never helpful, the professor is terrible at lecturing. Fortunately, the homeworks are doable and the tests are not very hard.",
                "I think the course goes over incredibly useful knowledge; I can easily see how these concepts apply in the real world. I think the main drawback of the course was the online format; it made it very difficult to engage fully with the class. I think it could have been helpful to have more guidance when it came to specifics of the psets.",
                "Strengths - great class if your goal is to get proficient at python and learn some OOP concepts along the way\r\nWeaknesses - Organization could have been much better - when Tim says an assignment\/quiz will be out \"later today,\" that typically means sometime in the next few days. Some of the assignments seem to be focused on trying to figure out what the autograder will accept, as opposed to really understanding concepts. HW specifications could have been more clear (I'm thinking of the assignment 2? that involved a GUI and database, where a lot of edge-case behavior had to be clarified later)",
                "Strengths: Valuable knowledge for interviews, made me a better programmer in general\r\nWeaknesses: The workload of the course is very tail heavy. The last two psets are more work than all of the previous ones. It is also pretty difficult to pay attention in lecture with all of the raw code we go through.",
                "assignments are strengths - enjoyed the last two psets even though they were the hardest",
                "The strengths are definitely the psets, the weekly quizzes, and the lectures. The psets do a really great job of reinforcing the material learned in lecture. Fore example, when implementing checkers, we knew that we would be building off it for chess so I was extremely motivated to utilize the design patterns discussed in order to ensure an easier chess assignment. The weekly quizzes do a great job of keeping students up to date with lectures. If they hadn't been there, I'm afraid I would have definitely gotten behind on lectures and the quizzes force you to keep up which is great! Lastly, the lectures are extremely clear and always motivated by actual code examples to reinforce the material right after a general discussion of the topics. It's difficult to come up with many weaknesses. Perhaps having one more assignment may have been nice on concurrency but other than that this course was fantastic.",
                "The lectures are easy to follow, the slides are concise with all the most important information, and the assignments greatly help me solidify the different design patterns we learn in class.",
                "I felt like the last two Psets were a bit rushed in. If possible, spreading out the Psets more would make it a lot less stressful and easier to handle for students.",
                "Professor Barron was (a) great lecturer, (b) very helpful and listened to students and was understanding, and (c) wise in teaching the class in a non-C language. I think that is everything one can hope for in a CS class, and I am super glad to have taken it. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness, as other reviews in past semester have said, is that the class is LOTS of work in the last three weeks of the semester, but manageable otherwise, so make sure to plan accordingly.",
                "The lectures were very thorough and the examples were helpful. Sometimes I felt like the code examples were so confusing",
                "strengths: you learn industry skills (that you could probably learn from a book), psets are kinda fun\r\nweaknesses: Tim Barron is a disorganized lecturer who is not attentive to his students, the psets are not designed to implement what is being taught in class, so content covered in lecture goes in through one ear and out the other",
                "strengths: reasonable and enjoyable psets, Barron organizes his teaching in a logical manner. He is helpful in office hours. I appreciated that we were allowed to code in partnerships for the last two psets. \r\nweaknesses: sometimes Barron goes just a little fast. Also the workload of the class became significantly heavier in the weeks leading up to and including reading period--I would've preferred more of that work be assigned in the pretty light first couple months of the year. Personally, wouldn't recommend adding the sqlite stuff next year, unless the TAs are more familiar with it",
                "Course material is good but the professors organization and teaching was not great",
                "Spread out the homework assignments more, so that the harder ones (in my opinion, HW2 and HW4, have more weeks to complete them). \r\nUse a queue system (like CS201 or CS223) for office hours.",
                "The strength of this course is the practicality of the subject. You learn very important concepts that are used in many software engineering settings, such as unit testing, asynchronous functions, and object-oriented design problems. Seeing live coding examples and working through them through lectures was also incredibly helpful. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were the weekly quizzes. While they seem like a good idea, the questions selected were kind of random and didn't really serve as a good evaluation of what was taught in the corresponding lecture. As a result, they ended up being annoying to complete. Another weakness was the pacing of the course. I felt like the beginning of the course went by extremely slowly, and we were given way too much time for some of the assignments and to learn some of the concepts. This made the end of the course feel super rushed, and the workload on the assignments ramped up suddenly."

                "This course is phenomenal. The material is extremely relevant to anyone who wants to go into software development. All of the technical interviews I have had have always involved object-oriented programming, so this course was a game changer in my understanding of those concepts (and helped me landed my first internship). Also, you get to learn Python which is just awesome. The assignments are really interesting: you create a bank application (and build a graphical user interface for it), you write test-cases for the German enigma machine, and you code checkers and chess, which are all really interesting",
                "Definitely worth taking. A pleasant challenge but not overly difficult, and very valuable content.",
                "Sure  the actual material covered in the textbook is quite useful and is very good to know for industry. If Tim is teaching this course, I'd recommend leaning mostly on the textbook and less on the lectures.",
                "I might recommend this course to someone if it were not online.",
                "Probably one of the easiest CS electives you can take, which makes sense as it recently got downgraded from a 400\/500 level course to a 200 level course - with the large amount of extra credit offered at the end of the semester, getting a good grade is not hard as long as you put some effort (if that is what you are looking for)",
                "Yes! Assignments and exams are really not bad at all, and the psets are project-like which is a really nice change from other CPSC classes I've taken. The class is taught fairly and the lectures are actually very helpful. The only downside is that we had a quiz after every lecture, though they got easier \/ more straightforward as the course progressed.",
                "I would recommend this course because OOP concepts are pretty important for work in industry. However, the psets are pretty poorly structured, and the workload will ramp up significantly over the course of the semester. The quizzes after every lecture were also quite tedious and didn't really do much for my learning.",

Even if you aren't doing any programming in the future, if you have the necessary background and are looking for a fun class with fun assignments I would recommend this course. This course did not count for my major but I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and could not recommend it more to anyone remotely interested!",

                "Yeah definitely. I'm at a point where I will only consider courses in CS taught in non-C languages and this was perfection.",
                "Yes interesting class, but second and third psets seemed to do less with OOP but I did think learning about the enigma machine was super cool",
                "No: The only reason you should take this class is if you're running out of CS credits and you need a gut to pad your other electives. You will not be excited or fulfilled by this course like you will other electives. I took this class because I wanted to get ahead in my credits, and I kind of regret wasting a credit on this class. Yes, you do learn industry skills...or you can read a book or watch some youtube videos to learn the same thing. Tim Barron made comments that made students feel uncomfortable asking questions and his lecture style is disorganized and only appeals to a portion of a type of learners. He may be a fantastic programmer, but that does not mean he is fit to teach students. His personal interactions with students were generally discouraging and the way he conducted the class was as well. The Fall 2020 reviews said this class was a gut and only depended on public test cases, and instead of adding more sophisticated private test cases, he just removed the public test cases. It took students forever to figure out how to read and use the auto grader because the class was purposefully opaque. He then padded the psets with extra credit to compensate for his management of the course in the beginning (I appreciated the EC but I would rather have better psets throughout). The quizzes for lectures were fine, I guess, but were annoying and motivated me to not really watch lecture (just to look out for the answers). The exams were designed for us to fail: in the first exam, Tim included a question that he knew we would get wrong. In the second exam, it was mostly on C++ even though we only have 2 lectures on it and were never asked to code in it until the final. Learn OOP another time and use your time better than I did.",
