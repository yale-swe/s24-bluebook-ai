   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lab manuals were well written and the experiments were interesting in theory.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Experiments often deviated from the lab manuals, and we would just be following what the professor wanted us to do that day. Many experiments did not work out; it seemed that (1) we were not well trained on the basics, especially on how to troubleshoot equipment, (2) Professor Keshishian would leave halfway through the experiments which meant that we could only ask TAs for help, and the TAs were not well-trained to deal with problems, and (3) Professor Keshishian would zip through the demonstrations without slowing down and ensuring that students were caught up. The experiments also did not line up with the Neurobiology class which meant that we had to learn the materials separately. Some questions that were asked during quizzes derived answers from the class and not the lab manual. The lab was 4 hours long but often went overtime, required at least an hour of preparation, and several hours afterward to do the lab write-up and was just as much work as a full-credit class yet is only worth a half-credit.",
    "The only instructions we got for writing lab reports were \"write down what you did, and the results.\" Not very descriptive. And then we would receive our lab reports back with points off for not being \"detailed enough.\"",
    "Less time explaining the experiment, more time doing",
    "The lab manual for this class is very well written and the experiments are very interesting on paper. However, the reality of performing the experiments is quite different. I felt like I spent most of my time getting the equipment set up properly--often I would spent all of the lab time trying to get my equipment working and would collect no data of my own. This was incredibly frustrating, and unnecessarily so.  While I recognize the instructional value in students setting up their own experiment, guidance should be available that makes this process feasible. The manual explained how to do things at a fairly detailed level, but there was no dedicated troubleshooting section for us to refer to when trying to figure out why we weren't getting a reading from an instrument. Additionally, the teaching staff was either not fully present or not experienced enough to help us get things working properly. If either or both of these things were fixed, the class would be much improved because students would have more time to actually perform the experiments."

    "Experiments were very cool in theory, but I would not recommend this course to another student. Almost none of the experiments actually worked out and a lot of times, students were not able to get through all of the protocol simply because the equipment was not working properly.",
    "If you want to be frustrated for approximately 4 straight hours but then feel an overwhelming sense of pride and awe IF the experiment actually works, then sure, take the class.",
    "Yes",
    "No. This class was the most agonizing 5 hours of my week. While the lack of lab reports and exams seems appealing, you'll be happier taking a \"harder\" biology lab. For 80% of the experiments, if the equipment were to operate properly the data collection would take 15 minutes. However, because the students (or at least myself) have no experience using oscilloscopes, inserting electrodes into muscle fibers, fixing issues with our experimental setups is really a matter of twisting a knob and hoping for the best. This inexperience wouldn't be an issue if there was always an expert in the room to advise us. However, Professor Keshishian is rarely present for the entirety of the lab, and neither of the TAs are electrophysiologists (which is an issue because most of the experiments involve measuring electrical potential) and so are not terribly effective at getting things working properly either. I was in the first section of the week, and it felt like the instructors were using this time to figure out the experiment, so if you do take this course, I would suggest taking it later in the week so the teaching staff is better equipped to help you."
