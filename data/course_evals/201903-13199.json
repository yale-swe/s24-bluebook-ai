    "Good overview into the application of Economics to the management of the environment",
    "Climate change",

    "how capitalism justifies horrible policy practices!",
    "nonren\/ren resources, mb=mc at ideal level of abatement, climate issues for the future",
    "Economics natural resources",
    "Some skills in excel, understanding of the economic concepts applied to the allocation and management of resources, inefficiencies in our current management strategy, overview of climate policy",
    "This class teaches you a lot about climate change and how economics affects other natural resources. If this is something youre interested in then this is a great class!",
    "Pollution, non renewable resources, climate change.",
    "Nothing really but got introduced to some somewhat interesting environmental econ topics such as stock pollutants, fisheries, forestry, etc.",
    "I learned about the effects of pollution, how to mitigate it efficiently through cost-benefit analysis, and then how to value environmental resources for regulation purposes. I learned how to discount prices using the exponential function and model trends in pollution using mathematical models.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental economics and climate change.",
    "Lots of knowledge on environmental issues and economic approaches to solving these in efficient manner",
    "I learned to think in terms of benefits and costs of environmental policies. I think it's really important to situate environmental problems and their economic context."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures are more about theory and the psets are about mathematical applications of the theory that you don't talk about in class. You learn the math in a weekly, 50 minute mandatory section which is actually pretty helpful. Because the psets have nothing to do with the theory, it's sometimes hard to be motivated to pay attention\/go to class. You do need the more theoretical components on the midterm and final, but studying the slides beforehand is sufficient. Attendance in class is pretty low.",
    "Professor Mendelsohn is the economist that we need, but dont deserve. His class was a great overview of the economics of natural resources and their roles in sustainability. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience in researching climate change and the associated cost that should be of great interest to everyone as a resident of the Earth.",
    "The course covers important topics that intersect in a variety of relevant ways. However, the structure, pace, and cohesiveness of the course is not very clear and seems a bit sporadic and not connected.",
    "We didn't really go deep into any of the topics we covered. I would have preferred to cover fewer topics in greater depth or even the same number of topics in greater depth  i.e. talk about what the current literature is saying on these questions of environmental management.",
    "Professor was very confusing and unclear. seemed outdated",
    "Strengths are the easiness of the class. Weaknesses are the boring lectures and monotonous professor.",
    "weakness: the homework has very little to do with lecture. if you don't have a good TF, you're pretty much on your own. lecture is fine. exams are fair.",
    "strength- TA's (specifically Austin) are really helpful. Honestly, they should be the one's teaching the class.\r\nweaknesses- professor is not engaging, no point of going to lecture\r\nimproved- please give some sort of review questions so we can know what to expect for exams (it was honestly the most random final I've taken at Yale)",
    "Good TAs",
    "Good TAs, friendly professor.  He could have added less filler\/narrative in the lecture slides",
    "Weaknesses: Should cover more practice problems in class, as a result of not doing so, psets felt like we had to learn on the spot. Sometimes lectures felt like they went on just for the sake of filling up time, nothing wrong with ending lecture early if there is nothing else to cover, and some of the graphs on the slides were very sloppy and hard to understand. Perhaps using a different program to create the graphs? Would have been really nice to have practice exams as well - was hard to tell what type of things could be on exam\r\n\r\nStrengths: Great TAs that cared a lot about the students (hosting review sessions, very responsive to emails, open to questions), Clear and easy to follow lectures, professor open to answering questions, clearly structured curriculum, and very fair exams",
    "The TAs were really nice and the lectures were very clear! It could be a bit boring sometimes",
    "Strengths: It's a really low workload course. But I think you already know that if you're taking this course. You will most definitely have a very stress free time because the professor and TAs are really nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You probably won't get anything out of this course. If you are really interested in environmental economics, this course is too shallow and is insufficient to actually addressing any environmental problems.",
    "The strengths of this course was the TF sections. The weakness was the connection between the psets and the lecture material. We only get tested on the qualitative parts of the material on exams, and the quantitive on sets. Maybe find a way to incorporate both into future sets?",
    "The course was great.",
    "The course was interesting but I felt that the material we learned in lecture did not match the material on the problem sets. As a non Econ major, I never felt adequately prepared to complete the problem sets. The lectures focused much more heavily on environmental topics and the Professor seemed to assume we would know how to do the Econ.",
    "Strengths - Mendeslohn\r\nWeaknesses - lack of guidance about grades, etc",
    "One of the sections was far superior to the others, as the TFs graded and taught very differently.",
    "The teaching sessions were very helpful and the lectures also gave us an overview of important consideration when it comes to choosing the right policies to address environmental problems such as cap and trade, carbon pricing etc.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that we did not explore the readings at all although they were assigned. It would have been better to suggest articles that could give us an insight on how the policies we learned in class are being effected in the real world"

    "If you need an easier economics credit, then this is a good course to take. It's interesting if you pay attention, but you don't have to in order to succeed in the course. The professor is very smart and clearly passionate about the material, but the lectures can sometimes feel repetitive. The TAs are fabulous and are very helpful, so it's a good, easy econ elective.",
    "Professor Mendelsohn is the economist that we need, but dont deserve. His class was a great overview of the economics of natural resources and their roles in sustainability. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience in researching climate change and the associated cost that should be of great interest to everyone.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although the topic is super interesting, the manner in which the class is taught is boring and not engaging. If I could go back to the start of this semester, I would tell myself to take a different class that I would be more passionate about.",
    "It was ok. Honestly did not learn that much which didn't leave me with the best feeling.",
    "Yes, but only if Austin Is the TA, if not, course will suck.",
    "Yes, if you want an easy econ distributional, or even for non-econ majors, just an easy class in general. It is nice to understand how economists think about natural resources and their thoughts about the most efficient way to extract\/harvest them, especially in relation to how they are actually harvested.",
    "if you need the QR, grin and bear it.",
    "it depends, psets are a pain but the tas really do come clutch and provide you with 'hints'\/answers. the class itself is interesting but the prof makes it incredibly boring. i wouldnt take it again",
    "No! Its terribly organized for learning. The professor is honestly good at the content but not much else. Gets boring after a bit and all the athletes have the answers to the exams already.",
    "Yes . Interesting chill course if you know micro",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, interesting easy econ elective",
    "Yes, it taught me a lot of concepts and gave me a stronger economic intuition. The course material is becoming increasingly relevant and Prof. Mendelsohn is a fantastic person to learn from.",
    "If this is a topic youre interested in and looking for a low workload econ credit, then yes!",
    "There is no work. The psets take 30 minutes a week. Mostly depends on the TA too.",
    "This class is for biology-minded students who want to learn about the gastrointestinal system without going through the Bio sequence or taking Anatomy 101. AKA it's a gut. \r\n\r\nAs a gut, it's the lowest workload class I have ever taken at Yale, and it's honestly kind of embarrassing. I never spent more than 1 hour on any pset, and for most of the psets, I spent less than 15 minutes. I'm also not some really intelligent econ god or anything -- the ENTIRE pset is done by the TAs in section with slightly changed numbers. And by slightly changed I mean like the pset problem has what is x + 4 and the TA does x + 5. \r\n\r\nThe downside of the course is that it's so easy and generally not useful. It's too shallow to go into any depth and the concepts are the most basic concepts from intro Econ. The annoying thing is that because the course is so easy, you might not get an A if you do subpar on the midterm :(, even if you do really well on the final. Feelsbadman.\r\n\r\nBut it's a great 5th, or even 6th course.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student looking for an Economics elective, that isn't strenuous in terms of the psets and exams, but still challenge you to think about the environment economically.",
    "Absolutely. Great class. Learned a lot. Not too challenging if you put in the work.",
    "Yes, if youre interested in economics and in environmental issues",
    "yes",
    "Yes because it's a great way to understand why complete abatement is not done in the present for instance or why environmental legislation is complicated from an economic point of view"
