   "comments": [
    "Strengths - good support for psets and tests with peer tutors \r\nWeaknesses - class work not at all related to midterms and psets. Problems and concepts In class are far easier than what was given in the psets. Far too much focus on pointless proofs that were not that applicable to real problems",
    "Be sure to advertise how critical the office hours are to a students understanding of a course.",
    "My strengths were derivatives and integrals and my weaknesses were applying material to the tests. I fully understood how to do every topic but the tests were very different than the problems I studied so I couldnt apply my knowledge. I can improve by seeing someone to help me with that.",
    "My professor was absolutely horrible. I had Elad Zelinger and he could not teach. I have taken Calculus multiple years in a row but I struggled with this class. He failed to prepare us for the test material. I later found out that other students had professors who who help them prepare for the tests and help them how to take the tests. Elad just spoke to the board and never turned around.",
    "I love that there are peer tutoring hours very regularly (all of the peer tutors were fantastic!). I also think the concepts are pretty well organized. I wish there was more standardization between the sections (worksheets or something) to help make sure every section is on about the same page. The problem sets were very useful but definitely irregular in terms of length and difficulty. The best review session in my opinion was the one by Yakir Forman with a power point and an outline of the sections, vocab, and basic problems. The other review sessions were much less helpful but still generally helpful. The textbook was also kind of a waste of money. The ximeras were pretty good for outlining concepts, but a few of them (especially the first integral ones) were way more difficult-- I think the ximeras should be aligned to the class day as best as possible. Also, the ximeras need to be checked much more thoroughly as almost every one had a mistake."

    "Yes, intro maths class",
    "Yes because it teaches you the basic skills needed for future math classes",
    "Its a prerequisite for many things. However, I took this course just because I could, I coud have skipped it, Therefore, I will tell anyone who has the option to skip it.",
    "I am not quite sure. I did like the material and I really liked working through the problem sets with the peer tutors, but the actual classes were not all that helpful. I think overall more collaboration between the instructors, peer tutors, and the problem sets\/exams would be helpful."
