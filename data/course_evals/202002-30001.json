    "This was an incredibly enriching and transformative course. I gained significant knowledge of plantation logics, ghetto formation, and prison abolitionism. The complex theoretical texts assigned pushed my critical thinking skills and opened my mind to new ways of thinking.",
    "So much  broadly, we covered the evolution of systems of white supremacy in the U.S. from slavery to the present day. Doing the readings and participating in class discussion helped me develop a vocabulary to talk about race, capitalism, and imperialism and think critically about the structures in our society that support the continued existence of a racial caste system.",
    "I learned how to critically consume materials about race and racism in our country. I learned to digest multiple mediums including writing, art, podcasts, and videos.",
    "Exposure to a series of great readings which gave me the vocabulary to start to talk about the discursive spaces of the plantation, prison, and ghetto."

   "comments": [
    "It was an amazing course; I can't think of a critique beyond that I wish it were longer.",
    "There was a lot of reading, but for a condensed summer session course, it was honestly a very reasonable amount and none of it seemed superfluous, so I'd really count that as a strength. Another strength was my classmates, who were all very engaged and shaped some great discussions and, of course, AC himself, who was\/is a great facilitator of critical thinking and productive discourse about challenging topics. He restructured the course so that we had three short assignments and a \"commonplace book\" in place of a final paper, which was basically a living document containing our thoughts about the class readings, relevant pieces of media we'd encountered on our own, and social justice actions we'd taken outside of class. I thought this format was super helpful for encouraging meaningful engagement with the course materials and topics  it was sort of low pressure and unstructured enough to give us creative liberty, but still intense in that it demanded consistent work and practical application of what we were learning about.",
    "As with all courses on Zoom, this class sometimes struggles with conversation flow because its hard to signal when people can talk. Prof. Caricos use of breakout rooms and timed contributions was helpful and could be used even more.",
    "Strengths were excellent readings and an obviously very thoughtful and very engaged professor. Few weaknesses that I can think of."

    "Yes  these are the most important issues of our generation and everyone should take a class like this or this class.",
    "Absolutely. Should be required reading and thinking for anyone living in or inhabiting the space that we call America."
