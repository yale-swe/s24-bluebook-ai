                "comprehensive overview of various areas of international cooperation, mechanisms and organizations that help resolve cooperation problems",
                "I had never taken a political science class before, so this course taught me both the basics (some game theory, basic economic concepts, cooperation problems) and more complex ideas about how the international system works/should work. I also learned a good amount of 20th- and 21st- century history through the case studies.",

The latter parts of the course build upon this foundation by going more in-depth in particular areas like health or international law.",
                "I developed insights into the inner workings of international organizations and the complex \"science\" of ascertaining the likelihood and needfulness of cooperation in a given situation. This was very helpful for evolving my mindset around international development and interactions."

            "comments": [
                "This class probably needed section. We didn't engage enough with the readings we were assigned because there was no space to do that.",
                "Strengths: the professor is very knowledgeable about the content and is always happy to meet with students. \r\nWeakness: I can't think of one.",
                "Lecture can get boring and feel like its just reading off the slides",
                "Strengths: Not a huge time commitment outside of class, but you still learn a good deal. Professor Pratt is a great lecturer, and the second half of the semester readings are quite interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Class grade is based on only a few assignments, and the first half of the semester's readings can feel a little more boring (they're more theoretical).",
                "I enjoy the longer lecture format without section. We're able to digest and break down more material .",
                "Strengths: engaging prof, low workload (just readings), straightforward exams\r\nWeakness: only lecture so low interaction, no assignments other than final policy memo and exams so unsure about learning progress",
                "Strengths: class is very well structure, easy to follow, intellectually engaging, classes build off each other, excellent combination of interesting anecdotes and foundational information\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is so much content that no matter how much you study -- it can be difficult to memorize everything for the exam",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, not a high work load, interesting content; Weaknesses: whole course felt very \"distant\" -- probably one of the few instances where I would not have minded a discussion section",
                "Strength: the Professor is extremely engaging and has the best way at explaining things. He is such an awesome and relatable person. Although the class was a 9 a.m. it was so fun and I never wanted to miss lecture. \r\nWeakness: the class is very long. It would be better to maybe go back to the 50 minute lecture classes with a discussion section.",
                "There is a large emphasis on current events and making sure the class material is topical, which is much appreciated.  It is also very well structured.  Not many complaints.",
                "Lectures were all very well-structured and the syllabus was effective in building a foundation on international cooperation as a concept and then building on it with applications of various international issues of cooperation.\r\nI think a more reduced, compact required reading would have been more effective in reinforcing the material.",
                "It would have been nice to get the list of exam topics a little earlier before the midterm and final. A lot of material was covered in the readings and I wasn't sure how much of it I would need to know (in addition to the material covered in class) for the exams until about a week before. I liked the structure of the class; I thought it was organized very well to build upon ideas that had already been introduced. I also liked the mixture of theoretical and historical/current events reading. I do think the class could have been helped by having discussion sections. I didn't know anyone else taking it and I felt kind of alone in studying, but this could also be my fault for not reaching out to people (I'm a first year so I was a little intimidated).",
                "The lectures were engaging and it was helpful that they were online after class. It is intimidating to participate in a 50+ person lecture hall, so maybe more outlets for participation, but I'm not sure how that would be accomplished.",
                "I really like the structural organization of the course and the way we do first half theory, second-half focus on issues. Also, Tyler Pratt is a really good instructor, he explains things really clearly and can communicate his fundamental intuition well. The weakness was just that it was a 9am LOL",
                "This course was very interesting and Professor Pratt is a great lecturer. The workload overall is not too bad, but the readings can be very dense and a lot on some days.",
                "Strengths: \r\nVery logical progression, easy to follow, relevant to current events\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNot at 9am!",
                "The organization of this course was fantastic, with the first half of the course building up a definition of international cooperation and very theoretical concepts. The second half of the course focused on applying the concepts from the first half to real-world case studies, which were very interesting and relevant. Each class also began with a discussion of current events. The exams were also incredibly fair, with basic fact recall from lectures.",
                "The format of the slides for the lectures was great and made taking notes in class really easy. The overall structure also ensures students get the most out of every example by providing a theoretical basis first and then moving into the real world."

This class is topical, engaging, well structure, and provides you with a useful understanding of how states interact with each other in the international system and the structures that support them.",

                "This was a useful introductory course, and if the student knew they wouldn't have time in their personal life to pursue information about global affairs (as I did), I would recommend this course to ge them started."
