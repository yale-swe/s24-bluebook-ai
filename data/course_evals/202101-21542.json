                "I think this goes for every math class but when there's dead silence it means no one understood what just happened. I know it's really easy to get excited and go off about a topic but a lot of the detailed understanding actually came from OH. That being said I think Caglar has been by far the best math instructor I have had because he (to some degree) understood that.",
                "The course is very straightforward and expectations were clear from the beginning. We had a problem set every week and the due dates were flexible depending on what we learned each week which was helpful. There were plenty of office hours every week and they were all very helpful. Lectures were also very clear and concise with plenty of examples that helped with understanding the material. Caglar was eager to answer any questions and was engaging during lecture.",
                "Strengths: Very organized, appropriately paced, and easy-to-follow\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of assignments were pure calculations and it would have been nice to put these in context (like how it could be applied in the real world)",
                "I think the course was very close to ideal as Caglar managed to teach it. A big strength was that the TA would walk us through the pset answers. This meant that on one hand we were able to avoid any stress associated with trying to solve a pset and on the other hand we were able to understand the concepts really well. Also, another big strength were the post-exam corrections. One possible improvement I could suggest is that given that the final is only worth 20% of the grade, in future semesters it could be placed during the last week of classes so that students could do corrections and raise their grade over reading and exam period. Also, I think it would be a good idea if lectures were recorded during future semesters as well. The recordings really facilitated my revisions before exams.",
                "Good coverage of content! Wouldnt change a thing",
                "The course had an amazing TA and professor which made this class more enjoyable than most math courses.",
                "I enjoyed the course and the idea of having exam corrections.",
                "This course assumes a knowledge of proof writing that is often not present, and could benefit from some concrete \"first you write this, then this, then this\" examples on that front. There are also elements that require knowledge of linear algebra concepts covered in application-based linear algebra but NOT in proof-based linear algebra, which caused some confusion for the students.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the second half of the course, while it requires knowledge of the material covered in the first half, could really be its own course. I know the introductory sequence is in the process of being restructured, and I hope that in the future the material in this course will be split across two courses. \r\n\r\nI did appreciate the time given to set theory\/topology concepts as well as a pset that reviewed necessary concepts from linear algebra, as those were both very helpful in grounding us in the new material.",
                "I thought the breakout rooms were very conducive to learning and practicing concepts.",
                "Caglar was definitely a strength of the course! Really engaging lectures and very clear explanations. Problem sets were not that hard if you paid attention in the class",
                "I thought this course was taught very well. Caglar taught at a good pace and was very clear. There were also lots of office hours which were super helpful (the peer tutor Fernando was GREAT). Sometimes the problem sets could be a bit much because we didn't really have a break after exams, but other than that I really enjoyed this course.",
                "I would have preferred if this class was more theoretical. It is definitely more theoretical than ENAS 194 or S&DS 241, but it is no where near as theoretical as MATH 225. A lot of proofs are skimmed over & the psets & exams were more computation based, at least with this prof.",

I did not find the breakout rooms during lecture especially helpful or engaging, as my fellow students weren't really interested in group work.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutor office hours on Zoom were also extremely helpful in understanding the homework.\r\n\r\nI had an extra layer of stress added during exams by the fact that there was a limited window of time allowed to submit my scanned document and that I had to remain on Zoom until I did so. This created issues as my bandwidth is severely decreased by Zoom so retrieving the photos from my phone, downloading from the cloud and uploading to Gradescope always left we with seconds to spare.",
