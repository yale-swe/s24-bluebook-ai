    "Great knowledge of how to take integrals and determine convergence\/divergence of series\/power series. Mediocre understanding of the FTC and the underlying formulas behind riemann sums.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of Calculus concepts.",
    "You'll learn more techniques for taking integrals, how to work with  sequences and series, and how to solve differential equations.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lam's section makes you learn math and not just memorize algorithms for how to solve basic types of problems",
    "Strengths: Teaches a lot of useful\/interesting concepts in math.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Poorly structured, the whole backwards classroom system is bad. It is even worse when your instructor does not make an effort to sync up with the content being taught in the videos.",
    "Strengths on the conceptual side of series and the problem solving side of integrals. Weaknesses on the conceptual side of integrals and probelm solving side of series. The single biggest weakness was the flipped classroom. I am yet to meet someone who liked the flipped classroom, it sucks!",
    "I think the strengths are the teaching of the concepts, but the weaknesses are that it is difficult to learn in the environment that I was taught in.",
    "Strengths: the preclass videos were very good for explaining the concepts so that the majority of classes could be spent doing practice problems. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unless you really like math, this class was difficult to stay engaged in.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-preclass videos\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-pace was fast",
    "This course needs much better and clearer teaching styles.",
    "There is a lot of discrepancies between the material learned in video lectures, class textbook, as well as between sections themselves. The course was somewhat disjointed, which made the material harder than it needed to be. It was hard to gauge what was expected of us due to these discrepancies.",
    "I did not like the fact that it was a flipped classroom. The textbook is very well written though.",
    "Weakness: moved at a pace too fast",
    "pro- smallish sections so you can ask questions \r\n\r\ncon- if you have a bad teacher, it will be hard to learn"

    "If you are considering a math-related field you are probably shopping this class because you have to. Don't be too put off by the reviews - it's really an okay class. If you are good at math and put in a medium amount of work you will do fine, and some of the Taylor series material is pretty interesting.",
    "Take it if you must. It's not really a good course but most people have no choice. Avoid taking it with Lam Pham if possible.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you have to progress in Math then obviously. If not, I would avoid MATH 115.",

    "Yes",
