                "Strengths: The lectures are amazing and Professor Kim is incredible. I remained super engaged throughout the course, and the assignments were very helpful in understanding the content while building something very cool. Everything in this course felt very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments aren't worth that much of your grade, but they take a long time. However, you mostly use the code from the ray tracer assignment in the final project, so it somewhat balances out.",
                "This course is fabulous, easily my favorite computer science class Ive taken. Its so cool to be able to actually use code to produce images and even an animated video at the end. The TA support for the class was also great, so I generally felt like if I was confused on a topic, there were plenty of office hours for me to ask about it, or I could ask on the Ed board. I think one area that could be improved is the lectures on rasterization and Monte Carlo integration, which I found a bit confusing.",
                "Strength: application is cool. When the code works, it's pretty satisfying\r\nWeakness: prof is rude and shows little care and sympathy with students. He also doesn't really know his stuff despite being a two-time academy winner. We'd ask questions in class or after class and he's really dodgy. The math he writes on the blackboard is often wrong (don't know why he doesn't use slides so he doesn't spend 2 minutes writing down matrices for us to copy).",
                "This course was fantastic. The lectures were very engaging and covered all the necessary material, and the book provided additional examples. The third and fourth problem sets, as well as the final project, were incredibly fun practices in what we had been learning. Despite the code being difficult, the projects were so fun and satisfying. Professor Kim is an engaging and fun lecturer and the TAs were all very helpful. \r\nI do wish that sometimes we had some more examples in class or went over a bit more of the math or it was a bit clearer how things fit into the pipeline/process. Especially early on in the class, it was difficult to see how everything fit together, especially with scanline. There was not a clear throughline of the material until maybe the fourth week. I also wish the first two psets were a bit more relevant to building the graphics tools that we needed for the final project. While fun and helpful, especially the mandelbrot stuff and the math practice, the coding portions of the two psets felt pretty unrelated to what we were learning in class. If they could be tied in a bit more, or maybe part of the third pset gets moved to the second pset for the part of scanline we already know, would make the first two psets feel a bit more connected and lessen the load of the thrid pset. However, all the psets felt very doable, we had plenty of time for them, and they were super fun and not at all a slog.\r\nI also think Professor Kim did a really good job of mentioning edge cases or clearly putting them in drawings so when I went back to my notes frequently looking closely at exactly what he drew and seeing what I did differently would reveal some issues.",
                "Professor Kim's lectures are very intuitive and his diagrams are always super helpful. It's also always fun when he shows frames/videos from movies that apply things we learned in class in action. I really enjoyed working on the programming assignments -- building things like ray tracers from scratch and seeing the images it generated felt really rewarding. The only weakness was the harsh grading on certain problems of the midterm/final exam. With only 6 problems total, the variance felt too high since getting a low score on one of those problems translated to a difference of a letter grade or more. I would appreciate a longer exam to lower this variance and more accurately reflect grasp of the material.",
                "It's cool to see how basic CGI effects are implemented, but sometimes the content gets a bit repetitive.",
                "Strengths: Phenomenal class! You should definitely take it. Creating a rendering engine is probably the most fun CS project I've ever done, and the course is organized very well to support students through the process. It builds really well from the early fundamentals to creating an entire 10 second fully animated movie by the end of the course. Tests are hard but fair, and I think the grading overall is pretty reasonable. Weaknesses: None that I can think of!",
                "I really enjoyed this course, despite the difficulty. Lectures were engaging despite the dense material. PSETS were enjoyable. Professor Kim is great.\r\n\r\nI will say that the PSETS were very difficult and most students did most of them during office hours. Unfortunately, office hours were often crowded and did not have a set queue so it was difficult to get help. I would have appreciated some sort of walk-through or more structured office hours.",
                "Professor Kim is extremely engaging and a great lecturer.  The content of the course is really interesting and I genuinely had fun in lectures.  The only weakness is that I wish there was more support from TAs (mostly this means I wish there were more Office Hours)",
                "Well structured, very strict on deadlines though.",
                "Strengths: This was one of my favorite classes I've taken in the CS department. Prof Kim is a great lecturer and gives a comprehensive survey of both the technical and historical aspects of computer graphics. The TAs were incredibly helpful and supportive in debugging person-specific issues. The final project was a fun way to culminate our understanding of concepts in the course. I think the tests were weighted pretty heavily in comparison to the problem sets, which could take a lot of time to complete. I also think linear algebra should be required, or a set of resources should be given for students to brush up on their 202 knowledge.",
                "Lecture notes on canvas would have been helpful.",
                "No weakness! A super great class.",
                "Strengths include really high quality lectures/notes from Professor Kim, interesting assignments, and interesting material about the history and context of computer graphics algorithms. Some of the exam questions and exam grading left room to be desired, with some questions feeling like they required a lot of \"luck\" or happening to think of a specific idea, and some of the grading feeling a bit harsh or blunt. Friends of mine had some pretty harshly graded exams, no doubt variable by who got professor Kim as a grader on a given question (he tended to be the most harsh out of the teaching staff).",
                "The course was really helpful for those who have never done computer graphics before. The final project is pretty cool, and PSETs/projects are gratifying if you get everything working. Make sure you get good seats because all teaching is done on the board, so sitting further away or to the side of the board, it can be hard to see the notes.",
                "Material was presented in an appropriate amount of depth, but the algorithms used in class did not always align with the textbook or homeworks. Several times on the homework I would implement an algorithm as described in class only to find it didn't work and I had to reimplement it using the textbook's description.\r\nThe problem sets are quite good at teaching the material and the exams were fair.",
                "Strengths: good homeworks, quite engaging lectures. Weaknesses: opaque exam grading policies, lack of professor office hours.",
                "The course's topics are super interesting and the overall structure is very well designed. Professor Kim's lectures are excellent -- they are very well-organized and engaging. The assignments are also highly helpful. They might be a bit time consuming but I believe that is necessary for us to fully understand the topics and solidify our skills.",
                "This course is EXCELLENT! This is my favorite course this semester and I did not miss a single lecture! Professor Kim is a really engaging and thoughtful lecturer! I still remember during the first lecture, he showed us some movies on PowerPoint, and in the last lecture, he wrapped everything by sharing with us how \"thinking and humanities\" are also important, with the equipment of programming skills we learned, to push the boundary of research and human perceptions beyond. Moreover, I really enjoy the use of chalkboard in lectures and the abundance of drawings Professor Kim had on blackboard -- they are really helpful in visualizing the different graphics. In addition, the programming assignments, which took me generally around 30 hours, are designed extremely well and enhanced my knowledge significantly!!! I enjoy doing all the assignments and the final projects (though just be cautioned about the rendering time of the final project and start early!)",
                "This class is fun! Everyone gets the chance to implement renders from scratch to produce scenes & movies. Not a lot of math involved, and everything is practical and follows intuition.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nThis was the best planned course that I took this semester. Everything, from lectures, to assignments, to the final project was very well planned and we received feedback in a timely manner. I feel that what was promised in the initial lecture was delivered over the course of the semester."

                "Yes!!!!! It's such an awesome CS elective! You learn so much about a very difficult and relevant field while getting to make cool art using code. There's a lot of room for creativity in this class, which is refreshing for CS. It is a difficult and time-consuming class, so make sure that you have enough time to spend on the class.  It also helped me get better at organizing big coding projects and improving my C++.",
                "Definitely!! I loved this class. It can be a bit challenging to debug  kind of a pain to step through a process which is doing tons of computations for every single pixel  but totally worth it to see your code turn into images at the end.",
                "Maybe? Concepts are interesting but main drawback is that prof is rude and shows little care and sympathy with students. He also doesn't really know his stuff despite being a two-time academy winner. We'd ask questions in class or after class and he's really dodgy. The math he writes on the blackboard is often wrong (don't know why he doesn't use slides so he doesn't spend 2 minutes writing down matrices for us to copy).",
                "Yes, this is a fantastic CS elective. Will you use graphics in your life, probably not. Will you use C++, need good debugging skills, and the ability to tackle large projects without direction, yes. This class will teach you all of those skills, be very fun, and have a great lecturer. In the first class, Professor Kim shows final projects from previous semesters and we were all shocked and thought we couldn't do it, but by the end you write a ray tracer and make some insane movies, and it never seems that farfetched that you can do it. The class builds so well, and is so fun, and is such a gem of a CS elective. Yes it is harder than some electives, but the hard electives are where you learn, and this class definitely teaches you a lot. I also had a lot of fun with my friends in this class and made some new ones, which is always a plus.",
                "Yes! The content is always super interesting since you get to learn about how graphics in movies and games are rendered (and build your own ray tracer and render a short video!). Professor Kim's lectures were clear and he draws a lot of great diagrams.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about something fun outside the most popular fields of CS like systems and AI. That being said, I think the stuff learned in this class is not really transferrable to other areas.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It was so much fun, Prof. Kim is fantastic at explaining concepts, and the projects are a lot of fun. It also genuinely makes you feel so much more comfortable in C++ and coding large projects in general.",
                "Yes, but be prepared for the workload. I will also say that I felt very behind on the math during the first half of the semester (I did not take linear algebra). It's not a requirement, but the knowledge did seem to be assumed.",
                "Yes!! The course is very fun and engaging - the only caveat is that it has a high workload.  I would definitely take it again!",
                "Best class I took at Yale.",
                "Yes definitely, if you have the time and tenacity for it. The workload was certainly more than I expected it to be, but I was more inclined to do it because the content was so interesting. This is a really unique CS class in the department, and taking it with Kim was a great experience.",
                "If you enjoy graphics, sure. Otherwise take a more useful and relevant elective.",
                "Yes, for people interested in graphics, games, movies.",
                "Yes. It's a decent amount of work but the content is interesting, the course is well-organized, and Professor Kim is a good instructor. I found working through the problem sets and doing the final project very rewarding. Professor Kim overall was excellent although he definitely has some quirks such as the nonsensical regrade policy. Professor Kim also made an effort to teach the history of computer graphics as well as racism in its history which is cool and not something you get in most STEM classes, but sometimes it was pretty strange especially when he spent 20 minutes explaining his pet conspiracy theory that the US military killed a Vietnamese graphics researcher that (at least in the way he presented in class) had incredibly shaky logical reasoning and bordered on absurd. Overall though, I'm very glad I took the course and highly recommend it to others",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Kim is teaching it. I am primarily interested in systems computer science, but I was quite happy with the change of pace that this course provided. The material was well-delivered, the challenge was appropriate, and the satisfaction of a visual product to your hard work is hard to get in other CS courses.",
                "If the student has a strong background with linear algebra (matrix/vector math) and a good understanding of c++, as well as the drive to learn the basics of computer graphics algorithms, then I would recommend this course. If your course load is a bit busy for the semester with other classes, be warned that the PSETs and final project do take a lot of time.",
                "Fascinating material, but quite difficult conceptually. This was the first CS course I had taken in a while that really forced me to think hard and mathematically. Professor Kim is a great lecturer and connects the material to the real world. My time spent on the psets were as follows: hw1: 4 hours, hw2: 15 hours, hw3: 14 hours, hw4: 15 hours. My final project was around 2000 lines of C++.",
                "If you are prepared to deal with harsh exam grading policies and sometimes exam questions explicitly designed to trip people up and prevent people from doing \"too well,\"  then sure. The homework is very well designed and fun to complete and the lectures are quite enjoyable to listen to. I was disappointed by how little opportunity there was to ask questions to professor Kim as he didn't have office hours, only the TF's had office hours designed almost exclusively for debugging problem sets rather than discuss content.",
                "I will definitely recommend this course to another student. The course includes a lot of fascinating topics, and they are introduced in a highly organized manner. The assignments and the project not only gives students plenty of opportunity to practice our understanding and skills, but also gives students very strong sense of achievement.",
                "Yes, ABSOLUTELY! If you are interested in how the animations/special effects in movies are produced, or simply want to hear Professor Kim share his experience, please take this course!",
                "Yes, this course was great, but for me was similar to 323 workload/difficulty. Grading was also a little confusing. But overall Professor Kim is the best lecturer I've ever had, especially because he emphasizes the social and political context of graphics.",
                "Yes to anyone with experience with c/cpp. Definitely one of the most interesting CS classes to take at Yale, and the homework is fun to do! (it's like building a lego, you start from scratch and see what you get)",
                "Definitely, I would recommend this course to anyone that was some background in Linear Algebra. I think this course is **the** entry point for any student from an arts/humanities background that is looking to learn computer graphics, of course, but also programming in general. I'm saying this because the motivations for some of the algorithms that one learns in other CS courses aren't always apparent their. Here, they are very apparent. Thus, it makes learning fun."
