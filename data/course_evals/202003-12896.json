I found myself understanding the nuances of the language far more than I ever have, and I increased my fluency and comfort with the language. I noticed the most improvement in my speaking and writing skills; the in-depth course discussions and many writing assignments pushed me to improve on a regular basis, and I am a much stronger Spanish-speaker due to my time in the course.",
                "I developed a lot in my Spanish skills, especially considering the course being taught online. I learned a lot of grammar and new vocabulary. My reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills all developed greatly. I also learned a lot about Latin American history and culture.",
                "I improved a broad range of my Spanish abilities, mainly with respect to my speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. The class places a heavy emphasis on those four skills areas, and throughout the semester we were given many assignments that were geared towards those different skillsets. The class also covers several advanced gramatical structures and aims to significantly expand your vocabulary. Finally, all of the topics we studied were connected to different Hispanic histories and cultures."

                "A strength is that the course provided many opportunities to speak in class to practice your spanish",
                "The greatest strengths of this course lie in the many different levels of exposure to the Spanish language incorporated into the curriculum. I felt that the course material balanced itself well between reading, listening, speaking, and writing exercises, and the incorporation of new vocabulary from the textbook chapters, songs, readings, and films that we investigated kept the material fresh and applicable. Furthermore, the \"Proyecto Cultural\" was an incredibly valuable opportunity to apply our skills in a real-world context, and it was rewarding to research elements of another culture prior to discussing them in an extensive conversation. I also found the various assignments (both on Canvas and SuperSite) to be highly useful; while it can be inconvenient to complete so many assignments (sometimes multiple per day), frequent and redundant exposure to different skill sets and concepts is necessary for improvement. The main weakness of the course was a logistical matter; the grade weighting for the course was not solidified until rather late in the class, and I also found various errors in the Canvas and SuperSite answer keys. Other than that, I have few complaints; I appreciated this course immensely.",
                "The course was highly engaging. Our professor was excellent at keeping the class discussion and material flowing. One weakness of the course was probably the nightly homeworks on Supersite as they were somewhat meticulous, but they aren't difficult and helped in learning vocabulary and grammar.",
                "I think the primary strength of the course is that it meets everyday, albeit asynchronously twice a week because of the virtual format. Because of the frequency, even students who don't put too much time into the course will, by default, see an improvement in their Spanish skills, given the fact that the class size is very small and classes are entirely discussion based. I really enjoyed getting to practice conversing in Spanish with this much frequency, and the class structure allows you time to practice the vocabulary and grammar structures you learn. Also, I enjoyed the variety of coursework. The course really tries to offer a diverse range of material so that everyone in the class has at least something they're interested in. For example, we had podcasts, movies, short films, short stories, novels, etc. that we worked with. The biggest weakness of the class is that, especially towards the end, the assignments just pile up. It always felt like there was quite a lot of work to complete all the time, and everything is graded for accuracy which means little mistakes on Canvas\/Supersite homework get marked down.",

                "The breakout rooms were great because it allowed me to speak to my classmates",
                "Given that this course is discussion-based, it adapted well to a virtual environment. Meeting synchronously on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (and asynchronously on Tuesdays and Thursdays) presented a manageable yet engaging schedule, and our synchronous class time felt worthwhile and inclusive. Despite the limitations of an online learning format, I found that our class discussions flowed smoothly over Zoom (aside from a few connection issues), and splitting up into breakout rooms was helpful for smaller, more detailed conversations. Taking quizzes, completing exams, and writing compositions on Canvas were all manageable activities, and I do not feel that the virtual format hindered our learning in any significant way.",
                "This course was designed very well for learning during the pandemic. The online assessments were designed well and asynchronous material was engaging.",
                "Professor Valle did a great job leading engaging discussions, which is not an easy thing to do on Zoom. She had such organization and structure to class time that the 50 minutes always flew by, and it never felt like we were struggling to fill the time. I know the decision to have asynchronous class was made because of the virtual format, but if I were to take the course again, I think I would have preferred the standard 5 times a week class. I say this because the asynchronous classes really just felt like more homework, and there wasn't any incentive to do the work during class time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I would have rather had more class time even on Zoom than being overloaded with assignments.",

The course does demand a fair amount of work, but students who are willing to put in the time will see excellent returns. This was a worthwhile experience, and the skills and vocabulary covered promote a firm understanding of the Spanish language. In short, if you want to improve your Spanish, and you are willing to receive feedback and to improve, take this course!",

I learned a lot about Latin American history while simultaneously developing my Spanish skillset. I would highly recommend Professor Valle if you can get into her section. She is a fabulous teacher and keeps the class constantly engaged.",
                "I would recommend the class to another student. If someone is at a high level of Spanish and wants to move to that next level closer to fluency, I think SPAN 140 is a great way to do so. People should definitely consider their workload before enrolling, though, because the class involves a large amount of daily assignments, and while I felt it was manageable, it may be more difficult for those with other intensive courses. For students who don't place into L5 but want to have access to those courses, they'll need to take this class."
