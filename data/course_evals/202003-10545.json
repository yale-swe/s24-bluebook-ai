                "Strengths: Multiple meeting times allows for re-enforcement  of material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of extra credit (or the fact that grades arent rounded) put a lot of stress on an already difficult and harshly scored class.",
                "It is a very fast-paced class and we tend to brush over many concepts before we have an opportunity to master them. The tests are also very difficult and expectations are very high for what is supposed to be a beginner-level Spanish class. It is almost as if you have to come into the class being fluent in Spanish in order to obtain high grades on exams.",
                "Strengths would include well structured class time that allowed for engaging participation in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses would be focused on the amount of homework and assignments we received weekly which I think indicates a lack of understanding on the professor's part of what a reasonable amount of work would be. The amount of work demanded, especially on presentations and projects, very often detracted from time that would have been more valuably spent on other courses.",
                "I believe that this course could be improved by moving away from canvas tests and quizzes. The majority of points lost on canvas quizzes and tests was not due to incorrect spanish, but due to minor discrepancies between what the question asked and the one word answers that the program allows. The students would find the class far more fair and understanding if the grading was done by a person and not by a computer.",
                "Strengths: \r\nLearning how to give presentations in Spanish.\r\nLearning verb tenses in the future, preterite, imperfect, past perfect, subjunctive, and imperative\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHard to hear things given connection to internet: Including a live transcript or subtitle feature on zoom so everyone can read what is being said live.\r\nEngaging and getting to know classmates: More activities learning about others and letting the Spanish they speak come from their hearts",
                "Strengths: extremely detailed syllabus, follows the book closely, abundant access to professor through email and office hours\r\nWeaknesses: fast paced, occasionally unclear instructions"
