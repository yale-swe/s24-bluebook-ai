The class is so unique in that it operates entirely around the creation of a personal exhibition, which really allows you to tailor the discussion of the relationship between poetry and objects to your own tastes.",
                "I learned how to think in ways that are not practical, but that are the hearty, heartbreaking, heartwarming stuff of life.",
                "I learned how to curate an exhibit, research in the archives, and bridge art and poetry in academic analyses.",
                "Unique class that puts poems in conversation with objects.",
                "This is a course that develops the ability to close read both poetry and objects, from artwork to daily utensils. You will learn to craft exhibition text and explain rationale for placing objects in groups that speak to a poem."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are its process-oriented nature, it really emphasizes the student to keep good research skills as Karin is most interested in learning how you arrive at a particular conclusion, as opposed to the actual conclusion itself.",
                "I think the purpose of the course could have been revealed earlier on (about objects as anti-symbols), rather than later. That could have helped me think about objects and poetry more intentionally.",
                "The biggest strength was how Professor Roffman organizes the course. The weekly explorations of the Beinecke and Wurtele while analyzing poetry was absolutely incredible. The class truly felt like a little family, and the final exhibitions were a wonderful celebration of our hard work all semester. In terms of feedback, I would suggest providing clearer expectations for the three exhibitions at the beginning of the semester before the research process begins and having the weekly assignments constitute a larger part of the grade since they involve significant effort throughout the semester. Overall, I loved this course and cannot recommend it enough!",
                "The biggest weakness in this class is that the instructions around organizing the exhibit and the narrative research essay are quite vague. As a result, it's hard to know when to start research or even what a narrative research essay is. However! This weakness turns out to be a strength toward the end of the semesterit means that each student has to develop their own path and pay attention to how they think independently and that each exhibition is delightfully different. Everything else is greatthe curators, poems, poets, etc are amazing additions to the class, as are Karin's objects. Weekly writing assignments are extremely helpful and also fun!",
                "Strengths: Get to devote most of your time toward creating an exhibition on a topic that interests you. Prof is very passionate, cares about your success in the class, and provides a lot of constructive feedback. Great class if you enjoy thinking deeply about objects and poems and don't like large quantities of reading. Interesting conversations with guest poets/speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing notable."

                "YES! This is one of those unforgettable Yale courses, designed exclusively by Karin's brilliance. It's such a unique chance to work with both archival materials and works of art through the lens of a project you design yourself. This course gets you to think about the secret lives of material objects and the ways they are sources of memory and personal history. There are also so many wonderful guest speakers in this course! Like john Stuart Gordon and Nancy Kuhl, two wonderful curators.",
                "Yes! Karin is such a sweet professor and friend, and I am grateful that she made so much time to meet and answer the smallest of questions. \r\n\r\nI feel like the three-hour class was sometimes exhausting, but I also enjoyed that we met once a week. Perhaps a slightly shorter class time would have been useful.",
                "Anyone interested in art, poetry, and/or exhibition curation must take this course! It requires hours of weekly research and a significant amount of effort, so ensure your other classes have a lower workload. The effort you put in all feels so rewarding by the end of the course when you get to share your exhibition with friends and family. I absolutely recommend this course!!",
                "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in strange and beautiful objects and knickknacks; how poetry has the power to both explain and mystify; in how to think and express yourself clearly, you should give this class a shot. I always looked forward to going to class. Be prepared to accept the premises of the class and learn to think in new ways. And don't be afraid of the 3 hourswe only used the full instruction time onceit's mostly for getting to and from the West Campus Wurtele Center.",
                "Definitely. For reasons listed under strengths. Don't take it if you're looking for a gut and not willing to invest in the class though: it's very much a class where you need to put in time to get something meaningful out of it (and to get a good grade).",
                "yes! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Rodman is amazing!",
                "Karin Roffman is a wonderful professor, who always makes time for her students and was meticulous in giving feedback at every stage of the class. This course is very independent, so you must be motivated in crafting your exhibitions. Every student was incredibly engaged and worked together as a cohort throughout the semester."
