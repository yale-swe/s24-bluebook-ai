                "I believe that this course's lack of tests took a lot of the stress out of learning a new language, and I believe that it allowed me to learn more German than I ever had before. Although it is a little unconventional, I feel like I have learned so much in such a little time due to this method. However, there was a very substantial amount of homework, especially compared to my other classes. I think to alleviate this, asynchronous days should have less time consuming assignments (i.e. shorter movies and questions), as they would sometimes take upwards of four hours to finish."
