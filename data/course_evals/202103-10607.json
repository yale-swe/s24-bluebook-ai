                "I learned a lot about the music of medieval Europe! To be totally honest, I did not think that I would be interested in the course material before taking the course, but I have gained a newfound appreciation for early music. It has been such a joy to spend time with Prof. Z and the TAs looking at this material  which they are all very, very, very passionate and knowledgeable about. It was also helpful to improve my musicology writing skills, which have been underpracticed.",
                "I learned so much about early music--genres, composers, how notation developed, the practice of using preexisting musical material, Medieval and Renaissance history, and more. In terms of skills, I learned how to take effective notes in class and study from those notes, and I also learned how to study from a listening list and become familiar with/memorize songs, which I hadn't done before.",
                "The course is a survey about early music, so I learned about early music and different composers, styles, and forms, but I also learned a whole new approach to how to do and view history.",
                "Learned about European musical traditions from 500-1600 CE, heavily focusing on 1100-1600. Prof. Z and our TAs helped us approach this material critically, investigating the historiography as much as the history and understanding how the music made its way to us, and what motivations/misconceptions might be implicated in the process. Writing and transcription assignments looked directly at medieval sources. Lots of memorization of songs/people/dates/historical events for nine quizzes and two exams.",
                "I came into this class not knowing what to expect from a Medieval music class but came out having a much better understanding of the stylistic development of Western music and the relevant historical context. A very fun and informative class.",
                "Musical styles and genres from 900-1600. Exposure to a lot of music over that time span. Some discussion of historiography.",
                "knowledge of medieval and Renaissance music, examined through the lens of musical notation; analysis and signing of medieval sources; ability to transcribe from primary sources; write own songs based on format of Jeu Parti Debate song; analysis of musical historiography and discussion of musicology as a discipline today",

                "Listening skills",
                "I learned about the history of music in Europe before 1600. In particular, I learned about how the technological developments of notation, social and political developments of what music was needed, and changing tastes brought by contact affected the music made by musicians in a time and place."

            "comments": [
                "The course material is excellent, and the pace felt just right. The weekly listening quizzes were quite stressful (even though they constituted a small portion of the grade), and it would have been nice to have a smaller or more consistent number of eligible songs per quiz. Sometimes, it felt like we were studying for the sake of memorizing the material for quizzes instead of for learning the material for learning's sake. Otherwise, the course was really well-designed, and the instructors were very interested in making good pedagogical choices and encouraging us to think outside of the box on assignments.",
                "There were very few weaknesses in this course -- I liked the general structure, the listening quizzes, singing in class, and the projects. \r\n\r\nI do wish I had gotten more feedback on the four projects we did (two of them as of now haven't been graded, so I'm basing this off of the first two grades). The feedback I got was great, but I would've loved more specific comments on my work since I put a lot of time into these projects.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that I wish there were a list of terms (genres, composers, etc.) we need to know posted somewhere. For people who had to miss a class, it was hard to know which terms were very important and which terms were just throw-away interesting tidbits from class. This was especially a problem because the powerpoints were already pretty sparse. So if on canvas there were a list of terms somewhere that would be helpful.",
                "Prof. Z is an excellent lecturer and pedagogue who helps students engage critically with this material! The projects are all creative and make you feel like a medieval music scholar yourself: we did a transcription of medieval notation, a collaborative composition of a jeu parti (debate song), and an edition, all with written reflection components, and then a short research paper on a self-chosen topic that was not represented in the survey. The quizzes and exams require a lot of memorization; I don't know if that is a strength or a weakness necessarily, just worth noting that a lot of your time studying for this course will be dominated by listening and memorizing. Sometimes it was unclear what we were going to be quizzed on (ex. quizzes asked us to identify quotes that did not come up in readings/assignments, but that were mentioned in lecture). Another strength is that class and section are both highly interactive and incorporate many different modes of learning: group work, discussion, activities, singing, and so forth.",
                "The class is really enjoyable, and the material was unique. One weakness of the class is the over-emphasis on memorizing the listening material, which I think is less important than being able to understand the styles in a holistic view.",
                "I like the check-in quizzes and assignments in that they spread out the work over the semester and thereby reduce stress towards the end. If the final remains open-note (a format that I personally like because it is more applicable to the real world), having the last assignment due during reading period is more reasonable. I liked the opportunity to go deeper on something from the course period that I was interested in. The debate song project was also really fun. The neume transcription assignment and \"De toutes bien plaine\" assignment were both a little bit tedious but also instructive. Sections should be devoted to discussion rather than covering additional material.",
                "Strengths: so many things! excellent instructor and TFs, logical and organized progression of material, reasonable assignments with clear grading and feedback; a real sense of support and community\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: few! I would say the transcription project was a bit time-consuming. Perhaps splitting it in to two parts so that one could receive some feedback before turning in the entire thing might help.",
                "I think the strength was the in-class lectures, particularly with singing and other group activities. \r\nThe weakness was that I hated that it was at 9 am! Also the assignments were a little bit of overkill. I thought the jeu parti was fun, but the 1st and 3rd assignments could have been slimmed out. There should have been only 4 versions of Deo Nostro. And we should have just done half of the song for the editing project. And the last project was assigned last minute and I couldn't make time for it. At a certain point it, these assignments became tedious rather than educational.",
                "Professor Z knows how to balance breadth and depth in a survey course. All concepts are explained clearly and thoroughly. Her model of asking why study Medieval music is followed by a detailed an convincing answer to that question in each lecture.",
                "Given the amount of assessments we take in the course, sometimes all the projects on top of them felt like a little too much and could be overwhelming.",
                "Despite the seemingly dry or irrelevant subject matter, it is incredibly engaging and interesting, especially with hands-on assignments and weekly listening quizzes.",
                "Lectures by Prof. Z were really great! Sometimes, it felt like a few classes were not as fleshed out as others, and there was just less material on some periods. This could have been remedied, I think, by assigning more readings  probably an unpopular opinion, but having read more Taruskin or other academic sources would have helped round out the picture sometimes. I also found some of the assignments a bit busywork-y. I felt like I learned the most outside of class about the material through the readings and studying for quizzes. I did like the first assignment a lot, though. The third felt like a bit of a repeat of the first, and as such didn't really grip me as much."

                "I would recommend the course to another student, especially for music majors or musicians. I don't think that we learn about early music enough in our day-to-day lives as 21st century musicians, and the music that you'll learn about in the course is very interesting! The course is laidback, and the instructors are dedicated to making things low-stress. You'll definitely enjoy it.",
                "Definitely! It is a great class for any musician who wants to learn about early music. I feel like it gave me so much more context and appreciation for classical music and popular music.",
                "Yes! Studying early music, especially with Professor Zayaruznaya, can be so incredibly relevant to how to approach music of our day and age.",
                "Yes, even if you do not expect to find the material interesting. With Prof. Z you probably will! This is one of a small handful of courses that go toward the Western history portion of the music major. With this one, I think you're making a good choice, but it is a LOT of memorization (so are the other courses in the Western history sequence), so get ready for that.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this class to other students in the music major. There are not many other places where one can dive so deeply in to music of the Middle Ages and enjoy the journey so thoroughly.",
                "Yes - Professor Z is a great lecturer and you will learn a lot. As long as you show up to every lecture and section and take notes, the readings are largely optional.",
                "Yes! This class was amazing. Professor Zayaruznaya is both a clear and organized professor, but also a kind and supportive one as well. She gave the class a sense of community in spite of such unprecedented times. This class taught me so much about early and Renaissance music and is an excellent selection if you are interested in music history. Its certainly a fair amount of work  weekly quizzes, invested projects, a midterm and a final  but theres a lot that makes the class worth the workload. Keep on top of the readings, start your studying for each quiz a couple days before, and youll be fine. I could not recommend a better class in the music major.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless they had a very strong interest in medieval studies or if they were filling a music major requirement. The material is not very approachable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Even if you have had no prior interest in the music of the Middle Ages or Renaissance, I can guarantee youll walk away from this class with a brand new curiosity for the material. One of the most engaging courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Absolutely. The professor is a gem, and the course, while a bit niche or esoteric, is surprisingly relevant and fascinating.",
                "Yes, if they're interested in music of this period. Lessons learned from studying music of this period certainly could apply to other periods, but I personally took it for a sense of completeness, having taken all the other survey courses."
