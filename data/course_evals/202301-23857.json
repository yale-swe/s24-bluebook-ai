                "This course was a really good introduction to thinking about measurement and theory in political science fieldwork. I felt like I got a lot out of Prof. Khan's breakdowns of the quantitative papers we read, and we also benefited from a dialogue with students at LUMS (a Pakistani university) who had done community surveys in Lahore. It was also really interesting to read the literature about women's empowerment and development, which I had not been exposed to beforethis doesn't feel like a class that has lessons only applicable to South Asia.",

                "This course was well-paced both in terms of topics covered and assignments. The overarching research paper was a great opportunity to develop an idea in depth over the course of the semester, while our weekly readings and discussions exposed us to a lot of subtopics and kept us engaged.",
                "I think the class could at times be a little disorganizedit would have been helpful to have a clearer syllabus at the outset and more systematic updates about changes to course plans. But overall it was highly informative and pretty enjoyable. We did a lot of small group discussions and engagement with multimedia material, which was a nice change.",
                "Really engaging syllabus, great professor, and generative discussions",
                "Strengths: syllabus was very well-structured, readings all felt relevant and focused; format of the class was engaging with student presentations and then discussion; appreciated the incorporation of outside media and the Zoom call we had with the LUMS students from Pakistan and their fieldwork\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish there was a bit more of a conclusion on the various political, social, and economic interventions we talked about (what works and what doesn't felt like a question we talked about a lot but I wish we came to some sort of direction for that); some of the readings were extremely long and then we didn't get a chance to cover them in class, so maybe highlighting which readings to focus on if we can't get to all of them; I'm not sure how helpful the discussion questions board was on Canvas, since we mostly seemed to go in our own direction in class discussion"

                "Yes! A great seminar for any political science, ER&M, or gender studies student. Its designed to be both accessible for younger students and challenging for older students. Our discussions were really interesting, Professor Khan is a stellar instructor and scholar, and the variety of assignments and materials meant that I gained knowledge both deeply and widely.",
                "YesI think this is ultimately a fun and interesting introduction to the study of gender in political science, and Prof. Khan facilitates good discussions in addition to picking interesting readings. The workload isn't too high, and you get out of it what you put in from a final paper perspective (and I would recommend starting to plan the final paper early, which the course is designed to help you do).",
                "Yes, I think it provides a great basis for studying gender issues in South Asia and more broadly",
                "Yes, I would! As a South Asian, I had never gotten a chance to study South Asia, and definitely not women in South Asia, in a class before. This class felt like exactly what I was looking for. We delved deeply into each topic, and it was extremely challenging and interesting to be able to think about interventions that political scientists and theorists have been using to solve a lot of the cultural, social, and economic problems that face women in South Asia. The class brought together a lot of the ways different conflicts religion, caste, class intersect with being a woman in South Asia, and I appreciated the level of attention we paid to all of these dimensions."
