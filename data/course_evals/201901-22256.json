    "Improvement in vocal technique and being on stage as an actor",
    "I learned how to voice Bach on marimba with the Cello Suite No. 1. I learned about how to play different movements of a suite written in the 16-1700s. I was able to integrate dynamics and articulation of my playing with the theory of the music.",

    "Strengths: High quality instruction from best marimba player in the world. \r\nWeaknesses: Instruction is not regularly scheduled.",
    "This is an excellent course; I cannot think of any ways to improve it.",
    "The lessons are less-structured, which can be helpful to lighten course load, but sometimes becomes a bit of let down when communication and consistency falls short. I learned a lot, but feel I could have gotten more with more consistent work.",
    "Personal attention and complete focus on my habits, technique, and pitfalls. Perfect!",
    "Russell was a great instructor. Sometimes difficult to work around both of our busy schedules",
    "It's good",
    "It does not seem fair that the students of Janna Baty do not have to perform a final jury. I feel that preparing 3 pieces for a jury performance was an important part of my lessons curriculum, and needing to memorize three pieces and perform them in an audition-like setting was extremely instructive. This style of preparing pieces and performing them is necessary for any performer looking to audition for graduate schools or jobs in the future, and I think Jannas students are deprived of this educational opportunity.",
    "The grad student, Jisu Jung, was fantastic in explaining how to create a more mature sound from the marimba.",
    "Weekly lessons were very helpful. Studio classes are a great way to work on performing and get feedback.",
    "I really enjoy my lessons."

    "I'd recommend lessons to any student looking to improve their technical skills as a musician, especially those interested in performing professionally.",
    "Absolutely! Lessons are so incredibly helpful to improving not only your musical ability but also your character and ability as a human to change, improve, and become flexible. This has been a really wonderful journey for me in improving my vocal abilities and an interesting exploration into how a lot of my character traits interact with my musical abilities\/production.",
    "Yes, Russell was a great teacher and super friendly.",
    "Yeah it's good take it get better at music",
    "Absolutely! If you are serious about improving vocal technique, I would highly recommend lessons for credit.",
    "Yes! Its for anyone who seriously wants to improve on an instrument or on their voice.",

    "I would recommend lessons to anyone interested in furthering their development in solo performance of an instrument.",
    "This totally depends on who you would be taking lessons with, but I had a fantastic time taking lessons during my time at Yale."
