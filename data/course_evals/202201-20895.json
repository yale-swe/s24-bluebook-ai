My only suggestion is that I wish the Spring requirements for Chem 490 were formally announced in the Fall. I spent the Fall semester unsure of what I would need to do for my thesis and knowing ahead of time may have helped me to start earlier. Similarly, seeing examples of past papers/presentations/posters could have been helpful - not everybody has somebody familiar with this process in their lab that they can ask questions of.",
