    "Homework is generally very manageable (time- and difficulty-wise) and is a good review of material and practice of skills. Lessons are helpful, go at a moderate pace, and are full of examples. More in-depth explanation could be nice (sometimes the concepts are diluted and simplified for us), but overall a good course that teaches you 3D calc very well.",
    "Teacher wasn't that engaging, and I relied on other people's notes.",
    "Ximera is a great resource for this class. However, in class there could be more thorough explanations for how to solve specific types of problems.",
    "the course moved very fast, and i often found myself frantically taking notes during lecture, then having to relearn the material after lecture. because there is just so much material to cover, i think this was just the nature of the course  it's hard to say how it could be improved."

    "Yes. Anyone who wants to learn multivariable calculus should take this course. It teaches you the skills, gives a good understanding, and is a pleasant course (in terms of structure and difficulty).",
    "If the student was interested in taking mathematics or other applied sciences that require multi variable calculus, yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "neutral  i think, if you need \/ want to learn multivariable calculus (esp. if, like me, you've never had exposure to it before), this is what you've got to do. there were certainly points where i felt very, very confused, but you must overcome that stage of confusion to reach a stage of understanding."
