I do think that there are certain things we learned in class such as the function of chords or how to construct them (rather than just applying them exactly as written in the exercises) that could have been reinforced more since we didn't need to think about them for most of our practice. I liked that toward the end of the semester there was more of a focus on building the chords with the proper voicings and extensions and not just relying on applying the jazz drills verbatim.\r\nAlso, during the first few weeks of class because of shopping period we had lecture prior to the start of that weeks practice on Monday. I found it much easier to practice during those weeks because once we were in a groove of lecture on Monday at 5pm, I found it hard to actually practice Monday evening (and hard to practice prior to lecture) so I would have to fit a practice day into the weekend which was just logistically difficult sometimes and also gave me less time to practice and look at the material before office hours on Wednesday. I wonder if it would work to have lecture on Wednesday and office hours on Monday- just a thought.",

                "I enjoyed the practicing aspect but the lecture could have been more engaging and it would have been nice to play/listen to more music together. Office hours were incredibly helpful as it was nice to see the keys."
