                "I learned about the landscape of world energy moving further into the 21st century, as well as the earth's processes leading to fossil fuel formation. I particularly enjoyed learning about the process of oil\/fossil fuel formation, as it was information I had not previously known.",
                "I felt as this course is more so a class where you can learn about things that will actually show up in life. I feel that this course material is practical in that some aspects you learn about how you can better equip yourself in real life.",
                "This class offers an incredible survey to fossil fuels processes holistically. Personally, I have a much better understanding of the earth systems that form fossil fuels as well as the economic and political aspects of fossil fuels.",
                "I learned everything I know about fossil fuels from this course. I had an incredible experience. Oristaglio makes this an incredibly accessible space for people of all backgrounds to engage with the material in a critical way. This class was one of the highlights of my academic career.",
                "Knowledge of fossil fuels' development, exploitation, use, and impact on the world. Very interesting to hear about the environmental impacts of each fuel and the possible trajectories future energy developments may take.",
                "Overview of three main fossil fuels with concentrations on geologic formation, extraction, refinery, and use.",
                "I learned a lot about how the world energy system works and how fossil fuels form and their effects.",
                "I learned about coal, petroleum, and natural gas systems along with other forms of energy.",
                "I learned about the earth science behind fossil fuels and how they are used today.",
                "Basic knowledge surrounding the earths fossil fuels",
                "An overview of the science of fossil fuel systems and broad knowledge about the role of energy in the world.",
                "Great technical, political, and economic exposure to fossil fuels and their impact on world energy. Oristaglio is an amazing lecturer who is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject material and super lenient in terms of flexibility for his students. His analysis on fossil fuels is top-notch, and this course is necessary for anyone who is interested in energy and the renewable energy transition. Highly recommend.",
                "Learned about a variety of topics: geologic history and structure of fossil fuel reserves, specific case studies of oil and coal fields, environmental impacts of fossil fuel extraction, basic climate science, economic factors.  Gained experience in reading through scientific literature to pull out relevant information, doing calculations, and manipulating data for our purposes.",
                "Gained a good knowledge of fossil fuels: their formation processes, the way they are extracted, their current levels, efficiencies, future implications, and comparisons with renewable energy. This course does a good job at providing a comprehensive review of the topic and the problem sets make sure to help us understand the implications ourselves. The professor does a great job at explaining all the complex topics.",
                "This course provided a great insights on energy transitions from a fossil fuel perspective. As a student of clean energy, this was an ideal foundational sort of course which provided knowledge on the fossil fuel basics and how to apply it to the transition towards clean energy.",

                "This class has a reasonable workload expectation, and an interesting professor. The course's biggest strength is Oristaglio. He is an Exxon well of knowledge. I wish this course included a few required readings or documentaries.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Oristaglio is incredibly organized and clear about the structure of the semester, due dates and expectations\r\n- he makes himself available to answer questions AND work with students. \r\n-the way that Oristaglio makes himself available to work with students for an hour and a half each week is so unique. It's rare that a professor will be so available to students and so willing to help them learn. I took advantage of office hours and had a great experience \r\n- the exams are great because they are set up to play into everyone's strengths:  both qualitative and quantitative. The class is similar \r\n- his powerpoints are so helpful and tell us exactly what we need to know \r\n- he is clearly so passionate about the material and about teaching and it makes for an amazing experience \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "Lectures are poorly attended and not very engaging. TFs weren't responsive. Office hours were only offered when many students have conflicts (athletes).  I learned the most from the HWs.",
                "The course was very well organized and supported. Having the slides available for review was a great help. I also appreciated the lectures being recorded, as it made reviewing for the midterm and final much easier. I have no recommendations for improvement.",
                "Strengths- great and consistent feedback, interesting problem sets\r\nWeaknesses - exams often have little to do with classwork",
                "Strengths: the content is interesting, Professor Oristaglio is very nice, the problem-solving sessions were very helpful, the exams were open book. Weaknesses: the problem sets sometimes felt a bit unrelated to lecture material.",
                "I enjoyed lectures and the psets were not too bad",
                "The material and professor are great, but the class could be organized a bit better.",
                "Strength - accessible content, interesting P-sets \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes lectures felt as if he was just reading from slides.",
                "Strengths: amazing lecturer, technical lectures, insightful takeaways, problem sets that are crafted in an applicable way with actually interesting takeaways and answers that expand upon course material. \r\nWeaknesses: None, really.",
                "Strengths: great professor who really put a lot of time into the teaching slides.  Manageable homework load which didn't feel like busy-work.  Each problem set was structured differently to give us a range of skills.",
                "Strengths: syllabus was well-organized, lecture content was clear\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a little repetitive at times, problem sets felt like busy work - content did not seem connected to the lectures sometimes, exams were basically a scavenger hunt \/ race against time"

The course was well organized and taught, and Professor Oristaglio is an authority on the subject. I believe the course is extremely useful for gaining a background in what will increasingly become a pressing issue; the change to carbon neutral energy systems.",
                "Definitely recommend to those who have some background in energy studies (although its not necessary). Some genuine interest will go a long way in making the class greatly enjoyable.",
                "Absolutely, if they are really interested in the subject matter. You have to be interested in earth science as well as just world energy. It is more fossil fuels than it is world energy but still very interesting. Professor Oristaglio is really nice.",
                "yes, I learned a lot about our energy systems which is very important",

                "Yes, good for getting distributional requirement",
                "Maybe. If they were interested in the science of fossil fuels, given their dominance in the world economy. It is very accessible to all students, no need for a science background.",
                "Absolutely. Chill, informative, and a great course as an introduction to fossil fuels, energy systems, and a good precursor to his other course, Renewable energy. If anything, take this course to have the chance to be taught by Oristaglio-- he is great.",
                "Yes, even though it may feel weird to you to be taking a course dedicated to fossil fuels, it will improve your understanding of why these fuels are so hard to move away from, which is necessary if you hope to work in or advocate for the renewable energy transition.",
                "Yes. This is a great foundational course for anyone specializing or with an intention to focus on energy, specifically energy transitions.",
