                "Interesting new perspective of organic pollutants in our lives/world. Review of basic organic chemistry, and their applications.",
                "I learned how to identify, describe, and infer qualities of different organic pollutants through their structure and chemical properties. This knowledge translated in an ability to understand concrete case studies. I also gained a working knowledge of organic chemistry like drawing and naming organic structures.",

                "The course is really well-structured and well-run under Shimi. Every point of frustration that I might've had during the course was fixed, as Shimi actually responds to and cares about feedback. It was such a pleasant experience!",
                "Strengths- instructor is excellent, course content was digestible for non-STEM majors",
                "Great breadth of subjects, but because it started off so chemistry-heavy, it was hard to transition to a more content-based way of thinking",
                "Strengths: Professor Anisfeld is very responsive to student feedback and reasonable, topics and the science are very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: none that were significant",
                "Shimi is a great instructor!! He is extremely knowledge about course topics and his enthusiasm and kindness made lectures enjoyable. Our TF Yoanna was also a highlight of the course.",
                "A lot of content to remember and its difficult to know what will be on exams.",
                "This is a super dense course. I found it fascinating and super relevant which was exciting, but sometimes it was hard to follow because of how specific Shimi got. I think towards the end of the year with slide reviews and going through psets I got a better grasp, but its definitely hard to parse through what information is most important and which is a little less pressing.",
                "Overall a great class!!! Shimi is an excellent professor and he clearly cares about all his students.",
                "Strengths: Very relaxed/informal introduction to organic chemistry (no background needed), all course concepts connect to real-world issues, problem sets are very manageable (office hours are very helpful)\r\nWeaknesses: Broad scope of material that is covered very quickly, but lecture recaps and practice exams added during the course help to drill the big ideas",
                "Strength - LOVED how we started from easier content and moved to harder content! Really loved the more quantitative side of the problems sets! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - More examples that tie into the problems sets would really be helpful!",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes! I was not a fan of organic chemistry at all, but the applications of chemistry in this course are very interesting and comprehendible. I enjoyed the balance and manageable workload of this course. I attribute the course's success to professor Anisfeld and the TA, so I'm not sure if the course will as engaging and interesting with another professor.",
                "Yes! Great introductory course to organic environmental pollutants and ways to remediate their effects in the environment.",
                "I would recommend this course for people who are interested in environmental issues but want to take a chemistry-heavy approach in understanding them. The course was more about industrial environmental issues (I.e. what molecules are in gas/oil? How do they break down? How do we extract them?) rather than how the natural world (animals, climate change) is impacted/affected by such pollutants on a broader conceptual level.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think science classes can be really daunting but I appreciated this class for making organic chemistry accessible. The content was focused on making you have a working understanding with the end goal of being able to understand organic pollutants themselves and their effects.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are an EVST major interested in organic pollutants. No chemistry background is needed but it's definitely helpful.",
                "Yes! All the material covered in this course is heavily relevant to the real world, the workload is quite light, and Shimi and Yoanna are wonderful at explaining the material (and incredibly sweet/patient). This is also a great precursor for organic chemistry if you plan on taking it!",
                "Yes! Such a wonderful professor and course to learn about really important pollutants in this world!",
