                "I learned all the foundational things about German. I learned how to construct sentences, ask questions and even how to hold up simple conversations.",
                "My German skills improved DRASTICALLY. I went from knowing zero German to understanding the basics. I can read, write, speak and listen at a much higher level.",
                "I learned a lot about German and language skills.",
                "I came into this course with absolutely zero German knowledge besides maybe a week on Duolingo. By the end of the course, I was having entire conversations in German, both speaking and writing. I also learned how to read and listen to children's stories and regular every-day conversations. I also learned at ton abut German culture, politics, and education!",
                "I learned basic German conversational and writing skills.",
                "After only a few months, I went from speaking no german to being proficient in the German language, such that I could communicate (albeit minimally) with native speakers. Learning under Professor Schenker, I learned so muchand it seems that I learned even more than other sections of the same course. I am so grateful to Frau Schenker for teaching my first semester of German because I truly feel as though I \"got off on the right foot\" in my German learning.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: While the course is intensive, it is very well structured. Professor Schenker is incredible and truly engages you in class. You will learn German in so many different ways (through videos, a textbook, Quizlet, peer students, etc)! You never get bored with this course and your improvement from week to week will be very rewarding. The assignments are often VERY FUN and VERY CREATIVE. Lastly, I almost always look forward to class. It is taught in such a fun and interactive way and I almost ALWAYS exit satisfied. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not every instructor that teaches this course has been helpful. Unfortunately, our professor was out sick many times and we joined a graduate student's class (Constantine) which was entirely unhelpful. \r\nMoreover, the Wednesday asynchronous work always takes longer than fifty minutes. This is perhaps the only frustrating aspect of this course: a lot of the work throughout the semester is \"busy work\". It takes up your time, but you are not learning a lot. Sometimes it feels like there is a lot of work just so the instructor can feel like she assigned a lot of work. I would have appreciated less work that was more intellectually challenging. The quality of a course should NEVER have to do with how much time you spend doing \"homework.\"",
                "The class had strengths in every area, but the only weakness was not having a lot of writing activities in class.",
                "The strength of the course is the amount you learn in such a short span of time. The assignments were also very engaging.",
                "Strengths: I really think I learned something and I feel like Ive really grasped some of the basic language strcutues. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the asynchronous day should be on Friday.",
                "I loved that this course had an asynchronous day. It allowed me to develop my skills in ways other than were available in a classroom, and also allowed for my schedule to be a little more flexible.",
                "Strengths: engaging classes, helpful and knowledgable professor, lots of speaking practice in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I liked a lot of our fun activities like making videos or e-books, it sometimes felt like I was spending more time editing than actually practicing German. I think it would be nice to still have those activities but maybe not as many.",
                "By far the greatest strength was Frau Schenker's devotion to teaching, and its manifestation in reliable feedback and clear instructions. If anything, I wish she had been more prompt in posting powerpoint presentations such that students could review course material with them.",
                "Strengths: Interactive learning experience.\r\nWeaknesses: It is hard to learn the language if you like/are used to formulaic approaches. No organizing charts are used to learn the cases, endings, etc. It is also hard to keep track of everything that is due each week because there are so many little assignments that frequently change between weeks. Might've benefited from doubling down on learning vocabulary rather than so much of a focus on Ubungen."

Especially with professor Schenker.\r\nYou will be very engaged and will learn to care about a random character named Nico and his journey. Trust me, you'll relish German 110. The final project was very fun and there was so much room for creativity!\r\nWhat a great course.\r\nJust beware of the busy work. Although, I would be cautious about calling it a high workload because if you can manage to do it quickly, it's definitely manageable. This course will not take over your life:)",

                "Absolutely! The German Department as a whole is a wonderful and welcoming environment. L1 especially is approachable and has wonderful professors willing to help you get started with both the language and learning German culture.",
