                "I got to read works from a wide variety of acclaimed Japanese authors, critically discuss these works with peers, and analyze them.",
                "I read a lot of Japanese literature!",
                "I went into this course not knowing anything about Japanese literature and came out with a nice understanding of some of the themes that Japanese authors grapple with. Since it has been some time that I have taken a literature course, this class was a great way for me to redevelop my critical thinking skills and ability to analyze text and underlying messages.",
                "This course honed my skills in literary analysis as well as my ability to contribute to more elevated discussions about literature. I think that I came out of this course a better writer but also a more open-minded reader. I learned that my instincts about the meanings of literature as well as someone elses completely different ones could be simultaneously correct (or incorrect, I suppose). This course also helped me develop skills in writing longer essays \/ responses in shorter time frames (within a few days to a week, as opposed to within multiple weeks).",
                "I learned to analyze literature and practiced communicating my thoughts through both discussion and writing.",
                "I really enjoy reading the selection of texts for this seminar. The short responses help me focus on one aspect of each book more in-depth. Reading other students' responses also helps me formulate thoughts for the class discussion. The seminar opens with a couple of rather heavy readings from post war Japan. I like the selection from the later part of the semester better, but that is just a personal preference. This seminar introduces me to a few writers that I like - Tsushima Yuko, Ogawa Yoko, and Tawada Yoko. Their Territory of Light, Memory Police and Memoirs of a Polar Bear are my favorite from the reading list, respectively.",

                "No huge weaknesses, but would be interesting to work in more historical context, especially on weeks where the text is not generating enough organic discussion to fill the two hours.",
                "Good course!",
                "Great class but would be nice as a smaller seminar.",
                "This course was nice and engaging and chill. If possible, an later course time would be preferred. Really like the discussion layout.",
                "Strengths: excellent selection of texts, final paper abstract due early to prevent procrastination\r\nWeaknesses: none I can think of",
                "I think the course would be better suited to a twice a week format, with less reading per session. It was often hard to discuss an entire book in two hours, but the length of time meant we spent a lot of time on broad details and little time getting specific. I enjoyed the class as a sort of book club\/way of encouraging myself to read these amazing texts, but the class discussion could get pretty rambly just because there was so much time.",
                "strength: I honestly thought all the books were really interesting even if I didn't agree with the message. I never really found myself bored by the text but that could also be just the fact that a lot of the themes and history were novel to me.\r\n\r\nweakness: I dont think that class had any major weakness. Since its a seminar, class flow really depended on the students\r\n\r\nOne recommendation would be to maybe do an intro slide that situates the text, historically. Or maybe directing students towards resources that do that since the history is so integral to the different novels.",
                "Overall the books were very interesting and a pleasure to read. Most discussions were pretty fruitful as well. The book are pretty varied in style and subject as well so no matter what you like there is a book in the syllabus together. The only improvement is that the syllabus could have been more tied together\/could have built more off of itself.",
                "Although I thoroughly enjoyed this course, there would be occasional lags in discussion for some readings, while for other readings, it felt like there was not enough time to discuss them all. And even though I enjoyed almost every work on the reading list for this course, I think that some of them could be cut in exchange for some of the works having more than one class dedicated to them.",
                "The strength of this course was that the readings were relevant and always fun to read. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "I think this course could be improved with some supplemental readings about Japanese literary history. We were not given very much context on any of the book we read. I think a lot of the discussions we had about particular books were flat and one-note because we did have the full context to understand aspects of the book.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goddard is amazing at facilitating discussions, and the reading list is really good and pretty varied.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings can be brutal to complete, since we go through a book a week, and I also would have appreciated more feedback from Professor Goddard earlier in the semester, like on the Response Papers (even if the feedback is very short). I also wanted to hear more from him during class, since I often wanted to know what he thought about the readings or questions we were discussing.",
                "I really like the structure of this course! The short essays help disperse the workload over the semester while one longer final essay gives the student to explore their favorite work more in-depth. The free-flowing discussion in class in less formal format is quite fun for me too.",
                "The books were fun, the discussions were great, and the professor is incredibly kind and helpful. One thing to improve would be directing discussions towards a slightly more literary analysis of the texts. I felt that too much time was spend talking about plot details or discussions of basic themes, and I think there is room for more close reading, discussion of character and thematic development, of language and imagery, of tone and narratorial style, etc. But the discussions were still a lot of fun."

                "I would recommend the course for the books, but I think the people who got the most out of it were probably the ones with some background on Japan\/Japanese literature. Otherwise, it could be difficult to analyze the books with limited knowledge of the broader context.",
                "I would totally recommend this course to another student. I think there is a book for everyone and it was fun having discussions with other students. I thought the professor did a great job in facilitating class discussion and it felt like a very welcoming space to throw ideas and opinions around.",
                "Yes! The books are fun to read and the workload is not too bad.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although the readings were weekly, they were almost always very manageable, and the structure of the course (for undergraduates) permitted some weeks where the student would not need to write a response \/ essay each week. The readings were for the most part very accessible  or if they were not accessible, they would be equally inaccessible and bizarre for any reader. This class was truly a wonderful experience that I would recommend for a student of any major or background.",
                "I would say that this course has a lot of ways to improve. Sometimes it felt like a book club because we were not given much guidance about the books themselves. In this way, I probably would not recommend this course.",
                "I would. It is an extremely cool opportunity to read through a wide range of modern Japanese literature and be exposed to many different authors and themes. I had very little prior experience with literature from the country before, and felt like I learned a tremendous amount. Although I would recommend this to another student, I want to note that they definitely need to budget time into their schedule to be able to complete the weekly readings (a book a week) and response papers (300-500 words every week), which was difficult.",
                "I would recommend this to another student, especially if they just enjoy reading. As someone just taking this seminar for my own intellectual curiosity, I really enjoy this reading list, especially towards the later half of the semester when the lesser known, more contemporary female writers emerge.",
                "Yes! This is a really fun class, the discussions are very enjoyable, and the books are very interesting."
