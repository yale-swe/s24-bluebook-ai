This would help individuals, such as myself, to learn content more easily and allow for more creative connections to aid in memorization.",
                "Roberto Ferrini was an incredible teacher that made this class extremely fun and engaging. I always felt very involved in the lesson, and having class everyday definitely hammered the language into my head. I dont believe there are any inherent weaknesses in this class, I thought it was wonderful, and I am excited to continue Italian with Roberto next semester.",
                "I think more student speaking would be good",
                "Honestly all great. Loved the chill atmosphere and fun time we had in class, while still learning a ton.",
                "strengths- very relaxed class atmosphere, made it easy to participate and be engaged during class; I learned a lot of Italian just in one semester\r\nweakness- the textbook is required to participate in the class and is extremely expensive",
                "The course is extremely engaging and you learn a lot in a short period of time. I think this applies to all L1 classes but the class was fairly self-taught and then we review in class. While the class review was very helpful, and while going through the information beforehand was also helpful, it would be useful to have more concepts be taught during class time."

Italian is such a wonderful language to learn, and Roberto makes doing so fun! It was definitely one of my favorite classes this semester!",
