                "The strengths of the course were the breadth of the material being discussed and the professor's ability to ground all of the material in the evidence from published economic papers. A weakness of the course is sometimes the depth of the material was not substantive as I would have hoped -- we often answered the question about what was happening and backed it up with economic evidence, but didn't always discuss why it was happening.",
                "The strength of this course is Prof. Tsyvinsky. He brings a level of knowledge that is unmatched, a deep enthusiasm for economics, and a true enjoyment of teaching. He made seminar engaging and tailored our class to student interest. No weaknesses!",
                "Prof. Tsyvinksi's broad knowledge is undoubtedly the strength of the course. The class hinges upon his facility with the broad, loosely connected range of topics we address. Sometimes, the class feels unfocused, but every lecture is interesting, and he is able to articulate complex topics clearly for students of all experience levels.",
                "The course was well structured to allow student input. Prof. Tsyvinski listened to what students wanted to learn about, welcomed asking questions and encouraged students to write their papers on topics that they were passionate about. Readings were manageable and interesting.",
                "Great course. Could be improved by clarifying arbitrary grading standards",
                "Strengths: Prof Tsyvinski is absolutely amazing. A few times during the course, he mentioned that this course reaffirmed his faith in learning\/education due to the small size and engagement, but I think it was actually the opposite -- Prof Tsyvinski reaffirmed all our faiths in learning. He is a professor who is truly passionate (and extremely knowledgeable) about his subject matter, and chiefly cares about imparting and discussing his (really interesting) insights with us. The course is designed to have two main papers that constitute our grade, but Prof Tsyvinski always stressed how these were only avenues for us to explore what interests and excites us. The class also had a casual, laid back atmosphere, and made me look forward to Thursday afternoons.",
                "strengths: engaging, enjoyable discussion format, interesting topics, assignments tailored to interests\r\nweaknesses: honestly none. This class was very well designed and executed."

It felt like a conversation some of the time, which was great to put in the larger presentations during the seminar format. The presentations that Professor Tsyvinski gave were incredibly substantive and organized and were always uploaded before the class meeting. A way that it could be improved was digging deeper into the way aspect to a lot of the data and evidence we analyzed.",

This is a great course to discover and develop macroeconomic theory and to find different aspects of the macroeconomy that you are particularly interested in and may have a passion for pursuing more research later on.",

The readings are very interesting, the seminars are honestly just chill and fun and informative in the best way possible, but Prof Tsyvinski is the highlight - he selects pertinent readings, explains them and general economic concepts really well (which I would expect to know, but someone most classes at Yale focus on theoretical stuff as opposed to actual real world scenarios). He is also just an absolute joy to have in class, really kind and very passionate and knowledgeable about his subject matter",
