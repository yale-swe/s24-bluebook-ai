   "comments": [
    "Increased appreciation of familiar texts and discovering new, under-discussed playwrights, enhancing my close reading and engaging in thoughtful class contributions",
    "Improved understanding of the American theatrical tradition from 1852-2001.\r\nImproved critical-analyrical writing skills.\r\nImproved understanding of dramatic theory.\r\nInsights into different perspectives from students who do not study at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze plays in their holistic sense, rather than just pieces of text, even when you're approaching them from the perspective of written word.",
    "I became very comfortable with identifying motifs in modern drama, and also learned how to analyze different aspects of drama.",
    "I have been training to be an actor for years now and the one skill I've always felt I lacked was true analysis of characters and plays, and more than anything I feel I developed an ability to look past simply the lines of a character to find out their intentions and motives.",
    "I learned a lot about the form of drama, and how to read or watch a play intelligently.",
    "I've created a foundation for theater analysis since this was my first theater class, so now I will be able to comprehend plays from the text and the stage production.",
    "I gained a knowledge of the history of American drama over the 20th century, along with an improved eye for analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course effectively built in the previous knowledge and learning of the prior lesson, texts and authors",
    "Strengths:\r\nDiversity and breadth of readings assigned.\r\nEngaging lecture content.\r\nEnsured pre-class participation through Canvas discussion.\r\nLively classroom discussion through significant participation requirement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nCan't really think of any - it was a very good course.",
    "The balance of readings, video lectures, and in-class discussions worked well.  The canvas discussion was a great tool for online learning -- I only wish people had engaged more with other students' posts rather than just posting their own reflection.  Class discussions worked as well as they could work over Zoom.  Prof. Robinson likes to talk a lot -- which was great because I learned a lot from him, but I also think that some students may have had trouble edging into the discussion.  Prof. Robinson also gave really kind and helpful feedback after the first paper.",
    "The video lectures could be more engaging, they often felt more like a summarization of our reading than something that would help engage thought processes.",
    "This is a great course. It obviously would be even more fun in person, but the online format worked well. The lectures are good, and paired with the readings they give a lot of material to discuss and write about.",
    "The webinar aspect made it more difficult for all students to engage at an equal level."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend if they possess an interest in theatre or writing, but equally if they feel that they want to contribute with their own experiences and studies to the course",
    "Yes. It is accessible to all students, independent of their background in theatre or literature. Significant foundational emphasis on the basiscs of theatre exists in tandem with advanced theoretical explication. Professor Robinson is an excellent lecturer and is genuinely interested in your opinions on the texts he nominates: he is never dogmatic in section and invites discussion of and challenge to student perspectives. The course is also really well organised so it's easy to work ahead at your own pace, especially given the willingness of the Professor and TA to help with the papers.",
    "Yes! Prof. Robinson is excellent, the plays we read are all really interesting, and overall it's a great introduction to modern American drama.  The class was very accessible -- you definitely didn't have to have extensive prior knowledge of the theater world in order to get a lot out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another person. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and reading all of the plays.",
    "I would absolutely, to any student who wishes to learn about seeing between lines and drawing their own analytical conclusions.",
    "Absolutely, Professor Robinson is a great instructor who never fails to offer great insight to the readings and does a good job prompting further and deeper discussion of the plays we study in the course.",
    "Yes, great course! Professor Robinson is very organized and on top of Canvas modules, so if you're taking an online course this is a really good one. The readings are great (though they're all a little depressing) and the class really encourages you to think creatively about the form and questions of drama.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! Professor Robinson makes sure that students are really engaged with the source material and is always giving us multiple ways to look and analyze the plays.",
    "Yes!!! This is a fantastic course to get an overview of some incredible modern American plays, as well as to really dig into a few with the papers. If you really engage with the plays, lectures, and discussions, you will get a lot out of this class. Plus, Prof Robinson is great  knowledgeable, supportive, and very adept at leading discussion."
