                "The strengths of this course is that it is very interactive, everyone is supported regardless of their success that particular day or thus far in the semester, the class becomes a tight knit community in which everyone can stumble through and learn together without fear of judgement, there is constant feedback which allows everyone to get a little bit better every day, and it was incredibly fun which made me excited for class and more eager to learn.  While I know saying this seems naive and false because everything could be improved to some degree, I'm unable to provide any weaknesses in the course. Thinking back there is nothing I wish had gone differently or was disappointed in. It is a really well taught course.",

                "1000%. It can be incredibly daunting to tackle any new skill, especially a language. The frustration you can feel when you are unable to communicate can be immense (though a good thing to experience so you can relate to others outside the classroom). However, despite all of that, not only is Italian a beautiful language, but it is also taught in a way that is entirely approachable and makes you eager to learn. You will have fun with your classmates, a wonderful relationship with your professor, and honestly, before you know it, you'll be conversing fluidly in Italian and walk out of class realizing you understood everything that was discussed. It is truly empowering, and I would recommend this course to anyone.",
