                "Knowing how to recognize and analyze visual culture in regards to architecture.",
                "I learned how to analyze spatially and thought about how place/space affects people. I learned about various cities and their histories and about architects and how various thinkers described cities and urban environments over history. We also did some collages and analyzed them.",
                "This course taught me so much about thinking architecturally and the way that urban environments transmit messages about the various visions and societal aims possessed by the city. Our wide-ranging discussions affected the way I experience indoor and outdoor spaces every day and I find myself considering the impacts of individuality and revivalism on architectural significance throughout New Haven. This knowledge not only of our host city but of some of the principal theories and goals in architecture has been highly valuable in understanding how space impacts experience.",
                "The breadth and depth of this course gave me so much insight into the world of architecture. The readings, while extensive, helped me become more accustomed to a heavier reading load and taught me how to manage it. Also, it was a great way to start the semester by getting exposed to New Haven and Yale's resources.",
                "As a first-year seminar, the course was a great introduction to the study of architecture and I really appreciated the direction of the course that introduced concepts about how places are shaped and used through the contexts of a case study city each week.\r\nI began to understand the process of analyzing buildings and appreciating the way that they engage with the city around them.",
                "I developed the ability to evaluate cities, structures, and places at a range of perspectives. I learned about the process of city planning and the considerations that are taken when creating the \"just city.\" I also gained the ability to find connections between cities, artists, and styles.",
                "I learned how drastically cities are transformed by architecture and urban planning. Successful architecture reflects the needs of the community it serves; specifically examining how design affects a cities culture, economy, and community.",
                "I learned about the social understanding of architecture. I also was able to express an artistic side through the different projects.",
                "I learned a lot about architecture, even though the class was so much more about urbanism. That was not an unpleasant surprise, but I don't think I had realized that going into the class. We got direct feedback on our collage projects, but the feedback was incredibly unerringly positive in the group setting. I probably could have learned from receiving grades and written critical feedback on the collage projects, but in general, Surry was so clear about communicating deadlines and expectations!",
                "This course introduced me to a new perspective through which to view the city and urban environment around me. I truly look at the design, layout, and functions of cities and public spaces differently and greatly appreciate this new insight from studying the urban frameworks of various global cities.",
                "I developed critical thinking skills on the spot, a lot of our classes were centered around analyzing the photo or situation at hand, so we were pushed to think on the spot about how the case was relevant to our overall topic for the week/semester.",
                "I learned about historical and recurring issues in different urbanizing cities, from New Orleans to New Haven.",
                "I learned how to analyze art and architecture in relation to spatial justice, history, and the city. I also developed an understanding of how to tackle long and complex readings within short time periods and incorporate them into our seminar discussions.",
                "In this seminar I learned about the aspects of a \"just city\" and spatial justice. We explored of places such as New Orleans, Los Angeles, and New Haven throughout our readings. I learned general aspects of architecture styles but also how to think critically about spaces.",
                "I strengthened my skills in research, writing, communication, and thinking. This class allowed me to change my thinking and develop knowledge in different areas. The class, discussions, visuals, and projects allowed hard work to pay off. I learned a lot from this course."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The discussion between students\r\nWeakness: three hour classes are too long; it was overall very draining",
                "Strengths: a lot of the readings were very interesting and engaging, and thinking about cities, urbanism, and the built environment was enjoyable for me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the three-hour format was sometimes tiring and it was often hard to stay engaged for the entire time.",
                "Strengths: Some of the biggest strengths of this course included its focus on visual analysis (examining and discussing photos, visual art, diagrams and designs), weekly themes tying together architectural theories, development of architectural storytelling (collage projects and essay representing a specific space), class format (weekly seminar with more time to develop ideas), and the inclusion of films and texts which presented often conflicting ideas to form a larger conception of the just city. Assigned weekly readings were also hugely helpful in contextualizing the information contained during class time into a broader historical narrative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Our discussions often focused on urban and social theory beyond architecture, which was interesting and highly valuable, but I would have loved to have a bit more time dedicated to design theory and the specific intersections between architecture and its urban context.",
                "Overall well rounded, low stress, and allowed for more engaging development of ideas and a better learning environment. One weakness however would be the length of the class. I think that while manageable, it can be hard to be fully engaged the entire time. I think small breaks would greatly improve this.",
                "Surry mentioned that he had moved the class from being a formerly biweekly class to a studio format weekly three hour-long class. Although this gave the opportunity to do a screening, people did begin to burnout and I think there would've been a greater level of class engagement if classes were briefer and more frequent.\r\nThe readings each week were fascinating and I really enjoyed these.\r\nThe collage assignments were incredible to do and to see what others did. I think this was one of the best elements of the class.\r\nPerhaps it would've been beneficial to request students to view the screenings in their own time to permit for greater discussion in class.\r\nThe tour around the New Haven streetscape was great for a first-year who's just arrived and incredibly informative, grounding my understanding of the university I'm at with knowledge of the buildings around me.\r\nI think that a really important improvement should be delivering students their grades for each assignment on Canvas so they can keep track of their progress.\r\nSeeing as 25% of the grade was participation, it would also be good to receive participation evaluations/grades every three weeks or so, so one can understand if they need to up their game in the classroom.",
                "Be ready to read. This course is as engaging as you want it to be.",
                "I believe this course provides students with a fantastic lens to analyze cities, but one weakness is the scheduling of the class. I think three hours is a bit too long, and the class would have been more engaging if the time was split into two classes a week.",
                "I think that more student engagement is needed. Right now the class is led by the professor, with it being led like a q&a session. I think that especially for how long the class meets there should be a discussion portion.",
                "Strengths: I really loved this course because we covered such a wide breadth of topics without losing any depth. I loved focusing on a new city each week. And the collage projects were very instructional without feeling like a burden, like papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because students are not assessed in a traditional form in this class, it's very easy to get away with not doing the readings. The quality of class discussions decreased significantly around the time when people started realizing that they did not have to do all the readings.",
                "I think it is great, maybe include a wider range of cities  Asia, Middle East, Europe",
                "Strengths: The depth of analysis of architecture and urban art was a fantastic learning experience and introduced me to a large range of social theory. \r\nWeaknesses: Although just once a week, the three-hour seminar could at times feel rather long and I would find myself occasionally disengaged with the course material. Additionally, the course seemed to veer towards critical urban theory and art history at times when I had hoped for more emphasis on a basic understanding of architecture. Especially considering this was a first-year seminar meant for students with no background in architecture, I would have liked for the first or second class sessions to have at least done a brief overview of architectural history and concepts through which I could apply an understanding to the later analysis required later in the semester.",
                "The strengths were that we really went in depth with the material each class and i enjoyed how the video sessions gave us a more personable look at each of the cities we were learning about. A weakness of the course was the length and lack of variety in the coursework. Each class was up to 3 hours, which is a very long time to stay seated and almost impossible to be engaged the entire time. I would have appreciated if we had an expectation of how long the class would last for because it would seem to go on until our professor was finished, also if it was going to last the full 3 hours, that we would have a break (or two) during the class. As for the lack of variety in coursework, in class we were mostly just responding to questions from the professor (like a lecture), not really engaging with our classmates (which made it difficult to get to know each other, and I feel like I really didn't even know everyones name in the class by the end of the semester). Lastly, the readings were very long and not always relevant to what we talked about in class, if the readings were shorter and more relevant, I would have been more eager to read them.",
                "Strengths: teacher facilitated discussions\r\nWeaknesses: 3-hour seminar that met once a week",
                "Great class discussions and remarkable connections across time and space. The essays and projects of the course aim to encourage group work and collaboration, as well as emphasize the importance of discovering New Haven and relating readings to practice.\r\nAs for weaknesses, there were times where we were not able to get to all the points made in the weekly readings because of their density, though all were very interesting to read about. Also, it were discussions that I was not able to participate in as much as I would have hoped, but this was usually because of my own lack of knowledge about architecture.",
                "There were many strengths in this course. I loved the class outline for this course. Having discussions and projects allowed creativity and collaboration to mix perfectly. The incorporation of presentation slides into class discussions allowed me to gain new perspectives and ways of thinking."

                "Yes, if you like architecture",
                "Yes. I really do feel like I learned a lot about cities and the urban environment, and it definitely teaches a different way to describe and think about cities and spaces. It's definitely a good course if you're thinking about architecture or urban studies, and the discussions and readings are all enjoyable. The biggest issue was definitely staying engaged for a full three-hour seminar.",
                "Absolutely! If you are generally interested in architecture or urbanism, or if you'd like to learn more about the human construction of space, this class is hugely instructive in thinking about the messages influencing, and in turn originating from, the modern city. Readings were fascinating and class discussions were engaging - 3 hours is a long time for discussion but this time allowed us to explore new methods of analysis, with a walk of New Haven and several film screenings coming to mind. It was also amazing to learn about the process of visual and creative storytelling through essay work and collaborative collage discussions. Like others who took this course, I wish the semester was longer and am hoping to take multiple further architecture courses next semester and beyond, even considering a possible major in the field!",
                "Yes, it is a perfect first-semester class. A great way to get introduced to yale.",
                "For sure. For anyone interested in architecture, urban studies, or any humanities subject for that matter, it's a great intro course where ideas are discussed freely. The challenge of analysing the architectural context of places over the spans of space and history was incredibly enjoyable and such honed analytic skill could be then adapted to many other fields of study.",
                "This was my favorite course of the semester. Staying engaged was always easy and I never felt nervous to contribute to discussion. Anything taht anyone said in class further developed the discussion and overall learning.",
                "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, it was my favorite class this semester. I think this course was the perfect combination of analytical thinking and writing and creative exploration and experimentation.",
                "One of the coolest courses I took at Yale. The fact that it was a first-year seminar made the class so enjoyable because it created a low-stakes environment in which I could learn about an interest of mine that doesn't necessarily factor into my major. Architecture is just so interesting, and although this class has far more of an emphasis on urbanism than I had expected, I still enjoyed it so much.",
                "Yes, this class is a great introduction to allow students to think about the history, culture and social aspect of cities and architecture.",
                "If you have the time and willingness to read ~100 pages of architectural analysis and social theory a week and have a knack for thinking and visualizing in abstract ways, this class is perfect for you. You get out of this course what you put in  which is usually a lot of reading and time for critical analysis.",
                "I would not recommend this course to other students because of the length of the class and that it didn't feel very engaging. Most of the architecture or urbanism elements were very Eurocentric and was not very diversified (with an exception to a few classes where we talked about Japan and New Orleans (and New Haven) which included discussions of communities of color). I would recommend this class to people who are interested in learning about how architecture influences the built environment and communities within and around it, which I agree is a very interesting topic--but the method of teaching was not adequate.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the relationship between people and cities. The workload isn't super bad, but you do have a lot of readings. The collage projects we worked on made the class so worth it!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, especially to first-year students looking to learn about and understand New Haven!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in architecture. I think this was a great, and broad, intro to different architectural styles and more importantly a very good class to learn how to think of a city critically (historically, especially in terms of spacial justice and experience).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I feel the course inspires interest in Architecture. The course allowed creativity to prosper and I loved so many aspects of it."
