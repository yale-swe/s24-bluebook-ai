    "I felt like I wasn't really being instructed on grammar or vocabulary, it was just incidental to class discussion of the texts. But when the tests came we were being evaluated mostly on grammar and vocabulary and the themes and plot points of the texts were incidental to the exam. The \"Course Packet\" felt more like an extended study guide despite the fact that its intended use was as the lesson material.",
    "I liked how organized and clear the syllabus was. I was able to plan my studying schedule accordingly and it allowed me to complete work in advance.",
    "Strengths: reading material, grammar books, breadth of information in course. Weakness: not enough speaking in class (too much time spent on grammar), not enough varied discussions."

    "I would if you want to learn French because I don't think there's a better way to learn French. However, it is not a very well-structured course and the \"Course Packet\" hindered my learning more than it helped.",
    "I would recommend French 4 as a course for those who are interested in learning French for fluency. It is a very difficult course, and therefore one should not take the course if they do not want to speak French well. It is not a course one should take to just fulfill language requirements."
