                "My seminar participation became much more skillful, in my opinion: the seminar was full of really smart students, and I learned when to hold back and how to make my points effectively. Charles helps you in this way. I learned how to evaluate and critique philosophical arguments with rigor and charity. I learned how to write and think in an entirely new and exciting way. I studied texts that blew me away.",

                "My class with David taught me the basics of ancient philosophical thought, running briskly but engagingly past the ideas of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Epicureans, and postclassical thinkers. At a primitive level we were introduced to various key starting points of philosophical discussion which we had the opportunity to develop and debate in class, such as whether knowledge is attainable, the existence and nature of God, the basic foundation of reality, etc. Most of all, I think David taught me to break down arguments into their constituent premises and dissect them by evaluating their foundational assumptions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I think the philosophy strand does a particularly good job of having a manageable and worthwhile reading load.  I also think DS does a great job with writing support.  Lastly, David Charles is an incredible professor.\r\n\r\nI think the shift between the Plato and Aristotle readings and the other readings was a little abrupt-- we went from spending weeks on one philosopher to suddenly reading four different philosophers in one week.  The course could be improved by adjusting this balance and pacing a little.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I wish we had more of an introduction to philosophy at the beginning of the course, especially since some students came into the course with prior philosophy knowledge while others didn't.  We got a few handouts on how to write a philosophy paper, but for the first few weeks I felt confused as to what philosophy actually is.  It's true that you have to learn some skills by doing them, but I would have benefitted from a little more advice and explanation: what are the goals of philosophy, and what are its methods?  what things should you be looking for when you read a philosophy text?  what kinds of things should you be getting at during class discussion?",
                "The lectures should focus more on developing a macro-view of the development of the course. The religious thinkers need more introduction and qualification, because they are very different, but also similar to the Greeks in important ways that I think, if explicated, could have positively influenced our discussions.",
                "Good small class size and teacher engagement",
                "There are no weaknesses!  I loved every minute of this course!",
                "The lectures for philosophy were particularly useful compared to my other DS sections, as the philosophy texts often require more guidance to fully comprehend. I really enjoyed the seminar discussions because hearing the views of my classmates would often cause me to question my own views on a certain philosophical issue. I did find that the reading load varied more from week to week in philosophy than the other DS strands, which made it more difficult for me to plan my time accordingly and ensure that I completed all the reading.",
                "The greatest strength is that David Charles instructs the class. His knowledge on the subjects discussed is outstanding, and his ability to create an inclusive class should be something all instructors should strive for. The only weakness I can think of is that it was not a longer class, as I thoroughly enjoyed each minute spent in it.",
                "Evidently the circumstances of this year affected my experience of the course in such a way that it would be difficult for me to say what a \"normal\" experience would be like: online zoom seminars lack the immediacy of face-to-face interaction. Certainly the quality of my engagement was lower than what it would have been during an in-person class. Structurally, I lamented the fact that so much of the course, by the very nature of the syllabus, operated at a surface level; we had so many thinkers to get through that much of the ideas could only be remarked on briefly and discussed in one or two classes.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the discussions we had in this class. Professor Charles was really good at creating an environment where those discussions could occur and prompting us to think critically about the works we read, to make the discussions fruitful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As I understand it this is a weakness of the entire DS Philosophy section, but I found the initial minimal guidance on how to write a philosophical essay was detrimental to my work.",
                "Strengths - The material was very interesting and the seminars allowed us to really dive deep into the material and ask great questions.\r\nWeaknesses - There wasn't a ton of support on the analytic writing end, which made the papers difficult."

I firmly believe it would be impossible to leave this class without feeling excited about philosophical ideas, and have found myself returning to the issues discussed even after class has ended.",
