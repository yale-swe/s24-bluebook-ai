                "I learned a lot about what it means to be a capitalist economy, and the different things that could mean. In looking at different areas of the world, I became a lot more fluent in economic vernacular, and well versed in comparing different economies and how they've come about.",
                "I gained exposure to texts that are fundamental to comparative politics and political economy. I learned about the different forms of welfare states and their historical development, the politics surrounding welfare reforms, as well as structures of parties and employer/labor interest groups. Then the course helped me apply these theoretical concepts to case studies of specific countries, especially Germany, Britain, and Sweden, as well as specific events, such as the Euro crisis and the migration crisis.",

            "comments": [
                "Really fascinating content taught in a well-organized, digestible way. Lack of contact with teacher (given asynchronous recorded lectures) a bit of a weakness, but TA's were generally strong.",
                "One of the primary weaknesses of this course is that there are no prerequisites listed when in fact the readings are quite dense and use a fair amount of economic language. I thought it was somewhat unfair to expect students to have familiarity with financial systems and macroeconomics without any sort of basic introduction to those concepts at the beginning of the course. For that reason, there was a definite divide in section between students with no background in economics and students who had obviously taken advanced economic courses. Next, the course was poorly organized at times, with lectures and readings named different things. I think that could be easily fixed by taking advantage of the Modules tab on Canvas. I believe the course also advertises itself as doing more than it does. When students think of Capitalism and Crisis, I think they anticipate material which is a bit more engaging and which includes other perspectives more relevant to the pandemic and current financial crisis. The focus on only a few advanced industrialized economies was at times a bit dull and could be seen as perpetuating the idea that the world has to learn from advanced (Western) industrialized economies and not vice versa. Overall, I think the reading was often too long and the lectures unnecessarily detailed. Overall, I think the material could be very interesting but the design of the course hindered my ability to appreciate that material at times.",
                "Strengths: my TA was super, super helpful when it came to understanding the content. The exams are also super fair and allow for a lot of flexibility in that you get to choose which questions to answer. The workload is not too bad and Professor Mares' lecture slides summarize information in a very succinct and helpful way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings can sometimes be a lot for a week.",
                "The TAs are great and Professor Mares is a sweetheart. I also think the topic is really interesting and the course was well taught and organized well. The syllabus made a lot of sense. I think that the discussion sections were painful to sit through though because no one wanted to talk, so I felt bad for my TA",
                "Strengths: Exams were manageable, and the content was great.\r\nWeaknesses: A little too much reading.",
                "Strengths: the readings were very well-selected and always directly complemented the lectures. There was a good balance of theoretical texts fundamental to comparative politics and specific case studies that are somewhat easier to understand. Professor Mares' lectures were very organized: although there were a lot of slides, she always had a clear outline and made sure to point out how the readings for that week are relevant. The course covered a lot of material, but for the most part, I found the concepts fascinating.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the guest lecture on Brexit was particularly relevant to the course.",
                "A strength of the course is that it focuses on countries in which one can clearly identify and compare differences in political and economic structures. It puts all material taught in perspective which creates a holistic image how and why corporatists institutions were formed and what were their implications.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that some of the readings were way too long or technical which made them hard to follow. Lectures were also sometimes too dense in information; the content in one lecture could be better spread out.",
                "Recorded lectures made the course difficult to engage with, but the content was still well organized and easy to study",
                "Great material",
                "At the beginning of the semester the recorded lectures were very long. They were supposed to be 50min but some were 1h 25min, which made motiviation to watch the lecutes decline, but it improved during the semester. There were a lot of difficult terminology that sometimes made it hard to follow the lectures and sections.",
                "The course assignments are straightforward, but they require significant engagement with the course readings. Professor Mares' lectures are clear and connect with the readings of the week. Particular points that the professor expected students to know may know have been emphasized enough in particular lectures, but the content throughout the lectures was meaningful.",
                "One strength of this course was its ability to start at a point where everyone could understand the basics without prior knowledge, but then really diving deep into the material once we felt equipped. One weakness is a result of the times; I wish we could have asked Professor Mares questions during lectures, which we couldn't because they were recorded",
                "A strength is that there are a lot of interesting things to learn, and the comparisons were very enlightening. A weakness is that the lectures were very boring and always went significantly over time, which is not fair. Some of the content, especially the historical aspects seem irrelevant and just confusing, and the lecture slides were extremely disorganized, so it can be hard to follow along sometimes. My friend and I had to compare outlines to make sure we understood the same thing.",
                "It was a lot of conceptual economic information which can be difficult for non-economic majors to grasp at first. I recommend to those who take this class to definitely meet with the TAs and ask questions because once you sit down and talk about it, it's really not that hard to understand.",
                "The TFs were great and Professor Mares enthusiasm was clear. I also appreciated the weekly discussion posts, as they encouraged engagement with readings and ultimately benefitted my grade. The overall structure of the course was conducive to learning, however lectures were often rushed, ran well over the 50 minute lecture time, and were very dense. I understand that the online format was difficult, but it was very hard to stay engaged and follow lectures without having to pause frequently"

I think at first it may seem like a lot of information and bit intimidating, but the exams are really straightforward and fair and easy to do well on. The course is also organized in a logical and coherent way; everything sort of builds upon one another and a lot of the information is super fascinating. Sections are super, super helpful when it comes to this course because they really help clarify and connect the content. If possible, I highly recommend taking this course with Sander as your TA!",
                "Yes! A great introduction to the themes of comparative politics and  the world of welfare policies in Europe",
                "Yes! Take this class. Its a pretty chill one where they really want you to just learn and succeed rather than worrying about grades (like shell tell you the exam questions during the review). Every section was for our benefit as the TA tried to break down the reading into understandable chunks. The class really focused on teaching as the #1 priority and was really well organized",
                "I would. It's not extremely difficult, the exams are manageable, and it gave me a lot more information on a subject I was lacking in. It' worth your while.",
                "Absolutely. The concepts covered in this course, such as welfare state, firm organization, party formation, are incredibly fascinating and more relevant than I had previously thought. I also feel that the readings Professor Mares selected gave me a preliminary foundation and greater foundation to study comparative politics and political economy. The course selects case studies of countries to facilitate a better understanding of political concepts, but I liked that the course never dwelled on one country too much, and had a comparative approach throughout. The course could be much more enjoyable in a non-COVID semester though, with the opportunity for real student engagement during lectures.",

                "If they are interested in the EU or comparative political economy. I initially thought this class was more an overview of the social outcomes produced by capitalist structures, but is literally just a political economy class"
