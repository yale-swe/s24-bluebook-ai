                "Compared to the spring semester, this term focuses much more on contemporary issues and is in some ways more challenging, because students have to go one step beyond familiar academic analysis of problems and work to synthesize a new actionable strategy to solve them.",
                "An application of Grand Strategy to a really useful case study, whichever module you choose.",
                "Really loved the community we built in our module and the opportunity to think about big problems and strategy in a practical way",
                "I gained a holistic understanding of the challenges facing the movement to reform immigration. The readings and class discussions gave me knowledge of the recent history of the movement and its state today. I got to practice the skill of applying the theoretical framework of grand strategy to a specific contemporary problem, and I think this experience really enriched my understanding of grand strategy.",
                "This semester taught me both the discrete history of a salient strategic issue as well as the methodologies required to analyze its base issues and develop a plan going forward. I essentially participated in a nine member think tank. I entered the semester knowing little about my group's chosen issue--domestic immigration reform--but I left feeling fluent in both the history of immigration affairs and with clear strategic imperatives for the movement.",
                "I developed a strong understanding of strategic decision making",
                "I learned so much about the movement to reform American immigration  the electoral politics involved, the movement's long history, the current situation under Biden. I also practiced thinking strategically to propose a plan for the movement: identifying a North Star goal, confronting obstacles, cultivating a communications strategy. Our module was a very rewarding experience because Kica and Prof. Brenes made a great pair, and the two presentations we gave were rewarding. The small class size also allowed us to really explore the material. Additionally, writing up my paper using my summer research was a great opportunity to research a topic I am passionate about. As someone who comes from a somewhat theoretical major, I enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about real-world problems and think big about how to solve them..",
                "Deeper understanding of how to apply the lessons of Grand Strategy to real world problems at scale",

                "How to approach refugee policy reform and apply theories and frameworks from Grand Strategy towards specific policy issues.",
                "Grand Strategy provided me with the unique experience of evaluating and practicing policy formulations with my classmates. I enjoyed working on the final brief and presenting it to our instructors. Moreover, the additional programing--lectures, dinners with alumni and policymakers, and the summer project--were invaluable."

            "comments": [
                "The Grand Strategy program is the best course I have taken at Yale. Definitely apply if you are interested!!",
                "The small group nature of the modules was one of my favorite formats of any class at Yale, and our practitioner Kica Matos has been a massive personal, professional, and educational inspiration.",
                "Love the module style and the weekly reading responses, though sometimes tedious, did ensure that I read the readings thoroughly",
                "I thought the readings and class discussions were really enriching, and the summer research paper felt like a good length. I think the class gave me a really robust understanding of the current problem of U.S. immigration, particularly focusing on the immigrants who are already in the U.S. I do wish the class had devoted at least one week to discussing the question of border policy and how we can make a fair and sustainable system for processing people who are not yet here but want to come here. I felt like that was the biggest gap in our strategy briefing, and I think it would have been really useful when thinking about the challenge and potential solutions of immigration.",
                "This semester was designed incredibly well: we had a manageable and well-curated reading load, professors that cared, assignments that were about depth of knowledge rather than busy work, and a format that allowed us to meaningfully delve into our interests. Our final briefing assignment, for example, was only ten pages split among seven or more students. The assignment was about precision and prior design rather than throwing words on the page. The only \"weakness\" I suppose would be sometimes the seminar sessions followed by sometimes four hour long events. Shortening the excellent (but sometimes quite long and mandatory) outside class events would likely improve engagement.",
                "Strengths: Second semester GS exceeded my expectations! A major strength is the small module size. Last semester, with such a big class, discussions sometimes felt a bit stagnant. With smaller class size, I felt like us students could steer the dialogue and explore ideas in more depth. I enjoyed both of the major assignments (summer research project and strategy briefing)  it felt like an appropriate amount of work and I learned from both. Aaron was amazing, meeting with all of us to talk about our career plans  he's a real asset to the course and I think future TAs should follow his lead. Professor Brenes and the GS team do a great job with the dinners as well; Professor Brenes is a great interviewer of guests! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were very long and we wouldn't really touch on them in class anyway  I think making the readings shorter, and cutting out any readings that aren't essential for class discussion, would be great. Also, when we met as a big group  all of GS plus several professors  for class, the discussions lacked the same depth as the small group discussions. Sometimes it felt like nobody was on the same page, even about what GS is, and not in a good way. I have no idea how to fix this problem but I definitely think as much time in small groups as possible is ideal. I think I learned more about GS from *doing* grand strategy through projects and small group discussions, than from talking about it abstractly in a big circle.",
                "Strengths: Got to work closely with practitioners; small class size; very interesting and relevant content. Weaknesses: Readings for the great power competition module were almost entirely Foreign Affairs thinkpieces. It would have been nice to have a greater variety of readings, including more historical background and academic texts. Also, more guidance on the structure and format of the strategy briefing would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Guest professors, events, meals, class diversity",
                "Strengths: 1. Practical problem solving, with feedback from relevant experts. 2. Small classroom setting, opportunity to get to know your classmates and professors well\r\n\r\nHelpful to know that this course requires you to think about strategy in a very particular way defined by different practitioners definitions of grand strategy (which may be slightly or largely different). I think this push is welcome and helpful, but it is very different from what other Yale classes ask of you so be prepared to engage in this exercise and ask for continuous feedback if you hope to perform well on major assignments, and feel as though you've mastered the thinking expected here.",
                "I liked that this section of GS is split into modules. The smaller size made it easier to interact with everyone. I think a lot of prior knowledge is assumed, and it would be helpful to provide more background information. Additionally, the instructions for assignments were often unclear or nonexistent, so it would be helpful to have better guidelines for expectations for assignments.",
                "This course is amazing! I wish I could take it again!",
                "Having Professor Brenes and Professor Sky co-teach the module was a great way to approach both the historical and contemporary angles of refugee policy issues. The Grand Strategy program includes opportunities to meet with activists, policymakers, authors, and academics in small group settings, which was really exciting and helped inform how I thought about the policy issues we discussed in seminar. The second semester (in the fall) also involves breaking up into modules, with each one focusing on a specific policy area. I really enjoyed the smaller group setting.",
                "I thought that the Spring seminar could be improved. At the outset, students should be provided with a clear definition of Grand Strategy and some basic tools for considering the epistemological questions that arise in pursuing one strategy over another. I sometimes struggled to find continuities between the seminars, and felt that many of the invited guests/co-teachers used the opportunity to discuss their own academic niche rather than engage with the framework of Grand Strategy."

                "Definitely! Getting to hear from our practitioner, Kica Matos, every class was a unique experience that I haven't gotten in other Yale classes. I really enjoyed the smaller size of the class, which made for engaging discussions.",
                "Absolutely! Truly the best course I have taken at Yale. You will never learn more than in a ten person seminar (including professor and practitioner) that builds upon thoughtfully selected readings and the experience of someone involved in the movement. Our classes felt like thoughtful conversations amongst equals rather than some more didactic seminar models.",
                "Yes, I definitely recommend the grand strategy program to those interested",
                "Yes. I have some specific recommendations, though, that GS students can follow to make this semester as rewarding as possible. (1) Bond with your module group (going out to lunch after class, making a group chat early on in the semester). When it comes time to make the presentation, you'll be grateful you have a good relationship and rapport established. (2) If you're interested in immigration or social movements at all, pick Kica's module! I might be biased, but I honestly think that our group had the most rewarding experience. (3) Don't save the briefing prep to the last minute  ideally, use class time in the module from the beginning to throw around ideas for your strategy. (4) There's no need to be intimidated by the briefing presentations, but you should take them seriously, because some of the panelists take it very seriously as well and ask tough questions. (5) I wish I had taken better advantage of the Monday dinners. Sometimes I would be pretty fried after class, but I think they can be really rewarding if you read about the speaker beforehand and think of questions you're genuinely curious about..",

                "Yes and I have!",
                "I would recommend if the class sounds interesting to you, and the program sounds interesting to you. This requires a lot of time spent both on class work, and also preparing to meet with and hear from the many guest speakers who come outside of class time. I would suggest taking a less heavy course load while enrolled in GS if you really want to have the time to immerse yourself fully and perform well. But it may not be for everyone  talk to others in the program if youre unsure.",
                "Yes and no. I would recommend it to people who have a very clear interest in grand strategy and international relations. A lot of the knowledge I gained could have been gained from many other history or political science seminars.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone interested in actually learning how to change society.",
                "Yes. The Grand Strategy program was a highlight of my time at Yale. The cohort of students is one of the best parts of the class, as are the opportunities to do deep thinking on policy issues I care about. The opportunity to do funded independent summer research is also incredible. It pushed me to grow as a researcher and student, and will inform my work moving forward.",
