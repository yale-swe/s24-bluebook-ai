    "The ability to discern important pieces of information from dense texts, as well as discuss complex topics on the spot. Furthermore, it broadened my understanding of architecture and its functions beyond a space of inhabitation.",
    "I learned about the cultures and aesthetics of different world cities and the way they fit into the broader fabric of urban history. I learned about various architects and architecture critics who contributed to the ways we conceive of the city now.",
    "not only did i gain an understanding of how architecture frames every aspect of urban life, i (perhaps more importantly) learned the importance of visual literacy and the crucial ability to put what  I see into words",
    "How cities are designed"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the discussions we have in class, the interwovenness of course material, and the professor.",
    "This course is fairly loosely structured, but very intentional in its material and order. Learning how to function in a less regimented educational environment was challenging, and I could see how it could be frustrating for some people. I thought that the in-class slideshows were always so well curated and so smart. Surry is this classs greatest strength by far - he gives actionable and thought-provoking feedback and always directs the seminar in interesting directions.",
    "Strengths: The topics are amazing. If you are interested in architecture, you will love it. Also, the reading pieces (the ones I managed to read) were great! \r\nWeaknesses: Discussions are sometimes too vague and hard to follow. Might be better organized to help learning.",
    "strengths: surry is the best\r\ncovered a wide variety of cities, concepts and styles\r\nunpacked themes from multiple perspectives, not just academic architectural theory\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lot of reading (didnt feel like too much because they were all interesting) but we often didnt get to cover all of the ideas in the readings in class bc of quantity",
    "I did not know what was going on hardly ever. I know we were supposed to draw our own conclusions but at times it felt we were not reaching the right idea and I wish at the end of each week we could have plainly stated the takeaways everyone should have.",
    "Difficult to be engaged in discussions unless you are very artistic."

   "comments": [
    "If you are willing to do heavy reading and enjoy participating in class discussions, I highly recommend. Otherwise, the class is still great for learning about the greater effect of architecture on a city, and builds reading abilities substantially.",
    "Absolutely yes, so long as I thought  they could be sufficiently self-motivated to discern meaning from it.  I think everyone would benefit from thinking more critically about the spaces they inhabit.",
    "Yes. But please do the readings. Otherwise, you'll just be a visitor with some cool ideas.",
    "i think this should be a required class for all yale students. the class attracted mostly kids with preexisting interests in architecture, urban studies, and design, and so discussion was likely uncommonly spirited and stimulating, but I think everyone can benefit from Surrys ability to show how the built environment influences our lives in New Haven and elsewhere.",
    "Not unless you already know you enjoy architecture and urban studies.",
    "Yes -- it was a great introduction to architecture and urban theory. Particularly as a first-year student, Surry's thorough knowledge of and appreciation for New Haven also helped me more quickly understand the city beyond campus (his mid-semester New Haven walking tour field trip, for instance, was useful and informative)."
