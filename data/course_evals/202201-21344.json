                "Although it was cool to listen to people's theses and also get comments on one's own it got monotonous after a while. I wonder if there is a way to make this course more engaging and efficient. Just listening to presentations for 2h straight is not the most interesting.",
                "There was little support given to developing projects that were out of the scope of the professor's work, but overall I felt that the class was a very supportive environment. I wish there were some more objective guidelines and things to look for when writing the thesis.",
                "It's nice to hear about other people's projects, but I'd appreciate more of a small-group setting where we can be in more direct conversation with one another about our projects.",
                "It was great, wish we could have had it first semester.",
                "It was nice to see everyone's project as it was getting developed. I think it would have been better if presenters had included questions or areas they needed help on at the end of their presentations. Otherwise, it's hard to know if any advice the class gives is relevant.",
                "I honestly thing the Cog Sci senior colloquium would be better suited to the first semester of senior year. I would have really appreciated some accountability and feedback during earlier stages of my thesis, and while it was helpful to have a class that helped us finish up the project, it felt like I could not provide super honest feedback especially for students who presented near the end of the course. At that point, studies had already been run and data collected, so we couldn't productively suggest a change in the study design. Had the class happened first semester, we could have helped one another design studies with enough time to make changes.",
                "It was hard to find the syllabus and I felt like I never knew when deadlines were approaching until they were dangerously close. While it was nice to hear my peers talk about the work they were doing, I couldn't help but resent the fact that rather than spending those hours working on my own senior project each week, I was listening to other people talk about theirs. It would be nice if some colloquium days could just be work-on-your-own-project days. I will admit that presenting the project was helpful if for anything just to force me to organize my thoughts. I didn't find the peer feedback to be that helpful given that a handful of my peers and Dr. Almeida read and provided feedback on my essay. Perhaps having that deadline be slightly earlier and doing a little less feedback on the presentations would have been helpful.\r\nI also wish that like other majors, we had some final presentation on our work where we could invite our advisor(s), friends, etc. It seems like most other majors have this, and I certainly would have appreciated it. Or making each in class presentation something that we could invite people to."

                "I know this will probably fall on deaf ears because this course is a major requirement, but this class (along with the Junior Colloquium) is a complete and utter waste of time and the most useless class I have ever taken. There is no reason why Cognitive Science shouldn't function like any other major, which just has students complete their Thesis for a credit and not take a synchronous class while also completing their Thesis. This class sucked up 2 hours of my time every week for 13 weeks just so that I could get about 30 minutes of feedback that I didn't even end up using. I understand that it's a good idea to have intermediate deadlines and that it might be helpful to get feedback on your draft from your peers, but making students show up to a 2-hour per week seminar and be forced to sit there and participate is the least efficient and effective way to do this, and this course should absolutely be abolished and replaced with an end of year presentation and regular check-ins.",

                "While it was cool to learn about and discuss other classmates' projects, I think it would be helpful to have more 1 on 1 feedback with advisors in the area that the thesis is in to develop the project further.",
                "Cognitive Science majors have to take this course!",
                "It is required, but it was also really cool to see what my peers were doing. Cogsci feels like a really disconnected major at times, so it was nice to feel like there was some semblance of community in this major.",
                "Well, you don't have an option. If you take time off in which you plan to work on your project, I recommend trying to join the course. I think it comes a little late in the year given the nature of most people's projects (ie, you don't want to find out that the basis for your experiment is flawed, only a month before the project is due)."
