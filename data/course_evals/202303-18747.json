                "I learned a lot about local governance, specifically about New Haven. Everything I learned will impact me as a citizen both in New Haven and in future cities, and as a voter.",
                "About city planning, who makes decisions, social contract, social capital, wealth of cities, inequity, legitimacy, who has power, how to gain power.",
                "I developed insight into the ways in which cities develop, as well as the a unique perspective on the political aspect of a city's development. I was able to learn about both the physical and cultural aspects of cities, as well as catch up on current events with our beginning of class conversations.",
                "I learned a lot about how cities work and should work. Professor DeStefano brought a very different perspective to the seminar discussions on the school topic that I think elevated our perspectives and understanding of how cities and therefore society works.",
                "I learned so much more about the history of New Haven, cities, and city politics through this course. I learned about urban renewal, New Haven politics, policing, de facto/de jure segregation, urban planning, and town-gown relationships. Through the various weekly themes, we explored the wealth of cities, social cohesion, and the legitimacy of institutions. The class not only helped me understand these topics as important political and historical ideas but also helped me better understand the city in which I (and all of us) now live. I am proud to know much more about New Haven after taking this class, and the class teaches information that would be useful and beneficial for any Yale student."

            "comments": [
                "Strength  theres nothing like taking a class on a city with the man who ran it for two decades. He understands how politics ACTUALLY works in a way that almost all the ivory tower folks in the poli sci department dont. \r\n\r\nWeakness  to be blunt, Prof. DeStefano isnt great at sparking discussions that engage with the readings.",
                "I wish students prepared more for class discussions.",
                "The readings were incredibly interesting and class discussions were meaningful. The field trip Professor DeStefano took us on at the beginning of the course really wonderfully set the stage for the rest of the semester, and I think was an especially poignant experience for us all.",
                "Most of the readings were relevant and referenced to in the text, some of them I didn't find to be as useful  especially the reading about liberalism and how it has failed.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it allows personal ideas to develop with regards to current events and the readings. It also gives a unique ability to interact with New Haven which is very important. A weakness that could be improved is that it was quite frequently more similar to a lecture than a seminar. It is nice to hear Professor DeStefano's opinions, however such a long class is nice to have more time to develop your own ideas and maybe do something with those other than just share with the class. Maybe activities that mimic some of the things we read about would have been interesting.",
                "I think that the strengths are that it is designed to help the student learn and foster good conversations. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: This class was amazing. A couple strengths of the course were the weekly seminar discussions, the Fair Haven field trip, and the final paper. The seminar discussions were engaging and interesting, and students were encouraged to raise present-day, real-world issues in the context of the concepts discussed in class. I have not felt this same encouragement in other political science courses, and I took away insights that were broader than just the readings on the syllabus. Second, the Fair Haven field trip was a great opportunity to get a small window into the lives of New Haveners, see the course concepts in action, and visit a place that is often unexplored by the Yale community. Finally, I learned a lot through the process of writing the final paper. Professor DeStefano encouraged us to pick a topic of personal interest and conduct interviews with New Haven leaders and community members. This research process, and the writing process was exciting, interesting, and connected us to the city in which we live.\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: The Fair Haven paper could be improved. While the field trip was really interesting, the prompt and take aways felt too narrow to write something original afterwards. For the Ricci vs. DeStefano week, it could have been really interesting to bring in one of the firefighters on the opposing side of the lawsuit to hear both perspectives in the seminar."

                "Yes! Super interesting and engaging.",
                "Yes but dont expect to learn a ton about the readings.",
                "My experience was net positive, though bumpy. I wish we had more agency to explore and disagree. However, I felt constrained to using the buzzwords (social capital, legitimacy, and cohesion) in all my writing. Part of this was on me, to be firmer. \r\n\r\nHowever, this class was a good one. Professor DeStefano is wise. He has a clear sense of reality. He can be repetitious, which is a minor flaw. My one suggestion: Ask normative questions. Rather than: \"What did the author of this piece have to say?,\" ask, \"Did you buy Jacobs's claim that a city should be measured by XYZ properties?\" \r\n\r\nAnd, I now see New Haven in a different light, which I am grateful for.",
                "This is a really interesting course to take, especially if you're interested in New Haven/local governance more broadly. Professor DeStefano is incredibly knowledgeable and an incredibly valuable voice to have in the room.",
                "Yes, it was a great course, I learned a lot, and had fun getting to know our class and going on our field trip.",
                "I would recommend this course because I think it is very important for people to learn more about the institution we attend and its relationship with the city that hosts it. It is also very interesting to have a space in which we can talk about political developments in a very academic and raw way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to any political science major or someone whos interested in politics. I gained a lot of insight into society especially compared to other classes.",
                "YES. Take this class!!! It is so rare to find classes at Yale that are applied to real-world issues and help you better understand the city and community in which you live. Professor DeStefano was awesome  he was honest, direct, down-to-earth, and had incredible experiences to share. He was a better teacher than almost all of my professors that actually had PhDs. Students interested in political science, urban studies, American studies, or environmental studies would enjoy this class. Compared to some other political science courses I have taken, this one was much more solutions and action-oriented and left me feeling hopeful about the future of politics and policy in American cities. Having some prior knowledge of New Haven is helpful and makes the class much more interesting  if you genuinely care about New Haven, you will get more out of the class."
