This class opened my eyes to how integral Einstein was to all of physics, both relativity and quantum mechanics. This class is not a traditional physics class, as we attempt to look at the assumptions Einstein makes from his point of view rather that using predetermined, already-worked-out \"textbook\" derivations that aim to simplify and instruct. In many ways, the thought experiments and historical data used by Einstein were more important than the derivations itself, making this hybrid historical physics class unlike anything else found in the physics department."

In the end, this led me to understand the material better.",

                "strengths - I loved learning about relativity and Einstein's biographical information; weaknesses - I think we spent a bit too much time on thermodynamics and sometimes felt the course was difficult to follow, especially the readings",
                "Prof. Stone was adept at understanding Einstein's papers and had a great understanding of the historical timeline of Einstein's work. However, sometimes it was challenging following the derivations of the work done on the board, making it hard to understand the implications of Einstein's (and others') work.",
                "I feel like this course would be dramatically improved with a teaching assistant that hosted office hours. There is a lot of breadth content-wise in this course and having extra time outside of class to go over it would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nI feel like a document standardizing the notation across modern physics and the early twentieth century physics papers would be incredibly useful."

I am a non-physics major and took this course as an elective, and I found the course quite challenging at times and very rewarding throughout. Professor Stone is passionate about the material and that makes the classes engaging and fun. This is usually a very small seminar, which allowed for questions to be answered and discussions to be had.",
                "You need the math and science (thermo) background to do well.",
                "I liked the course material overall, but struggled a bit. If you're a physics major it could be a good elective, but it's definitely not a gut",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are interested in learning and appreciating Einstein's contributions to physics. This course is NOT a gut. The exams in this class are extremely tough because they weave in both physical derivation and historical memorization. It is truly unlike anything taught in either the physics or history department. But if you are interested in the historical narrative of physics, Prof. Stone is an expert in this field.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone if they already have a multivariable calc and basic statistics background and experience with maxwell's equations and thermodynamics past the intro sequences. The syllabus markets itself as a course that is for anyone, particularly nonphysics majors. However, this course covered so many topics that I feel like this marketing is simply misleading."
