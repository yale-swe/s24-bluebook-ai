                "I learned so much about not only the education system but also about developmental psych. I learned how to read scientific papers and think more critically about how we as students, educators and workers can better assist children. I was shocked by a lot of the findings in this course that despite seeming so basic are so significant.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the scientific practice that goes into thinking about how kids are educated, but also into how kids think and move about the world. We tend to think of things like creativity or persistence as innate, but it was interesting to think about how they come about or could be manipulated.",

                "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Instructor went the extra mile to facilitate connections of concepts to the real world as well as to brainstorm innovative solutions.

This class completely changed my perspective on this issue - reviewing many studies that discussed real world applications for academic interventions based on psychological research was truly rewarding and consistently fascinating.",
                "This course really motivated me to reconsider the ways in which we are educated and the ways in which we might be educated as backed by psychological research. Great for honing in skills regarding reading and thinking critically about scientific papers, designing experiments and interventions, and combining real life with lab-based science.",
                "This course helped me improve my critical thinking skills and reframed the way I approach scientific articles and journals. It provided me with a better grasp on the current state of the field of psychology"

                "Extremely engaging and helpful professor, interesting course material, structured really well. Could use a little more organization at times but that will surely come as the course continues to be taught and refined.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material filled with active learning, reasonable workload \r\nWeaknesses: tries to fit too much into one lesson and different sections of the seminar in a day can end up feel rushed/cut off even if discussion is really interesting",
                "I loved the way Professor Leonard organized this course.",
                "There are many strengths: Prof. Leonard is super kind, clear, and engaging. She achieved a great balance between \"lecturing\" enough to make sure we all had a good foundation for discussion and facilitating productive conversation. The weekly readings were appropriate in length and interesting, and weekly reading responses were low stakes and painless. Prof. Leonard provided thoughtful and prompt feedback on our reading responses before discussion without fail, and she always incorporated student comments/questions into her slides -- this made them feel worthwhile and not like busy work! The only weakness is that the question of bridging the gap between neuroscience and educational practice is a difficult one, and it felt difficult to cross that gap between big picture/practical questions and research in discussions. I would have appreciated more of a focus on the neuroscience side of things, but that is a personal preference and I know others in the class would disagree.",
                "I loved the style of lecture it was one day a week so its hard to get everything in. We didnt always get time to do research designs which I did wish. Other than that I loved how engaged the group was and how Professor Leonard pushed the discussion.",
                "I loved the conversational elements, and would have loved more free-flowing conversation at times.",
                "Professor Leonard runs a very structured class but not in a suffocating kind of way. Our weekly reading responses are thoroughly read and incorporated into our classroom discussion prompts. We also take the time to discuss each reading in class, so completing the reading never feels like a waste.",
                "Strengths - extensive seminar discussions, professor is very committed to class, grades quickly and is skilled at guiding conversations and preparing readings\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes we ran out of time because discussions or presentations ran too long",
                "ALL STRENGTHS. AWESOME COURSE. LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. \r\nOne thing several classmates mentioned is that for some of the neuroscientific papers the instructor walked us through criticism of the research methodology, how results were presented, etc. This was extremely helpful because I had only ever been presented neuroscience papers in the context of just accepting that they're true. So maybe more of these papers/walk throughs of criticizing/interrogating neuroscience heavy papers would be helpful.",
                "It was great",
                "The requirements for the weekly reading responses ensured that I was staying on top of the readings and was able to actively participate in class. Some of the papers that were assigned were a little difficult to grasp / not well written, and slightly more background information on developmental psychology may have been helpful toward the beginning of the semester.",
                "strengths\r\n-great and diverse readings\r\n-prof leonard is so excited/passionate which boosts engagement\r\n-incorporating your own educational and psychological experiences into constructing potential interventions\r\n-very discussion based\r\n\r\nno weaknesses",

Prof. Leonard is so wonderful -- she is really insightful and knowledgeable, but also intent on making the class as beneficial as possible to students. We received feedback every week on our reading responses, and helpful feedback on papers as well. And she is so kind and fun to speak with in class. I enjoyed learning about developmental science and it was an interesting exercise to try to apply research to practice on a regular basis.",

There's a reading response each week, two papers, which you prepare for early with outlines, and you give one presentation of a paper. It's also very interesting to learn about the variety of education other students have received and how that's shaped their opinions on schooling.",
                "YES! One of the best courses at Yale. Instructor is incredible and extremely engaging as well as supportive. All literature super interesting and chosen with care. Assignments are intellectually stimulating but spaced in a way which makes them manageable (it is evident a lot of thought and effort went into the course). Other Yale courses should emulate.",

Lessons are well structured to stimulate class discussion and everyone is given the chance to articulate their ideas. Highly recommend!",

Great for honing in skills regarding reading and thinking critically about scientific papers, designing experiments and interventions, and combining real life with lab-based science. Also, Julia is so engaged/passionate about the course, which creates a super inviting/supporting learning environment. She gave great feedback and was always open to our thoughts.",
