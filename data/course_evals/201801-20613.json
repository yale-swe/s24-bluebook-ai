    "A great course where you'll learn to really dive into course law and explore how intellectual property affects our modern lives through art and science and pop culture and more.",
    "Thorough background in IP in the digital age",
    "I learned a lot about intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, and various legislation that governs the current state of intellectual property.",
    "I gained basic knowledge about the tenets of American copyright law today. Learned a lot about intellectual property law, and the legal\/social interests driving cases",
    "How IP affects us and how its history has evolved through times. What is outdated and what needs to be changed.",
    "IP, how it has changed, and what we need to know given software.",
    "A working understanding of the way the law - especially intellectual property law - works!",
    "This class offered me a survey of IP laws in the U.S., giving me my first introduction to copyrights, trademarks, and patents. I learned to think critically about legal decisions and the fundamental philosophies that they boil down to.",
    "I learned how to approach and understand legal questions and reasoning. This class strengthened my writing and my ability to contribute to class discussion.",
    "Overview of intellectual property,  from copyright to patent to trademarks."

   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading, but it's really interesting. Definitely know how to read court cases coming into this or you will struggle.",
    "This course is incredible and has no weaknesses. Xiyin was a brilliant teacher and incredible facilitator with a great syllabus",
    "The course is basically a discussion of the readings, and then Professor Tang brings up interesting aspects of the readings, current events, or things from her experience. This course is strong because you really get to express your opinion and viewpoints and see how they fit into the context of those of others. This course could be improved, however,  if the discussions were sometimes kept more on topic, or if more current events were brought in to make understanding the concepts easier.",
    "Super engaging and well taught class!",
    "Great seminar style class that allows a lot of opinions. Not much bad",
    "Pretty solid already. Great for learning and speaking.",
    "Many elements of this course were very strong. The readings were interesting and informative, and I felt that we spent an appropriate amount of time on each of the subject areas. Class discussions were also generally very good I always looked forward to coming to class. Professor Tang and our TF Brent were both terrific, in terms of leading the class, giving in-depth feedback on our assignments, being available outside of class to answer questions over email or in person, and making sure we understood the material. Finally, I also thought the structure of the assignments was good. Allowing people to choose which weeks they wanted to do reading responses for allowed us to focus in on the topics that interested us the most, and also naturally ensured that there were always some people who had thought in-depth about that week's topics and could help lead\/generate discussion. I also enjoyed the flexibility we had for the final project.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I believe could be improved about this course is the size of the class. At times, I felt that the course would have run better with about five fewer students, as it was sometimes difficult to for two people to engage back and forth with so many people trying to speak, and sometimes by the time you got called on to make your point, the discussion had already moved in a new direction. That said, I hate to suggest that people be turned away from the course, since it was such a great class!",
    "Amazing course!",
    "The course was taught well and had great readings. The only weakness might be the class size, which sometimes felt overwhelming because so many students were trying to participate. I don't think the class size should be reduced since it's obvious Prof Tang wants to accommodate all who wish to take the course; perhaps this can instead be ameliorated with some more structure in class. I would have appreciated if Prof Tang sometimes set aside time from discussion to more thoroughly go over some of the materials.",
    "Loved the readings and discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're interested in copyright and trademark and all of that jazz. It's a lot of reading and you have to know how to read court cases well, but you'll learn so much about so many facets of intellectual property. Professor Tang is also hilarious and brilliant and really approachable. Reading responses give you a lot of freedom.",
    "100% take this course if you've a) taken the CS 183\/185 classes or b) are interested in intellectual property. You can't go wrong with this course it's all around great",
    "Yes, I really did learn a lot from this course. I felt that this was a more specialized course, so you definitely should be at least a little interested law or intellectual property if you take this course, though.",
    "YES! One of top 3 classes ive taken at Yale. Most interesting content you will probably cover, and from one of the best professors you'll ever have. Tang is super knowledgable, fun, and engaging. Must take",
    "Definitely! Super relevant, interesting info, that is manageable to do.",
    "Yes! Xiyin is great and the material is super interesting!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You do not need to have any prior knowledge about the law in order to enjoy and succeed in this course. If the topics interest you at all, you will learn a ton and will truly enjoy doing the readings and going to class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! An interesting seminar if you are at all curious about the privatization of knowledge and if you yourself feel conflicts over the everyday manifestations of this we see (i.e. music royalties, twitter plagiarism, etc.).",
    "I would absolutely recommend! It's a great class led by a professor who clearly loves the material and teaching. It can be intimidating to come in without taking 183, so be prepared to feel behind. But seminar felt pretty relaxed and the workload was really manageable.",
    "Yes! I learned so much about IP in this course and Professor Tang is truly one of the sweetest professors you'll ever meet.",
    "Absolutely, all Yale students should at least consider taking this course."
