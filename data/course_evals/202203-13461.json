I think this is probably the most critical thing I learned in this course.\r\nAs for skills, I learned how to budget my time with a lot of readings, how to respond productively to discussion posts, and how to write a full-blown research paper.",
                "I learned a lot about Roman history and various elements of religions practiced by peoples of the Empire. I also developed my written argumentation and analysis skills.  This class taught me a lot about myself, how I conceive of religion, and how I write."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This class is a very good survey of the various \"religions\" in Rome. The structure of reading primary and secondary sources followed by completing a discussion post is very effective. The broad nature of the final paper---anything peripherally related to Roman religion---is also very nice because it really allows you to tailor your research to your interests. \r\nThere are two small critiques I have for this class. One, I think the word \"Empire\" can be dropped from the title, since the Roman Empire is not really the scope of the class so much as all of Rome in general. Two, because the class only met once a week, and we missed class for fall break in October, it felt like we did not have very many class sessions. I wish the class met twice a week so we would have had more time to cover more content, although I did enjoy the long-form seminar.",
                "I think this class could be improved by rearranging some of the course's contents (ie. combining the freelance week with the magic week, having a separate week for material culture\/aesthetics of religious iconography and the following week for visiting the art gallery, adding a week on the domestic cult, etc...). I also think it would be good to have writing assignments that could be revised rather than just having discussion posts each week. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think the course was organized and taught well. CJ did a great job!"

                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in deconstructing the idea of religion. You do not have to be interested in Rome to enjoy this class; the focus is more on religion in the Roman setting than on Rome in the religious setting.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course! It fulfilled my Roman requirement for the CLCV major, and I found it to be much more enriching than the standard Republic and Empire sequence. I also really enjoyed the seminar aspect of the class because all of our discussions each week were tailored to our personal interests in ancient religion. It was very cool seeing everyone present on their final projects and all of the different directions that could be taken in ancient religion.\r\n\r\nThere also aren't classes offered on Roman religion, so if it's offered again take it since there's no guarantee it will be taught again. Even this year it was taught not by a Classics or Religious Studies faculty member, but rather by a graduate student."
