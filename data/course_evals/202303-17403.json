                "The foremost strength of this class is that, despite the growing size of the EVST department and number of majors, in the colloquium you are split into small groups with a single advisor and a few other students who all have relatively similar projects. This smaller-group arrangement is very supportive and ideal for this kind of learning and work, I think. I thought that the end-of-semester three-minute presentations were another strength, and I would advise sticking with this format, rather than longer five-minute presentation slots, going forward; I really enjoyed hearing about everyone's research and thought all did a wonderful job presenting.\r\nThe only weakness of which I can think at the moment is that there were a few weeks where the assignment for the week seemed to fall short a little; for instance, I don't know how much I truly got from the outline review.",
                "The EVST colloquium format is the best. Other majors need to get with the program! They did a great job of building community and keeping students and advisors accountable throughout the semester, without adding too much pressure."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, even though those who do take this are required to by the EVST department anyway, I'd still recommend this course. It keeps you well on track for writing your thesis in a thoughtful, measured manner, and provides you with support from your advisor and your peers (and it's particularly nice to do the work alongside and learn from your peers, especially those who are doing similar projects)."
