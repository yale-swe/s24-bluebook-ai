Professor Escoffery is deeply knowledgeable about jazz history and rubbed shoulders with the greats, so he has the kind of knowledge you can't find in a textbook and is a valuable resource. Ask him for recommendations and *listen to the artists he mentions!* I learned different scales to use for improvisation, the importance of rhythm, specific lessons from individual transcriptions, and the cultural history of jazz."

                "Strengths: Man, performing was scary sometimes but it was very worth it. The work is spaced out pretty evenly, so it's not a super-crunch to complete, which is nice for a half-credit course. Professor Escoffery can confidently provide insight for a broad variety of instruments, so it's not like it's all saxophones or anything.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the assignments were quite tricky (but still rewarding)! Sometimes I felt the homework and expectations were a little disorganized. I didn't have this issue, but a friend misunderstood the scope of his final performance and was asked to do something day-of that he hadn't prepared for."

                "This course is fascinating and one I'm glad to have taken, although it is definitely a niche interest that won't apply to everyone (even every musician). Although engagement with the material itself is very challenging if you do it right, the actual workload isn't too crazy because Professor Escoffery is nice enough to space things out so everything's doable. You will have to be proficient enough on your instrument to participate, (definitely at least enough to confidently read back sheet music in real time), otherwise you'll have a bit of a tough time. I'd definitely recommend this course to those interested."
