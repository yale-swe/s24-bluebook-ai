And why do we not have intelligent robots in our lives yet?\r\n\r\nThroughout the semester, those were some of the main questions that we tried to answer. We started with the history of how intelligence was defined and tested (e.g. IQ tests, Turing test, etc.) Then, we discussed the history of robots beginning with the Sense-Think-Act architecture before progressing to Behavior-Based\/Reactive models such as Subsumption, Motor Schemas, and DAMN. Despite being more adaptive than the traditional Sense-Think-Act architecture, the reactive models are unable to plan for long-term goals. As a result, hybrid models such as AuRA, Atlantics, 3T, and SSS were developed, which allowed for the Mars rovers to operate autonomously!\r\n\r\nAfter covering the history of how robot capability and intelligence have progressed, we briefly learned about dynamical systems (how to evaluate which behavior is the best), motor control, sensing technology, kinematics, and machine learning. We also discussed more \"humanities\" issues such as human-robot interactions, robots + autism, false assumptions of human intelligence, multi-robot systems, social interface design, ethics in robotics, autonomous cars, humanoid robots, and collaborative manufacturing.

                "It probably doesn't need to meet 3 times per week. The lecture material could definitely be condensed. Overall though, I very much enjoyed the lectures. Scaz is a great lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets were very much not thought through though. It was abundantly clear on the psets and the final project that whoever made them never actually tried completing them. If they did, they would notice that some questions on the psets didn't really make a lot of sense in context. \r\n\r\nThe final project was kinda silly. They clearly did not adequately test the environment, relative speeds, and overall logic of the world before it was released. That being said, I enjoyed the final project, I just wish they tested it more before release.",
                "I think it is a strong course that is underrated for the challenge it presents. It can quickly become overwhelming and it seems like a lot of what it taught is later revealed to not really be important.",
                "Possibly more programming.",
                "The strengths include organization, lecture style, and engaging material. Weaknesses include not much communication with psets and the pset material was far more advanced than the classroom material.",
                "The strength of this course is in the subject matter.  The course is rare among computer science courses with its focus on designing robotic systems for intelligence at the architectural level; essential skills in this course are not a focus in others.  Another strength of the course is the inclusion of some of the instructor's research, which is both fascinating and impactful.\r\n\r\nThe two main areas where the course should be improved are inclusive teaching and the overall course design.  For inclusive teaching, the instructor should make an effort to include the contributions of people other than white men when he discusses the history of robotics and computing.  The third slide of the first lecture has a picture of J. Presper Eckert ostensibly programming ENIAC, but this could have been a picture of the team that actually programmed ENIAC, which was six women lead by Jean Jennings-Bartik.  Instead, the first woman we see on the slides is Grey Walter's wife, even though women have definitely contributed to robotics and computing throughout the 20th century.  Showing the contributions of more than just white men indicates to students that they can all be roboticists, not just the ones that look like you and I.\r\n\r\nI also recommend improving the overall course design, and specifically expanding the content from the first half of the course to go into greater depth.  The second half of the course felt like a collection of random topics related to robotics that got one lecture each, but one lecture (and no problem sets?) is not enough for students to understand inverse kinematics, PID control, machine learning, etc.  Each of those topics deserves a whole course, and the only reason I could take the final exam is because I have taken a whole course in each.  Because there were no problems sets or formative assessments and much of the lecture content was unrelated to the project, it was unclear to students what the instructor's goals were for these lectures.  Instead, my suggestion is to leave many of these topics to their own course and pick just a few to include that will actually assess students on through projects.  You can start with Webots on day one, and then design assessments that align with the topics you cover in the lectures.  That way, students can actually program the different architectures that we discuss, experiment with different sensor arrays they design, and even implement one or two machine learning algorithms on their simulated robots to reinforce the topics discussed during class.  From my point of view, these are the important skills the students should have when they leave the course, but the course assessments seem to reward students with prior background in robotics and students who are skilled at making cheat sheets, so the assessments are misaligned with the instructor's objectives.",
                "Really interesting and well taught class. Project was a bit unorganised and came with a lot of technical issues",
                "Scaz was engaging, lectures were fun. Most of the class is not coding, which is a good change from lots of CS classes. Lots of robotic architecture which I found interesting. Final group project was very fun, code a robot in simulator to survive zombie apocalypse. You didn't receive much of any feedback or grades though besides the midterm.",
                "Scaz is a great lecturer! He does not simply read off of slides or lecture notes and is really able to keep the class interesting. The final project was interesting, but the course does not really teach the necessary skills and tools to complete the project. You are mainly using pre-existing outside knowledge to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe course is relatively disorganized. Homework is haphazardly assigned and graded (we just try our best to use the models we learned about in class to design a robot and hope for the best). As a result, your grades are really random since you can't really learn from your mistakes. It also takes a while for assignments to be graded. Furthermore, the exams are also quite random since we can't even see what previous exams looked like. But, the exams are a relatively good representation of what we learned in lectures.",
                "Strengths - interesting content, well-designed final project. Recorded lectures were great.\r\nWeaknesses - Asking us to learn opencv in just a few weeks for a final project felt like a lot to ask. Psets were often unclear in what questions were actually asking and what the expectations were. Lecture was interesting, but slightly dry.",
                "The lectures were generally pretty good, especially toward the end. I enjoyed listening to Scaz explaining topics related to his own research. Some other lectures were kind of iffy, like his ones on kinematics and how motors work--not entirely sure why that was relevant. Projects were not good. We had a lot of freedom in answering, which basically meant that no one really knew what they really wanted from the assignments a lot of the time.",
                "Strength: lectures\r\nWeaknesses: understaffed, vague pset instructions and wasn't clear how they would be graded",
                "Scaz is a great lecturer and a super caring professor. The psets didn't feel too tedious. I felt like I was actually learning from them and using the material from the lecture.\r\nI think there should have been more office hours and a mix between in-person and online office hours.",
                "The course really didn't ask for many deliverables: just two homeworks, the final project, and the two exams. Thus one of the issues seemed to be the lack of constructive feedback for students, since the assignments only tested our knowledge of a small fraction of the material covered in class, and the graders took an excessive amount of time handing them back. I think adding at least one more assignment would be helpful. It would also be nice if there was more programming in the class, especially just small assignments that simulated implementing the robot architectures we studied in the course. The final project allowed us to implement architectures in code, but overall I felt like I learned very little about high-level concepts from the project. Maybe the project could somehow force students to think more about architectures or kinematics...\r\nOverall the course was very good because the lectures were really enjoyable and informative. It was a \"fun\" course, but I can't say it left me with many practical skills that I could directly use hands-on in industry.",
                "The course gives a comprehensive overview of robotics from the 1970s to modern architecture. Scaz is a strong lecturer and you will enjoy the lectures. The midterm and final exam are well designed and provide a good assessment of your knowledge. However, the final project about surviving the zombie apocalypse is incredibly difficult and will be graded very harshly irrespective of how much effort you put into it.",
                "Psets were generally pretty difficult, could use some better in class examples to guide student through psets. Lectures were very informative.",
                "Strengths: Scaz is a very engaging lecturer who made lectures feel a bit like Ted talks. The material is organized in a logical way, with important concepts coming up alongside history of when\/how the concepts were introduced.\r\nWeaknesses: The final project was difficult in ways that did not push learning at all.",
                "Strengths - really cool class that covers a lot and its very engaging. Weaknesses - so much of this class is weighted on the first two psets for which there was little to no guidance for. TAs had office hours during the day when people had classes so it was particularly hard to get help",
                "great lectures but problem sets and exams did not match",
                "Very good lectures but I don't think I learned much from the problem sets. It sometimes felt like difficult busy work.",
                "I do not know how this course can be improved",
                "I thought the course had some interesting topics and Scaz was an engaging lecture. I think the largest weakness of the course is that the application of the knowledge was not clear. Most of it felt like memorization.",
                "The professor is very engaging, and the material is interesting. I would have liked to be given more background on the robot project, because we did not practice any hands on programming before being assigned it.",
                "Scaz is an amazing lecturer and is an expert in the field. I learned a lot about how we got to where we are now and where we might go in the future. The class is a bit disorganized in terms of assignments, as there is not much guidance on how to think about design questions on problem sets. Besides that, each lecture is amazingly organized and very engaging.",
                "The strength of this class truly lies in the lectures. They are incredibly engaging and well thought out. The lectures guide you seamlessly through the history of robotics up to the present. The homework assignments nicely reflect the content covered in class, asking both theoretical questions as well as technical design questions. I loved the lectures on human robot interaction. I really can say that I loved every single lecture. From introductory kinematics lectures that were highly technical to the lecture on robots for children with ASD, this class spans a breadth of complex topics while still managing to give you a solid understanding of each. \r\nOne very specific improvement: I thought we spent a lot of time discussing the technical details of braitenberg vehicles (and were tested on understanding their behavior). I think that the takeaway of this topic is interesting and useful (re: uphill analysis and downhill invention), however I thought that testing and understanding the very specific details of different vehicle configurations was not as valuable.",
                "The course overall was quite strong. It covered history and theory, but also engineering - the final project was designing an intelligent system and implementing a virtual robot in python. However, the assignments, as they were assigned this semester, did not adequately facilitate student learning. There were only two theory assignments, the second which was due on October 6. Aside from a minor assignment to get students comfortable with the robotic virtual environment for the engineering  project, the only other assignment was the engineering project. Much of this course covered theory, but there wasn't much of a chance to practice this.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a lot of the assignments, especially the engineering project, were not super polished. Frequently student questions on Ed Discussion pointed out very large issues with the assignment specifications and provided code, with major changes being announced up until very close to the assignment deadlines. Announcements and grading were also frequently erratic and late.",
                "All the lecture is given with ppt, which is hard to follow and focus. It can be improved with some iPad hand notes\r\n\r\nThe class dont get the mid term answer until the end of the semester\r\n\r\nI dont have further chance to request regrade of my final.( the professor replied once but I still have question with his response)",
                "Strengths\r\n- Content is broad and covers many topics\r\nWeakness\r\n- More technical details would be useful",
                "Good",
                "I love the lecture and how classes are interactive",
                "It is sometimes too high-level.",
                "Interesting lectures that got us to think about important, high level decisions made in the robotics field.",
                "This course is about robotics but it has taught me a lot more than that. I have had zero background knowledge in robotics, yet I found this course very comprehensible and engaging. The assignments are creative and aimed to develop general skills beyond the field of robotics.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the very creativeness of assignment could cause confusion because I have never seen anything like this before.",
                "I think the course could have been a little less focused on the history of robotics and a little less narrative or case study heavy and a little more skills based. While discussions of the media equation, the use of robotics for learning (both for neurotypical and neurodiverse children), and the ethics of robotics were interesting, I felt that they were sometimes a little stretched out and could have been shortened or combined into fewer lectures. That way more lectures could be devoted to designing robotic architectures, using sensors, or coding. I felt that the level of coding workload in the last project was a little harsh especially given how very little of the course was devoted to it and it demanded a high level of coding that not everyone in my group had. \r\n\r\nI also think that the sections on chaos theory \/ the math heavy sections should have either been explained in more depth or left out completely. It was a little confusing to be exposed to all of those concepts but not expected to learn much of the math at all and to be tested very superficially on it. \r\n\r\nStill I felt that the course overall was very interesting, and a great foundation for me given how little I understood about robotics prior to the class. The sheer amount of information dumped on us was very high, but somehow I was able to retain a big chunk of it which surprised and impressed me about the course.",
                "Weakness was the final project depending heavily on having prior coding knowledge. There was no prior preparation introduced to the course in order to properly execute the final project.",
                "It's a good survey course - you cover a lot of material that is relevant to robotics. That means that, though, you don't go into much detail and don't cover topics deeply."

                "Definitely, I learned a lot from this course and enjoyed it. The psets felt somewhat unfair at points but that was fine.",
                "Only if you are really interested in the history of robotics and want a baseline for how they work. This class does not actually do any hands on robotics work, it is really just a history lesson on robotics",
                "Yes, if they wanted to learn more about robotics in general and some excellent history, and how we develop intelligent systems today.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student. Not only was the course well designed and the material was extremely interesting, Professor Scaz is an excellent teacher and truly cares for his students.",
                "I will recommend this course to students because it covers interesting and important topics, and students can learn relevant things without too much work.  When I recommend this course to other students, I will be transparent about the areas where I feel the course should be improved that I have stated in other parts of this evaluation.",
                "Yes. It's a great CS elective and super interesting",
                "Yeah! Honestly fun class. Only like 2 real homework assignments, both were a bit strange and not super clear, but fine. Grading was a bit unclear, but fair. Midterm and final were very fair tests, final project was super fun and graded leniently. Great mix up from traditionally large work load CS classes.",
                "Overall, yes. If you're interested in robotics, this is a great course to learn about the history and present state of robots. Scaz is a great lecturer and the final project is relatively fun. \r\n\r\nHowever, the class is not a complete gut, and getting a good grade can be quite arbitrary. There are only 3 assignments and you kind of just try your best and hope that you did the design aspect correctly.",
                "Not really. Workload is much higher than I expected from coursetable reviews, especially with the final project. And the psets themselves aren't super interesting. If you're looking to learn a lot about the current state of robotics, this class will teach you some very cool content, but the work itself can get frustrating. Also be prepared to memorize a ton of info for the midterm and final.",
                "Yeah, the material was interesting enough. Just don't expect to do well on assignments and\/or enjoy them because they're not very well written.",
                "Depends, if you like having psets where you dont know how to do anything because the lectures are completely disassociated from assignments, then yes! Otherwise, no. Though, I guess this is one of the lighter workload CS electives and this has reasonable exams",
                "Not really... I've taken a bunch of typical \"hard\" classes in the CS and math departments, and this class was by far the most difficult out of all of them. This difficulty comes from the course organization and teaching staff, and less so due to actual difficulty of the material. \r\n\r\nLectures are straightforward -- Scaz is a storyteller, and he tells stories about robots relating to ethics\/design\/whatever. However, Scaz is quite poor at explaining technical material, which is largely what ends up being covered on the exams. There are also no practice exams given, and little indication is given as to which topics are important\/will end up being covered. This isn't always an issue, but the averages for the midterm\/final were lower than the CS323 midterm\/final, and that should put you on alert. Again, the material is not difficult by itself, but students on average perform worse than in CS323 (and CS366 and CS223, etc). The problem sets experience the same phenomenon -- averages are quite low due to a combination of harsh grading and tedious\/poorly written problems. Teaching staff are slow to respond on Ed, if that matters to you.\r\n\r\nI think this class has a lot to offer if you Credit\/D it. Again, the material is not hard, and Scaz is a great storyteller. The final project is also fun. I think you should avoid this class if grades are even a slight concern for you. There isn't a lot of work assigned, but nearly all of it sucks for all the wrong reasons.",
                "Not a bad CS elective although there's very little support, especially from the teacher. But the topics are decently interesting depending on whether you like math or more theoretical topics. The final project though was not fun though, I felt like I was just kind of thrown into it with no help and really no correlation to anything we learned in class.",
                "I would recommend it because I think it is a really good CS class! Not as much of a CS gut as a Coursetable would have you believe (though I guess \"CS Gut\" is an oxymoron).  You got to put the work in and not procrastinate on work. Definitely gather a team of people you can trust for the project or you're screwed.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it. You won't learn a lot of useful, concrete programming or engineering techniques for robotics, but you'll certainly learn a lot of cool history about the development of robotics and robot software architectures. You'll get a nice survey of a lot of the big areas of robotics research, and you'll even look at some basic hardware concepts. Don't expect to learn about any one topic in much depth in this course. You also barely do any programming--just the final project, where you learn how to implement some basic robot architectures in software and learn how to work with some sensor outputs. Other than that the project won't teach you much (although it's fun). The class is very little work compared to a lot of the CS electives at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you did not take artificial intelligence with Scaz. The problem sets and project are graded very harshly thus you should prepare well for the exams.",
                "I would recommend this course to CS majors who are looking for a pretty easy elective with no coding until the final project or to non-majors that are interested in robotics. Classes generally felt like a mix between a cogsci class and a CS class, and especially towards the end of the class, we were just talking very broadly about fields like autonomous vehicles and collaborative manufacturing. It felt like a survey course during these parts of the course, and don't expect to dive incredibly deeply into how to actually program an intelligent robot.",
                "Yes if you really dedicate time to each and every assignment, everything is very heavily graded.",
                "yes",
                "I would take this course to see if you would be interested in going into robotics, but maybe not if you already know and want to learn some tangible skills.",
                "Yes!",
                "No, I would not. I felt like I did not understand what knowledge I was supposed to come away with.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have programming experience and enjoy learning about robotics.",
                "If you're interested at all in robotics, yes! This class is a great way to understand the very relevant field of intelligent robots and Scaz is an expert. Each lecture is quite engaging and well organized, though the problem sets and project can be a bit confusing and require effort.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The lectures are incredibly engaging, especially for a CS course. I found myself looking forward to going to class. The psets are interesting, but not too long and nicely complement the lectures. The class covers a breadth of incredibly interesting topics and is very balanced between covering robotics history, theory, science, ethics, and more. I would absolutely recommend this class, particularly to CS majors. It was easily one of the best I have taken for my major.",
                "Scaz is a great teacher and lectures are interesting. Exams are needlessly detailed though and there need to be more office hours. Id still say take it if you need a CS elective; its interesting and not a horrible amount of work.",
                "No, good thing is I learned some knowledge in this course, but the reason I dont want to recommend this course is the poor grading and homework answers. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, we dont get the answer of the mid term until the end of the semester. We get the answer of each problem set very late. Many questions are open question  but I dont have enough chance to argue with my question\r\n\r\nBasically I dont know this is the TAs problem or the professors problem. Overall I think the professor prepared each lecture quite good but his or maybe the tas attitude toward homework and exam is bad",
                "Recommended for people interested in autonomous robotics and need a place to get started.",
                "Yes, but need a lot understanding",
                "Yes I would. Love the course and love what it taught. Moreover it asks us to design out own robot, which is very fun.",
                "Yes, very clear discussion of robotics history and design.",
                "Yes, chill but insightful class to take, although not a traditional CS topic.",
                "Yes. This course covers lots of interesting topic even if you are not already enthusiastic about robotics. Moreover, the instructor delivers his lectures in such a masterful manner that you would not want to miss any one of them.",
                "I would recommend the course to students with a good coding background, and who do not know the broad history of robotics and are interested to learn about that as well how it is situated culturally. It is also helpful to have an understanding of robotics or be in an environment\/ have friends who can help you out with this (I had the latter).",
                "Yea, it is a good introduction of what the field of robotics has become.",
                "Yes - the course introduces you to a lot of topics. Even if you're familiar with some of them, you'll learn about some other ones that are new. But, don't expect a particularly challenging or super intellectually stimulating course."
