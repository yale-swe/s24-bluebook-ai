The only challenges I noticed were those of time, and I would have appreciated a little more discussion following the simulation exercises in particular. However this was overall a really interesting and engaging course.",

                "If you are interested in international relations or mass atrocities and human rights, this class is very good.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in international law, human rights, genocide prevention, or any related field. The course does a great job capturing the international politics that are implicated in massive abuses of human dignity. Furthermore, Professor Simon does a good job steering discussions towards more in-depth explorations of how to stop atrocities that goes beyond just saying there should have been military intervention. This is not something I had encountered in many of my other classes and I was really grateful for that aspect of this course.",
                "Yes!  Professor Simon is so nice and a good guy to get to know (especially if youre a political science major). Its also such an important topic nowadays, so I definitely recommend if youre at all interested in human rights."
