            "comments": [
                "The course was well-developed and was able to tackle a huge amount of Spanish grammar quite effectively.",
                "Strengths: All dimensions of the Spanish language are covered despite the emphasis on grammar. We spoke, developed our comprehension by listening to movies, recorded a podcast, read many short stories, and completed exercises on a daily basis. The course was comprehensive and encouraged us to explore profound themes in a foreign language.\r\nWeakness: The structure of the assignments. For example, we would be assigned a movie to watch for Friday on Wednesday (giving us two days to watch a 2 hour and 15 minute film) in addition to regular coursework and conversations with native speakers. This sometimes made for an overwhelming amount of work in 2 days which could easily be avoided by assigning the film a week in advance so that students can better prepare their schedules.",
                "Strengths: The amount of practice problems and overall assignments. I found all the assignments engaging, and the assessments were abundantly fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasnt too impressed with the actual class time. I feel as though there could be more of a discussion of complex matters.",
                "Strength - the organization and the professor. I loved learning Spanish grammar through the medium of stories, songs, and group work. The class was so well oiled.\r\nWeakness - I wish there were more time for freeflowing conversation. My favorite class was the one where we had a debate, in which we split into two sides and argued freely about a theme. I would have liked more opportunities in class to implement grammatical structures in a free way, although there were plenty of opportunities outside of class to do so (Ecuadorian conversation partners, and conversation with online teachers).",
                "Strengths: You will cover every single question you had about Spanish grammar in this course, and the diverse assignments (reading short stories, watching movies, talking with languages coaches/Ecuadorian pen pals) will really help you improve. Weaknesses: a lot of assignments, but it is SO worth it!",
                "Strengths of the course are that the professor is very accessible for individual help. Students are set up to be as successful as possible, practicing examples in class and on review guides before exams. A weakness of the course is that it really resembles AP high school spanish classes in that it uses a textbook fairly strictly instead of having discussion and freeformed learning.",
                "The course is very well organized. The workload is high, which can be demoralizing at times, but generally the work does help with skill-development.",
                "The workload is a bit high so there can be busywork at times but overall its worth it."

                "Yes! Though the name Advanced Spanish Grammar might scare some off, I would 100% recommend this class to those interested in pursuing Spanish. It is a fantastic way to consolidate all that one learns in L1-L4 and then go well beyond the traditional scope of taught grammar. I think the class would be especially important for those who plan to take multiple L5 classes.",
                "If the student is prepared for an exceptionally high workload, yes. Fortunately, the benefits far exceed this aspect of the course. The instructor feedback is unparalleled. The diversity of the teaching approaches is formidable. The content is interesting and universal (ranging from love and death to colonization and science fiction). The generality of the course is much appreciated in a department that prioritizes specialization (from what I have heard from my colleagues).",
                "Yes. I think this course gives a great overview for people learning to master the Spanish language.",
                "Yes I certainly would, if you want a well-structured review or expansion of Spanish grammar. I feel a lot more confident in both my ability to express myself and my ability to learn new grammatical structures.",
                "YES, YES, YES! I walked out of this class having gained so many skills, and most importantly, more confidence in myself and my Spanish-speaking abilities. I didn't think I would love a grammar class so much. While this course requires a lot of commitment and there are many assignments (in-class essays, quizzes, grammar exercises, readings, watching movies, exams, making a podcast, conversation reflections, and compositions), you will immensely benefit from them all and will ALWAYS get helpful feedback. Finally, I loved how collaborative this class was (I feel that I rarely get that at Yale)",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they had a very strong background in spanish and really enjoyed grammar. This class was very difficult and is not the class for someone looking to fulfill their language requirement in a fun spanish course. This class is definitely not bad, it's just very challenging.",
                "Yes, if the student is comfortable with a heavy workload and harsh grading.",
                "Absolutely! Anyone who wants to perfect their Spanish should take this course."
