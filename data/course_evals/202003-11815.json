There was no midterm or final which eased the stress of needing to remember content from every module. The weekly quizzes were fair and a pretty good representation of how much I understood the content. Discussion sections were informative and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: attending the lectures live or watching the entire recorded lecture in one sitting was difficult because it is a long class and staring at a screen for that long is hard.",
                "strengths: Special Thursday paper discussions, breadth of material\r\nweaknesses: Sapling, Canvas quizzes",
                "Strengths: good pace, passionate professors, great TAs\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "I think that there should be less memorization on the quizzes and more application of knowledge questions. I felt like all the questions on the quizzes came directly from the slides, and I think have more difficult\/application based questions would help students learn more. The paper discussions were my favorite part of the course, and I liked how the professors would give a brief intro to the papers during lecture to help students get a baseline knowledge of the topic before reading.",
                "Not much to add here, the course does a good job considering the format and the number of students",
                "the main issue was that we were graded on participation in sections but due to having classes online it was easy to be spoken over which would affect your participation grade",
                "Biweekly quizzes were good to stay on top of material but it also felt stressful at times, as if we had a midterm every two weeks.",
                "I loved how well this course adapted to the online format. The professor was very understanding and did a great job teaching the course!",
                "I thought the course was taught very well given the circumstances and the greatest strength was the review sessions held by the TAs the night before quizzes. They were very helpful and helped to prepare for assessments.",
                "The course provided a pretty comprehensive and engaging survey of genetics, from Mendelian genetics to population genetics to developmental genetics. However, the biggest weakness I found with the course was with the grading structure. There are absolutely no assignments for this course, and you were only assessed on six Thursdays throughout the semester where you had to take a quiz and then participate in a discussion section about an assigned research paper. It was frustrating to have my entire grade rely on quizzes that were trickier than the material we learned in class, and I wish I had more opportunities throughout the semester to prove my knowledge.",
                "Dellaporta is a gem.",
                "Some of the strengths of the course were the way it was structured, with lecture lessons and then Special Thursday's, during which there was a quiz and discussion section. I think it was really helpful to digest the information through talking about relevant scientific papers, especially because I was very new to that. However, I think it would have been helpful if the homework and work on Sapling had been more directly connected to the course because it felt relatively disparate and unhelpful to complete.",
                "Strengths were the professors and their passion for genetics. Professor Dellaporta was really enthusiastic about the material, which helped our learning. It could be improved with more quiz practice questions integrated into the lecture slides.",
                "I liked how the course was split up into different modules and that the quizzes were not cumulative so that we could focus on the content. On the quizzes where there are math questions, it would have been helpful to know the rounding rules beforehand. I appreciated having problem sets on Sapling, but Sapling in general is not great--sometimes the answers seem incorrect, and it's annoying when you don't know why you got something wrong.",
                "I thought lectures and discussions were very engaging. Prof. Dellaporta is a great and helpful professor.",
                "The teaching was great - the concepts were well explained. I wish the Canvas quizzes had more questions, so our grades didnt rely so heavily on a couple questions.",
                "I think Professor Dellaporta could have been more clear about the grading throughout the semester.",
                "strengths - fair quizzes, review sections going over past quiz questions very helpful, useful animations on Sapling, great papers for getting an introduction to genetics, no final exam \r\nweaknesses - developmental genetics module covered same material as BIOL103 so didn't learn anything new or more challenging there, professors' slides felt disorganized sometimes and not in a logical order so can be difficult to determine what the big picture is during a lecture (a more in-depth outline at the beginning of each lecture would be helpful)",
                "Strengths: This class was VERY well facilitated for learning in an online environment.  Low pressure, great class discussions, and very clear instruction.  \r\nWeakness: a little convoluted communication on when the PSETS were due.",
                "It's tough having virtual-format quizzes on Canvas. Toward the end of the semester, we switched to having quizzes where we were unable to review past questions we had already answered (to ward against cheating), but this format made it difficult, as normally you can go back to check all answers before submitting quizzes in person. Otherwise, lectures were well-taught and interesting, and discussion section for papers were handled well!",
                "I think a major strength of the course was how Dr. Dellaporta took our situations into account and was able to adapt the class accordingly; online lectures were great and he was able to answer our questions with ease and help us learn. I also think the discussion sections were interesting and not impossibly challenging so we could learn. I believe the review sessions for the quizzes could have been better; they did improve as the semester went on, but I think all the TFs should have a good handle on online learning and how to share their screen in order to give the best experience over zoom.",
                "strengths: prof. dellaporta, course organization\r\nweaknesses: I wish there were clearer deadlines on PSETs, and clearer guidance on what needed to be completed by when. We were told that our PSET\/reading\/activity completions were going to be given an \"effort grade\" which I guess makes sense, it would have just been helpful to know what went into that grade.",
                "The strengths of the course were that it was well taught, and well organized for learning (bimonthly quizzes, special thursdays). The weakness I think was the lack of clarity about certein course requirements such as the sapling requirement.",
                "Fair workload, and good lectures. Help is also readily available.",
                "Strengths of the course include the bimonthly discussion section and quiz day, which helped me keep up with the material in manageable chunks, and the instructor's enthusiasm\/knowledge. The Sapling format felt like both a strength and a weakness because it was a flexible option for students to reinforce their handle on concepts, but it was not really clear what was expected of students since performance was evaluated by effort rather than a more concrete measure.",
                "More concise class structure. The lectures were presented in a great manner, but more transparency on the grading and logistical pieces of the class would make it more enjoyable.",
                "Weaknesses: Discussion sections being graded on quality of contributions. Theres a wide range of people with varying degrees of Existing knowledge and I felt like I could t really attempt to focus on the knowledge of the paper we discussed but focused on where I could contribute so I could get participation points.",
                "N\/A",
                "Strengths - Quizzes were very fair, readings and overall workload was rather light (quiz and paper discussion with preparatory questions on Sapling every 2 weeks), help sessions and peer tutoring office hours were offered every week, textbook was immensely helpful in clearing up confusion about lecture concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes difficult concepts in lecture were covered a bit too quickly but if you go back to the lecture recording and read the slides and the textbook or go to office hours you will be completely fine. Also apparently a lot of people cheated on the online quizzes.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging \r\nWeakness: nobody really knew how much hw we were supposed to be doing",
                "The professor made good use of the recording element of the course and offered asynchronous lectures which were appreciated by many students during this time. The lecturing itself was typically interesting and informative. I definitely appreciated having quizzes every other week with no final exam. However, Professor Dellaporta's quizzes were significantly more difficult than Professor Dawson's quizzes, to the point where to do well on them you had to really memorize all the slides, even if he didn't cover every point on the slide (especially the ones at the ends of lecture). It definitely seemed like he, more than most professors, tried to challenge students with questions on the quizzes (ie. 8\/11 could be a typical class average from a quiz). I very much preferred Professor Dawson's quizzes to Professor Dellaporta's because they were much more straightforward. Vocabulary that was not formally defined on the slides often appeared on the quizzes, which made it pertinent to do the Sapling reading and memorize the vocabulary from there. Grading of the other components was pretty ambiguous for most of the semester until the last week. He gave conflicting information about grades (ie. at the start of the course, he said discussion & sapling components would help improve most people's grade from the quiz average but then said at the end that he starts people out with a 3\/5 (for 25% of the grade!) and moves them up or down from there with 5\/5 being reserved for above and beyond discussion performance - but we all only had the opportunity to equally participate once during discussion before it ended so this seems highly subjective. He also said learning curves on sapling would not be graded but then sent out an email at the end of the course saying that he had included them in the 25% sapling grade and, likely as a result, the average given for this component was 8\/10. With all of the grading ambiguity and contradictions in combination with his insistence on trying to really \"challenge\" students on the quizzes (ie did you completely memorize the slides or not), I would not put it past him to scale students down. Overall, I really enjoyed the actual teaching and material of the course, but did not appreciate the grading system.",
                "This course's strengths were the lectures and the section, I think the weaknesses were that the homework assignments didn't enforce the concepts rigorously enough.",
                "The homework was assigned over Sapling, which cost $80 (new for 2020). Most science courses at yale dont require a fee.",
                "Strengths - Professor Dellaporta is an amazing professor who really cares about the wellbeing of his students and wants to see everyone in his class succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sapling Learning homework assignments were often tedious and were not very relevant to the information we were expected to know for quizzes. The weekly quizzes were also significantly more challenging (due to \"match definition\" and short answer options on Canvas) compared to the quizzes administered in person in prior years of this course (which were almost all in a multiple choice format).",
                "The course was wonderfully organized. Its main strength was the \"special Thursday\" section where students were given the opportunity to discuss papers that covered important topics in genetics. I feel like I did most of my learning here. The Sapling questions were also helpful, but sometimes the question content was beyond the scope of the course. I would have liked a better understanding of how our engagement with Sapling would have affected our final grade. It would have been helpful to have received quiz grades back earlier as well.",
                "I really enjoyed the course. I liked the mix of live lectures and discussion sections - I was able to learn a lot from the lectures and then expand on that knowledge through participation in discussion sections.",
                "Professors are great and recorded lecture is great!",
                "Very good setup for online with the varying modules and quizzes every two weeks, however I thought discussion sections every two weeks were very difficult to have be smooth over zoom.",
                "Strength: The course was well-organized, and Professor Dellaporta was great. I learned a lot about genetics through this course. The Thursday paper discussions were also super helpful for better understanding the material in the papers.\r\n\r\nWeakness: More TF office hours wouldve been nice. The quizzes were a bit challenging at times."

                "The use of Sapling made sense with the Canvas quizzes.",
                "Having recorded lectures was very helpful because it allowed me to review the content multiple times to strengthen my understanding of the content.",
                "I thought Prof. Dellaporta did an amazing job at structuring this class for an online format. The modules were a great way to divide the class up, and the online quiz format was fine.",
                "I think this course was well adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic. The office hours and review sessions held virtually were helpful in preparation for the quizzes.",
                "Quiz format towards the end did not allow us to go back after we completed a question. I hope this question does not remain especially because this was a timed quiz, as it doesn't stop students from cheating, it only induces further anxiety. In earlier quizzes which were harder especially with calculations, being able to go back was what allowed us to get questions right because we would change answers after redoing math. Review sessions for quizzes would be announced last minute and then the TA would change the times again and again the day of. I also think not posting practice quizzes and only showing it in review sessions hindered some students. Sapling was a waste of money. It was not reflective of the types of questions we got on the quiz, we should have just been allowed to get the copy of the book alone without paying $90 to do questions when we already have the book. Peer tutor sessions should have been announced earlier as they were super helpful for later quizzes. I preferred the peer tutor sessions to some TA review sessions.",
                "As far as I could tell, this course was largely the format online as in person, and it transitioned pretty well - review sessions were good, Prof Dellaporta gave really good lectures, and the thursday quizzes\/paper discussions worked alright. I definitely appreciated removing any large tests because those are always a mess over zoom, and I think the quizzes worked decently well.",
                "I thought overall it was a great course!",
                "I liked how the course was organized with quizzes once every two weeks and how homeowrk was handled. This gave us more flexibility with how we organized our work while still maintaining interest in the course as well as keeping up with all the work.",
                "The lectures were recorded and available for later viewing, which helped a lot during stressful weeks when I didn't have time to attend the lectures synchronously. The only sessions that were synchronous were the \"Special Thursday\" discussion sections. I did not find much trouble with the structure of the discussion sections over Zoom, although we would sometimes have technical difficulties.",
                "Everything was great. Only note was that sapling was expensive for students who may be FGLI or have financial difficulties.",
                "I think the virtual discussion sections and quizzes worked well. The TF's took advantage of screen sharing and breakout rooms and various other technological resources to make them effective and very worthwhile. The lectures didn't seem too different over Zoom because they just shared a powerpoint and went through the material. It was harder to be engaged with this lecture format over Zoom.",
                "The virtual seminars that occurred every other week succeeded in breaking up lecture material with online learning, which students appreciated. Allowing students to ask questions in the chat during lecture also helped. Having the recorded lectures accessible on Canvas after class was also helpful because it allowed students to review material.",
                "The professor added Sapling problem sets to account for the circumstances. I'm not entirely sure why. It didn't really add to the learning experience, and the content didn't match the course content. It was really just extra work for the sake of it. Otherwise, the class was well done.",
                "I thought lectures and discussions were very engaging.",
                "I think the professors did a fair job of making the class online.",
                "Overall, the HW, quiz, and section was very well structured for COVID. I was frustrated by getting locked out of individual questions on canvas quizzes.",
                "I think recorded lectures should always be done.",
                "I liked the Sapling animated videos because sometimes crossover events are hard to visualize, but I don't think the psets or textbook were helpful at all so it felt like a waste of money. I thought the Special Thursday discussion section-Canvas quiz proctoring system worked well. I liked having live review sessions before Special Thursdays and think it would be helpful to have extra problem solving sessions because genetics materials requires a lot of reviewing\/compartmentalizing what we learn into categories. For discussion section, I think TAs should make it clear that students should not speak twice until every student as spoken once, and they should monitor the raise hand features so that students don't feel like they need to unmute and interrupt each other.",
                "Success: the special thursdays reserved for paper discussion was excellent!  This definitely helped to keep my engagement higher in the online format. \r\nImprovement: Doing a couple more practice problems IN lecture would be helpful (ex: Chi-square test, etc.)",
                "The live discussion sections every other week were really nice. It was difficult not being able to check past answers on quizzes at the end of the semester, though I understand it was to avoid cheating. One strategy to avoid cheating that I have found helpful in other courses is to have open note quizzes, but limit the amount of time that students have to take the quiz.",
                "Like I said, the online lecture format succeeded very well, but the review sessions for the quizzes could have been improved. Often, I felt like it was a waste of an hour because it was clear some TFs were not able to adapt their normal review practice to virtual classes.",
                "succeeded: the course grading scheme and format was very self directed and forgiving which I appreciated.\r\nimproved: clarity in grading",
                "I think there was too much Sapling assigned and most of the time, Sapling was not too helpful for the quizzes. The special thursdays were helpful and the quizzes helped us stay on track.",

                "Making recorded lectures accessible to students, paying attention to the chat, and meeting with students after class made for an optimal learnign experience in MCDB 202 during the pandemic.",
                "Virtual lectures were successful, as well as virtual discussion sections.",
                "A bit more clarity on what homework grade would be based on--TA said only sapling reading homework+reading quizzes, but learning checks were also apparently included, which many people did not do.",
                "Virtual help sessions and peer tutor office hours were very helpful.\r\n\r\nQuizzes were timed and online during section with the TA watching which was often quite stressful, but I recognize that there is really no other fair way to go about virtual quiz-taking.",
                "I think Dellaporta did a wonderful job keeping the class interesting throughout the entire semester",
                "This course adapted exceptionally well, and wasn't afraid to make major changes to the grading in response to major changes in the academic situation. I think the course still had a kind of disconnected feel, which I found in almost all online courses, and engagement with the material could have been a bit better.",
                "Discussion sections were aptly suited for the virtual learning environment. Testing could be improved with the use of a lockdown browser instead of the Canvas quiz feature.",
                "All practices were successful.",
                "I really enjoyed the virtual discussion sections. To me, they were some of the best sections I had this semester. I loved my TA, Vaughn - she was always trying to help us engage deeper with the material - which in turn always allowed us to perform better in other aspect of the course. The set - up was overall really great. It prioritized both information gathering and information processing, which I felt was missing in a lot of my courses this semester.",
                "Recorded lecture was great as I could rewatch it!",
                "The biweekly quizzes in place of a final and midterm worked very well, the concept behind the discussion section was good but zoom made it difficult to execute well.",
                "The two-week chunks with Special Thursdays worked well. It mightve been helpful to have more office hours with the TAs instead of one every two weeks."

                "I think this was a relatively OK MCDB core class. Definitely reach out for help reviewing concepts if you're having trouble with them. Reaching out to the peer tutor in the course was probably the only thing that got me through it. Definitely read the papers for discussion section and try to understand as much of them as possible otherwise you'll probably be lost during those sections. The quizzes aren't too bad, but can be a little tricky\/test very specific things that might've been on one lecture slide.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's very evident that bumps along the way for the format of this class is really due to getting used to the online formatting, and Dellaporta would always adapt to issues we had or change, so I think in case this class is virtual next year, take it because it will be a better experience. If this class is in person, 100% take it. The course material itself is just super interesting and Dellaporta really cares about his students.",

                "I really liked this course and felt that I learned a great amount even given the online format. Sapling was a good resource although at times was too in-depth for certain concepts and was a bit confusing. However Sapling was graded for completion and not accuracy so that helped to relieve some stress. Overall I would definitely recommend this course to another student!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a further understanding of genetics from what is taught in the Intro Bio sequence. However, the grading structure may require some time to get used to, especially if you're someone like me who struggles with quizzes but does well with proving themself on assignments and final exams.",
                "Yes! This was a great course. Quizzes were a bit weird, but overall good.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think the professors are both very knowledgeable about their topics and the class is a great introduction to genetics and biology overall. It takes a lot of self-motivated study, but overall a good class.",
                "Yes I would recommend it. As a senior in MCDB, I think this was one of the better MCDB courses because the material was so interesting and it gives you a good foundation for genetics, which is an extremely important topic. Professor Dellaporta is so nice and enthusiastic about the course material too.",
                "I would recommend this course! It's a great introduction to genetics and covers all the major principles. Most of the assessment questions were fair and could be answered from information in the lecture. You also get to read fundamental papers related to each module, which I thought was a great experience. (Be sure you understand the figures!)",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in learning more about genetics.",
                "Yes, it's the best MCDB class I've taken.",
                "It's not that much harder than BIOL103, just a bit more in-depth. But some modules have a lot of material where you can easily confuse concepts so you will have to invest many hours in reviewing on the weeks of quizzes, and reading the discussion paper - be ready to explain any figure that the TA calls you on as well as look up the methods that aren't explicitly discussed in the papers but are used.",
                "YES!  This has been my FAVORITE class at Yale so far!  Very interesting, and low pressure learning environment.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in genetics. The topics are interesting, and the quizzes aren't too hard to study for if you keep up with the material. Just beware of getting behind on reading assignments.",
                "Absolutely, if you are interested in genetics. This course is so interesting and as long as you do the assignments and study for the biweekly quizzes, you will do very well. I really enjoyed this course, Prof. Dellaporta is so funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. The quizzes being biweekly is great, frequent enough that one or two bad quizzes won't hurt you too much and that you are always keeping on top of the course material, but spaced out enough that it isn't too stressful. The papers are very cool and fun reads. Overall, this class is very enjoyable and you learn a lot.",
                "Yes. If you need as a requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course to any MCDB, pre-health professions, or interested student because it provides both foundational knowledge of genetics and some opportunity for analysis.",

                "I would if he becomes more clear about the grading from the start. Sure, the material is interesting, his lectures are fantastic, and his life experiences are incredible, but grades cause most Yale students anxiety anyway without all of the ambiguity and contradictions.",
                "No. Some of the material is interesting and isnt too challenging, but unfortunately the class is poorly structured and there is zero grade transparency. Neither of the professors are very good.",
                "I definitely would, but would just point out that this course definitely focuses more on concepts of genetics and not molecular genetics. I only point this out as I was a bit confused on that front, but if you're interested in inheritance patterns, recombination and that sort of thing it's an excellent course.",
                "Absolutely - this course is a wonderful MCDB class for majors and non-majors alike. Professor Dellaporta does a wonderful job of breaking down complex biological concepts into a manner that is palatable for a general audience, regardless of your academic background.",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot in a short period of time, the content was interesting and I enjoyed having had the opportunity to engage with scientific literature.",
                "Yes, definitely. It has been one of the best MCDB courses I have taken so far at Yale. The professors and TA's are both great, and the material is taught in a way that is not only understandable, but enjoyable. The course was broken down into six modules with a module quiz every other week, and I found that this is a style of instruction that works really well in STEM courses - particularly courses with nuanced topics that require practice or memorization. It made the course easier to digest, and I always left the weekly sections over Zoom having learned something new that pertained directly to the course.",
                "Very good to learn genetics!",
                "Yes, if a student were interested in biology this is a very good course that wasn't too heavy.",
