                "This was a nice course, maybe doing actual problems during lectures would be helpful, but besides that was a good class. If Collin is TAing the class, sign up for his section, he is the best!!",
                "Strengths: Professor Turner, who was able to teach the material in an interesting and engaging manner, and the TAs, who were very helpful with reviewing material and answering questions. Weaknesses: none.",
                "I think the course is very well laid out. The flow from lecture to lecture was conducive to our learning. The psets prepared us well for the exams, and the exams were fair.",
                "Very well taught and the material is really engaging. Wouldn't really have changed much",
                "MOST IMPORTANT: Take it with Collin! He is a great TA. I highly recommend trying to get into his section because he is very clear and so helpful. Go to his office hours for help with PSETs. It is worth it!\r\n\r\nProfessor Turner is a big strength of the course. He is totally sweet and makes lots of dad jokes. Also I noticed he uses always female pronouns for the games which is cool. Lecture was pretty good, especially if you are interested in political science and its processes. Collin helped a lot with the PSETs, which definitely helped me learn. The TA review sessions and practice questions were good, though one problem on exam 2 didn't have a corresponding practice question and hence many students bombed it (read the textbook! It's important). Exams in general are pretty fair though.\r\n\r\nMaybe a weakness is that the political science aspect isn't covered on the exams, which are pretty game-heavy. Otherwise I thought the course was strong, which is saying something considering I am not especially interested in politics.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would have liked for the PSETs to be scheduled ahead of time so I knew how to distribute my work. We always had enough time to do them, so it was no sweat, but I just would have liked the structure of it..",

Weaknesses are that sometimes it can feel like Professor Turner rushes over material to try and fit it in (frequently going over the 50 min).",
                "This course was good.  It is definitely an introduction and was not too difficult which honestly made the students like and appreciate the material more.  The biggest weakness was that Ian ran over by like 8 minutes half the lectures which can be annoying.",

Like a lot of people got screwed over by 1 question we didn't really cover in class in the second exam and the final was the length of a pset (expected to be completed in 1 hour and 20 minutes).",

It didn't really have much political science content though. It was more like game theory tools occasionally applied to political situations, but I don't think I learned any political theory, which would've been interesting to see more of.",

I also took it because it got good reviews and didn't sound too difficult.\r\n\r\nThe course is not necessarily a gut! There are 7 PSETs and three exams. None of them are particularly hard, especially if you got to office hours, but I studied quite a bit for the course. I could see my math major best friend taking this and thinking it was insanely easy, but I am not a math person so I had to work hard but ultimately it was possible to do well. \r\n\r\nI would recommend the course to a student who was interested in government and political science. Professor Turner talked a lot about how to apply the games to different political situations. Honestly as a humanities kid I just wasn't that engaged with these bits, but I could see them being TOTALLY fascinating for a political science\/EPE\/Global\/history student who thinks about this stuff all the time. \r\n\r\nOverall I would tell a friend to take this course if they wanted a relatively low workload and unstressful class, a QR, and to learn a bit about American government. It wasn't life-changing like many Yale courses, but it was a solid course and I don't regret taking it..",

                "Highly Recommend. DO NOT BOTHER READING OTHER COURSE EVALUATIONS, STOP RIGHT HERE! This course is a yale gem. Do yourself a favor and take the course! No further information is needed. And if you pick a TA, pick COLLIN!",
                "As an EP&E requirement, yes. If you want to learn more game theory, ECON 159 would probably be a better choice, since they move at a quicker pace. If interested in specifically political science applications of game theory, then yes.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the subject or are trying to fulfill a requirement.  Almost definitely better than the other game theory options.  It is interesting, if you like math it is fun.",
                "Yes for major requirements (I took for cogsci breadth). Definitely way easier than the Econ game theory course so Im glad I took it. Covers pretty much the same topics I think.",
                "Yes, not only is it a pretty easy QR but the material is also very engaging.",
                "Sure, if you need it for your major or if you're genuinely interested.",
                "I would recommend this course 100%. As a political science major that needed a quant, I was searching near and far for a quant that would be applicable and practical to my current studies and long term goals--Game theory checks both of the boxes. Professor Turner showed up to lectures twice a week excited to teach the class and it showed. The weekly PSETS allowed for me to further my understanding on Game Theory and kept me engaged. I am thankful that I was able to enroll in such a great course. I would take it again if I could!!",
                "I would, but only if they have an interest in game theory AND political science.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about game theory!",
                "I would recommend this course. not insanely hard or too much work and reasonably interesting lectures.",
                "Absolutely. The course content is fun and challenging, the professor is great and understanding, and the TFs feel a lot more personal than I've had in most of my other courses.",
                "Yes a very good course. Content is easy to get your head around. Taught well.",
                "Yes. This is a great intro to game theory that assumes no prior knowledge of concepts. I also really enjoyed the applications of the concepts to political science as we went along in the course",
                "If you are interested in game theory and it fits better into your schedule than the economics one the other semester (if it still is taught that way) then check out this course, but expect there to be a couple lectures about specific political science topics that may or may not interest you.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in game theory, economics and human behavior. The knowledge gained in this class is applicable to many different fields.",
                "Yes, without a doubt.",
                "yes, but more for Econ than political science."
