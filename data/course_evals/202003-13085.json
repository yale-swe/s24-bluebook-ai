They were always so accommodating and made going to class so fun, especially in a virtual environment where Zoom burnout is real. The class always keeps you interested, because we constantly were watching videos, giving presentations, and going into breakout rooms, where we did so many different types of activities - answering discussion questions, retelling the fairy tale we read and drawing the stories' events, playing Kahoot, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the secondary texts were very difficult to read, but by the end of the course the professors (Theresa and Shira) were great at highlighting the most important sections and giving us guiding discussion questions beforehand.",

                "The material of this course is very interesting, and it was always a joy to attend because of the discussion format. Occasionally the readings were very daunting (though interesting and rewarding), which was helped by the annotated versions which were available towards the latter half of the semester, but those could have been useful at the start as well."

                "Professor Schenker and Dr. Miron went above and beyond to make the class as interactive as possible. They used breakout rooms, cahoot games, a game on the last day of the class, presentations, discussion question submission, video submissions as response to discussion section as part of the homework and having different types of homework for each week. I think that all were very successful and the class was overall very engaging and very well organized yet often too fast for my pace.",
                "Given the need to be virtual, this course fared as well as a course could, in my opinion. The small breakout rooms that constantly switched allowed me to get to know my classmates in a way unusual for virtual learning.",
                "My virtual engagement remained incredibly high due to the diversity of activities we did during class (Kahoots, interviews, discussion questions, grammar exercises, presentations, drawing the fairy tales, etc.). Great use of breakout rooms! I don't have any suggestions on what could be improved - Theresa and Shira did a fantastic job of shifting this course to a virtual environment.",
                "I think the virtual seminar format was effective. The Kahoot quizzes and other classroom activities were also useful, but I wish the course had looked a bit more academic and less \"high schoolish\".",
                "Just the fact that this was a seminar-style class allowed for built-in engagement. Video and microphone were requested to be on at all times if possible in order to best bring an in-person environment to the Zoom room. Frequent and appropriate use of breakout rooms also made it possible to participate in small-group and class settings.",
                "I think the discussion format worked well, despite being online. Breakout rooms were also useful and generally productive. I wasn't a fan of the virtual learning day, however, and felt like the work took longer than a regular class would have."

                "Yes, most strongly! This course was incredibly interesting and engaging with a well balanced and spread out workload. The instructions and grading were very clear and the teacher was incredibly engaging.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, if Theresa and Shira are teaching it again. They are so passionate about the material, and know how to make every single class different and fun. Know that the workload can be a bit heavy at times, just because you have to keep track of weekly assignments (vocabulary lists, creative tasks), and also keep up with the readings. That being said, however, reading the fairy tales themselves never felt like a chore (unlike many of my readings in other classes), and we often were given links to movies that we could watch instead! Fantastic course that will be so different in contrast to the other classes you are taking. If you're trying to improve your German grammar, this class might not be for you - but you definitely still get to practice your German and improve it more conversationally!",
                "Yes, I would! It's exciting to delve into original fairy tales and study their symbolic meanings. It's also great to be improving your German with Theresa, who always makes it fun to learn new stuff.",
                "Yes!!! Take it! If you're not completely swept off your feet by a class about fairy tales (amazing!) then you will still be taking a very well-organized, challenging, yet manageable and rewarding class. Do it!!!",
                "Absolutely. Theresa and Shira were both great, the material is extremely interesting, your German skills will definitely improve, and the discussion with classmates is always fun."
