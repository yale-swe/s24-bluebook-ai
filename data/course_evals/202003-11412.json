                "My writing improved, in large part due to Professor Riley's fair but tough feedback. I learned about the America First isolationist movement of the late 1930s, as I wrote a research paper on the topic. I also further developed my critical thinking skills, my argumentative abilities, and my persuasiveness.",
                "I definitely learned how to be more concise with how I write, and I had my eyes opened about political philosophy. I learned that I put too much weight on words that I sometimes do not even know the meaning of such as truth or facts, and this course allowed me to dig deeper into what words like that actually mean.",
                "I was introduced to the standards of academic writing at Yale. Professor Riley provided clear and thorough feedback on my assignments, and was super helpful in improving my writing over the course of the semester. I learned how to write in both objective and subjective tones, as well as how to write a research paper. We discussed many contemporary subjects in American politics, and class discussion helped me gain a better understanding of such topics.",
                "I learned how to write succinctly and clearly in my essays. I also improved how to organize my thoughts effectively on paper, and the value of peer review. I developed my skill in formulating a thesis, checking my credibility throughout my paper, and picking good quotes to analyze. The biggest assignment in this course-- the research paper-- taught me how to gather and evaluate research material, and how to digest it in order to write an argument.",
                "I learned how to analyze a text for its problem, claim, evidence, motive, and warrants, and how to present my own reasoned arguments in a similar style and structure. Additionally, I learned how to engage and respond to an author and their ideas while relying on facts and evidence to provide the backbone of my arguments. I also learned how to write an academic research paper from start to finish--including how best to maximize Yale's resources and who to turn to when looking for guidance. Unique to this section, I gained a breadth of insights into the relationship between objectivity, truth, and politics in the American landscape, and got to explore the ideas of philosophers like Arendt and Nussbaum, as well as journalists and historians like McLaughlin and Snyder.",

                "The small-group, seminar format, even virtually, allowed for interesting and wide-ranging discussions on a number of topics. The spacing of the essays ensured that I got consistent practice at writing without becoming overwhelming. The course topic of truth and democracy especially made the class enjoyable; these kinds of issues are important to discuss in today's political environment and made for lively, enjoyable classes. The assigned reading was also compelling but not overwhelming.",
                "I think that a big strength of this course is that the students really guide the discussion based on the questions that the professor provides. The workshops when writing drafts of essays were extremely helpful in getting a fresh pair of eyes to look at the paper that I was writing. One possible weakness of this course is that one of the texts (\"The Craft of Research\") was not discussed in detail even though it may have been important when writing the paper. I think that the class could be improved by adding a wider variety of authors because there were a couple of articles from one person.",
                "Strengths: Professor Riley gives thoughtful and thorough feedback on essays, the course is wonderfully structured (the readings and assignments build on each other), and the people this course attracts are so engaged and excited about the subject. Despite the zoom format, discussions never hit a dead-end, and everyone was very involved.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only small weakness was that sometimes there would be confusion about deadlines on readings or writing, but this could easily be fixed through a weekly zoom announcements or email about what is due.",
                "Strengths: Professor Riley teaches this course incredibly well. She guides the conversations in the seminar with really interesting, probing questions that always provoke response, discussion, and debate. As a scholar of American studies, she adds a ton of interesting things to the conversation herself. Possibly more importantly, she gives extensive detailed feedback on every paper we submit. Her feedback was extremely helpful and made me grow a lot as a writer. She's kind and caring, and extremely approachable, and always willing to put in extra time to help out her students. The topic of this section is also very interesting and fun to engage with. Our class always ran out of time in our discussions; there were too many interesting ideas and lines of thought to follow. As such, I sometimes felt that we didn't do the authors\/texts justice, because there simply was not enough time to discuss all the big ideas. But this is a \"weakness\" that comes from one of the great strengths of the course: its questions and ideas were truly fascinating and engaging, for most if not all of the students in the class, and as such, we had very lively and thought-provoking discussions.",

                "great teacher, interesting reading",
                "Very well organized and structured, most of the readings were pretty interesting, great in class discussions",
                "strengths: a lot of open discussions which make classes very intriguing, it's always a surprise in which direction the class will go",
                "The greatest strength of this course was the professor. Professor Riley clearly wanted every student in her seminar to succeed and she put in several hours on each of my papers to give me feedback and notes that I could use to improve upon my writing. The weaknesses of the course were the online limitations. I think it would have been far more engaging if it was an in person discussion rather than an online one. I think I would have been able to understand people on a different level and participate far more often without trying to wait for a break in zoom talking.",
                "The class and its setup was very nice. We would have class readings then hold class discussion and go out into groups to refine our ideas before returning together to discuss more. The only thing I would say could be improved in this class was that i felt a little lost at the very beginning with our first writing assignment because their were not a lot of guidelines and expectations which led was a struggle in figuring out the expectations in our writing."

                "For the most part, I think the class went about as well as it would have during a normal year. It was a little harder to do research, as the libraries had significant restrictions, but not impossible. With 15 students and a professor, especially over zoom, discussions could get a little chaotic. In my opinion, requiring students to raise their hands to talk wouldn't impede the flow of conversation too much and would make discussions more orderly.",
                "I think that the virtual discussion\/seminar was definitely efficient but sometimes could get bogged down by the fact that many people may have wanted to talk at once (this could be improved with some type of system of calling on people or something of that sort). I think that the breakout rooms for workshopping definitely succeeded and individual breakout rooms as well for writing towards the end of class.",
                "Succeeded: believe it or not, the zoom format succeeded in discussions, since everyone for the most part was respectful of the speaker. The share format also was great for peer-review, since you could see the edits in real-time.\r\n\r\nImproved: I don't think there is anything that could be improved within the restraints of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
                "The Zoom seminar format was not perfect but this was unavoidable. Nevertheless, in some ways it could be conducive to having a sort of \"round table\" discussion, where you could see everyone's faces and reactions moment to moment. Professor Riley also often put us in breakout rooms for smaller discussions before sharing with the larger class, which made everyone get to talk to everyone else at least once throughout the semester, and also made the class atmosphere more comfortable for sharing ideas. She also used breakout rooms for peer-to-peer feedback sessions, which I found extremely helpful to my writing and to my ability to receive peer criticism.",

Everyone should take an English class at some point to improve their writing, and this course has the dual upsides of a great professor and interesting material. Professor Riley is intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and helpful. She willingly makes time outside of class to meet with students, she grades papers quickly and offers useful feedback, and she manages class discussions well. The subject matter of this class is very important nowadays, and it also leads to a lot of passionate and enjoyable debates. For anyone considering a freshman english class who enjoys a bit of political philosophy, this is the class for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student--it taught me so much about concepts of words that I take for granted or never really give more thought to, and also gave me ways that I can check myself when falling into some of the traps we discussed. It also enlightened me about the relationship between truth and democracy, which was actually the title of the book we read!",
                "I would 100 percent recommend this course to another student, especially if professor Riley is the one teaching it. The class was thought-provoking, well- run, and was a great introduction to writing courses at Yale.",
                "Absolutely, take this course if you want to do an intro English course. Professor Riley and the subject of \"truth\" will surely challenge your thinking, but you \"truly\" get out of this course what you put in! We experienced this course when there was a global pandemic, so I can guarantee that it will be even better when you get to take it face-to-face with your classmates! If you do choose this course, my one suggestion is to pick a research subject that you are interested in, since that will bring you the most joy in writing the paper.",
                "Yes! If you're taking your first writing credit, and you're interested in questions around objectivity, truth, epistemology (how we know what we know), politics, democracy, media, journalism, etc. (all very interesting stuff), this course is unquestionably for you. I had a lot of fun with the readings, the writing aspect, and the class discussions. I came into this course a bit apprehensive because I'd boxed myself into a STEM-personality in high school, but I ended up doing way better and enjoying way more than I expected. It has inspired me to take more classes in the humanities\/philosophy\/history department and encouraged me to explore interests I never would have thought to in high school.",

                "Yes. It's a class that allows you to both dive into the topic and practice writing.",
                "Definitely! I believe now more than ever the topic of this course is relevant",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to other students because I think this was maybe the most I have progressed as a writer in my lifetime besides the year that I learned how to write. Reading my first essay compared to my last was a huge difference.",
