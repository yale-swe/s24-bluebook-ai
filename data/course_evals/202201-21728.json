As someone who is quite a theater novice, I learned almost everything under the sun such as movement, acting, dance, and the mind of a director.  I really appreciated how welcome this course made me feel given most of the other students were well-versed in theater.",

Each week is a different guest lecturer from the TAPS department\/Drama School, so you get a really broad introduction to the field and get to hear from experts in all areas of the field -- everything from directing panels to avant garde\/surrealism to playwriting and more."

The quizzes were quite tough and asked for more specific answers than I hoped they would, but I learned how to study for them over time.  My only other wish was that Professor Brooks had one class to himself, as I think he has a lot to offer.",
                "very strong in showing the diversity of theater. I do think that the class has improved in racial inclusivity, but theres still more work to be done. Quizzes were unexpectedly difficult.",
                "disorganized with little continuity between classes",
                "Strengths: Getting to meet\/talk to many TAPS professors. Getting to see a show.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is really boring, you really don't learn much, the grading is pretty harsh for no reason. There are quizzes from stuff that only Hal knows, very minute stuff that does not teaches you anything.",
                "Strengths: You get to meet a lot of theater and performance studies majors (or generally people interested). \r\nWeaknesses: Didnt really learn much, most lectures ended up being somewhat problematic.",
                "I enjoyed the guest lecturers and how they are people currently working in the fields they were lecturing about. I felt as if this course gave a great preview to different courses available within the TAPS major and the people teaching those courses. I have no major critiques about this class."

                "Honestly, I don't think anyone should take this class unless you're decided on the major. I think even for the major, the class is pretty useless.",

This course is structured so that students can meet many professors in the TAPS department and decide which ones they would like to work with in future classes. For non-TAPS majors, this can be interesting but not especially helpful.",

                "Yes! I think it gave an intriguing theoretical overview to theater and performance. I feel as though I have a great understanding of the \"why\" we do theater. I think this course is interesting for people with little experience with theater and majors alike.",
                "Absolutely! you get to explore a wide range of theater topics, and it's exciting to hear from a new professor every week and get to know a large portion of the TAPS faculty"
