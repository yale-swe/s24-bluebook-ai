                "More math examples instead of reviewing definitions and exceptions would have been more helpful.",
                "By not writing all-or-nothing high stakes multiple choice questions, problem sets were unnecessarily difficult in comparison to the content taught in the course and the tests and oftentimes didn't help me do well on the tests. \r\n\r\nProfessor did excellent job of explaining content and always made sure to do many examples.",
                "Some of the strengths included all the practice problems we completed in class. Also, the willingness of the professor to help answers questions that students in the class had. Overall, no weaknesses about this course.",

                "Strengths are the small class size and many resources to get the topics. Weaknesses are the differences in teaching across sections.",
                "Strengths: There were a lot of office hours and tutoring options available.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In class it felt like we barely skimmed the surface of concepts that we would later be expected to understand in more depth.",
                "The course is well-structured and the textbook provides lots of exercises to learn the material. Practice exams were also very helpful, but having even more of them would be an improvement.",
                "A strength is that It teaches you to understand what you are being taught not just learn it. I think there could be more resources to help study and prepare for midterms and finals",
                "Strengths: Professors are very engaged with the students and are flexible, class was a mix of lectures and practice problems, engaged students with each other\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Slides that were posted only showed as they were presented, but did not show the solutions and problem steps"
