I think it was good that the problem sets were significantly more difficult than the exam questions. The organization of the course, though, was more of an issue for me. I found it difficult that I didn't know who was grading my work and what their standards were, and the peer tutors didn't really know the professors and what they expected of us. To be honest, I taught most of the material to myself from online sources after class, which took extra time but was ultimately easier to understand.",
                "Weakness - variability in teaching skill. This course is very dependent on who is teaching the student; some teachers know how to break down concepts into digestible chunks for their students while others simply do not how to teach. This is very unfair to the student because some sections are better prepared for the exams due to having a better teacher while other sections are less prepared.",
                "The professor wasnt good, I had to learn everything from the videos and psets",
                "there is a bit discrepancy between the quality of the teachers that i completely stopped going to my own teachers classes and went to another teachers classes",
                "I believe the greatest weakness is the disparities between the different professors that teach the course. I heard some of my peers had a really great professor that explained the content clearly, however I felt that I did not get the same quality of teaching. I would not mind that the class be taught in a big lecture rather than being split up into smaller sections because these differences in teaching styles made a difference in the final grade outcomes.",

I liked math a lot in high school, and I decided to take this class despite being a humanities major, but I don't think that was the best decision.",

There is also much content that is covered in this course and I felt that there had to be more support systems in place to ensure that each student was succeeding. Additionally, the cutoff for the grades was steep and required a lot of outside learning to get the grades needed.",
