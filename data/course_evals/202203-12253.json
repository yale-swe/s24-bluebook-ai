                "You will be astounded by how much you learn in one semester of ASL! When you take ASL, you're not just learning a language; you're learning an entire culture. I loved learning about all the little aspects of Deaf culture that make people proud to be Deaf. Through ASL, you will learn how to express yourself not just through signing with your hands but also through your facial expressions and body language. Learning signs was so much fun and felt really rewarding because every day I gained a little bit more communicative ability.",
                "Professor Rubin gave me a great introduction to deaf culture, how to sign basic words, phrases, and how to understand when other people are signing.",
                "I learnt basic sign language and about deaf culture.",
                "I learned beginner American Sign Language, aspects of deaf culture, and ways to help and include deaf and hard-of-hearing people. I learned many skills including ASL of course, but also how to interact with a deaf or HOH person, I was exposed to many different ASL events and organisations that helped to build up my knowledge as well as many service projects to help expand the deaf community at Yale.",
                "I learnt a lot of ASL vocabulary, as well as a lot about deaf culture, history, and inclusive communication. I feel like I can hold a basic ASL conversation, and I now understand a variety of things that are important to consider for inclusivity which I never would have thought of before.",

I gained a lot of insight into Deaf culture, which I am grateful for given my limited background in communicating with Deaf folks in the past. A valuable skill I've developed would be learning how to study such a unique language like ASL and improving my vocabulary so that I could think faster on my feet.",
                "I learned a lot about deaf culture, as well as learning different signs to understand and practice the nuances of ASL as a language, and how the different nuances work in the language that is not spoken, and how some of them are similar to those of spoken words, such as the uses of different hand shapes and its derivation, but is different in that it focuses more on emotion and movement than other languages. It is a very cool language.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: ASL at Yale is structured such that you're required to interact with the Deaf community, and I thought that aspect of class was a brilliant touch for cultural education. We were required to do a Deaf community service project, which taught me so much more about Deaf culture than I expected to learn from ASL, but I'm very glad it did. Prof. Rubin is also a very sweet and understanding person (I had multiple problems/questions throughout the semester, and she always helped me quickly and kindly), and she will always review signs to make sure we get them. She'll slow down if you think she's signing too fast as well, IF you ask!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the course was a bit disorienting at times. I always struggled to review signs because 1) I couldn't access the homeworks without going through and re-doing the homeworks 2) all the class slides were on the Modules tab on Canvas, but they were all just labeled as \"Lecture ##\" so that if you didn't remember exactly what day you were looking for it would require a bit of scrolling to review. The Deaf community service project was also a structural weakness; it's intended to be student-driven, but there were so many of us working on the same things that we often found ourselves stepping on each other's toes. That being said, the service project is very new and will get better with every passing semester, so don't let that deter you from taking ASL!",
                "The weekly field journals could be reduced to every other week and still help students track their engagement.",
                "There were only strengths, I felt very immersed in the deaf culture and I loved how the classes are completely silent, it was hard at first but as I got better at sign language I realized how much it helped.",
                "The course is well structured, and Professor Rubin is very engaging and a great professor. I do think that the workload is harder than other ASL batches, and while this was a bit frustrating at times, overall, I think I learnt more as a result of it.",
                "The instructor is easy to understand and very committed to us understanding and engaging with the content of the class. Professor Rubin's signing was easy to follow and she really encouraged us to engage with the material and Deaf community beyond the classroom, which was crucial to growing in our language skill.",
                "Strengths: very welcoming and accepting community, good pace\r\n\r\nWeakness: Canvas was a little disorganized at times and there was some confusion about assignments but I think this will get better with time!",
                "There was a general lack of organization for the course. There are so many things you have to keep track of over the course of the semester  journal entries, four different types of 'hours' that you have to fulfill, a service project, homework, filming yourself, etc. We would sometimes be notified of something we had to do by tomorrow at 10pm or of something we should prepare for class the next day that we never ended up doing. The grade weight of our midterm changed after it had been submitted but before it could've been graded. Also make sure to get a good seat in the center of the room because if you sit on the sides she won't ever look at you or sign to you so you won't learn as well. Basically, this class kind of has to become your whole life if you want to take it.",
                "A big strength in this course, and more broadly the entire ASL department at Yale, is the plentiful learning opportunities outside of class. There are so many potential community events (movie nights, athletic events, baking nights, signing tables, etc.) that students can engage in, and it made learning ASL much more fun. Interacting with Deaf/HoH folks, as well as fellow ASL students, gave me insight into the accessibility barriers facing the community. However, there is room for improvement, especially with the service projects. At times, it felt a bit disorganized and rushed, especially toward the end. Additional planning toward the beginning of the semester and specific assignment of tasks to students would alleviate the issues. Additionally, some of the learning materials -- PowerPoint slides and Signing Naturally homework -- felt a bit hard to follow through during independent study. Perhaps making the slides more relevant (and less repetitive) and allowing students to revisit SN without repeating it all (if possible) would be highly beneficial. Otherwise, I've had a great experience thus far, and I'm looking forward to ASL 120!",
                "Weaknesses: I think maybe making the syllabus a bit clearer. While we had a syllabus, the course itself did not follow everything on the syllabus and while what was expected to review was reviewed, the order and the actuality was very different. The other issue is the correlation of the course to the Signing Course on Canvas, as some of the signs learned in class did not correlate to those online and vice versa, especially since it used a different variant. I think some more practice of just fingerspelling would also be a huge boon to the course, as many other students I have talked to, including myself, had a bit of an issue following fingerspelling in the latter half of the course when learning new signs.\r\n\r\nStrengths: the course was well done to be taught by a deaf professor, as it really fully emersed the students into the culture of the deaf and gave us what we could look for and study. It felt more that there was aid than I have seen with other classes, which are usually taught by someone who is not usually a native speaker but rather someone who learned it. It felt more personal in that way, because we did not have to search for the culture to engage and spoke only in academic terms, but also culturally and socially which is often a problem I have with learning other languages in an academic setting. Engagement with the community was also very great as we were able to really get to know others who used ASL as a primary form of communication and there was a large community that we could learn with.",
                "Weakness was unplanned signing I will improve by attending signing tables",
                "This course is super interesting and informative. This course is also engaging which makes students more passionate about learning asl."

                "Absolutely! ASL is tons of fun to learn and a very useful language. I think you should only take ASL if you're genuinely interested in using it to reach out to/communicate with the Deaf community, but I would also highly recommend taking it with a friend, because signing across a loud room or while you're on the phone is such a lifesaver! It's a great way to fulfill your language credit; the professors respect your time enough that the workload isn't too much (and most of your work is just community engagement!) and you'll learn a lot in just one semester.",
                "Yes! Its a great thing to be pushed to be more expressive with your body language, the entire ASL department is so nice, and theres a lot of fun activities you get to do!",
                "Yes, because I think it is important to learn how to communicate in a different way and it was interesting and fun!",

                "Yes! ASL is a very interesting language to learn. Learning also facilitates a more inclusive environment for everyone!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in learning ASL. It fit well into my 5-credit schedule, since the workload is not too heavy. However, placement into the course was difficult given the demand. Regardless, I think a lot more people should learn ASL, and this class is a great introduction to it.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It is a bit easier to learn than other romance languages or obviously non-Roman alphabet languages, but it also forces the learner to engage a bit more. Whereas beginner level courses sort of build you up before getting into the space of strictly speaking that language, this course challenged the students as there were 2 days total of usage of speaking within the course, and they were the first and last (really the day of presentation) day. It made it so students were forced to focus on the hands signs as a way to understand others in the course. \r\n\r\nIt also forces students to engage more with their emotions. I am a very expressive person by nature and this course forced me to be more expressive when I sign so I could be understood.",
                "Yes! A very different learning experience",
                "Yes. This course teaches you so much more than sign language. It opens your eyes to the struggles that the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities face."
