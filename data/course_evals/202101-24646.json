                "I learned about ancient medicinal practices and theories, development and practice of medicine, and applications",
                "I learned to think critically about the conversations being had in the ancient world about the practice of medicine and how it ties into some concepts (like race and gender) that we still wrestle with today.",
                "I learned about ideas that people of antiquity had towards medicine, disease, and health. The course also taught me how to analyze ancient texts/other primary sources and to write concisely.",
                "Gained a better understanding of ancient medical practices and traditions and how they are still relevant today.",
                "I found this course to be very accessible as a non-history major. The primary sources that we worked with were very interesting, and I feel like I improved my ability to assess sources in general.",
                "I found the topic fascinating, and as I knew almost nothing about it when I began the course, I learned a great deal.",

                "The power of those in the medical profession during Antiquity and how they influenced and were influenced by the cultural practices of their time\r\nHow the female body was perceived and subjugated\r\nHow these ancient teachings were able to remain widespread for hundreds of years\r\nWhere we can see similarities between current day medicine and that of the past\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to concisely create an argument that details the purpose, point of view, and result of past medical perceptions\r\nHow to use multiple lines of reasoning to shape to create a bigger picture",

                "I loved this class",

A big focus of the course was reading primary texts and considering how to analyze them and get information from them.",
                "I learned a lot about medicine and belief in the Ancient world, but mostly in Ancient Greece. I also improved my critical reading of ancient texts.",
                "I learned much about medicine in antiquity, how to academically \"skim\" long pieces of work, how to analyze ancient medical descriptions. What I loved about this course was making connections between ancient medicine and medicine today; similarities still exist, and it's fascinating to see how we've come to where we are.",
                "History of science and medicine",
                "I learned a lot about the history of medicine, particularly in Greece and Rome. We learned about connections across cultures and up til today, which were very interesting.",
                "This was the first course in Greco-Roman history that I've ever taken, and I learned a great deal. I gained insight into society and culture in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, through the lens of disease and healing. For example, we learned about how medicine reflected and reinforced gender biases in society, about ancient responses to disability, and about the socioeconomic and other factors that might motivate an individual or couple to expose an infant.  \r\nWe learned that the themes present in each ancient society were often relevant to the themes present in other ancient societies, and also to themes in modern medicine and society. We learned about the Hippocratic corpus, and how its legacy was cemented for centuries in medicine practiced both in the western Europe and the Arabic speaking East. More broadly, we learned about various camps of healing in the ancient mediterranean, and how they interacted with one another. \r\n\r\nThroughout this course, I also gained confidence in my ability to approach both primary and secondary sources relating to history. I learned to be conscientious about the kinds of sources that historians use to study ancient medicine, and about what kinds of questions can be asked of those sources. I learned how to read primary sources closely, and how to understand the claims and structure of complex secondary sources.",
                "This course was a really interesting survey of the ways that health, medicine, and illness were treated in the ancient world, as well as parallels in the modern world. The assignments focus mainly on engaging with works of secondary source material either evaluating a certain aspect of ancient medicine or articles discussing the social repercussions of medicine today.",

                "This class was very easy to follow even as someone with little experience in the Classics.",
                "Strengths: professor, weaknesses: section, organization",
                "A lot of regions/topics are covered throughout the semester, and the workload itself is fairly manageable.\r\nHowever, grading was pretty unclear. You have to write three concise response papers, and you are given a recommended structure/format, but then your TA grades off a rubric that you had no knowledge of (so even if you write in the concise format, you still get points taken off). Feedback is clear, as your TA will leave comments, but it is just frustrating that they use a rubric that they do not share with students beforehand, or make clear what it is that they are looking for. The same goes for the written response for the midterm exam--there isn't a rubric and you can get points taken off without knowing why.",
                "Some strengths include that the professor was very kind and that there were three one page response papers that teach you to write concisely. Course content was also extremely interesting. I might not have read so many Hippocratic treatises and ancient texts had it not been for this course. I particularly enjoyed this course since we ourselves are going through a pandemic - learning about plagues of the past helped contextualize our situation now. \r\nA weakness of the course was that feedback for response papers were delayed, so it was hard to see what I needed to improve in my writing.",
                "Strengths- interesting course material\r\nWeaknesses- lectures were sometimes confusing, powerpoints were often ineffective and did not portray a lot of info",
                "Strengths: The course really provided a deeper understanding of antiquity medicine practices and how they are relevant to medicine today. Prof. Lamont was a very enthusiastic, engaging lecturer, and the course was very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The feedback was very slow. 40% of our grade was made up of three different writing assignments. For the third/final writing assignment (a month after the second writing assignment), we had still not gotten back feedback for the second writing assignment. As such, there really wasn't much room to grow here and really do any better on the last writing assignment over the second one. This is a personal preference, but it was at times confusing where different topics fit relative to each other as the course was taught by topic and not chronologically. Once the course had been finished, it all became clearer, but it was at times confusing during the semester.",
                "The course content was very interesting, and I liked that the professor encouraged us to make connections to the present day. I found the one page response papers to be a bit stressful, as I felt the expectations were a bit unclear. However, the professor was extremely engaging in both her live lectures and her recordings, and I really enjoyed the class!",
                "Strengths: Really engaging professor who supported her students' learning. There were lots of opportunities to ask questions and learn from the professor  and TAs. \r\nWeaknesses: I suppose it's my fault for not reading the syllabus more carefully, but I could have loved even a lecture on medicine in other regions of the world. There's a lot of emphasis on Hippocratic medicine too, and it would have been interesting to learn more about temple medicine in the Mediterranean world.",
                "A strength of this course is that everything within one unit related to each other. There was never a time when it felt like the readings were purposeless to the overall topic at hand. Office hours were extremely useful for talking about the readings and bonding with other students and the professor even though it was through zoom. The papers were short and sweet and we were given enough time to write them. The end of the year project was chill and fun to present.",
                "Strength: Professor Lamont is fantastic! Fascinating lecture, such a nice person and lecturer, and you really feel like you get to know her and that she cares about her students, even in a lecture. Interesting material, especially if you like Greek history or are a medicine person. Biggest strength is how organized her lectures are and how she really tells you what exactly you need to know from the readings by covering it all in lecture.\r\nWeakness: non. I couldn't recommend this class more",
                "Strengths: Professor Lamont and the content itself! I thought a lot of it was really interesting, and the professor was really passionate about the topic and was really accommodating this semester. Weaknesses: Virtual format made it harder to stay engaged.",
                "I wish that there were more powerpoints",
                "I thought the structure of the class was great, however, I wish the discussion sections were more organized.",
                "I thought this course was wonderfully formatted. Wouldn't have it any other way. Sometimes the reading was a bit long, but i'm understanding of that.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lamont was very personable and always seemed excited to teach the class\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures felt redundant. If you did the readings, you learned nothing new in class. Most days the lectures consisted of the professor summarizing the Hippocrates treatises assigned for that day and nothing else. I also wish there were PowerPoints in the lectures. Additionally, a few weeks had far too many readings. Lectures usually assign less than seminars, but after converting this course to a lecture class, the readings seem to have stayed the same.",
                "Very engaged professor",
                "One of the primary strengths of this class was that it was very well organized. A great deal of thought clearly went into arranging the order of the units and the readings. The readings for a given class might all touch on similar themes, for example, or might ask different questions about a given historical event. I also appreciate that the professor took time to explicitly go over the readings in class. Oftentimes, there were ideas or rhetorical strategies that I missed in my own readings of primary sources, and so it was helpful to have those points out. This added to the depth of my understanding of the sources. \r\n\r\nOn a related note, I found that the lectures that made use of lecture slides, images, bullet points, etc, were more helpful for me than those lectures that did not make use of these elements. The images were engaging, and the bullet points helped me to take more structured notes.",
                "The material is fascinating, and the course is laid out so that students can draw connections between societies and cultures across geographical regions and across time. Because the lectures are highly correlative with the readings, it is always quite clear what students should be focused on and responsible for in terms of assessments, which is very helpful and straightforward. Professor Lamont's lectures were fantastic, but I do think that they would come to life even more in person, so I hope that future classes will have that opportunity.",
                "A strength is that all of the lectures were recorded. A weakness the course wasn't that intellectually stimulating (i went over all of the material in the semester for the midterm and final in a combined total of around 24 hours) and discussion sections were boring",
                "I think a major strength of the course was going through all the readings together as a class, allowing us to truly understand the material. Dr. Lamont was also very kind and accommodating of us, allowing us to really enjoy the course."

                "In my opinion, the professor greatly improved virtual engagement this semester by opening up her Wednesday lectures as a period for discussion. While lectures on Mondays were live, the Wednesday lectures were actually pre-recorded. This allowed students to watch the Wednesday lecture either before or after Wednesdays class, and to use Wednesdays class time to ask the professor questions relating to that weeks material. This was an incredible opportunity to work through challenging readings. When lecture slides were used, these were also incredibly important for virtual engagement.",
                "It was an interesting approach to include synchronous and asynchronous elements, with one live and one recorded lecture each week. I appreciated Professor Lamont's aim to accommodate students who prefer each format in including both.",

                "the recorded lectures were amazing!",

I think this course is a great humanities course for anyone looking to go into the medical field. I will admit that the readings were pretty lengthy. That said, we were mostly asked to remember the big picture/thematic ideas of readings than the minute details (although some were important--but Prof. Lamont made it clear which these were in lectures). As such, even if you're deterred by long readings, I would still consider taking this course.",
                "I would recommend this course. The content is very interesting, and the assessments are fair.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found it very interesting.",
                "Depends on whether or not you like classics---this was my first classics course ever, and while it was interesting, I realized a little too late that the course would be nearly solely focused on the Western, Mediterranean world and nowhere else",
                "This course was easily my the highlight of my freshman year. Not only did I enjoy the information, but I adored the professor. I joined this class scared that it was tailored specifically for med students, but it isn't (not that a med student wouldn't benefit from taking this course). The reading were always interesting and the connections created between the various medicines in Ancient Antiquity was fascinating. I truly loved this course as was sad once it ended.",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It was so interesting, I felt like I learned a ton, and it was very easy! Lamont tells you exactly what you need to know from readings, which are not long, by going over each individual reading in lecture. She is such a great professor, I can't recommend her enough.",
                "Not with a virtual format, but it might be worth taking if this class is offered in-person again",
                "Yes, unequivocally yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in how diseases were understood in Ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome especially. I would also recommend this course to any student who is interested in the history of how diseases have been perceived and treated in Western cultures since ancient time periods.",
                "I did enjoy the material and topics, but Im not a fan of lectures and didnt find it too engaging. The professor is great, but it just depends on your learning style if this works for you or not.",
                "Perhaps, though I think it would benefit from being a seminar because it was difficult to engage with all the material in a lecture.",
                "If you love Ancient civilizations, ancient history, mythology, or medicine this is the class for you! Prof Lamont is wonderful, warm, and always so supportive.",
                "Yes, only if its offered as a seminar again.",
                "I would only recommend this to people who are interested in reading Hippocratic treatises because thats pretty much all we did for the entire semester.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in early medicine and ancient civilizations.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course manages to touch upon a broad range of topics (e.g. gender, disability, the relationship between rational and religious healing, etc), and thus has something to interest everyone. Furthermore, while the class asked challenging questions about source material, and while it drew on a great deal of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman history, the course was still very accessible to humanities and non-humanities majors alike. Finally, while the course focused on ancient history, the themes were very relevant to modern medicine and disease (and particularly to modern Western medicine). The knowledge Ive gained from this course will stick with me, and will inform the way I understand conceptions of disease and healing in the Western world going forward. I think others who take this course will have a similar experience.",
                "Yes! The material is completely different from any other class I've taken, even as a Classical Civilization major. I also think that it's a rare opportunity to find a class that considers the interactions between STEM and humanities in such an important context, as social issues and history influence modern medicine far more than one might assume. For that reason, the course also brings together students of different academic interest who all converge in this topic, which makes discussion sections quite vibrant.",
                "Yes, very interesting class. Great professor and TAs.",
                "yes! my favorite parts were learning about the various historical methodology--which we would've had time to dive into this even more. overall, really enjoyed.",
                "I would! It was an interesting gut course, especially for premeds & people studying history/classics/ancient civilizations",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the subject matters.",
                "I would recommend the course if they were interested in the subject of ancient medicine specifically because the course goes very specifically into different aspects of medicine in the ancient world; I don't think it's an ideal class if they're only interested in medicine and public health today, because while there are a few shared themes and connections, learning about medicine in the ancient world didn't really help me understand patterns today. Additionally, it is worth noting that the course covered ancient Mediterranean and Egyptian medicine, but not medicine in any other part of the world."
