                "This is one of my must-takes in the CS department. CS majors are very good at building things, and not as good at thinking through the consequences of building such things. This seminar surveys common issues with sensitive and private information in digital systems and the impact on society at large. Instructor lectures 50%, student presentations make up the remaining 50%. Got exposed to many different topics through student presentations.",
                "I honestly did not learn anything specifically other than the problem of sensitive data pretty much touches anything vaguely related to technology.",
                "You learn about the various ways your sensitive information is at risk by major institutions such as the government or large tech companies.",
                "I learned more about the collection and transmission of sensitive data.",
                "Different ways to think about hacking and sensitive information",
                "My writing was improved and I gained a deeper overall understanding of various issues relating to privacy.",

                "I learned about past\/current\/potential future issues in privacy. We spent a lot of time discussing the risk of a strong lack of privacy in society in different parts of tech, and the implications of that. Looked at how the technological landscape has evolved over the last few decades and discussed how it might change in the coming years and how that will affect our lives."

                "The course is very relaxed and clearly structured, which I appreciated. I think one of the weaknesses of the course is the repetitiveness of some of the content. We spent a lot of time reading Bruce Schneier's \"A Hacker's Mind\" and spending many class period just recapping what we had already read, which got a bit boring. Other than that, there wasn't a lot of expectations for time commitment which I appreciated.",
                "Lectures were slow and difficult to follow but students had a lot of autonomy in what they wanted to learn throughout the course for the term paper and presentations.",
                "Strengths: Survey overview of how sensitive information is collected and transmitted, across which markets and with which technologies; student presentations\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures didn't seem to build off one another cohesively",
                "Strengths: Interesting writing assignments and presentation topics. Helps develop key writing\/communication skills related to technology and cyber security.\r\nWeakness: Lectures could be dry and had fairly low classroom engagement. Would have liked more guest lectures (perhaps in different fields of cyber security)",
                "Strengths - allowed students to explore individual areas of interest\r\nWeaknesses - occasionally content felt scattered",
                "strengths:\r\nGreat- TF, and very interesting martial.\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nteaching is explained through slide shows.",
                "Jonathan and Professor Fischer are very kind -- sometimes the class lectures were a little dry. Great as a fifth class. Little\/no weaknesses.",
                "A strength of this course was the discussions we had in class. A weakness I would highlight is the pace of the lectures. I would have preferred more discussion based classes than lectures.",
                "It's a very low workload course which I appreciated, but not one that I was completely tapped out of! I think with low workload there is a risk of low engagement but I found the content to be interesting and helpful in my day-to-day life, especially as a computer science major. I like the breadth of topics we covered and the readings. I feel like I learned a lot in this course, which I wasn't totally expecting. Professor Fischer is also a very nice guy and is committed to your learning."

Especially recommend if you're a computer science major and you're looking for an elective to take alongside more intensive classes. I'm very glad I took it. Just keep in mind that there is a final paper that will creep up on you if you don't think about it a little bit before it's due."
