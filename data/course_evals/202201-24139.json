                "The course has a very interesting subject matter and premise, but the course frequently strayed from music, memes, or digital culture per se. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but at times, it felt insufficiently connected to the ultimate goal of understanding memes. This was exacerbated by the difficulty/esoteric nature of the readings. When we had the activities/time to really understand a reading, the class worked quite well, but when we didn't, I think most people didn't get much out of the readings. The extremely academic nature of some readings, with name dropping and references all over the place, made it difficult to engage.",

The class discussions were interesting. Sometimes reading the introductions to different readings seemed a bit pointless, and maybe overall the readings could've been trimmed down a tiny bit."
