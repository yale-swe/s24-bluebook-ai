Workload is significant but not unmanageable with regular dedication, and course structure offers lots of space for feedback.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A (textbook material uninteresting at times, but that is hardly the course's fault).",
                "Strengths: La!! She is an amazing professor! La explains things very clearly, creates an open class environment where people feel comfortable learning by making mistakes, and it is clear that she really cares about her students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is not specific to the instructor, but the workload for this course is very high. I know that it is a 1.5 credit course, but it often feels more like a 2 credit course given the amount of assignments. I have taken two other introductory language classes at Yale, and this course had far more work compared to the other two."

                "ABSOLUTELY! As someone who came to Yale with zero experience with German, this course built upon the basics of L1, improving my reading, writing, speaking, and listening to a huge degree. All the professors are very kind and encouraging, and the classroom was always a welcoming space.",
                "I would recommend the course unquestionably to someone with an interest in pursuing German language studies. Like many other language courses the workload is not trivial, but the reward for a considered study is genuinely uplifting.",
                "Yes; for anyone who is serious about wanting to learn German and to do so in a rigorous environment, I would recommend that they take this class.",
