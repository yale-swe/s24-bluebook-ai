                "Writing an academic essay, basically. Also, a wider perspective on post-colonial and colonial literature.",

                "I gained an understanding of some of the schools of thought of postcolonial literature. I gained an awareness of power dynamics and exploitative gaze when approaching a postcolonial text as a western reader.",
                "Some of the skills and knowledge I developed through this course included close reading skills due to the number of readings assigned in class, public speaking skills due to the number of class discussions that took place, the ability to formulate ideas and guiding questions as well as an understanding of instances of colonialism and its effects across the world in different contexts.",
                "The discussions in this course centered on the influence of colonialism and imperialism on the way people tell stories. We focused on post-colonial literature and discussed the various ways that the English language is used to trap or liberate. Specifically, we read stories from authors in the global south who contended with their experiences with the history and impact of empire and independence. I learned to critically appreciate and observe the legacy of English literature outside of its Western context."

            "comments": [
                "I personally thought the books/ course content were pretty boring. I thought we focused too much on the context and history of the book, and not so much the literature itself. It was more of a history class than anything.",
                "Strengths: fantastic reading list; Professor Mohamed is wonderful and extremely engaging in seminar; assignments were manageable but interesting\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: Professor Mohamed is definitely a strength of the course. His supplementary readings were excellent and helped us get more out of each novel. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class conversations were sometimes a little bland. I think Professor Mohamed did his best to move us along when conversations hit a lull, but I thought he could have directed us even more to keep it moving. He would also project quotes from other works or from criticism, and these often enriched our conversations greatly. However, we would often only talk about these for a little while, in a shallow way, and I wish we could have stayed with them more.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course include the interesting and engaging readings, the diversity of topics, novels, and author backgrounds included in the syllabus, the small seminar format that allowed much discussion, and the class format where every student had to be a discussion leader at some point in the semester. \r\n\r\nI think the course could improve by including a Latin American novel/author as the topic of colonialism was heavily examined throughout the semester and a Latin American reading could provide a different perspective that would encourage good conversation and discussion in class.",
                "The course readings were my favorite aspect of the course. I found them all to be interesting and worthwhile. I especially found the readings to be valuable to our considerations of the imperialist legacy of English literature, and how authors in colonized territories were able to forge their own stories. For example, one of the major themes of the course was the use and symbolism of language. We discussed what it meant for colonized people to tell their stories in the language of imperialist forces, and whether English-speaking audiences were entitled to English translations of non-English stories. The selection of course readings were very helpful in our course discussions."

                "If you are looking to fulfill the English major requirements, perhaps look elsewhere. If you are genuinely interested in colonialism in literature and the contexts behind them, take this class.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is great at providing students with important context on the readings and an amazing discussion leader. Definitely one of my favorite English courses I have taken at Yale!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, and I already have! I have convinced my roommate (who isn't even studying English) to take the course!",
                "I would encourage all prospective English majors to take Engl 128 as many times in the English major, the syllabi do not focus on non-American or non-British authors. As such, this class was different as its name announces from the beginning. The authors included in this class had an enriching and diverse variety of perspectives and experiences which generated engaging discussions as well as the acknowledgment of important and relevant topics.",
                "I recommend this course to other English majors because it opens up the world of storytelling. The readings discussed in this course go beyond the borders of the traditional geography of English literature, North America and Western Europe, and makes students reconsider their relationship with the English language. This course is an excellent introduction to the study of the influence of imperialism on language and literature."
