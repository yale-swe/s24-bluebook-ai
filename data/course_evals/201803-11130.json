   "comments": [
    "I developed my french speaking, reading, and oral comprehension through reading french literature, watching movies and discussing.",
    "I increased my French grammar skills the most in this course, while also learning a little about French literature.",
    "Frenchreading was great, speaking, and some amazing writing exercises",
    "The opportunity to consistently speak, read, and write in French definitely increased my fluency. I became far more comfortable writing short essays in French as well as speaking for long periods of time. The texts and films are also pretty wide-ranging and give a good backbone for the course.",
    "Above all, this course gave me a stronger foundation in French grammar, which has always been the most difficult aspect of the French language for me. The course also helped me gain confidence reading in French. The writing practice and Professor Skorupa's comments were very helpful, and the speaking practice and pronunciation feedback from Professor Skorupa during the oral tests was invaluable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: let's you practice your language skills in a safe environment and let's you revise grammar.",
    "I think this course had many strengths, and the one thing I would improve is increasing conversation time in the class. I think the reason that did not happen was because of the larger class size, which is understandable.",
    "Strengths:  covers everything from grammar to writing to speaking\r\nWeaknesses: unevenly organized",
    "Overall, the work is manageable. The units for the texts and films helped organize them for comparison and analysis in essays. Sometimes, the grammar exercises can be tedious and long, but the ongoing review of grammar is really helpful.",
    "The best unit was the Guy de Maupassant unit--the movie we watched was good practice and had an interesting and relevant plot while still being short enough that it didn't feel like a waste of time. In addition, Boule de Suif is an excellent novel. The units towards the beginning whose major work was a film, however, were not so good, as I found that when the dialogue challenged me I could not go back and look up words as I could when reading, so often major aspects of the plot escaped me. I learned more from the class discussions about the films than the films themselves.",
    "Some of the works we looked at in class were more engaging than others.  Tous les matins du monde in particular was difficult and not rewarding in my opinion.  Another work or even multiple works would have been better."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is a good course for those who have taken french for a couple of years and need to revise both grammar and comprehension while improving vocabulary.",
    "This class was amazing! My French improved a lot due to the feedback and attention from the professor (try to get Skorupa), and it's totally feasible as far as work is concerned. If you're thinking about continuing French after L4, I promise this course was meaningful. That being said, it is not easy since learning language requires a lot of practice and dedication.",
    "Yes, professor Skorupa is a great professor that is always willing to help with anything you may struggle with.",
    "Yes if you are interested in a wide ranging French course that will not focus entirely on one area",
    "Yes! L5 is really not much more daunting than L4. I was a first year who got a 5 on the French AP, so I was unsure going in if I would be able to keep up with the pace, but I was fine. You go over a lot of material that may be familiar, which is really helpful. Although there are a lot of essays, tests, and orals, they were well spaced out, and my french improved because of them. Also, having Professor Skorupa for this class makes it fun!",
    "Yes! It is an excellent (and necessary) next step in learning French. I feel much stronger in my language skills than I did in August.",
    "Anyone proficient in French should take this course, although it is a bit of work."
