    "INCREDIBLE readings that will definitely guide a lot of the rest of my academic study.\r\n\r\nClasses could have been a little more intentional, I think. I think the class would have really benefited from a discussion at the very beginning of exactly HOW to have a good discussion, and what classroom norms would be. \r\n\r\nI liked writing the reading responses, also!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to anyone remotely interested in the topic.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is necessary to today's times, really engaging, but also relaxed and a good space to have discussions about race and capitalism.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with reservations. The course is heavily theoretical, so if you are seeking a comprehensive treatment of the intertwined histories of race and capitalism, this may not be the course for you. It focuses heavily on the American context and could, I felt once or twice, benefit from sampling more readings and histories from other regions. The readings are difficult and dense and will take a lot of time to wade through. That said, they are fascinating and very instructive. They will challenge you to think about the world in new ways and to look for the intersections of race and capitalism in your everyday life. I feel that the professor could do a better job of facilitating discussion, given the difficulty of the readings and the diverse academic backgrounds of the students in the class. I felt he often looked for very specific answers to questions and didn't do as well as he could in allowing the students guide the discussion. Overall, I felt an unsatisfactory balance was struck between the teacher teaching and the students contributing. However, as in all seminars, the other students in the class play a large role in one's experience, and I did feel the students in this class with me were often not the most engaged. Finally, I would advise that the professor stick more closely to the reading list assigned at the beginning of the semester. It felt like a decent amount of chopping and changing took place, which was not only confusing, but disadvantaged students who had purchased texts which ended up not being used in the class.",
    "Take it, it will ground a lot of your future learning, especially if you're an ER&M major. But also be conscious of the class, and how the dynamic feels to you. Prof Carico is great, and can explain dense texts really well, but won't necessarily set up the best discussion environment, so it's more up to the students."
