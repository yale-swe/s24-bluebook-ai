I practiced introspecting on past experiences and current thoughts, writing them out, and editing them into an essay.

                "Professor Sharlin was very encouraging with the class discussions, this was helpful. Weaknesses for this course were unavoidable due to remote teaching  a fair amount of the spontaneity of in-person seminar discussions was lost.",
                "Professor Sharlin picked out fantastic essays for us to read. They were engaging, and I always looked forward to reading them. She also did a great job facilitating discussions, especially when we workshopped each other's essays.\r\n\r\nAlthough changing the meeting style kept things interesting, it would have been nice to have a consistent group of people to work and talk with through the semester. I often felt like we were changing groups right as I was getting comfortable with the peers I was working with.",
                "only strenghts, no weaknesses - this was the best english class I have ever taken; the class size is perfect, the workshops are amazing, super engaging, and meeting with the teacher one-on-one to discuss the essay is amazing, have access to tutors too is super super helpful!",
                "The readings, carefully curated, spanned several styles of the personal essay and were from all kinds of authors. I loved picking up new readings not knowing what to expect, and I also was amazed at how free all of us were to voice our likes and dislikes of particular pieces. Learning what made writing good included learning what made a personal piece, and the author as a result, unlikeable. Peer review was also so helpful. Professor Sharlin's feedback, sent in a word document with comments highlighting details and also useful general comments, was useful, but so was feedback from peersand Professor Sharlin understood this. I found myself very seriously addressing every comment made by my peers after a workshop or small group session. I'm pretty satisfied with how we were able to trust and respect each other while we discussed one another's work and stories, and I wish we could have gotten to know each other just a little more.\r\n\r\nWe always had interesting discussions about readings of essays from notable writers. Still, it was sometimes hard to take tangible lessons from our observations about their essays. Even if we did, it was difficult to directly apply some of the creative sentence structures. Perhaps this is just another level of writing that requires more editing sessions, time, and experience."

Smaller groups allowed for more discussion per person, and after first draft revisions, discussion on each person's piece even if you weren't workshopped by the whole class."

                "DEFINITELY! this class is insane. prof. sharlin was the best, but i bet most engl 120 profs are. this class is just sooo much fun. it is a lot of writing, but if you like creative writing and want to have freedom, explore differnt stiles, and recieve amazing feedback, it doesn't feel like work. i nthe end, we only had to revise one more essay, but I rewrtoe two, just because this class made writing so much fun. it made it feel natural, real, and just a distraction. the topics are so broad, but they also give you direction, which allows you to wrtie about exactly what you want. everyone says that engl 120 is iconic and they are right. there is nothing more i can say, except that I am a stem major and this is my favourite class.",
                "I strongly recommend this course! This is a meaningful WR credit where you feel freedom to explore your personal experiences and try new things in your writing. The workload was not so much heavy, as it was uncertain on an individual basisbrainstorming personal experiences could take an unpredictable amount of time. I especially enjoyed this class because of the wonderful professor and the fantastic, diverse, group of peers. If possible, shop two sections to see how you feel about the group of people taking the class."
