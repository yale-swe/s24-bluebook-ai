                "about the history of drugs over the course of American history/social and cultural trends/legislation etc.",
                "I learned about the cultural history of drugs in 1900s U.S and how rapidly the pharmaceutical industry and debates around drug and medicine have shifted in the past century. Some specifics include the history of alcohol prohibition, pharmaceutical contraceptives, heroin, amphetamines, and more.",
                "I learned a lot about trends regarding medical/drug opinions in America throughout the 1900's (like Prohibition to the wonder drug era to the War on Drugs era), as well as specific details about the emergence and rise of certain drugs (like opioids, Valium, birth control, tranquilizers, etc). I also learned to think critically about certain things that we take for granted in the drug/medical world, like how certain drugs became acceptable or unacceptable, or how certain drugs or diseases have become associated with certain demographics of people.",
                "Histories of drugs, their cultural/political significance, trends in drug regulation/policy (prohibition era, emergence of white market/black market drugs, reform, pharmaceuticals, war on drugs). How to think about the meanings we have given drugs over the course of history and why certain drugs carry associations with certain types of bodies, politics, regimes.",
                "I learned about how illness and health are defined by the interaction between drugs, policy, and history. I practiced primary source analysis skills and learned how to write an op Ed.",
                "I learned about the history or drugs and addiction in America as well as the science behind addiction and how this science has been interpreted by lawmakers.",
                "This is a fascinating survey class of the history of drugs in the U.S., which covered typical topics like alcohol and prohibition, cigarettes, racialized drug policing, and psychedelic counterculture as well as critical framings of decolonial queer activisms and science and technology studies toward the end. This is a fantastic history of science class taught by a professor who is knowledgeable in decolonial and critical theories of science studies, which has made this one of the more interesting \"history-focused\" HSHM classes I've taken!",
                "So much! There were so many topics of contemporary relevance like those on opioids and discourse on risk, and things I found personally interesting like birth control.",

                "All strengths very engaging readings and discussions I only wish the readings were slightly shorter but they were all good",
                "strengths: discussions, professor, interesting content\r\nweaknesses: n/a",
                "The class was strong in how varied the topics were which is also one of its weaknesses; each week seemed a bit disparate than the others, making it hard to draw connections between histories of various drugs and medications. The flow of the class as a seminar was also interrupted by the teaching style of showing a powerpoint for the first 1/3 to 1/2 of class with an open Q&A session; I personally felt it was difficult to communicate with peers in the class and build off of each others' observations and ideas given this class format.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- amazing readings (I actually wanted to read all of them to understand them and think about them, instead of just reading them in order to be able to participate) \r\n- not too high of a workload/generous deadlines to eliminate any stress about the course\r\n- the final op ed was so cool because you could pick any topic you want so I was super excited about mine\r\n- a really interesting professor who can provide both the clinical aspect of the topic (making it really exciting for pre-meds especially) and also the extensive historical background\r\n\r\nno weaknesses at all",
                "Course material is definitely a strength by itself all readings seemed carefully curated and selected to provide a diversity of perspectives for each discussion. Maybe one weakness would be the op-ed assignment instead of a class workshop (which not everyone was fully engaged in), there could have been office hours or 1-1 meetings with students for a more productive discussion?",
                "Professor Ramos runs class skillfully and chooses fascinating material. The Reading list and Professor are absolutely a strength of the course. Discussions could be a little more structured, because sometimes they got a little off track and it didnt always feel like we were connecting the material from one week to the next.",
                "This course is excellent and I highly suggest it to anyone interested in drugs and addiction and the science and law surrounding it (which is pretty much everyone).  The class is highly organized and engaging, and the feedback is clear and personal. Professor Ramos is incredibly understanding and allows extensions with no questions asked.",
                "I really appreciate the way this course is structured and the teachers teaching style. He is super accommodating and makes it feel easy to participate and have your perspective be heard. The only thing I would wish is that more students could take it! But I think Professor Ramos is turning it into a lecture course which would be great.",
                "Class is oriented around discussion in a really productive and generative way. Students bring a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, as in every HSHM seminar I've taken. Readings were interesting. Professor Ramos is a fantastic guide through this material. This is a fantastic course, I can't recommend any improvement."

A lecture format would make more sense given the wide breadth of content the class covers, as in a seminar format, there simply isn't enough time to fully delve into certain topics. \r\n\r\nI would recommend it as a lecture but not as a seminar which I think is because the class was kind of being trialed as a leminar as it transitioned into a full lecture for next year.",
                "YES!! If you can get in, you should take it. It was my favorite class at yale, as a pre-med student and a history major. It is great and applicable to your life no matter what background you have. Professor Ramos is also so amazing and understanding, so you will never feel stressed about the class. It made me rethink a lot of my assumptions about drugs and medicine in a really good way.",
                "Yes, an amazing HSHM seminar for both majors and non-majors! If this class ends up being a lecture (likely because its always oversubscribed), would still recommend taking it!",

                "I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to anyone, history major or not. I was one of the few students in the class who was not pre-med, and I still found the class to be incredibly accessible. I loved it and wish I could take it again.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of science and medicine, American studies, history as well as public health and pre-med students!! If you're going to be working in health policy, public health, or medicine, then I can't recommend this class enough. If you're more interested in STS and critical science studies, then I recommend this class for learning a significant amount of historical grounding that will help give material context to theories like Adele Clarke's biomedicalization, Dumit, etc.",
                "Absolutely! The topics and level of engagement was great. I learned a lot from my peers, the professor, and the TA.",
                "Yes! Take this class if you want to have a history seminar designed around actual seminar discussion and deep engagement with a fascinating and important subject."
