Definitely a great German culture course, or a history course (especially if you are interested in memory culture or WWII specifically).",

This course really opened my eyes to film as a medium through which history, culture, and change can be examined. As a history major, I definitely got what I wanted out of the course (more so than in actual history courses), and also developed a more sophisticated film vocabulary.",

                "Strengths: the grading structure is really excellent and conducive to a lot of different learning needs (you can either do weekly responses every week, or skip some and do a final paper). Prof. Hagens is very kind and invested in us as students and learners. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the films were a bit boring (in my opinion) or the discussions were too lecture heavy, but in general it was a really well-run seminar",
                "This was a very well-designed course. Students were required to write a two-page analysis of each film each week in lieu of a final paper. But, if students choose, they could skip up to four weekly responses and instead write a final paper at the end of the semester. This provided students with several different options and allowed us to choose what was best for us. The readings and films were fascinating and class discussion was incredibly engaging.",
                "This course is really good at engaging with the film I loved it",
                "This course's strengths include an emphasis on discussion and its emphasis on the ethical component of filmmaking; I really can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Nothing should be changed, the course is great.",
                "Purely strengths. This course was the best course I have taken at Yale so far. Prof. Hagens is an amazing, friendly professor and the workload was manageable and even exciting. The course was one I genuinely looked forward to and enjoyed doing the viewings and discussion contributions for.",
                "The most obvious strength of the course is the content material. The required films are incredibly interesting and offer a range of German perspectives on culpability and the Third Reich. The format of the class, in which a student leads discussion on the film every week, was also very successful. The only weakness I might point out was that I sometimes wished we got to hear Prof. Hagens give more historical and filmic context in class.",
                "Heavy on the film history. Although it was interesting, we could have examined filmic methods and analysis more."

                "Definitely, especially as a German culture course or history course. Probably not a lot of new film studies info if you're a film studies major, but if you're not, it's a good intro film studies course!",
                "Absolutely. Professor Hagens is a kind and engaging professor. The class content was fascinating. It is a discussion-based class, and the assignments were meant to force you to engage with the material as opposed to being arbitrary assignments. I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed each and every class.",
