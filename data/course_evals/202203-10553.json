I learned as much from my wonderful professor as I did from my insightful and engaged classmates. This course offered both the opportunity to explore seminar classes at Yale while also allowing me to examine my own beliefs, and as a result, feel more confident in my convictions.",

                "The assigned workload of this course was not heavy, but the thought-processes were. In order to get the most out of this course, you definitely must commit a significant chunk of time to digesting, interpreting, and reflecting on the assigned readings. Each week, we had a collection of readings to interpret that were structured around a theme (usually between 30 to 100 pages). Additionally, we were asked to reflect on them in a short discussion post. I really liked how we weren't asked to propose any grand theory from the get-go, but that these discussion posts instead served as a way for us to come to these understandings together in class discussions. Unlike a lot of other learning at Yale, the process of philosophical thinking is slow and deliberate, and I think the structure of this course mostly encouraged that. The opportunity to lead class discussion was insightful, and I would have loved to have an opportunity to do that more than once. I learned a lot the first time and have so much room  and now, knowledge  to do so better and more effectively.",
                "Strengths--interesting readings, class discussions, amazing teaching\r\nWeaknesses--no grades are put into canvas, more practical approaches to readings, what do we do about this?",
                "A strength of this course is that the reading load is manageable and that class discussions are easy to follow\/are engaging. A weakness is that due to the lack of graded assignments throughout the semester, there aren't a lot of opportunities for feedback and it is difficult to know exactly how well you are doing in the course grade-wise.",
                "Strengths: such a great course!! the readings were always super engaging, interesting class discussions that left me pondering throughout the week, and Prof Dembroff is very knowledgable, kind, and created a warm classroom ambiance devoted to openness to different ideas. definitely changed the way I look at labels such as gender, race, and disability in our society. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes difficult to participate in discussion since the conversations were fast-moving, could benefit from smaller group discussions as well, but this improved as the semester went on",
                "I think it should meet more than once a week. I also think it should involve more variety in the assignments.",
                "I loved how the course focused on learning and different ways of thinking rather than grades. The discussions of the readings were very engaging and I loved hearing my peers insights. \r\nOne weakness is that it only met once a week and it may be more productive to do shorter classes throughout the week.",
                "The strengths are the manageable workload and thew amazing clarity with which concepts are explained in class. Also the freedom to explore ideas and projects that all students have. A way it can be improved might be by providing more context on the history of scholarship about masculinity and the main figures in that area."

If you want to think critically about gender, challenge your own thinking, apply your learning to your own experiences, and contemplate justice through a complex historical and contemporary philosophical lens, take this course. Get ready to feel uncomfortable, to revise your way of looking at the world, and to think about catalyzing thought into action.",
                "Yes! Professor Dembroff's course is amazing and you learn so much! Masculinity is so complex and it's so intersectional.",

                "Yes 100%! This is one of those courses that changes the way you view the world!",
                "Yes, great option for a first year seminar.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it introduced me to a new way of thinking of the world.",
                "I would so recommend this to anyone who wished to understand themselves and the world more clearly especially in relation to gender. Everyone should know this stuff so they are freer in their personal life to look at themselves from outside of the daily dynamics that govern out interactions around gender and which often go unnoticed."
