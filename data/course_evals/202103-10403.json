                "This course was my introduction into what ethnography is, using the lens and focus of Latinx studies. This course was really engaging, especially the assigned readings which were typically ethnographic pieces that dealt with different themes in Latinx studies such as belonging, migration, transnationalism, etc. It was also a great introduction into archival work, which I gained a lot of skills in through hands-on practice.",
                "Understanding the process of how my community is all undergoing autoethnographic work to subvert and understand our condition of exploit.",
                "I gained useful insight into qualitative research methods. This class was great for exploring ethnography in the context of Latino Studies. It was very special because we got to sort the Despierta Boricua archives and interview past members of La Casa Cultural. The history was very relevant and applicable to not just schoolwork but Latine life at Yale."

                "Strengths- The actual semester long project was a lot of fun and something that I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to do. The work we did each week was interactive and tied in the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I was a bit frustrated sometimes when we didnt receive clear instructions on how to do some of the archival work. I would worried that I was not doing the work correctly and would rely on my peers for advice and guidance. Some more guidance during some parts of the process would be extremely helpful!",
                "The strengths are the readings, which were always so interesting and well selected. Ana is also a huge strength. There is so much to learn from her. The major weakened is that we there was not much seminar discussion. This was because we were doing so much in the class, doing readings every week in addition to archives work but more discussion would have been nice.",
                "The strengths of this course are the quality and relevance of the readings. I was never left thinking that I had wasted time with them, and I enjoyed hearing professor Ramos-Zayas' thoughts on them. That being said, classes were primarily lecture-based, not necessarily in that we were being lectured more material, but that there was not a lot of time for discussion. When we did have discussion, it was a bit dry. Another weakness was that the grading felt arbitrary and did not usually come with an explanation.",
                "Course was great! Overall one of the best classes to understand the application of concepts and ideas.",

It was extremely interesting and not overly taxing, and professor Ramos-Zayas is absolutely wonderful!",
                "Yes! and I have to many people during the semester.",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about Ethnography and Latino Studies. If you ever considered working with archives or conducting your own qualitative research I strongly encourage you to take this class. The history we learned was very relevant to Latine life at yale. It is rare to find a course that engages with the history of activism at Yale and the importance of our culture houses."
