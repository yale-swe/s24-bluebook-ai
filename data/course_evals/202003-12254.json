                "This course is extremely well taught with close student engagement. I wish the course could have had some more speaking practice, which was difficult given the Zoom format. Honestly, though, it is very difficult to find a weakness.",
                "I think the course is designed very carefully and allowed us to move at a very fast pace without feeling overwhelmed. The parallel between the story French in Action and the grammar we have been learning helped us to learn phrases faster and easier.",
                "Strengths: Madame Sherak is incredibly helpful and was very supportive and encouraging throughout the semester. I also appreciated how flexible she was during the pandemic with assignments and scheduling.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It can be a draining course since it is nearly 2 hours every day and the 1:30 PM time can eat up your day, but I liked being able to sleep in if I could and the breaks are very nice.",
                "Perhaps more Zoom breakout rooms and more in-class exercises\r\nAlso having solid grammar review sheets whenever we learn a concept would be great",
                "The course overall is great and will give you a strong foundation in French in a short period.  \r\n\r\nThe materials are dated, but they are also kind of awesome, and they are definitely still effective.  I do think that Yale should probably revisit the episodes and edit out some elements that have not aged well, including some problematic racial and gender stereotypes, or at least add material to address and own these problems.  At a point in the course we deviated partially from the French in Action materials, and I found it challenging to maintain the same study rhythm once we didn't use the FIA materials as consistently.  So, for me at least, it would have been a little better had we stuck fully to the program the whole class.  \r\n\r\nI think having the course in the afternoon was great, and I wish that the second half of the intensive course were also offered in the afternoon.",
                "The material could be updated to encourage more active engagement from the students. The storyline is outdated, so I didn't feel I was getting as much in terms of its cultural context as I could. Even conversations about what changed\/what is different today would be interesting and informative."

                "Overall, the course translated surprisingly well to the online format, especially for a language class. I got plenty of reading, writing, and listening practice. The only thing I wish we had was a bit more speaking practice, which was difficult over Zoom (we'd have to go into breakout rooms which is so much more difficult logistically than just turning to a partner and talking).",
                "I think learning a language through zoom had its difficulties such as being able to hear the correct pronunciation of words or being able to imitate the instructor in order to be able to get words right but with a collective effort I think we overcame such problems.",
                "I liked the flexibility in scheduling our tests because it made the class very accessible for students in different time zones and\/or who had scheduling conflicts. I don't think this flexibility would have been the case in-person since we would all have to be on campus.",
                "Language courses work fine online",
                "The French in Action videos are very helpful as a learning tool. Yet, on Zoom when a video is shown through ScreenShare, there are a lot of freezes and for the purpose of engagement it wasn't very productive. I think the videos could be seen before class and there could be an alternative oral exercise related to the videos in class."
