                "I learned a lot about the different techniques used in data science in studying the humanities or more broadly non-STEM fields. I also learned to be critical of data science projects in the humanities and to bring those critiques to my own work. I think the material I learned in this course can be so useful for both future projects regardless of the field as well as for everyday life. Data science in the humanities is still a relatively novel field and there is so much more to learn that this course opens up doors for.",
                "The class goes over a lot of techniques for meaningfully using and crunching data in a humanities context and explores its limitations and the current debates over its use. More-or-less weekly psets give exposure to each technique covered, from topic modeling to data visualization, and overally provides a good introduction to the growing intersection of data science with the humanities.",
                "Get a strong foundation in how to construct data visualizations, and a pretty high level overview of many different techniques. I wouldn't say taking the course makes you an expert in any of these, but the value is more in recognizing that a given method exists and recognizing when it might be useful. I definitely feel like I'd be able to teach myself the more in depth stuff if I ever needed it now that I have a bit of a foundation.",
                "A very surface level overview of humanities data mining techniques.",

            "comments": [
                "I think it is really a great course if you want to work with data in humanities (hence the title).  Peter is super aware and understanding that many of us had little experience and was really accommodating.",
                "maybe some more interactive things with the class.",
                "Strengths: Exposure to broad array of computational methods, Professor Leonard is really great during office hours, and the topics discussed are generally applicable to a lot of different fields.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's easy to get by in the course without learning the material if you want to, reducing the practical application of the course's teachings. Moreover, the lectures were often dry because they were just Professor Leonard walking us through the Collab notebook. Collab is one of the worst platforms for coding and it was very frustrating to use throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Grading is fair, problem set expectations are communicated clearly, teaching fellow support is solid, and the literature reviews offer an opportunity to delver deeper into topics of interest to the student\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It can be hard to reconcile super technical readings and math-heavy lectures with the actual simplicity of the code required to execute the assignment. I appreciate learning about the deeper mathematics, but it can take away from learning how to apply code in an accessible way.",
                "My favorite part of this course was definitely the class itself. The format lies somewhere in between a lecture and a seminar, where it is still the instructor talking to a class but the level of participation and engagement in the class is really high. This interactive format was very enjoyable. It was easy to participate because it felt like all comments held value in the class. The assignments are also relatively easy because the explanations are so clear, and as such you gain so much knowledge from the problem sets and papers without feeling that you are unnecessarily strained for time or knowledge. Peter would always bring in amazing examples of projects he has been involved with or other projects that demonstrate certain humanities data mining techniques that always made the class so much more interesting. \r\nI can't think of any weaknesses for this course besides perhaps a small learning curve for students with no experience in coding, which can easily be overcome by visiting office hours where help is so readily available.",
                "The lectures were really interestingwell paced, good content, and engaging. Thursday labs got a little slow, but that might be due to the fact that the class teaches to a very wide range of programming skill levels. If you're just starting out, you won't be drowning, but if you have a little more experience you'll be able to finish everything quickly and might find yourself twiddling your thumbs for a couple minutes (which given the pacing of many Yale classes really isn't the worst thing in the world).",
                "I like how this course is what you make of it. It's easy to get by without trying at all but you can also learn a lot if you take the content seriously.",
                "Strengths: fascinating course material!\r\nWeakness: The problem sets is very similar to the class material , would have been able to learn python better if they were a bit different and challenged us by making it a bit different.  We barely got any feedback on the writing material and vague ideas about the rubric",
                "The problem sets were very approachable and made learning about data really fun!",
                "It's a low-stakes point of entry to try out coding, and the final project was a fun opportunity to experiment with different methods covered in the course. On the other hand, the non-coding lectures (on different topics in the digital humanities) are mostly very basic and will seem boring to people who've taken a few humanities courses.",
                "Strengths: Leonard is a great professor, content is interesting, workload is very reasonable.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Would have liked a bit more focus on Python basics for the non-CS people in the class.",
                "The Strengths include the discussion of relevant, engaging projects as well as the accommodation for students of all disciplinary backgrounds.",
                "The course was well structured. I came away with a lot more knowledge of data science and I was surprised by just how applicable data science is to the humanities. It was taught very well. The professor and TFs were all extremely knowledgable and capable.",
                "I think the class could afford to be slightly more difficult in order to make it more engaging.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Leonard is fantastic! He explains complex topics in mind-blowing lucidity. The final project felt especially rewarding and gave us lots of creative freedom.",
                "Strengths: Professor Leonard is extremely enthusiastic (and he has a great sense of humor IMO). He is very understanding and willing to help his students succeed, and makes time to guide students through problem sets and assignments. The course material would definitely be interesting for anyone who has no prior exposure to this field. The grading is extremely lenient. || Weaknesses: While the course material was fun and interesting, it almost felt too easy. After all, because this course has no pre-requisites, many of the topics are covered at a level that would be too basic for someone that wants a really in-depth understanding of data mining techniques. I think marginally raising expectations on assignments and problem sets would go a long way in terms of allowing students to really engage with the material at a more intellectually challenging level.",
                "The clearest strength of this class is you learn a lot without an overwhelming courseload. Thus, it's an incredibly fulfilling and efficient class. That said, you get what you put into the class, meaning it won't be fruitful if you're not invested in it.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot about data science and I am interested in taking more S&DS classes in the future. This class is an easy A and almost all assignments are graded on completion and showing that you understand and can apply the course's contents. Professor Leonard is an engaging professor who loves what he is teaching.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) If you want to learn Python really well and be able to code a lot of things in the language, I do not recommend this course. I would have preferred if this class taught me how to code Python first and then how to code specific functions for humanities research, rather than only teaching me the latter. 2) This class is not a QR credit, even though it is an S&DS course, so if you are looking to get a QR credit, I would not take this class; it will feel like a waste of time. 3) I thought this class would be a seminar but it was a small lecture."

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student regardless of major, especially if it is still being taught by Peter. The material is just so interesting and so relevant to anyone regardless of your major. It is difficult to find material interesting to both data science and humanities students, but this course managed to do so! I look forward to bringing many of the skills I learned in this course, both technical in learning new data science techniques, and the more \"soft skills\" acquired in learning to be critical in the field of data science to my social sciences degree. There really is no student this course would be absolutely useless for. It is also not a demanding course in terms of workload and I felt on many assignments you could spend as little or as much time as you are interested in investing and still do well.",
                "Yes-- I came in with a significant amount of programming experience, but the weekly psets are very accessible to even those with no experience whatsoever. The literature/project reviews are a lot of fun, and the open-ended final project is a fun application of those concepts to whatever topic you are interested in.",

                "Great course if you want an introduction on humanities data mining topics",
                "Absolutely! I learned a lot about the tools that are available out there to help me with humanities work, and actually managed to use some of the tools for my final papers in other courses. While I wouldn't consider myself utterly data-proficient, I think this was helpful to enlighten me to the \r\n\"search terms\" and scholarship that is available out there. I also learned that a lot of data work/ coding can be learned by going onto github and learning to ask the right questions, and this was a great way to build that foundation so I can pick up skills more quickly in the future.",
                "Yes, if you have very little or no coding experience and are interested in the digital humanities. If you aren't either of these things, this class won't benefit you.",
                "Yes, both if you're a humanities student looking to find ways to incorporate data science into your work or a CS/S&DS major looking to expand your understanding of Python methods. I will warn that this course isn't really a standard introduction to Python and is more teaching you specific methods, so I wouldn't come in expecting to roughly the same type of instruction you would get in, say, CS 50.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a really fundamental introduction to the field of data analysis. It is a pretty chill class that exposes students to useful humanities data mining tools/techniques.",
                "Absolutely! You learn a lot without a heavy courseloud. It's also an incredibly self-driven class, meaning the more you put into it, the more you learn. It was interesting, fun, and a great class to apply to the stats certificate.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking for an easy A and engaging subject matter. I would not recommend this course if you really want to learn how to code a lot of things in Python and/or if you are looking for a class that fulfills the QR requirement."
