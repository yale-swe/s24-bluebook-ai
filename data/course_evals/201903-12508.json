    "I learned a lot about Greek history, as well as literary and filmic styles, that I didn't know before. I also got to reinforce my film studies skills that I hadn't practiced in a while.",
    "I learned how to better strip my writing down to its core ideas, removing excess content in order to create a more focused and fluid piece."

    "strengths: interesting seminar discussions, small class size facilitates greater learning, professor syrimis cares a lot about the subject matter and his analysis of the text\/films were enlightening\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the material can be uncomfortable",
    "I would not change this course in any way -- it is already amazing! The readings and the films are great and the discussions themselves are very enjoyable and engaging.",
    "I like that this course requires a lot of writing and weekly engagement with the texts. I also really enjoyed the presentation assignment.",
    "I enjoyed the discussion based nature of the course as well as the student moderation. However, I wish that the discussion was tailored to cover the text more broadly. The class would often get entrenched in one aspect of the reading and we would not get to discuss other important topics due to time constraints. Also, while I did enjoy the task of thinking about the texts through the response papers, I think that having one paper a week did not allow me to fully develop my ideas and produce a polished product."
