    "This course provides a bit more depth into more specific chemistry topics in comparison to S161. I would say 161 was a lot more general material where as 165 is a lot more difficult, specific material.",

   "comments": [
    "Online courses are really tough.",
    "Being online, it was hard to engage with the professor and other students to better understand the materials. There was a lot of information in this course that is hard to cram into a semester's worth of class.",
    "Top hat was great aside from the specificity it requires for dog figs",
    "Profs and TA are very accessible when you need help.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Cooper! He does an amazing job at not only keeping us engaged (or as much as he can with sometimes pretty abstract concepts) but also at explaining material clearly and breaking it down for me. I was always nervous about STEM at yale as someone with not a great hs background for it, but Prof. Cooper is great at clearing up any confusions and more than happy to go over any questions you still have after class.\r\nWeakness: just the timing of it, which isn't anyones fault, it's a lot of material to go through so theres not much time to go back and really practice and get comfortable with too much of the material if you arent within a day or two. Outside resources help a lot though if theres specific things you want to focu on practicing more.",
    "Strength: Prof Cooper is organized and communicates with students well on the expectations of the class. \r\nWeakness: Due to the nature of the course, lectures and work can be pretty dull. Sometimes concepts were not explained well enough in class\/lecture or the example problems were not hard enough so the exams were a bit surprising."

   "comments": [
    "You have to catch on quickly, especially given the compressed timeframe. Know yourself as a student when deciding whether or not to take this course.",
    "I think that the information and problem solving received from this course is extremely helpful, so from that point of view, I would recommend it.",
    "I recommend this course to people who have not taken AP chem",
    "I thought the material was very interesting and well presented, and Professor Cooper is great. If you can take this course with him, I definitely would recommend it.",
    "Lots of people need to take it for reqs, but if anyones just interested in chem and wants to learn, its not a bad class at all, just time consuming since its a 5 week course for yss so I wouldn't recommend it if you know you have more than just it going on.",
    "required",
    "Yes, Dr. Cooper is a great professor. I took the class over zoom and it was ok, although in person would have been more engaging. If takin online, student must be very disciplined and be able to self-regulate."
