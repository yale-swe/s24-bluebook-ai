    "This course gave a great overview of some important and growing topics in bioethics. I learned how to approach these issues from different perspectives.",
    "we read a book every 2 weeks. Topics: Vaccine Resistance, abortion, medical nihilism (medical science and research and practice are faltering and failing us in important ways), disability, the politics and economics of assisted suicide, the assisted reproduction business and its regulation, and gun control as a public health issue.",
    "Learned key examples and ways to make sound decisions in Bioethics Politics and Economics.",
    "Deeper dive into bioethics and law, learned an abundant amount of really relevant information.",
    "I had taken Bioethics & Law previously at Yale and was able to build upon this foundational knowledge with this seminar. I thought integrating politics and economics in the bioethics debate was super interesting and something that wasn't previously covered."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength was that we often spent two sessions on each topic, which allowed for more depth of understanding and discussion\/engagement.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Fascinating subject matter\r\n- Interdisciplinary discussion\r\n- Knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\n- The topics under examination - abortion, assisted suicide, in vitro fertilization - were all extremely interesting. Unfortunately, we rarely approached any of them in a very systematic manner. Although I learned a lot from hearing Prof Latham say a lot of random things about these topics, I think the discussion could be even more rewarding if students were challenged to stake out a claim or develop a coherent position.\r\n- The long table in our Watson Center room is not conducive to a seminar discussion, as it is impossible to see half of the group. Getting a round or square table would be a significant improvement\r\n- Most of the time, half the students were preoccupied with all kinds of things on their computers (myself included, at times). One time I even saw a student watch an entire Netflix movie in class... The quality of the discussion and level of engagement would be a lot higher with a no-electronics policy.",
    "Structure and planning for this course were lacking. Regardless, the topics covered by the class were really interesting and Professor Latham is great at holding discussions.",
    "strengths - the setup is amazing. we are aware of what we will be doing each class and it was an open discussion. \r\nweaknesses - the books are lot, but SO needed for the course.",
    "The course is perfect and the readings were extremely interesting!",
    "We did not often touch on the assigned readings, but not bad because we were having such insightful discussions.",
    "Strengths: I thought the course content was really interesting and I loved that towards the end of the semester, we were able to choose what topics to study pertaining to bioethics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the nature of the seminar, only a handful of students participated which sometimes made it difficult to facilitate discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course provides a strong background to a lot of important and increasingly pertinent topics in bioethics.",
    "It was a good class and there was a lot of discussion which was great. It was interesting to have  conversations about bioethics with professor Latham in such a small setting in comparison to the lecture he teaches.",
    "if you are freshman, sophomore, or junior - you will not get into the course. senior poly sci majors - you will get in. if you are ding your thesis on a bioethics topic, you will also get in. Super compeititve bc THIS COURSE IS AMAZING.",
    "Maybe. Latham is cool and really knows his stuff but this is more of a leminar. He kind of just talks and people jump in when they want to. Seems that the vibe of the class really depends on whos in it. Bioethics is always interesting though and youll definitely learn something just by showing up. Workload is incredibly chillits literally just readings and the final paper. Id say its really just about what youre looking for. I liked that this class counted towards my major, was pretty interesting, and I could slack on readings when I needed to. Latham is a great resource if youre writing a thesis on anything in his realm or interested in the field of bioethics. This is notoriously hard to get into unless you preregistered. Dont show up during shopping period if youre not a senior.",
    "If they are interested in the subject matter, absolutely!",
    "Definitely, best seminar taken at Yale, very conducive of conversation and never any awkwardness that can come with some seminars. Everyone wanted to talk and discuss. Latham is a great Professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student especially those who enjoyed the bioethics lecture! You don't have to have taken that lecture to keep up in the class but it definitely peaked my interest while shopping it. Also very good for seniors who are looking for a less workload heavy class with super interesting content.",
    "Yes!"
