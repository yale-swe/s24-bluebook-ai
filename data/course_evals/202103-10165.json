            "comments": [
                "One of the most poorly taught and orchestrated stats courses I've taken at Yale. For what's meant to be an intro class, the exams were ridiculously difficult, with an average of around 60% on the first. Feedback from the teaching team was nonexistent, despite harsher grading than I've seen in most of my classes.",
                "The lectures and the professor were not fun or engaging. Hard to follow material",
                "PSETS and midterm were far too difficult for what this course is supposed to be. Good job of teaching R and statistical concepts.",
                "Sometimes, it can get a little theory heavy when the hw is really only focusing on the code. I would recommend putting a little more theory on the hw even if it is just part of a question or two. Will make prepping for the exams much better.",
                "Strengths of this course include the problem sets and the format of the class notes. I feel like I learned a lot by doing the problem sets and 90% of the time they were very much related to the course material. It was also super helpful to have the class notes with answers available. \r\n\r\nMajor weakness of this course -- the timing of the TA sections. The sections were poorly spaced out and placed at inconvenient times. I think it would have been helpful to have more sections early in the week. I also think the early Saturday/Sunday sections and the Friday night sections are unrealistic for most students.",
                "The slides were easy to understand.",
                "I thought the course flowed well and remained interesting throughout. Even when a topic was very familiar to me, it was useful to learn about it from a different perspective. The only thing I have mixed feelings about is the mix of introduction to R and the statistics material. I found the statistics review (and added depth in some cases) to be very useful but the introduction to R was rather dull (I was already very familiar with R). I wonder if the course could be taught with something like a lab for those students trying to learn R as part of the course so that the lectures could focus on statistics material?",
                "Strengths: a rigorous approach to teaching the theory of data analysis instead of just raw skills, like you might learn on Coursera, to produce a deep understanding of the skills gained. Highly practical material. Course material builds neatly on each other, week after week, oscillating between statistical theory and working in R. \r\nWeaknesses: draws heavily on intro stats material, much more than the version taught by JDRS. Some of the theoretical work can be rather tedious, like manually performing ANOVA or copying graphics, and some of it is glossed over in the interest of time. \r\nImprove: focus less on statistical theory and make the homework assignments more exploratory.",
                "very well organized",
                "Strengths: lots of homework assignments to boost your grade\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: learning is almost deincentivized, answer rubric is not good",
                "Strengths: the R sections of class were taught very well, the homeworks were very comprehensive and helped me learn and solidify concepts taught in lecture. Really appreciated the lecture recordings and slides made available to students. \r\nWeaknesses: this class is focused a lot more learning R rather than the statistics, which feels a bit misleading form the course title and description. ATON of typos in the homeworks sometimes made the question difficult to understand.",
                "I appreciated the recorded lectures. Prof. Meyers always asks for feedback in the class and takes student feedback very seriously. We were all encouraged to use Ed discussions, which helped with homeworks. There was ample support from TA's in terms of office hours. I think the weaknesses would have tp be the midterms and finals (the multiple choice portion in particular), which I felt didn't really capture what was emphasized in class.",
                "The course does a good job and focuses heavily on R, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, the class was not very thorough with understanding statistical concepts and when to use them, which made taking the midterm exam especially hard.",
                "Strengths: lots of interesting material and tests \r\nWeakness: a lot of what we learn isn't always helpful for homework assignments. The psets usually force you to think outside of the box to find the answers.",
                "No weaknesses, I liked how the course was a mixture of theoretical and coding applications.",
                "One strength is that we are given alot of tools and gain alot of new skills but it is rushed and the homeworks are very long.",
                "course content was organized very well with canvas page, ed discussion board, github etc. Content was presented well with useful slides for later revision.\r\n\r\nWeakness, the multiple choice questions in exams were sometimes very confusing to understand. Short answer questions would be preferable as despite feeling I had a good grasp of the content I could not demonstrate this in the exams. \r\n\r\nCould consider making homeworks every other week or reducing length, some weeks took a long time to complete",
                "The course breadth was great; we covered a lot of different kinds of material in a short time. We did not engage in particular depth with the concepts, but that's expected in an introductory course like this. I was glad to be introduced to so many different kinds of analysis in R. The class code and homeworks are really nicely prepared, organized and detailed and a great resource to keep coming back to. Those were a strength of the class. A weakness was the professor's lecturing style; he is not a very clear explainer of tricky concepts and his slides were sometimes imprecise.",
                "Strengths: a lot is covered in this course and I feel like I have become very comfortable using R\r\n\r\nWeakness: the conceptual part feels quite superficial",
                "Strengths were that notes and class lectures prepared you well for homework. Sometimes it was difficult to find additional practice work or feel prepared for assessments with just the problem sets. There should also be more time dedicated to the final project.",
                "The topics covered in the course were good, however many of them were not well explained. I often found that googling the concept led to a better and clearer explanation than what we got in class. The professor could also greatly improve in communication. We often were not given any information about expectations for assignments. We did not get rubrics for the homework or final projects. Additionally The grading schematic for the homework was very volatile. Often questions were unclear as well. It is OK if a course is difficult, but it should not be difficult because questions are written in a vague manner or concepts or not explained in a clear way.",
                "homeworks focused mostly on R markdown practice (which was great), but not so much conceptual practice which was tested more on the midterm",
                "This course is organized very poorly. The lectures are very unhelpful and are just a compilation of slides that the professor reads off of. In addition, the concepts covered in these slides are only tangentially related to the information on the exams. Rather than teaching the material that the students will need to know for exams, it seems that the course is designed to withhold certain pieces of information from the students so that they can be tested on it later and that they can learn it themselves. While I understand this sentiment of appreciating students making their own discoveries, it would be much more beneficial to the students to simply teach them what they need to know.",
                "Maybe more coding and less theory might be better",
                "strengths: weekly R markdown problem sets keeps you engaged and helps with understanding course material; very responsive professor\r\nweaknesses: sometimes, course felt detached due to optional attendance policy/all lectures being recorded; would have liked more opportunity for group work",
                "I think it should be focused more towards learning how to use R to complete codes, not to prove statistics theory. It made it very confusing what you were actually supposed to be doing for a stat test, and what was just the theory learning part.",
                "The difficulty of homework is very different from that of the exams, which may be a little bit overwhelming.",
                "Multiple class and homeworks to encourage learning the material. Access to multiple TAs with several office hours. Only challenge is the amount of material covered, length of homeworks and how fast it goes.",
                "I thought the balance between coding and concepts during lecture was great. The weekly homework assignments helped consolidate the concepts covered during lecture. I think it would have been helpful to go over more of the nuances of the statistical techniques we were learning because some of the exam questions related to this."

                "I would recommend taking this course credit D with Ethan meyers if youre not planning on having it count for anything and still want a technical background in data analysis. It really gives you a foundation in analysis / R and an ability to understand statistical tests and methodology used in studies and academic literature.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who have a moderate background and programming and statistics. The students should also be prepared to put in a lot of the legwork to understand the assignments (even though that is work that should be done by the professor).",
                "I definitely recommend taking this course if your main goal is to learn R. The basics and covered in great depth and with interesting data analysis projects alongside it. The problem sets were not terrible (I could usually do them in one day), but keep in mind that I have previous programming experience. This is by no means necessary to take this class; it just means that it'll probably be more of a time commitment for you. Aside from R, you will also learn about useful statistical methods and techniques and the theory behind them, although this often felt like too much, especially come exam period, so hopefully they will revise the course in the future and cut down on some of the topics.",
