    "We covered the major philosophers from Descartes to Kant.  We discussed Reid instead of Spinoza, which was a little strange.",
    "This class provided a very comprehensive survey on numerous influential early modern thinkers in philosophy. Metaphysics and epistemology are explored very deeply.",
    "Critical analysis of the written argument, clear and brief writing",
    "Good question",
    "This was my first philosophy class ever, so in addition to learning about Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant's take on metaphysics, I learned how to approach, process, and discuss works of philosophy.",
    "overview of the big themes in modern philosophy.\r\ndeveloped writing skills.",
    "You learn about early modern philosophy from Descartes to Kant (but no Spinoza), and you learn how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "Great intro to philosophy. I can think in cool ways now",
    "I learned very little.",
    "As someone who has never taken a philosophy class before, basically every philosopher and concept was new, which was super refreshing!",
    "Learn about Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant by getting a basic introduction to each of their systems. The readings are extensive, and by the end, I felt like I had a good grasp on the basic ideas behind most of the philosophers. I also got better at reading philosophy and analyzing philosophical arguments critically.",
    "Learned about epistemology and the methodology of philosophy.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about the philosophers and their theories ranging from Descartes to Kant. Professor DeRose also did a good job of linking them together, so that I understood the progression\/change in philosophy over time.",
    "This class allowed me to read and discuss many books from the western cannon and introduced me to well-known philosophical arguments and topics.",
    "This course taught me a lot about modern philosophy, and went into depth about a few major thinkers. It improved my ability to write essays in a timed setting.",
    "Learned basic introductory philosophy",
    "I developed a better understanding of how philosophy developed, and became a lot more comfortable writing philosophy essays.",
    "Developed foundational knowledge in epistemology. We surveyed the writings of Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant.",
    "Learned not only modern philosophy but also the general way in which philosophers think using logic.",
    "Durrr",
    "I gained an understanding of the metaphysical systems and ideologies of Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant.",
    "I learnt about the ideas of various European philosophers (Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Reid and Kant) in the fields of metaphysics and epistemology. I exercised my ability to drill deeper into various terms or concepts, isolate the source of philosophical disagreements, imaginatively consider different examples, and clearly express my thoughts on paper. You won't get any close to definitive answer about the nature of the world, but you will encounter material that might introduce you to entirely new possibilities of what the world might actually be like.",
    "I was exposed to some of the fundamental ideas and contributions of major European philosophers. I feel like I have a solid understanding of their takes on issues like the existence of external bodies, proofs for gods existence, etc.",
    "I gained exposure to a range of philosophers through this course. I mainly took this course so that now I have more exposure to philosophy and can recognize the basic ideas associated with the name of a philosopher. I just feel more educated in that sense."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "great reading selection, engaging lectures",
    "One of the worst courses I have taken at Yale. Professor DeRose is not an engaging lecturer at all, his lectures lack any sort of structure and basic concepts remain unexplained. Throughout the course, I felt that I had to teach myself everything from notes online, because section was rarely helpful either. The reading was interesting.",
    "This is a foundational course with some amazing ideas.  But Professor DeRose taught it pretty terribly.  He's an excruciatingly slow lecturer, and because he gets sidetracked a lot it's usually not even particularly clear what's going on.  The amazing TA's were the only reason I got to understand the material any better than I would have by just reading the texts myself.  Also, having 2 exams and only 1 paper was unusual for a philosophy class but also made it lower-stress than if there had been more papers.",
    "The works that are examined in this class are very challenging and it is difficult to gauge what an accurate reading of the texts consists in between one's own reading, the professors, and the TAs.",
    "The relationship between certain thinkers could be more clearly conveyed.",
    "It's a good class, I took it for a distribution requirement, so I should not tell it how to do it's job.",
    "Section is incredibly helpful in working through often hard-to-follow texts and lectures. It is imperative to stay on top of the reading, but if you do, lecture is interesting and helpful.",
    "strengths:\r\n- reasonable and manageable workload\r\n- very engaging course\r\n- intellectually stimulating",
    "I though the lectures were great and the amount of reading was appropriate for an intro philosophy course. However, I thought we should have read Spinoza instead of Reid. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame the course has to have tests. Maybe it would be better to have the in-class midterm exam, but instead of a final exam we could have two papers due throughout the semester instead of one. This would give students more practice writing philosophy papers, preparing them better for the major in which written tests are very rare.",
    "Great lectures, great distribution of work",
    "I found lecture confusing and unnecessary to go to. The readings and the section were much more helpful.",
    "I thought a disproportionate amount was spent on Reid, and not nearly enough time (2.5 classes) was devoted to covering Kant, who is arguably the most important philosopher in this course. Additionally, too much time is spent on Descartes, whose arguments are really rather simple as compared to someone like Kant or Leibniz. Additionally, the written midterm and final are quite difficult (unless you're good at writing in-class essays). I also found the class to be a bit dull at times. One should also be advised that this is a very very fundamental course, dealing with fundamental epistemological ideas, so things like phenomenology or Marxism are not discussed at all.",
    "Its very easy to skip readings, but theyre essential to actually getting something out of the course, so maybe devise some way to check that people have read? Maybe during discussion sections, with a designated discussion time at the beginning?",
    "This course has a great reading list, but I felt that the structure of the course (midterm, final, and paper) didn't encourage learning. I think it would be better if there were smaller assignments throughout the semester, perhaps in addition to the midterm, final, and paper.",
    "The strength of this course was that it covered interesting material in a meaningful way. Professor DeRose was funny and taught the material well. The weakness was the way in which Kant was taught.",
    "Strengths that it gets you to think and you cover a lot of philosophers",
    "I wish classes would have been structured a little more clearly. But the daily handouts were very helpful.",
    "Very clearly and well organized. The assignments and deadlines were fair and clear.",
    "Lectures were not helpful at all. They didn't help guide us through the materials.",
    "The strengths of strength of def were that I learned the fundamentals of mechanical engineering.  The weaknesses of Math 120 were that were that I got a C+;",
    "Has a woman done philosophy ever? If so it would be nice to hear about it.",
    "The course covers some deeply interesting material, primarily dealing with the limits of our knowledge and the nature of our experience. Prof DeRose is highly enthusiastic about the material and is able to bring the philosophers to life, though he might occasionally ramble or be hard to follow. There are tests in the course, but the topics for the final are released ahead of time and are a great incentive to really firm up your knowledge on the material taught. Possible steps for improvement might be to increase the number of papers instead of having 2 exams, focusing the paper on philosophers covered in the second half of the course, and having slightly clearer notes with more obscure terms being clearly defined.",
    "Since this is a survey course, it does a nice job of introducing philosophers and philosophical concepts to people who (like myself) have no previous exposure to the subject. Readings and workload are generally light. There are only three grades (midterm, essay, and final) for the class, though, so there is a lot of pressure on each one of these assessments. The essay in particular is difficult to write if you have never written a philosophy paper before. Another weakness of the class is that the lectures often feel disorganized and more like stream of consciousness. Fortunately, I had an amazing TA who clarified and explained the material well. This class mostly involves understanding, regurgitating, and synthesizing the material presented to you; while there are some opportunities in section and with the essay to develop your own ideas, critical engagement is relatively low.",
    "I seriously disliked this course. I found it extremely disengaging. I feel like it actually might be better if there were more essays because then you could actually engage with the material and practice philosophy. I frankly didn't learn much from going to lecture, and I think it made me more confused."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It's a useful survey of modern philosophy and helpful for learning how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "Absolutely not, unless you have to take it for the philosophy major. Professor DeRose is not able clearly explain basic concepts, his style of teaching is rambling and incoherent, and he is unengaging.",
    "I would recommend holding off on taking this course until Della Rocca or some other faculty member is teaching it.",
    "In all honesty, if a student is simply curious about philosophy, I am not sure I would recommend this course as it does not examine traditionally interesting topics in philosophy while nonetheless holding fairly high standards on one's understanding of these topics.",
    "Yes, it made me a better reader and writer",
    "If they were interested in philosophy",
    "Yes, to any student interested in metaphysics. I would warn that the class is challenging, not in volume of reading or assignments, but the actual texts themselves. Reading and comprehending, therefore, takes a lot of time!",
    "Absolutely fascinating course. Unique course that forces you to stretch your mind and think about concepts you wouldn't naturally question.",
    "If you are thinking about Philosophy at all, take the course! It's also a great course for CogSci majors looking to fulfill the Philosophy requirements. I thought the lectures were very good, and the readings were very enjoyable. Both TFs in the course were excellent and lead great sections. Definitely try to get into a smaller section if possible.",
    "Great intro to philosophy. Also great class to credit\/D because lectures were great with DeRose.",
    "I would not recommend this class. So many people stopped going to lecture because it didnt help their learning of the material.",
    "As someone who has never taken a philosophy class, this was a decent introduction. Prof DeRoses's lectures and handouts sometimes felt a bit scattered, but it was definitely worthwhile to go to lecture. The course seemed to get progressively more challenging (Descartes and Leibniz were much easier to understand than Kant). 1 midterm paper, 1 written midterm, 1 final exam (with essay questions released beforehand), so not a gigantic workload. My TA was Allison Glasscock and discussion sections with her were wonderful (and at times more helpful than actual lecture). Definitely stay on top of the reading for this class!",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to modern philosophy that serves as an excellent basis for future studies in philosophy. After taking this class, you will be able to converse freely about many pertinent philosophers.",
    "Yes, absolutely if you want to learn the methods and discipline of philosophy.",
    "Nothing more than a survey course.",
    "Yes, insofar as it teaches you about the philosophy but also introduces you to philosophical thinking. Definitely serves its purpose as an intro course",
    "Not unless you're very interested in the subject and will hold yourself to do the readings on time and learn the material on your own. I think the class had the potential to be very great but ended up not being so because of the structure of lecture.",
    "This course was interesting and tried to cover a lot of material. Most of the philosophers were covered well, except Kant, who was hardly covered at all. Lectures were interesting, and the professor was engaging.",
    "Yes because having a background in the argumentative lessons of philosophy is good",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in developing an understanding of certain important philosophers.",
    "If you're looking to take a survey course of modern philosophers then this course is precisely for you. There's not much else to be expected.",
    "Yes, to anyone interested in modern philosophy and willing to put in the individual time.",
    "I would recommend PF Changs to any fan of chinese food worldwide.  This place has it all from Sushi to General Tso's chicken.  So to the staff of PF chang's new haven I say a hearty Konichiwa.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in philosopher's ideas about the limits of our knowledge, the nature of our world and our experiences. It's also a great way to firm up your writing\/speaking skills, and engage critically with difficult-to-parse abstract concepts. Don't expect any real answers to questions though, and be sure to take advantage of office hours.",
    "I recommend this course if your goal is to gain some initial exposure to philosophers like Descartes, Locke, Reid, Leibniz, and Kant. Lectures are kind of disorganized and not many people attended, but I thought they were interesting. The material is cool and, if you make an effort to engage with the readings and develop your own thoughts and critical opinions, it can be very rewarding. Assessments are fair (especially if you attend lecture), but they are stressful since there are only three all semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course at all. Unless you seriously are considering philosophy, I wouldn't take it, at least not with the way it is taught now.",
    "This class is an excellent overview of the tenets of modern philosophy, and I highly recommend taking it. The one paper assignment was given two months before it was due, and you are given much insight into what to study for the essays on the exams. It is difficult to grasp and remember topics, but this course is a great, low-pressure course that allows you to have a taste of complex philosophy if you are interested."
