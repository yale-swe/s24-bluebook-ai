                "The class had a really interesting syllabus, made up of works with connections that weren't immediately clear but unfolded through the semester. Nancy Levene thinks about things in a fascinating way, and brought the discussion to very profound places, frequently.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main class just was too big to facilitate ideal seminar discussion. I know she was trying out a new model, but I do think that when we were together as a whole class, there were too many people, too far apart, for it to really become comfortable and natural (and when we were in smaller groups it didn't ever really feel like a full class). I think in the future it should be run like a normal seminar course!",
                "Could benefit from a clearer understanding of how texts fit into coherent whole of curriculum.",
                "The strengths were the professor (the best I've ever had), and the material (truly phenomenal). Weakness: the format. As much as I admire the ideas/values upon which the format was based, I did feel that the class was sub-optimally large and long. On the other hand, if not for the size I wouldn't have been able to take it!",
                "Strength: Seminar style, ability to contribute your thoughts and interrogate them in this forum.\r\nWeakness: Three hours is quite a long class, even with a break in the middle. Would be better suited as a twice-weekly course.",
                "Strengths: interesting syllabi, engaging seminar discussions, lots of feedback on writing\r\nWeaknesses: quality of seminar discussion depends on students in the class",
                "Weakness: really long class period. Some weeks, it seemed that this time flew by and three hours was the least that was necessary to really get somewhere with the texts. The discussion is very student driven which means that some times the class felt a bit disorganized.\r\n\r\nStrengths: you only read a few texts which gives you ample time to read annotate and speak about them in class. Prof Levene will not hand you the correct answer or interpretation but compels you to always go back to the text.",
                "A major strength of the course is Professor Levene. She does a wonderful job of structuring class discussions so that they are shaped by student interests, but will jump in from time to time to push back on students' ideas and provide insights of her own. She is also extremely approachable and helpful to talk with during office hoursdefinitely go to office hours if you can, even if you don't have specific questions about assignments. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I'm honestly still not sure if I know how to write an interpretive essay, even after writing four of them for this class. I would have found it helpful to be provided with samples of essays before the first paper, or even to workshop essays with other students in class (although I understand there may be pedagogical reasons for not doing so)."

                "If you are willing to think outside the box and suspend your judgement to the end, yes! Nancy Levene put a lot of works in conversation with each other that on their surface seem completely unrelated. (And, some works did feel less relevant and ended up not being talked about.) However, discussion was always really interesting, and we were able to think about classic works of philosophy (like Genealogy of Morality/Gay Science) in new ways: the real triumph of the course was adding richness/complexity/madness into a class ostensibly dealing with philosophy, which rarely happens, but is certainly more true to Nietzsche as a thinker. \r\n\r\nGetting a lot out of this course means putting a lot into it. If you are willing to read the readings, annotate, take notes, re-read, etc, you will get a lot of out of it. It is not a course that you can coast through.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Nietzsche.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student has the time for it. The readings aren't that long in general, but they take a long time to get through and understand. You get out what you put into this course, especially with the papers.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in reading very foundational text with a very learned professor.",
                "3 hours is way too long. Unless you think you can handle sitting still for 3 hours, especially after any seminars you have prior in the day, I would reconsider taking this course. Also, the grading is very strict.",
                "Yes! This class is advertised as a course on Nietzsche, but it's really so much more. Because you read Nietzsche in conversation with works from different genres and historical periods (this year, we read Ferrante, Toews, and Kant, among others), you get to see how Nietzsche's ideas play out in different contexts and compare them with other perspectives on religion, morality, and life. I am not a philosophy or religious studies major, but I intend to take more classes in these subjects now that I have seen how eye-opening they can be."
