After the third class, I can definitely say that I wasn't learning anything new. This however could also be a strenght in that we were allowed the opportunity to apply the cultural theories we learned to the books that we read and current situations having to do with racial injustice.",

                "Weakness: the reading material is wayyyy too dense and theres usually a lot to read and its just this academic nonsense that even the professor makes fun of so like I just think if you as the professor dont like that kind of writing you shouldnt give your students reading material that is that kind of writing.\r\nThe TAs where not really that great they were kind of pretentious. Mine I swear always just talked down to me and made me feel like I was stupid and that everything I said was wrong which really didnt foster an environment when I felt I could speak out and be wrong, until I got one of the top scores on the midterm paper and when I tell you it was night and day between the way he treated me after that it was gross. \r\n\r\nGoff had not alot of office hours like they were pretty limited to just one day and they filled up fast and they were very short which wasnt great so when I would schedule to meet with him for a paper which I did for my midterm and final because it was so short a time it actually made it worse for me bc I was left with more questions than answers bc he was talking to me like we had an hour to have a conversation so none of the thoughts were compete in 15min so I always left more confused. \r\n\r\nStrengths: only one and that is that dr.Goff is a fantastic lecturer."
