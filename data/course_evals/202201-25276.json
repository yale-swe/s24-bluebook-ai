Having read excerpts from books that are renowned in Spanish literature was fascinating to me. Of course, my communication skills in Spanish were enhanced as a result of the class, but I also appreciated that there was a presentation component in the class because this allowed me to improve my public speaking in Spanish. Some of the insights I gained were how to critically analyze autobiographies and apply them to be able to write my own autobiographic piece as a final for the class. Overall, I gained an incredible amount from the course.",

                "Strengths: the focus of the course on self-narrative is really compelling and interesting; assignments like the journals and presentations are great for learning and improving Spanish skills, great feedback \r\n\r\nImproved: Even though it was a literature course, sometimes the readings/discussion seemed to veer away from the literary. I think the syllabus could be reorganized so that some of the texts are swapped out for more interesting and literary choices.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussions, weaknesses: heavy on the reading and a little repetitive",
                "One strength of the course was the diary entry. I felt like it was a great assignment to measure progress in the class. However, I think that one way it can be improved is to make it a weekly assignment. I feel that if it was made a weekly assignment, it would help with students' ability to establish consistency within the class.",
                "I think I would've appreciated less of a focus on earlier texts and more on more recent authors",
                "Strengths: lots of discussions; interesting readings; Prof. Brewer-Garcia is really kind and understanding; student presentations keep the class engaged\r\nWeaknesses: some readings are kind of lengthy if you are not a fluent Spanish speaker (which I am not)",
                "Class discussions were always engaging and inspired new thoughts. One thing that I think could be improved is perhaps providing materials on the literary devices as some students were more versed in them than others.",
                "The class was great and we read very interesting texts; texts I hadnt read or heard about in other classes. However, I thought the class could get a bit dull after a while. Discussions seemed to fizzle out a lot throughout the course.",
                "I though the syllabus was really well put together on the whole. Overall, I would have liked to see a bit more poetry (that could just be my personal bias shining through though!). The topic and central themes of the course were really interesting and I liked how we were able to explore the different ways in which the self is represented in literature. The first part of the course gives students a good foundation in some of the early narratives of self, before jumping ahead a couple of centuries to look at more contemporary examples. We learned different \"lenses\" through which to analyze these works. I liked the freedom in format for the final assignment. I also really liked the journal entries--I love low stakes writing assignments! I felt like I could take risks in sharing my thoughts in a low-pressure format and just start a dialogue with the course staff about what I found most interesting in the work. I think there could have been more communication at the end of the course about our transition to Zoom. It felt like all the sudden it just happened."

                "Absolutely. This course had a plethora of literature that I was not familiar with, and it opened my eyes to different perspectives.",
                "Absolutely! Such an interesting course that allows you to explore texts as a reader as well as develop writing skills and explore yourself. The professor is AMAZING  which she would come to Yale permanently!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone trying to fulfill the 300-level requirement for the Spanish certificate. There are not a lot of assignments, and Prof. Brewer-Garcia grants a lot of flexibility with the final project which I enjoyed finishing. You get out of the class what you put into it, so class discussions are always best when you have a working knowledge of the readings. Everyone in the class has to do a presentation on one of the readings throughout the term, so hearing a student present at the beginning of class was a great way to familiarize yourself with the work before discussion.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are interested in learning about literature in spanish as it provides a diverse array of texts ranging from time period to theme. Topics also are very relevant and timely to today and your personal \"self\" so it is pretty engaging.",

                "If you're truly interested in the topic, I'd absolutely recommend the course! The syllabus was well-constructed and I felt like the readings provided a wide range of examples of narratives of the self, though, as with most courses, I was more engaged with some readings than others. Prof Brewer-Garcia was really open to feedback in the course and provided many different options for us when it came to the final assignment (traditional analysis paper, take-home exam, creative option, etc.). Karina was a super enthusiastic TA and added a lot to class discussion. We have journal assignments that we kept in dialogue with each reading. I liked the low-stakes nature of these assignments (they were graded on effort), so I felt like I could take risks in my analysis/share my true thoughts and begin a dialogue with the course staff.",
