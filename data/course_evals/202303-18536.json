                "Topics discussed include the following: Ethnic studies, its history as a subject established through student movements and organizing, and its role in the university. Theorizing what colonial work can look like in the university. The history of ethnic studies at Yale, and the student organizing and institutional conditions leading up to the 2019 withdrawal of faculty labor from ER&M. Racial capitalism and relational formations of race, property, and power through imperial nation-state projects like settlement and Indigenous land dispossession, global capitalism, militarization, immigration policing and the construction of citizenship, and mass incarceration. The importance of non-transactional and non-homogenizing solidarities across difference. In examining these themes, we considered as a case study the U.S.'s imperial projects in Hawai'i. Specifically, we considered mass incarceration, land dispossession, and the intersecting roles of corporations, the military, and the state in racial formations in Hawai'i. For the final project, we also learned how to prepare for and conduct an oral history interview.",
                "This is genuinely my favorite class that I've taken in this major. We learned how to do interviews and transcripts, how to research about a person before interviewing them, and a really comprehensive understanding of the history of ethnic studies and ideas/disagreements in ethnic studies that are so helpful in thinking about literally everything else. I wish I had been required to take this class earlier because it is so so helpful in all my other classes. And the workload and engagement was really great.",

                "Strengths: A very nice way of tying up and strengthening many of the themes and topics you've covered in your other ER&M coursework. Some really great readings, like A Third University is Possible (la paperson) and Nuclear Family (Joseph Han). Great professor. Workload is standard for a seminar: a few readings plus a short discussion post each week, a few short papers (two 750 to 1000-word papers and one 500-word paper) across the semester, and a final guided oral history project. Weakness: I would've liked more of an opportunity to think specifically about the senior thesis, even if it is a year from when you have to take the class. No other weaknesses.",
                "Strengths - readings for each week all interacted with each other in really interesting ways, and we always had a lot to think about and talk about in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - it's a 9:25 am class",
                "One of the strongest components of the course was its final project: to interview a participant of the 2019 ER&M walkout for an oral history. It was engaging work that really pushed me to interact with the concepts I'd read about and to really be in touch with what Ethnic Studies both means and looks like in practice, as opposed to the typical research paper.",
                "All assignments and readings felt relevant. Professor Hobart responded well to student feedback throughout the semester and adjusted curriculum accordingly.",

                "Yes! Especially anyone in ER&M, WGSS, AfAm, American studies, etc",
                "Yes! Depends on the professor teaching the course at the time, but the content is great!",
                "Yes! Prof. Hobart is super great and the material of the course is chosen very carefully.",
                "Definitely. Even non-ERM majors will find this class super meaningful. Professor Hobart is a great instructor -- her lectures are always clear, informative, and organized to incorporate student discussion."
