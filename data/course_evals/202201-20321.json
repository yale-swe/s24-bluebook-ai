                "I came into this class having never made a film and now have three under my belt, along with confidence, passion, and a love of filmmaking. We had weekly screenings of brilliant documentaries and art films, as well as readings that guided us in the creation and development of a documentary film. In all, we made 3 short films (under 3 mins, final under 5 mins) and engaged with stories, archives, and media through blog posts (3 total). In this class, you definitely get out what you put in, and Professor Harris and my wonderful community of classmates were more than worth it.",
                "I learned a lot about experimental media, documentaries, and personal storytelling. This class allowed me to experiment as a storyteller and build on the skills ive already developed. The screenings were really insightful and the projects pushed my creative abilities. This was more challenging than a normal documentary class and the branches into new media were really interesting.",
                "As a student who had never made a film before, the class was super helpful in teaching you how to use film as a creative platform of expression. It held workshops to teach you how to use Premiere Pro, it had many guest speakers who walked you through the process of different they create like music, documentary film, collages. We also walked through ways that you can have your art distributed. The films we screened like Flee and Attica were great in showing how animation, film, and archival footage can be used in advocacy.",
                "I learned how to use personal and public archives to create short videos. I developed my editing and storytelling skills.",
                "I learned about different film techniques, basics of video editing in Adobe Premiere, and about different ways archives have been used in films in recent decades.",
                "You develop beginner skills in filmmaking, editing, and videography. You also begin to explore the depths of documentary filmmaking as an incredibly diverse, multimedia, and creative medium.",
                "Knowledge: What the archive really is, importance of family histories, documentary film theory, knowledge of my peers family histories (new cultural perspectives)\r\nSkills: Filmmaking and editing"

            "comments": [
                "Professor Harris clearly cares about each of his students and does a wonderful job of facilitating a community among classmates. Critiques were enthusiastic and positive, but still helpful and challenging. I think this is a really great thing because for many students, this is their first film class and the positive environment was vital to creating community -- there was never a sense of competition between students, everyone just wanted to help\/support\/engage with one another. Prof. Harris brought a ton of incredible guests to the class as well. Everyone at CCAM was wonderful, we got to check out the Blended Reality Lab, which was incredibly cool, and host a showing in the space. Altogether pretty wonderful.",
                "I think the biggest strengths of this class are the screenings, guest speakers, and projects. The screenings were interesting and facilitated great discussion. The guest speakers were accomplished and had unique backgrounds that showed us possible career paths and inspired our work. And the projects was the place where we could implement all this. I love that we made three projects. We had the space to improve\r\non our projects and try new things. I think readings in this class were a weakness. They were mostly irrelevant to the class or way too esoteric to be understood and applicable. They felt like a waste of time with the exception of a small few. I also think the 3 hour class was difficult to focus for the entire time. I wouldve preferred twice a week for 1.5 hours. We often ran out of time for things and I wonder if shorter classes would keep things moving and students focused the entire time. Students also showed up to class unprepared all the time or just didnt show up. Im confused why there was not better attendance for a once a week class. Short media projects were turned in late a lot and then it felt unfair to the students who turned them in on time.",
                "This course was amazing. My only regret was wishing I had taken it earlier because it created a love for film and using film as an outlet that I had never experienced before. The class is oriented in a way that makes it accessible for students who have never taken a film class before or made a film, and also allows students extremely familiar with film to go above and beyond their previous work. I think my favorite moment of the entire semester was the final film screening because it showed just how much growth everyone achieved on both personal journeys and in their filmmaking. The class itself is cultivated in a way to provide you with genuine feedback that allows you to improve your art, from both the TA, professor and from your actual classmates. The structure of the class also allows for you to continue working on one project, and allows you to pull in all of the feedback to either continue your project or improve upon it. This lets you track your progress in the class. The professor is also incredibly accessible, helpful, and extremely knowledgable. The professor was definitely the asset to this class because you could tell just how much he cared about the success of each one of his students and would give his undivided attention to us individually, and would also try to give us opportunities to experience a film screening or submit our short films.",
                "This class served as a safe space for creation and experimentation. You get to watch your classmates films and learn a lot from each other. Professor Harris also brings in great guest speakers and filmmakers.",
                "Strengths of this class is that the workshop format is very beginner friendly. The guidelines are also very loose so projects can be experimental and you can focus on whatever your personal interests are. There are a bunch of cool speakers and we get to interact with different kinds of media so if youre looking to experiment with visual storytelling this course gives you the space to do that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that if youve never taken a film course before it can be difficult to manage the workload and figure out what to prioritize. Readings are interesting but if you dont have the time to do them its okay to let them to as theyll be discussed in class. People slacked off in the weekly film showings but I found them super enriching and was somewhat disappointed that we didnt always get to give them their due diligence in class.",
                "Strengths: Unbelievable course - such interesting course content and balance between analysis, personal reflection, and actual PRODUCTION \r\nWeakness: COVID semester was tricky with a class like this -- with so many absences and a late semester start, it made the entire semester\/projects feel a bit rushed"

                "Absolutely. Professor Harris is wonderful and clearly cares about his students. You make deep connections with your classmates. You meet interesting people in the field. You engage deeply with the media. This isn't a typical filmmaking course in that it has a very specific focus on telling personal stories. It is an opportunity to dive into your family history or your community or yourself and tell a story.",
                "I would recommend this class as a second or third practical filmmaking course. It definitely helps to have editing experience as it is not taught but expected that you know it. Its a great challenge to branch into experimental content.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. I think this is one of those special classes at Yale that can impact and alter your personal life depending on if you are truly willing to put in the work. I also think this is one of the best ways to actually improve on your skills is to actually make a short film and get feedback on it.",
                "Yes. You get to develop your personal filmmaking and storytelling styles and you learn a lot from your classmates, Professor Harris, and the guest speakers he brings in throughout the semester.",
                "Yes!! Definitely take this class! It was such a transformative and amazing time! I learned so much and learned of new ways to approach filmmaking and the art of it.",
                "I would recommend! I took this class because as part of my senior thesis I would like to include a short film, but I have no filmmaking experience. This class definitely allowed me to explore making films in a supportive environment.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Harris is a jubilant teacher that cares about each students success and believes in the work of his students. He exposes students to so many approaches to archive-based filmmaking that each person is bound to find an approach that calls to them. This class was so engaging and fun, the long meeting time was hardly a drawback, plus we got a 10 minute break to give people time to use the bathroom or eat food. Overall a great class, I would highly recommend if you are interested in filmmaking and dont know where to start.",
                "Absolutely as stated, it's an incredible course for a student of any film experience. It allows for personal growth and introspection, and creative skill development"
