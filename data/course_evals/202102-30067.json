Prof. Galindo is amazing, and I always felt very comfortable during the discussions despite having a fear of speaking in other seminars I've taken. The workload is reasonable, and Prof. Galindo is always there to support you when needed. I have no real criticisms of the course - I was genuinely excited to come to class every day and participate in the discussions, which I could have never imagined me saying before the course as I come from a very STEM-oriented background.",
                "The only significant weakness was of course the compressed time period. There was not enough time to see an improvement in my writing or fully apply every writing technique introduced. However this was out of the control of the course, and I have no complaints about anything else.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone. I was very insecure about my writing before taking this course, but now I am much more confident writer and acquired a greater appreciation for writing. I even started a journal after the course ended just to keep up with writing since I loved what we did in the course so much.",
                "Yes! Although I did not choose this course based on the writing topic, I still found the subject matter intriguing and very relevant. I enjoyed discussing the readings and debating real-world issues in the small zoom classroom. The course also helped me start to improve my writing skills confidently, as I am not a strong writer in the first place.",
                "Absolutely. The content is fascinating and the conversations it sparks are wonderful to be a part of.",
