However, the vast majority of topics in this course I picked up along the way or as a TA for YSPA - a high school program hosted at Yale. I would have liked to spend a lot more time with a lot more instruction on how to do real science (i.e. more problem sets on analyzing images like the final project but with more concrete goals).",
