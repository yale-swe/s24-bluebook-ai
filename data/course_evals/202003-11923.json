Still we get to print a book for our final project so we didn't miss out on all.",

                "YES, TAKE IT! Though, you need to provide yourself a DSLR camera and a hard drive (which honestly isn't that difficult). If you don't own a DSLR, try reaching out to other people who can lend you for a semester or consider getting a used camera online!\r\n\r\nTed is amazing. He is so passionate about photography and really engaging during class. I worried that taking an art class in a virtual space will limit my learning, but I was wrong. He gave us plenty of individual attention (had one-on-one sessions) where we got to ask specific questions we had about our project, and it was truly helpful. Lectures about technical aspects of photographing and editing are really useful. The guest lecture was very fun -- definitely needed that lecture in midst of all the zoom fatigue!\r\n\r\nThis was my first art class taken at Yale, and during the first few weeks, I felt a little bit stuck. I felt like I needed more guidance and scope when Ted told us to \"go out on an adventure and take pictures of anything you want\". I felt impatient that my photos will seem random and won't have a cohesive theme. I tried to take photos every week at least once or twice (about 100-150 photos per week on average), and slowly I started to see a pattern in things I like to photograph. So do be afraid to take this class even if you have no art background. :))",

                "Yes I would. It is a great break from the rigid syllabi of other classes and it made me think about creating art in a different way.",
