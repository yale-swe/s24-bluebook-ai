                "having a piazza would be great",
                "Prof. Coppock's lectures match the textbook/readings very well so it's all fairly easy to follow. The final project is a fun way to tie everything we've learned together, although it does feel at times as though the course only skims the surface of the topic. Then again, it's more of a gateway course so the overview approach makes sense.",
                "Strengths - Professor Coppock is a phenomenal lecturer, an incredibly clear coder (and uses tidyverse, which is all too rare in the SDS department), and an interesting person to talk to. He knows what he's talking about and is clearly passionate about it. I found lecture engaging, particularly on the days that we talked about papers. I appreciate how he would reinforce a concept many times, bringing it up again and again and reminding us about how important it is. I learned a lot in this class that I will remember for a long time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The workload of this course is not evenly spaced out over the semester. Psets drastically range in difficulty (but are overall fair and interesting). I think the biggest issue was when we had to start doing our final project at the same time that we were doing psets - the preanalysis plan was a lot of work, and I was completely swamped that week. It's good that the final project is spread out over so much time (forces you to start early!), but it's hard to balance alongside all the readings, papers, and psets you're also doing for the class at the same time.",
                "I learned so much in this course! Professor Coppock is wonderful as is Liz. It felt relevant and applicable and gives really valuable skills in the 21st century. The only weakness is that sometimes expectations weren't clear from the start and students were left without much guidance, such as on the final paper (it was sprung on us a bit). I also thought it didn't make a ton of sense to have a final exam given the pulse of students mental and emotional states by that point in the COVID semester.",
                "Prof. Coppock is an excellent instructor, and Liz is an excellent teaching fellow. Both Prof. Coppock and Liz made themselves available to students on a weekly basis, and each showed an interest in getting to know students better.",
                "Everything about this class was great!! The psets were reasonable and very helpful, the final experiment was really fun and Professor Coppock is amazing. The only weakness was probably the final exam, which was a little tougher than I anticipated.",
                "Very well-structured course, and Alex explains the theory very well. The R felt a little fast-paced at times.",
                "The course is structured very well to provide training in three different areas: RCT theory, RCT applications, and coding. I can not think of any weaknesses.",
                "strengths: professor coppock is great and really wants students to learn, the content is interesting, the class is well organized\r\nweaknesses: there were some topics that we spent a lot of time on that I think we should have spent less time on and vice versa",
                "This is a wonderful course. The general design (the first class of the week is usually on a section from the textbook, the second class is on a randomized social science study that utilizes the concepts the textbook section explored, the weekly section gives instruction in R, and weekly problem sets go over everything covered that week) is a definite strengthit allowed us to ground theory in practice, which made everything more understandable and more fun. Professor Coppock is also, of course, a strength. His excitement about the material is infectious, and his kindness makes for a welcoming class environment. The final project was also greatit was exciting to put everything we learned into practice! Regarding improvements for the future, a bit more clarity over which concepts from the textbook were not necessary to study closely (the textbooks method of constructing confidence intervals, for example, which we didnt use in class) might have made for slightly more efficient work (but this is a very small thing)."

The theoretical lecturers were less engaging and somewhat harder to follow, but I always appreciated when we'd pause and go through an example together as a class.",
                "I thought it worked really well to ask people questions in the Wednesday class when we discussed readings. This kept everyone engaged. Also, when we solved problems together. Again, the only thing to improve was being a bit more cognizant and understanding of the kind of semester it was in terms of the final exam... it felt a little tone deaf.",

This is a fun, engaging class where you learn a lot of useful things, but the workload is fair and relatively light. Lectures alternate between theoretical days and paper days, and section is always a review of coding. Psets are out of a textbook and interesting and straightforward. You have complete freedom with your final project. The class is worth it for the exposure to tidyverse alone, which is not often talked about in R classes but is what most people in the professional world use. You also get a full exposure to why we care about randomized experimental designs, how they're implemented, and potential problems. I would recommend going to office hours to get the most out of this class. It truly was an enjoyable time.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student (I already have!). I gained a way of looking at experiments that I will use for the rest of my time in college and, hopefully, for the rest of my life (experiments are really everywhere, so it is nice to have a critical eye). I also was able to feel successful engaging with statistical theory not covered extensively in introductory classes, and this as someone who did not take any statistics or coding classes before this one (Professor Coppock means it when he says you do not need any specific background!). It is also a great class to start learning R. Finally, it was fun!"
