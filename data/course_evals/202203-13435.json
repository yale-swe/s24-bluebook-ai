We were encouraged to explore a plethora of seminal pieces through intersectional and interdisciplinary lens. It was an amazing opportunity to learn how to analyze, understand, and appreciate sculpture.",

I also gained a deep knowledge of 20th century sculpture and the minority artists who were working during the rise of Humanism."

While exploring many types of artists/artworks, we stayed close to the goal of the class ie. expanding the notion of what it means to be a human body. Although the readings were dense (perhaps in the future they could be shortened), they were very insightful and interesting. I also liked the opportunity to give a presentation of the readings to the class."

                "It was a very interesting course that challenged me to think deeply about our assumptions about art and humanity. There were good opportunities to engage with the YUAG and Beinecke collections, and it was very rewarding to attend the Surrogates symposium and witness a lot of great academic minds collaborating. On the other hand, this course was a LOT of work--heavy readings each week with discussion posts, papers, presentations, and attending the symposium. I thought the schedule of assignments was not always well planned: for example, the week before we had to attend the symposium there were no readings, supposedly to make up for the time that we would spend at panels. But the week of the symposium, we Did have readings, so we had to do many hours of readings and attend at least 9 hours of panels, which was too much. The midterm was also originally scheduled to be due the day after fall break, but it thankfully got pushed back. I am pleased with the class discussion and how this class stretched my capabilities, but it was often exhausting. Also, having two professors was a unique and very positive experience.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in sculpture. You will learn to see sculpture in a different way and understand its implications.",
                "I would highly recommend the course to another student. The professors really go above and beyond to enhance your experience, taking the time to organize outings to both the YUAG and Beinecke, recommending exhibits on the east coast, and inviting us to a really illuminating conference on sculpture in the 20th century spotlighting academics and artists from other universities. They also provide thoughtful feedback as well as encouragement, while simultaneously challenging you to grow as a writer.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student if they were interested in both philosophy and art."
