   "comments": [
    "How to write creatively (short stories, poetry, drama), how to analyze the craft of creative pieces, how to revise creative works, and how to think creatively.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the more intricate crafting of writing and how to learn to let go of things I enjoyed and think about the bigger picture. I learned a lot about play-writing and fiction through guest-lectures. I also learned to peer-review thoughtfully.",
    "My ability to not only immerse myself in the creative writing process but also in the revising process was greatly enhanced by taking this course. Workshopping skills are definitely improved throughout the course.",
    "This course overviews fiction, poetry, and drama. I learned a lot about poetry in particular, which can also help my prose become more lyrical. The feedback is really really valuable in this class.",
    "I learned a lot about how to read, in addition obviously to how to write. I gained important skills in workshop.",
    "I learned what creative writing means, and got a good intro to poetry, fiction and drama. I gained an appreciation for creative writing which will help me decide how I want to operate within the English major.",
    "I learned so much about creative writing and the creative process and how it might be different for each person.",
    "I learned a lot about what goes into writing a good story, whether that story be told through prose, verse, or a dramatic scene. I feel that, as a result of being exposed to works by a variety of different authors, discussing these works in class, and writing a number of works of my own and receiving feedback on them from both the professor and my peers, my writing has greatly improved. This course really reinforced my love of fiction and drama, and also got me to appreciate poetry a lot more than I had before. I also feel that I have become somewhat more capable of critically examining a piece of writing (only somewhat, because I readily admit that I still don't have a great grasp on it). I leave the class feeling encouraged about writing on my own and inspired to take more English classes and delve even deeper into the world of literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course is really greatcant think of a weakness. The best part of this course is the workshops. I got to hear so many different voices regarding the same works I wouldve never thought of otherwise, and it really helped my writing\/revising process. And because most of the students werent too experienced with creative writing, the workshops were never too intimidating (it was intimidating to be put onto the spotlight and let everyone else and the professor critique my work though, but it honestly helped me so much and made me think of my work differently). The guest lecturers were all really awesomewe brought in award-winning authors, and they shared with us their personal experience with creative writing, which was super interesting and helped our own creative process. The readings for this class were funnot a burden to get them done at all.",
    "The strength would be the guest lectures, workshops, and the feedback provided by the instructor. Some of the guest lectures were truly amazing. Notably Susan Choi, Carl Phillips and Deborah Margolin were fantastic and I genuinely learned so much. The instructor also gave strong feedback. Learning to workshop was another strength. \r\n\r\nActual class could be a bit awkward. I sometimes felt it was a bit disorganized. We would read things and go over them for either too long or not long enough. Class could sometimes be a bit boring. Additionally sometimes the instructor would zero in on students to drill every class. It became an awkward environment during that time and sometimes I dreaded going to class because I thought it would be an uncomfortable experience for either me or for another unfortunate student that got picked that week. I think a lot could be done to improve the learning environment in the class. I felt I did not learn much from the actual classes with the instructor because of the learning environment that was cultivated which seemed aimed to intimidate and embarrass rather than teach.",
    "The course could lend itself to being more intentional and helpful through the revising process of works previously submitted. Seeing how other authors approach revising should have been focused on with more depth.",
    "This course is great! A perfect intro to fiction writing. The lectures were interesting and introduced us to important faculty in the writing department; the amount of reading is helpful and not overwhelming and the assignments are all exciting.",
    "The strength of this class was how welcoming and helpful everyone was, as well as the detailed feedback from the instructor. The weakness was that the syllabus was always slightly off!",
    "I don't think this course has many weaknesses. Maybe it was a little hard to track your progress over time?",
    "I would have liked to do more workshopping and I also would have liked to read more of my classmates work and discuss what worked and what didn't.",
    "I greatly enjoyed our class discussions, and I think our professor, Richard Deming, did a wonderful job of facilitating them. As such, they were definitely a strong point of the class for me. I also enjoyed the assigned readings. Many of them pushed the boundaries of convention in interesting ways, forcing us to think critically about whether what was written was working for us, the reader, and if so, how the corresponding effect on us was being achieved. Professor Deming was another strength. He wasn't often very forthcoming with the answers, even when it was clear that none of us knew how to respond to the piece that was being discussed; this allowed our personal opinions and understandings of the piece to develop more naturally, instead of merely having them force-fed to us by the professor. The revision period at the end was a huge strength, as it allowed me to see for myself how each of my works, in their initial form, weren't really as good as they could have been, and how they could be improved upon -- something that ultimately can't be truly understood simply by having a professor explain it to you. I can't think of any real weaknesses of the course. I got everything out of it that I wanted!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes definitelyeven if you arent an English major, you can still get a lot from this course.",
    "I would be eager to recommend the course, but not the instructor. The class will actually help you improve your writing skills and is genuinely intriguing. I would caution POC that it can sometimes be uncomfortable with this instructor in particular (just because you may write about experiences that I'm not sure this instructor would respond well to, or know how to incorporate into the classroom.)",
    "For those interested in writing, this class is a really great introduction into poetry, fiction writing, and drama. Very few classes give you the opportunity to delve into all three, and through reading assignments and hands-on practice this class allows students to explore all three in depth. In addition, the workshops in this class help everyone improve; by workshopping other students' work, you can get a feel for how other students write and borrow some of their ideas, while by getting your own writing workshopped, you get a sense of how to improve.",
    "Yes, the way of thinking in terms of creative writing is a much different process than regards to a typical analytical writing credit. I would recommend this course both the humanities major and the stem major due to the different type of engagement required by the course work.",
    "Definitely! A great intro to fiction writing, even for more exerienced writers because Professor Deming is a master at breaking down poetry. Make use of office hours if you take writing seriously. Also a great way to connect with creative writing faculty and other writers on campus.",
    "I absolutely would but only if the student is willing to take it seriously.",
    "Yes! This course is incredible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course it was one of my favorite courses at Yale so far! The assignments give you so much creative freedom and you get really in depth feedback on your work.",
    "I would, provided that the student has an interest in creative writing and is seeking to develop their reading and writing abilities."
