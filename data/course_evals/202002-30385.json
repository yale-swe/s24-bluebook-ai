    "I improved my Spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills in a variety of ways - by watching movies, reading stories, and writing compositions.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the phonetics of the Spanish language and Spanish culture in this class.",
    "Reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills of Spanish.",
    "This course greatly improved my Spanish skills. You are regularly required to speak, read, consume videos, and write in Spanish, all of which requires you to truly engage with the language in all areas. This course also improved some hard skills like learning vocabulary and condensing a large amount of information into the core concepts.",
    "Basic spanish skills (it was a review of spanish L1&L2)",
    "Better listening, reading and writing skills in Spanish",
    "I developed Spanish speaking and grammar skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the content and the variety of activities done in class. For breakout rooms, I preferred to be with only one other person because when there are three or four people in the room it can be a bit awkward when no one knows when to talk.",
    "The strength of the class was that help was  easily achievable because the professors make themselves accessible most of the time through emails or office hours.\r\nWeakness of the course was that if you take it during the summer, this class does require a lot time not only inside the class but also outside. Also, because the course was taken over zoom, it was sometimes hard to participate because if you can not think of the answer quickly, another student will beat you to the answer and then it feels like you are not contributing to the class at all.",
    "One of the big strengths of this course was its organization - the class followed the path of the syllabus really well which made it easy to follow! I think this course could be improved if students were given more specific feedback on some assignments so they could improve on certain areas.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe structure of the course is very organized. There are variety of activities incorporated to improve all aspects of language learning (speaking, writing, reading, and listening). Although this course was moved online, I think the professors did their best to ensure the quality of the teaching is still the same. Both professors are great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe class moves rather fast, but given that the class is five weeks it is understandable.",
    "The only weakness of this course is that I took it online, which is a difficult learning environment for me. This being said, Professor Diaz and Professor Garca are excellent teachers, and always took the time to make sure the class was engaged and learning the material.",
    "This course met everyday for two hours, so it's strength is that you will learn something no matter what\r\n\r\nthe weakness is that it was all online and it's not easy to recreate a classroom environment for language classes online",
    "Engaging and very well-taught - no complaints!",
    "The course was well taught remotely. The break out sessions were a strength of the class, allowing students to practice speaking amongst themselves."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I enjoyed the course. It is fast paced because it's taught in such a short time but the work is manageable.",
    "If you are passionate about Spanish or if it is a requirement that you have to take then I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! I think the intensive format is really effective for language learning.",
    "If you are motivated to learn Spanish, this is a great course for you. Due to the intensive nature of this course, students need to remain highly motivated and put extra work to achieve the same amount of understanding as a full semester long course. If you come in with the mindset and interest of wanting to learn the language, the course will ensure you successfully walk out with more Spanish knowledge. The professors are always there to help if you ask.",
    "L3 Spanish is a requirement for many students, but I would still recommend taking the course with Professor Daz or Professor Garca.",
    "Absolutely! The course reviews pretty much all of Spanish 110 and 120, while providing more opportunities to really reinforce all of those topics. Definitely a great option for improving Spanish fundamentals.",
    "Yes I would. The spanish department did a great job making this class remote."
