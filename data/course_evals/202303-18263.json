I gained insight into the process of scientific research, from the beginning to the end: the proposal to conducting the fieldwork to submitting a polished lab report after data analysis. I also gained a deeper sense of the future implications of scientific research, which was very insightful.",

                "The field trips of this course are easily the most wonderful part. Lectures could be improved to facilitate more engagement. I think that the flow of assignments was frustrating, given that we had almost no work until the last third of the semester where everything became very intense and stressful all of a sudden.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Decker's knowledge and the fun, yet important for learning field trips. Perhaps moving the mercury lab to be due earlier in the semester might help alleviate a heavier workload at the end of the semester (proposal due, presentation due, and lab report due).",
                "Strengths - I liked the field trips, and also that they were of a low-stress nature. We were not trying to complete a bunch of activities on the field trips, we were there to learn and absorb. \r\nWeaknesses - it felt like long lectures sometimes when we didn't have a field trip and class lasted from 9-12:20.",
                "Strengths: The strength of this course is the hands-on element. We go into the field often which makes class engaging and very insightful. This class provides more real-world experience than other classes at Yale. Also, the research proposal, presentation, and lab report brought real-world skills. We were forced to learn by doing the assignments. Also, the feedback we received was amazing -- you could really tell Prof Decker and Sam spent a lot of thoughtful time looking through our projects. Also, the TF, Sam, was a huge strength of the course because she was so helpful!!\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been helpful to have been given more direction for the assignments. We weren't given much direction at all on the research proposal. This was the first research proposal for the majority of students in the class, so I know myself and other students felt very lost with the entire assignment. This made it pretty overwhelming. We didn't even know where to begin. This could have been improved by arranging a one-on-one meeting with each student within the week after the proposal was assigned on Canvas. These meetings (30 minutes or less) could be used to discuss the student's interests and potential research ideas. I think this would really help! This way, the professor can provide feedback and inform the students of things they need to consider before choosing a topic.",
                "Strengths - the field trips!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - feedback given too close to deadline"
