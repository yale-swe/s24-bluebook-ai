   "comments": [
    "Strength- well-organized class, tons of resources, easy to get help, problem sets nicely reinforced what we learned in class.\r\n\r\nWeakness- online homework can be tedious",
    "Even after switching from a terrible professor to a better one, the teaching of this course remains sub-par. My teacher made a real effort to explain things and make sure everyone was following but the level of explanation not very high.",
    "The course is very subjective of the teacher. My teacher did not teach the course well, and it was very difficult because of that. The class spends too much time on the easy things and not enough time on the actually hard ones.",
    "It was hard to study and budget time for.  The psets were very helpful though and the class was well structured.",
    "Strengths: It doesn't cover too much but still has a good breadth of material\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the structuring is odd; i.e. shells not being taught with integral material",
    "More time for the psets. \r\nThe 7:00AM deadlines for the explorations could be changed.",
    "The course is well taught in a small faculty to student ratio, although I believe the explorations were not that helpful.",
    "The strengths of this course were that there were constantly review sessions or office hours if someone needed help with any of the concepts. The weakness in this course were caused by the disparities between different professors. Some professors were covering the material much better than others."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you want to learn calculus. It is a great class, relatively easy as long as you keep up with the work during the semester. It's really easy to get help through office hours and peer tutoring.",
    "Yes if they want to take more math but only if they have a very solid foundation in calculus already otherwise they will be lost.",
    "No, it was very difficult and did not make the math easy to understand.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. I'm not a math person and would not recommend it to any other non-math people unless absolutely necessary.",
    "Sure, it's math and pretty straightforward",
    "Yes. it sets a good basis for understanding more complex math. It's just one of those good fundamental courses to take.",
    "Yes, it's a good starting point for those wishing to take harder math classes at Yale.",
    "Yes. Any student interested in taking a challenging math course should enroll in this class.",
    "I would for any student desiring to have a basic understanding of integral calculus, as the material covered provided this understanding, but my specific section was uninteresting and not engaging."
