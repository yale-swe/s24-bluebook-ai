                "The different essays plus the creative group publication allows students to get feedback on many writing techniques, and it serves as a good introduction to writing. One weakness may be the breadth of the material covered since visual narratives can cover many other topics besides the books we discussed in class.",
                "Strengths: The variety of material (graphic novels\/memoires, film, essays, a video game, etc...) and subject matter (memory, feminism, history, environmentalism, exile, etc) covered over the semester kept things engaging, providing ample opportunity to explore and write about topics of interest. Also, between the instructor and peer reviews, I received a lot of feedback that helped me significantly improve my writing between first and final drafts. Weaknesses: If I had to point to some area of weakness, I would say class discussions were a bit slow-going at times. I wouldnt note this as a glaring fault though, and the instructor was pretty good about finding ways to get conversation to pick back up.",

                "Whether they consider writing a challenge or a strength, I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to another student. I saw an improvement in my writing by the end of the semester and I feel better prepared to write for other courses moving forward. Additionally, the works we engaged with over the semester were diverse in subject and form which made reading, writing, and discussions thought-provoking and enjoyable. The instructor was knowledgeable, accessible, and provided thorough feedback that was straightforward and immensely helpful to work with. If youre looking for a well-structured course and a supportive environment to improve your writing, Id say this is a good place to start.",
