                "I learned how to read essays with a critical eye and deconstruct the techniques used by skilled authors in developing high-quality compositions. I also learned how to apply the techniques we identified in other authors' writing to my own writing. Overall, this course has given me tools to be a better reader and writer.",
                "My writing greatly improved and many of these styles of essay ive never written before. I learned skills that can be applicable to all forms of writing: syntax structures, how to create humor, show dont tell, using evidence, incorporating quotes, etc. I think the pieces ive written in this class are some of my best pieces of writing.",
                "The course gave lots of insight into reading and writing for craft. Close reading, analysis, and experimenting with different writing techniques were emphasized.",
                "I learned how to understand, analyze, and write pieces within the genre of creative nonfiction. Within the genre, we learned how to write in concrete, vivid detail, and how to anchor our arguments within such details.",
                "I vastly improved both my analytical skills when reading essays, and my ability to write essays with coherent arguments. We learned about a variety of different genres of essays as well.",
                "I gained a lot of insight into short, personal writing. It was a great break from the academic focused writing Im used to.",
                "I learned a lot of new literary terms as well as techniques to help advance my writing. I also improved on and corrected many of my previous writing strategies and habits."

                "There is hardly anything I would change about the course. I thoroughly enjoyed all the readings, workshops, and essay topics. The class was interactive and engaging, and every student found a topic and/or writing style that interested them.",
                "The strength of this course is Jessica Modis feedback. Its clear, easy to understand what changes to make, and takes your work to the next level. She is really a stand out professor and is the main reason I loved the class. I think sometimes the selections chosen for reading were a little too long as what we were writing was always around 1500 words. Its hard to compare your writing structure to something that is 7-8 pages. I wouldve liked to see more shorter form essays to mimic their form. I also feel like some of the essay critiques in class were a little brutal - people were willing to attack each other and more ground rules shouldve been set to avoid students feeling ostracized by their peers.",
                "Strengths: Nearly all assigned essays are talked about in class, discussions are geared towards each essay we write, units are distinct, writing exercises are applicable to assignments\r\nWeaknesses: In-class workshops are too structure, leads to important things being left out",
                "The five-essay structure of the course, including workshops to give and receive feedback on our essays, was extremely conducive to learning and improvement in writing skills. However, the content within the coursethe pieces chosen by the instructor, often selected seemingly on the basis of personal taste over quality of writingtook away from my experience. Though many of the pieces were from highly accredited sources, others were not, and I found myself distracted by pieces that focused acutely on the instructor's interests rather than pieces which displayed excellent creative nonfiction writing regardless of the content itself.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Great instructor\r\n- Fun readings\r\n- Prompts allowed us to be as creative as we wanted\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Actual lecture content could have been more consistent each class in terms of style"

                "Absolutely! This course forced me out of my comfort zone, but in a way that was manageable and improved my writing. Getting feedback on every essay in such an intimate environment really helps you learn your strengths and weaknesses.",
                "Yes, very useful for improving reading and writing skills",
                "Yeah",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. This course was super fun not only because the prompts were interesting and flexible, but also because I enjoyed seeing what my peers had to say about my piece or what they wrote too. I also thought that the skills taught in this writing course are critical skills that the average person needs and should have if they desire to communicate clearly and in a compelling manner."
