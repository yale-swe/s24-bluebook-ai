                "This class was great BECAUSE of Prof. Fairdosi. The course structure, the topics he covered, the insights and unique perspective he brought to the classroom made this class incredible. I see that next semester this class is being taught by a different professor, and the class seems to be completely different. I don't think you could base these evaluations as reference for that class, so I'm glad I took this when I did.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well organized and comprehensive. Slides were always posted to Canvas, and recordings were often available as well.",
                "It is a very good basic overview, but for someone who already knows the basics of Congress you will learn very little.",
                "Strengths: Very managable workload and Fairdosi is a great teacher\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the pace/lectures could be a bit slow, but that is also just the nature of some of the most foundational topics",
                "Great course no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: engaging and relevant to current topics, covering some information that wouldn't be found in textbooks\r\nWeaknesses: a little disorganized at times and with confusing grading",
                "Strengths: Dr. Fairdosi is a great guy and did a great job of fostering a welcoming class environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures dragged and werent very well organized. Class also didnt lend very well to developing a solid critical understanding of concepts.",
                "The strength of this course is the clarity of the lectures. The weakness of this course was the midterm and final exam organization: both were 5 page papers on one topic, so it really limited your ability to show critical thinking by engaging with one topic only. It could be improved by 2-3 smaller prompt responses.",
                "Honestly no weaknesses. Great course and very engaging.",
                "This course was incredibly dry. What couldve been a valuable semester of looking critically and congress and its structures was instead a series of slow lectures focused on the least interesting parts of congress in the abstract, not at all contextualized by real world examples. Prof Fairdosi is great but this syllabus was not. Engagement was extremely low.",
                "More engaging lectures",
                "A strength of this course was the way in which discussion sections allowed students to share their perspective on course topics in a respectful environment. A weakness is that there was inconsistency relating to the density of material within differing lectures.",
                "Strengths: great professor, clear expectations. Weaknesses: could be boring or straightforward at times",
                "Strengths: great introductory course on the U.S. Congress, works well as an extension to introductory political science; Weaknesses: section was really unnecessary and at times redundant, would recommend that this class switch to a seminar-style or have only optional section",
                "One strength is the teaching style. Professor Fairdosi teaches in a concise and easy-to-understand way. He is able to make complex topics understandable. His teaching style, lecture structure, and organization were great strengths. A weakness could be that some lecture topics weren't interesting (but they were important and contributed to overall knowledge of U.S. Congress)."

The topics we covered gave such an excellent overview and the structure and insight prof. fairdosi offered was incredible. This was BY FAR my favorite class this semester, and I genuinely looked forward to coming to each and every class. The topics were always interesting and engaging, and the small-ish nature of the class gave a great opportunity to discussion.",

He is very knowledgeable and passionate about politics and Congress and fills the course with meaningful anecdotes. He always makes you feel welcome and like a part of a class and not just a number, which I have felt in other classes with different professors before.\r\nThe course was interesting for those interested in politics or a career on the Hill.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student for sure!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about this institution that is central to American politics and society, although do be prepared to go through some very basic information at the beginning of the course",
                "Yes. I think the course covered some important topics for people interested in understanding the workings and history of the US Congress/people interested in civics/politics in general. The course is also very low stress so I'd recommend taking it as a 5th class and just trying to get the most out of it by trying to engage as much as you can with the discussion section conversations.",
                "Your entire grade is based on two essays that you get no feedback for. I also found the class fairly dull. However, if youre looking for an easy A- to an A, this is a great course to take.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, a political science major or someone trying to fulfill their social science credit. The class is slow paced and full of knowledge, while the instructor is very adaptative to learning needs and studies queries.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if congress is something youre interested in. If not, I still believe its important to know the way in which the government works",
                "Yes this course is fantastic and very interesting",
                "Yes. Great professor and very interesting.",
                "This is a great gut for political science majors. Very low time commitment and will not take away from your other classes while gaining a credit for the major.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn more about the institutional structures which underly Congress, or for those students who wish to learn more about how these structures interact with the institutional structures underlying other branches of the US gov.",
                "Yes! Especially for political science majors",
                "Absolutely. Fairdosi is a great professor who really levels with students in terms of workload and class demands. He understands the importance of work/life balance and does a great job conveying information without a ton of sidework.",
                "Yes!! The lecture were well-structured and the workload was very manageable. All of the topics were well-taught and relevant to current U.S. Congress. Anyone interested in American government should take this course."
