            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the online nature of some of the guest lectures, the selection of guest lectures, the TAs. The guest lecturer on social entrepreneurship was interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm was time pressured, and sometimes the lectures were too general and I didnt feel like I learned any new perspectives. This could be improved by talking more about the solutions brainstormed for global health issues.",
                "The TFs were awesome and having the weekly sections was great to discuss the material.",
                "great class, nice for stem majors",
                "Strengths: low workload, interesting discussions in section and mellow vibe overall.\r\nWeaknesses: this course doesn't really teach you very much.",
                "The course was packed densely with a lot of information which was fantastic. This was both a strength and weakness as I felt lecture went really fast. I wish we had two 1 hr 15 min sessions a week as opposed to two 50 min sessions so I could have longer osmosis of global health! The class was just so interesting; I truly wish it was longer.",
                "Strengths: The guest lecturers were quite exciting, and I enjoyed hearing from them about their work. Dr. Fallon is also a very kind professor, and her lectures are enjoyable to listen to. I also enjoyed the weekly readings. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the biggest weakness of this course is the content. Many students stopped showing up to lecture (and Dr. Fallon even noted this), and I think one of the reasons why is because the lectures are not built around stimulating new conversations. Instead, they felt very surface level, and I found that when I sat down to study for my final, I had learned a bunch of facts about global health, but had not really developed any new conceptual insights about the field. It was also a little boring to sit through these lectures given Dr. Fallon's expertise and wealth of insights. I wish the discussion sections did a better job of elevating the conversations stemming from lecture, or if the course was restructured into a seminar to allow for a better grappling of the course themes.",
                "Sterngth of the course was the guest lectures. These were really enjoyable and nice to hear from a variety of people who were outside of Yale which helped demonstrate real-world context of the topics we were learning. I also appreciated the extra credit opportunites for the midterm and final, the grading was kind and the papers were not too long.",
                "Strengths: very interesting topics throughout the whole class",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of relevant topics in a clear manner \r\nWeaknesses: this is a \"scratch the surface\" type course that covers a lot but not super in depth. Personally, I really liked this because it was my first global health class but others who are already knowledgeable may not like it. The exams are very fast paced (although they are open note), I personally would rather a closed-note exam with more time, I'm not a fast test taker and I don't think its fair or conducive to student learning",
                "Strengths - Good survey course that introduces you to a lot of themes in global health. Cara Fallon is a great lecturer and the TA team seemed good. Weaknesses - Sometimes the grading was unclear and very TA dependent. Also due to the nature of the survey course, you couldn't go in-depth into topics which was a little hard.",
                "Not many weaknesses - I think that this course was fantastic!",
                "The midterm exam did not provide enough time to adequately answer all the questions but the final was a better set up. There were a lot of guest lecturers towards the end that added valuable info.",
                "Lots of statistics and memorization, but a strong focus on ethics and people in global health, which I appreciated.",
                "Great lectures but test were graded by TAs that were not yours and they were subject to their ways of teaching in evaluation",
                "Strengths: offering different perspectives from the field and introducing key challenges that students could think critically about and reflect on in the form of papers, projects, and exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none in particular, only perhaps that there was typically more exam material than the allotted time allowed for, so completing everything was a bit of a time constraint.",
                "This course was the perfect amount of engagement. The lectures were interesting as there were many guest lecturers that kept the content tailored for the real world. However there were times when the content could get a little repetitive such as the two writing assignments which felt they were very similar in content.",
                "strengths: good introductory survery course, exams and writing assignments are fair assessments and applications of knowledge, discussion sections were very interesting\r\n\r\nweaknesses: given the nature of the field, it felt like we learned a lot about challenges but the responses were less clear (this connects to the complexity theme), very introductory so we don't go very in-depth on any given topic",
                "Strengths are the lecturer and section was fun. Weaknesses are timing for exams",
                "The guest lecturers were great and the slides for the lectures overall were very comprehensive. I appreciated that the final was a take-home, but I wish the lectures were recorded.",
                "This course is very surface-level information and does not provide much content. Although organized, there were many lectures and very few discussion sections where we could really talk about the material. This class could be improved by decreasing the number of lectures. I do not know what I learned despite all these lectures.",
                "Strengths are the guest lecturers which were very interesting. Weakness was the time crunch on the exams.",
                "Strengths - Professor was incredible!",
                "Overall I feel that one strength of this course was the discussion sections. I also felt that the lectures were pretty good, but the discussion sections were where we really got to think critically about global heatlh issues. I would say that one strength of this course was the teaching team; Dr. Fallon was a good lecturer and all of the TFs seemed pretty excited about global health issues as well. I think that this course could be improved by adjusting the assignments to have more variety. Our two big assignments besides the midterm and finals were both writing assignments, and the prompts honestly seemed quite similar to each other. I also thought the timing was a bit unfortunate and not-thought-through, as we had a paper due very shortly after the midterm.",
                "Strengths: interesting course content, engaging lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: As a survey class, it's incredibly surface level. Lectures didn't require a lot of engagement, because most of it was common sense (e.g. poverty makes healthcare harder). Ethical issues introduced in class were not really explored in depth, and sections didn't enhance my understanding of any material."

                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in learning about global health and how health is understood, managed, interpreted, and addressed globally, there's no better place to start than this course. You both learn a great deal and also are not challenged too much. Prof. Fallon is fantastic.",
                "This course is required for the Global Health Scholars Program, so in that regard, yes. For those who aren't in the GHS program, however, my answer would be no--if the course was kept in its current form. I think that this course has the potential to teach students new concepts related to global health, but the current structure of the course is very surface-level, and not a great use of 100 minutes of lecture each week. I don't think it's realistic to restructure the course as a seminar (though it would be great if it was!), so I think that better utilizing sections and revamping the course material would equip students with the most information about global health.",
                "Yes, really interesting class that is low workload, honestly a good 5th class to take to just learn and not worry too much about grades. Also open-book midterm and final meant not everything had to be memorized.",
                "YES!",

                "I'd recommend it if you dont mind having to answer why certain people do or do not deserve healthcare, there will be people in the class who will defend their right to vaccinate children in foreign countries when they were 14 years old as part of missionary work. While this is not what the professor teaches this is the kind of discussion that happens in sections and the sort of people the class attracts. If you don't mind this or can deal with being annoyed then sure take the class",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I think so. It's a good intro course to themes in global health and gives you a wide range of topics that you could delve into further in future courses.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student! Dr. Fallon was amazing!",
                "No, I don't know if it's necessary to learn about global health at such a basic level. It's better to take a more advanced class.",

                "Yes--very broad but insightful exploration of global health!",
                "Absolutely, this course is applicable to any field and provides the foundation and intellectual challenges needed to apply it",

                "yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although it is introductory, preventing us from going very in-depth, I came out of it with a better understanding of the history of global health and current issues. The case studies we learned about were very fascinating. Discussion sections were fruitful. I believe understanding global health is important for anyone interested in health\/medicine and global affairs.",
                "I would if they're interested in global health. It seemed like a great precursor to understanding and engaging with the subject and I do feel like I learned quite a lot.",
                "Yes, really interesting and lots of cool guest speakers",
                "Yes! It's a very useful class that enables you to understand global health in a very comprehensive and practical way.",
                "yes! Every topic that we covered was extremely interesting and engaging, and the assignments gave me the space to research issues that i was interested in.",
                "Id recommend it if youre curious about global health. Its also an easy class with just two papers to write.",
                "No, there is not really a reason to take this class if you are not a global health scholar. There are many more seminars and HSHM lectures that better represent public and global health. Though this course is more contemporary, I believe that Yale just needs to make more global health-specific courses. There is no way that this is the only opportunity students have to learn about global health. It is simply not substantial and it makes you leave class thinking... what did I learn? But the guest lectures were great. They were the better days.",

For those taking a heavy load of STEM classes, I feel that this course is a great low-workload, generally low-stress class that still pushes you think think critically with a more humanistic perspective. For pre-meds, I also think this course is a great way to start thinking beyond the biological determinants of health.",
                "If you're a Global Health Scholar, you have to take this class. Otherwise, if you're looking for a class without a high workload and potentially interesting classes, this could be a good fit. However, I think your time would be better spent taking other global health\/social science classes.",
                "It's a good and interesting introductory course, but I did not really receive helpful feedback for my work. My midterm grade in Canvas was put in as a different grade than the comments that explained my score, and I never received clarification on the discrepancy despite several follow-up emails with the TFs. My own section TF nor the TF that left the Canvas comments were not the person who graded my midterm, and I never received single email from the TF I was told graded my midterm. The feedback I got on my writing assignments throughout the semester was also super vague. For one assignment, I got points taken off but was not told what I could have done in order to have received full credit."
