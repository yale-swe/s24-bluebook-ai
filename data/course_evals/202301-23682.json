                "This course is amazing in terms of format. 2 lectures are built around a film screening. Pre-screening lecture on director's filmography and the movie's context. Post-screening lecture on film analysis.",
                "The professor is the strength of this course. She has an extensive knowledge on Italian history and films. One to one pre-writing session with my TA was also very helpful. Weakness : I don't think a final exam is necessary to this class.",
                "It's an interesting class, but you have to be engaged in order to get something out of it. The turnaround time for essays was very short, and grading was very dependent on your TF.",
                "I genuinely loved some of the films we watched, but I also found it very difficult to get through some of them. I don't imagine the film list will ever be changed but I wish there was a chance for me to focus on the films that resonated with me in my essays. As of now you have to equally write about every film. I also think having a final exam is a bit excessive on top of the four essays. We were told the best way to prepare for the exam is to study our notes, but I think it's tricky to take good notes in class since it is largely based on class discussion. But the professor is very kind and certainly willing to help during office hours, and she also takes the effort to learn everyone's name which is appreciated.",
                "Good class for non-humanities people to learn about film.",
                "The films are great, and Prof. Millicent is a good lecturer.",
                "I think the course shows some amazing movies, but some of the more modern movies I didnt love. I also think that the Tuesday lectures are not super informative",
                "I wouldve loved for this class to be smaller. My favorite part of the class was talking to my TF and other students about the films, but in class there was never space for between-student discussion. I do see why it was necessary to have more of a call and response format for class participation, though, given the size.",
                "Beautiful lectures that cover film from a variety of angles, extremely helpful prewriting sessions.",
                "I think the essays could be a little more evenly spaced out, but they were not too long and so it was manageable to write those five pages in five days (and extensions were given when necessary), though a bit more leeway wouldve been nice.",
                "Boring lectures. I love Penny, but she drones on and on about pointless stuff. Lame lectures a lot of the time.",
                "strength: the course content is genuinely quite interesting and Professor Marcus is very dedicated to teaching and knowledgeable about the field\r\n\r\nweakness: the turnaround time for essays is quite short, which can make writing feel rushed sometimes.I wished there were drafting periods",

                "Incredible lectures by Professor Marcus, fantastic TAs and one-on-one time with TAs. My only critique was I thought the quality of movies in the last unit was lesser than the rest of the course.",
                "strengths: Professor Marcus, most of the films were enjoyable, the pre-writing sessions with the TAs, you can choose from multiple prompts for each paper\r\n\r\nweaknesses: 4 papers and a final exam feels unnecessary, grading really depends on your TA",
                "Strengths: the films, Professor Marcus. Weaknesses: the Tuesday lectures, the workload. I feel as though the course could be improved by shortening the lectures, or eliminating the Tuesday lecture, which I felt (with some exceptions) did not help in analyzing the films or developing an understanding of Italian film.",
                "I wish this course could be a seminar! The lecture format sometimes made it difficult to get to the nitty-gritty. I also wish that there were some more diverse directors. \r\n\r\nI absolutely loved the readings because they weren't always directly about the films. Instead, they helped inform my opinion of the readings by offering me philosophical, theoretical tools through which to view them.",
                "well organized, great lectures, very engaging",
                "only two or three of the films are enjoyable to watch and study (coming from someone who loves film classes/film studies)  the lectures are hit or miss interesting and boring, and the papers are super rigid and draining to get through",
                "Strengths: Prof Marcus knows literally everything about the topic.  It's a joy to hear her lecture as she is incredibly knowledgeable about the content.  The movies are an excellent, representative set of films that are united trio-wise by a common thread, which makes the class entertaining and organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the paper turnaround can be pretty brutal.  You practically have four days to produce a 1500 word paper (and the papers are not easy). and then have basically two and a half free weeks from classwork.  I thought the pre-writing sessions were pretty helpful but having to produce either a completed paragraph or a detailed outline less than a day after watching the last movie adds to the workload asymmetry.  I would recommend that Prof Marcus make the papers due by the following Wednesday film screening rather than the Tuesday lecture, and provide an option to have pre-writing sessions on Saturday.",
                "strengths: most of the films were great and a good watch\r\nweaknesses: having both a final paper and a 3 hour long final exam with 2-3 essay questions (especially when we didnt have any information on what the final would consist of until a little over a week before, and the vocab that we were going to be tested on was things that couldve been from anything throughout the semester)."

                "Yes, with some reservations. I took this as a fifth class and was not ready for the workload level (four papers and a final exam). The grading depends on your TA, but it was a bit tougher than what I had experienced in other literature/humanities courses.",
                "Yes! I learned so much, and I will never watch movies in the same way. It is a perfect and necessary course for anyone studying film.",
                "good course, great professor, fun and interesting",
                "Yeah, the movies are all amazing and so worth watching besides Il Divo.",
                "It was fine, not a bad class but definitely not worth the hype of all the reviews (and pretty sure from talking that many of my classmates would agree). A few really great films but mostly boring, rigid paper formats and quick turnout times make the papers a huge drag/intellectually unexciting",
                "This course is a spectacular introduction into Italian film with a professor that could not be more knowledgeable and helpful.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Italy or film, especially the confluence of the two.  I think if you're looking at this course because you need a chill writing credit and you think it's a gut, and you are not interested in film in an academic sense, ENGL 120 might be a better choice.  This class is designed for students that are new to film studies, and while I think students more well versed in film are at an advantage at the start, by the end you will know a lot about the topic.  It's engaging and entertaining and the movies are mostly very good -- some standouts are Cinema Paradiso, Bicycle Thieves, and Life is Beautiful -- take the course!",
                "Yes but not as a super gut class, only take if youre at least somewhat interested in film analysis."
