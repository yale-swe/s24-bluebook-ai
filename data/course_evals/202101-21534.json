                "This was a great course and helped me apply things I had learned in 403 to applications are actually relevant, which was super satisfying. Super well laid out with notes and course material readily available. PSets were fair, but sometimes they kinda had nothing to do with what we were learning in class which was kind of confusing. Just go to office hours if you run into anything like that. The term paper was actually super cool to write and I feel that I gained knowledge and appreciation for my topic, which I barely thought about before. The final exam is also not too bad! Overall a course that gives you so much and isn't going to break your back with work.",
                "I was grateful to take a class that talked in detail about discoveries that have successfully been implemented in industry, as I felt it gave me some insight into chemistry \"from the other side\" so to speak that I had not seen in other electives. I do not feel there were any weaknesses that would not be remedied by an in-person experience."

The course material is presented very well and the assessments (3 psets, term paper, and midterm) are actually engaging and interesting to complete. It's not an easy class by any means, but it's not impossible and won't suck the life out of you like pchem lab. I loved taking this class and highly recommend it to anyone interested in inorganic chemistry or organic synthesis, as it is useful to understand the reactions you learn in these class for your syntheses.",
