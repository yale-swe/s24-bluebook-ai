This course really teaches you how strategies even from the reconstruction era carry over to an extent in future wars and strategies. This class was very helpful in thinking about how previous wars' strategies effected future strategies and how strategies changed or didn't. This is not a class about memorizing individual battles or anything like that, it's more about strategy.",

                "Strengths: professor Brenes is amazing - very accessible and always available to meet and discuss assignments, always leads a very engaging discussion; the guest speakers were wonderful!!!! learned so much from them; the students were also so engaging and thoughtful and I really enjoyed discussion every week; also really enjoyed the readings - particularly Biddle, Weigley, Mittelstadt, Kramer, Bessner, and Kim. I also had SO much fun doing the in-class archival assignment with Josh Cochran and James Kessenides - that was really a highlight of the course.",
                "The class discussions were always fascinating and really great. Professor Brenes also brought in lots of guest lecturers which were all incredible. The readings were diverse in perspective. Professor Brenes' grasp on American strategy is also great.",
                "The organization of the course was fantastic, enabling us to draw connections between, and see the evolution of, American military history/strategy from the 19th through 21st centuries. I especially appreciated being introduced to Yale archives staff/procedures early on, in advance of the final paper.",
                "Strength: good readings, great instructor who facilitates conversation, interesting topic that allows for good debate and wide interpretation, open final that allows students to take a deep dive into a topic of interest \r\n\r\nWeakness: my only comment would be to suggest bringing in more diverse speakers"

                "Absolutely. Sometimes I felt like the readings were scattershot and the theme of the course got muddled at times, but it was enjoyable, stimulating, and genuinely challenging.",
                "Absolutely. This class was somewhat out of my comfort zone but I'm so happy I took it, so don't be hesitant if this is also a new area for you. Discussions were great - really thought-provoking and challenging and got me to think about the readings in completely different ways from how I initially interpreted them. Professor Brenes is such a great professor and I highly recommend that everyone take a class with him. We learned about so many different facets of war and the U.S. military - from top-down military strategy and technology to the experience of those not often discussed in military histories (soldiers, women, people living in occupied territories), the military as a rights-providing institution but also as an institution that deprives people both at home and abroad of human/civil rights in pursuit of military domination.",
                "Yes, this class changed my perspective on how American wars are fought and in many ways built on previous strategies. For anyone interested in foreign policy, grand strategy, or wars, this is a great class to take.",
                "Absolutely--this class was simultaneously a survey of American military history post-Civil War and a seminar that engaged with complex questions surrounding military strategy, American power, and more, making it a great class for someone with little to no engagement with military history and someone interested in these more complex questions.",
                "I really enjoyed taking this course and would wholeheartedly recommend it to other students. In terms of the course objectives and the material that we engaged with, I don't think I've seen anything else like this offered at Yale. It was helpful to begin with US military history in the late nineteenth century and trace it all the way to the present in order to understand contemporary policy discussions on US empire and endless war. Prof. Brenes and my classmates always offered valuable perspectives, criticisms and questions. Prof. Brenes' also chose an excellent selection of readings/guest speakers and was great at facilitating discussion. This course has ultimately given me a lot to think about for my last few semesters at Yale and my thesis.",
