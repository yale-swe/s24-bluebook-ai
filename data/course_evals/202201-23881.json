Sometimes the in pair work could be daunting, however. Also this course does not meet any distributional requirements so take that into consideration when you take it.",
                "It was so well organized! Cecilia did a great job. I accomplished every goal I had set for this course.\r\nThe only negative is that it was listed as a course without prior German experience required. I had prior German experience and thought the pace was lightning fast! Still manageable. But, it was definitely quicker than the description made it out to be.",
                "The instructor was very knowledgeable, the textbook assigned was very effective, and the class was aimed at an appropriate skill level. My only recommendation would be perhaps more translations available from a diversity of sources.",
                "Overall, we got through all the material in the textbook and Cecilia was really engaging and responsive to any questions we had. I felt the pace in the first half of the semester was very intense and sometimes felt a bit rushed overall. But the second half incorporated a lot of reading, and in our own subject areas, which was particularly useful. I had some issues with some of the Canvas quizzes etc., with links not working."

You need at least some prior knowledge of the language and also a lot of confidence in grammar. Dont take this course if you dont at least have an A2 vocab or you will be in a lot of pain.",
                "I definitely would! If your work after graduation involves working with German texts, this course is invaluable!",

However, I had experience of two other modern languages already which helped with grammar acquisition and familiarity, so the pace might be challenging for those without this framework."
