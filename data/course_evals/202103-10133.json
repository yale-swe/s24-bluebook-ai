                "Put simply, this course is incredible. If it is offered, try try try to take it (although I don't know the next time it will be offered). It is so unique and exposes you to things outside the classroom that you would never otherwise experience. There is a great camaraderie formed in the class, and the assignments are pretty manageable. Elihu even always had a snack to give us in the middle of our 3 hour excursion. The specific TA's we had for the class were great too, especially Zach, who was just so helpful and generous with his time and knowledge.",
                "I would shorten the class session and have a separate day, say Monday, where we present field notes to a small section. Otherwise its really easy to let this class get deprioiritized (unless you have a true burning passion for it).",
                "I liked being able to develop the final project at my own pace; however due dates were always very unclear and misinformation is common. At the end of the day Professor Rubin and the TFs were very understanding and accommodated student needs."

It's basically a weekly guided tour of New Haven\r\nThe only real assignment for the course is the final project, which you do in stages throughout the semester. This project was much more fun and well-guided than the one in intro architecture. It's super flexible, and Professor Rubin and the teaching team will get behind your excitement. \r\nProfessor Rubin is a joy, and it's so fun to experience the city alongside him.",
