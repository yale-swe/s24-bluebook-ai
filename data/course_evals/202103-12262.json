                "Language-wise, this course gives a really solid foundation in a lot of different styles of Latin writing, from epic to history to novel. For someone with more experience with the Latin language, the course will not help develop grammatical skills, but will give you more familiarity with different styles of Latin writing and analytical skills for approaching different genres. The secondary reading choices were amazing and gave really great insight into the primary readings, but also gave great background into classical reception as a whole and meta-analysis of the field. \r\n\r\nBroadly, this course gives great background to the literature of Roman Africa, and the implications of that literature for the field of classics and later African literature.",
                "I learned new skills for approaching a Latin text I'd never seen before. This class was especially good for developing these skills because we jumped around a lot from text to text instead of becoming extremely comfortable with a single text or author. I became much better at becoming comfortable with different writing styles more quickly. I also got exposed to many texts that aren't taught a lot in typical Latin classes.",
                "This class was an L5 Latin course that built skills in grammar and translation; there was grammatical review for more difficult constructions encountered in readings, and most of the time, multiple commentaries were provided with varying degrees of grammar help. We also learned to use Allen and Greenough (an online grammatical text available online through Dickinson College Commentaries), which was helpful as well. This class also had extensive readings in translation (so that we covered each work completely, either in English and Latin), as well as scholarly secondary readings offering additional contextualization of the Latin selections.\r\n\r\nIn our class discussions we split our time between Latin translation and literary discussion of the Latin, English, and secondary readings. The first half of the class we focused on the conception of Africa (particularly Carthage, the ancient enemy of Rome) in the mind of Roman authors. The second half of the class, we focused on the conception of Rome from authors born in Africa (including Apuleius, Augustine, and Corripus). Some of my favorites were Silius Italicus' Punica, an epic on the second Punic war, and Apuleius' Apology, a legal defense from claims that he seduced a rich older Roman woman through magic. Our discussions in class were thoroughly engaging, as we discussed each work on its own and also put various works in conversation with one another.\r\n\r\nIn terms of assignments, we each did an in-class presentation on a secondary reading of our choice, a midterm involving Latin translation and grammatical identification, a final exam involving Latin translation and a short essay, and Latin translation quizzes every other week.",
                "Reading Latin without having to write out a whole translation, interactions between Rome and Northern Africa, ancient race dynamics and thoughts",
                "Continued to develop my translation skills, learn about a swath of new authors and a dynamic within Latin literature that I had never formally thought about.",
                "This course gave a broad survey of different authors and genres all relating to the relationship between Africa and Rome, whether through the content of the works we read, the authors, or both. We read different types of Latin, prose, poetry, comedy, from different time periods, that improved our vocabulary and language skills.",
                "The course covered a very different set of Latin authors when compared with other L5 Latin courses. I learned a lot about the literary tradition developed in Roman Africa and how ancient authors create \"belonging/membership\" and \"otherness\" through their writings.",
                "We studied various works from Roman North Africa, with plays, novels, poetry and historiography selected from different historical periods. It's a good way to be exposed to many authors, in contrast to many courses which focus on a specific author/time period."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course are secondary readings, the broad range of genres from which the texts are chosen, and the relaxed pace of the class. I also really enjoyed how the class embraced being a seminar; as a student, you really feel as if you are able to change the course of the conversation and engage with other students in the class.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness that I can think of is that I think the assessments could be more challenging, and I wish there were more formal analytical assignments. Beyond reading, I wish the class would have offered opportunities to engage with the texts through essays; all of the graded assignments we had were fairly simple translations and grammar questions.",
                "I think one strength of the class is that it is very flexible. A student could choose to focus more on the literary aspect of the class or could choose to spend more time engaging with the minutiae within the language of the Latin texts. One weakness might be that the class does jump around a lot, and this might not align with what someone looking for a typical Latin class is looking for.",
                "Strengths: a diverse and interesting set of texts and authors across a wide range of history, with equally engaging secondary texts and supplementary readings that deepened our understanding of the selected primary readings. Overall, a nice balance of English and Latin readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been interesting for the class to engage in historical evidence as well as literature.",
                "strengths - super flexible and student-driven curriculum, relaxed environment. weaknesses - sometimes the commentaries were hard to follow but honestly it's hard to find commentaries for half of the authors we read so",
                "The amount of work per class could have been more consistent - and designed such that we would actually have time to discuss everything that we read/prepared.",
                "The strengths were the instructor, the carefully thought out syllabus, and the content itself. Ray was an excellent instructor who created a well-designed syllabus. The course had survey-like content, which can sometimes be difficult to teach given the frequent switching between authors and genres. Ray made these transitions smooth and elucidated the differences between what we had just read and what we were just beginning to read. The secondary scholarship was also very good in this course. It augmented our class discussions and our understandings of the Latin readings. A weakness might have been the expectations for an L5 language class. The class moved at a slower pace due in part to the different Latin abilities of each student. This is in no way a fault of the instructor's, but perhaps some minor fault of the department's. The difference in pace between this L5 class and the other L5 Latin class this semester was stark. This probably shouldn't be so, and it certainly doesn't set up the students in this class well for a future L5 class that runs at a faster pace and requiring a greater confidence in Latin grammar and syntax. Despite this, the class fostered great discussions and made me think about the Latin canon more than any previous class.",
                "Its strength is unfortunately also its weakness. The survey nature of the course means that we cover a great deal of material, but only a little bit of each author, so we got to experience many different writing styles (which is good for one's Latin) but didn't really have time to explore each text fully. The fragmented nature of the course also made it quite hard to follow for those who do not have a strong historical background in Roman history."

                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to someone who tends to take more traditional-style Latin courses. It offers a different perspective on the generally accepted Latin canon and allows both for close-up examinations of chosen texts and for reflection on the way that classical texts are received and analyzed within the field.",
                "I would recommend this class to students (both Classics majors and non-majors looking to fulfill L5 requirements). It was engaging and non-stressful.",
                "Yes!! This course made me think deeply about how race has affected the world since ancient times, even though they had different terms for it back then.",
                "Definitely! Ray is a wonderful and kind teacher, the material is interesting and relevant to current discussion of the elitism within the field of Classics. It will introduce you to texts you've never encountered before.",
                "Yes, this course broadens one's view on what the Latin canon is and what is worthy of reading and discussing. It will give an overview of many different authors and genres, improving your Latin skills over the course of the semester. The secondary scholarship helps you think critically about other aspects of the text you might not have noticed. Finally, the instructor was excellent: the expectations were always clear, there was always empathy and understanding during a challenging semester amidst and ongoing pandemic."
