As a capitalist I became more skeptical of capitalism in this course, and my hardline socialist classmates became more receptive of it, so it's a win-win for everyone. First time I've ever read Rawls or Keynes.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- Good coverage of a lot of material\r\n- Well-selected readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I felt like the emphasis on more modern thinkers wasn't very thorough.",
                "Strengths: we got introduced to a wide range of capitalist thought \r\n\r\nWeakness: we didnt read any anti-capitalists apart from Marx, neither did we discuss the real-world ramifications of different thinkers thoughts",
                "I really liked the readings and the way that Professor Collins would put key words\/concepts on the board at the beginning of class. I didnt like the midterm. Quote memorization felt like a waste of time to me and I didnt feel like I learnt from it",
                "Strengths: Clear and organized syllabus that moved in conversation with previous authors in chronological order, midterm and papers facilitated understanding and deeper examination of topics. Readings were interesting every time. Secondary literature provided good modern interpretations and applications of primary authors. Class dynamic was fun and thoughtful. \r\nWeaknesses: Lots of time to summarize what the authors wrote, not enough time to think about our own opinions. Final paper was rather unstructuredit would have been nice if we had a list of topics instead of needing to come up with our own. Class was focused on answering one question: is capitalism a force for moral good? If you're not interested in that question, you're out of luck.",
                "Strengths: Professor Collins is great! He explained concepts very well and made them fun and engaging with little games and examples.\r\nWeaknesses: often we wouldn't finish talking about a thinker one week and have to finish the next week, which I found challenging because I would forget a lot of the reading and feel a little lost in class. No significant weaknesses though."

                "Yes. Great business ethics course.",
                "Absolutely! Super interesting and thought-provoking.",
                "Yes, I would if you are interested in exploring different branches of capitalism. I would not recommend if you are looking for an anti-capitalist class",
                "This is an excellent introduction to the foundational thinkers of business ethicsspoilers, here's the full lineup of thinkers: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Hume, Montesquieu, Mill, Weber, Marx, Keynes, Hayek, Friedman, Rawlsand contemporaries McCloskey, Cowen, Robert Reich and Stiglitz. And random academic commentators and articles. If you're interested in any of these people's ideas and how they interact with each other, take this class! You won't regret this opportunity to think about the foundations of our modern capitalist system and how we can be more self-aware of the implications behind it, and how to respond appropriately as participants. A lot of the class is focused on the opinions of the thinkers in the syllabus and not too much on developing our own opinions, but that is just fine because students come in with their own implicit biases on this sort of contentious questionis capitalism a force for moral good? Class revolves mostly around this question.",
                "Yes! Professor Collins is great, and you will come away with a really good understanding of the theory behind things you learn in econ classes. I think every econ\/EPE major should have to take a class like this.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Professor Collins is an incredibly thoughtful, thorough professor, who ensures that all of his students not only understand but actively participate in the discussions regarding capitalism and various thinkers. This course is also incredibly valuable in that it allows students to develop their own perspectives on capitalism, without the course being biased from the start."
