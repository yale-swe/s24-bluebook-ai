                "While the course could benefit from even more time spent looking at and talking about photos, my favorite part was going into Haas to review Artist files, aperture foundation features, and having in class artists talks. You learn a-lot about the photographic process this way and gain much inspiration in building a voice.",
                "This course was my favorite course I have ever taken.",
