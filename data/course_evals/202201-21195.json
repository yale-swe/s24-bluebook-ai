                "There are no weaknesses of this course. I loved everything about this course. Definitely my favorite class at Yale so far!",
                "Strengths: Dannielle and our TA Jessica were gems. Also students in class made this a great semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The crits were a bit short which made it hard to recieve feedback.",
                "While the course could benefit from even more time spent looking at and talking about photos, my favorite part was going into Haas to review Artist files, aperture foundation features, and having in class artists talks. You learn a-lot about the photographic process this way and gain much inspiration in building a voice.",
                "This course was my favorite course I have ever taken.",
                "Only strengths: amazing!!! taught me so much in how to improve my hand at a digital camera and my eye in noticing subjects and frames that make for interesting photos"
