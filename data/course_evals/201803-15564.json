    "What exactly it means to be a \"body at war.\" Also the effect that war has on different peoples, countries, and areas. I also became rather adept at writing one page secondary source reviews.",
    "I learned how to effectively read, analyze, and cite both primary and secondary sources. I also learned about many aspects of American war not covered by traditional military history, which inspired me to change what I am thinking of studying.",
    "I developed insight into how class, gender, and race biases intersect in general and during wartime, as well as how medical technology shifts during conflict.",

    "A fantastic course by all means. I would probably characterize this as a survey course that focused on many different themes throughout the semester. Katie was very flexible in her teaching and also always encouraged us to meet with her. I really liked how we got to do each assignment twice (secondary source review and blog post), although it was kind of a leap to write the final paper (12-15 pages). The topics were interesting and the readings, while sometimes long, were always pertinent to our discussion and sometimes were actually fun!",
    "The strengths included the organization of studying one war each week and posting before class to ensure accountability for readings. The readings were carefully selected to provide a variety of perspectives and facilitate interesting discussion, and writing assignments besides the final paper reoccurred twice throughout."

    "I would highly recommend HIST127 to another student (even though it won't be offered ever again). You learn a ton about bodies of war and the small class size (5 people) was very conducive to conversation. The subject matter also caters towards people who are not history majors since it's more accessible than other topics (in my opinion). Katie was a fantastic teacher and super flexible, making the entire class an enjoyable experience.",
    "Absolutely, the workload is not too much, but at the same time, so many things are learned which will shed light on topics not traditionally covered anywhere else.",
    "Id recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine since it emphasizes that medicine always involves cultural factors and discusses interesting yet alarming American history."
