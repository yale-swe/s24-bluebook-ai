I also got the chance to read some entertaining stories and got the chance to read parts of the Qur'An in their original language for this first time. Beyond this, I began to appreciate the complexities of translation.",
                "This class gave excellent insight into how to read and translate classical Arabic texts.",
                "Generally, I developed a greater understanding of Classical Arabic, as well as how Classical Arabic differs from Modern Standard Arabic, in both theory and application. I also developed a greater understanding of the Arabic grammatical tradition. In addition, I gained a greater working knowledge of the mode-of-action in Arabic when it comes to constructing and voweling all categories of Arabic words (nouns, verbs, verbal nouns, participles). Consequently, my Arabic translation skills vastly improved over the course of the semester."

                "it was consistent in routine of in class participation and outside of class preparation, maybe find a way to go about in-class participation so that random/cold-calling does not jar or intimidate students too much generally",
                "The way this course revolved around reading Classical texts was a real strength. It was much more engaging to learn grammar rules and words when we could see them in the work we were deciphering, and it was helpful to practice recitation in class and to compare translations. I would have liked a bit more discussion of the cultural context of the texts we were reading, as I found the discussion we did have regarding this to be quite interesting. I also would have liked if we studied Arabic terms for different grammatical concepts (such as \"Mansub\" for \"Accusative\"). One challenge the course faced was the varying skill levels of the students. I heard they might offer a new Classical course next year at a level above this course but below the graduate seminars; I hope they do that, as this could address the problem.",
                "The texts we read and translated in class were very interesting, and Chris gave us a lot of historical context. Although the Gutas reader was excellent, the grammar we used was occasionally confusing. I am not sure there would be all that many options for a classical Arabic grammar textbook."

                "I would recommend this course to another student, if they are at a skill level where they could benefit from it. If they know a decent amount of Arabic grammar already (such as al-mafoul al-mutluk, case endings, verb forms, etc.), they might not learn a lot of new content in this course. Regardless of skill level, the course is enjoyable, and Classical Arabic is a great language to study (there is just such a depth and breadth of literature in Arabic across the centuries).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If you do all the preparation, you'll learn quite a bit about how classical Arabic works.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in a) learning Classical Arabic, b) improving their grammatical/syntactical understanding of Arabic, and c) being exposed to various sources of Classical Arabic literature. This course is especially beneficial in tackling Arabic grammar in a way that introductory courses were not able to, especially since there wasn't really a focus on vocabulary. However, this course is overall effective in accomplishing all three of these overarching goals."
