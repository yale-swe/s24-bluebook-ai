We also practiced writing succinctly for an online museum platform. It was really cool to learn all about the objects in the HST gallery before it opens.",

            "comments": [
                "The assignments were not very structured and the expectations unclear. I struggled to understand what was being asked of me. Class discussions were not always structured enough, so conversation did not flow. Or they were structured too much, for example when we were having an engaging discussion that was ended because we had gone off topic. I was not comfortable sharing in class because it felt like there was too much harsh feedback that decided there were right and wrong answers, rather than having a conversation that was allowed to be impromptu and imperfect.",
                "I think the strength and weakness of this course is one and the same -- it is almost entirely what you make it. Prof. Bertucci is very open and gives students freedom to research and write about what they're interested in, and since the timeline was a bit looser, the work of the course was generally pretty self-paced. This was great, but did require some discipline.",
                "This course is wide-ranging, covering an entirely new concept every week with a fair amount of readings, and showing historic objects in-person that you would never be able to engage with otherwise. I appreciated such an expansive syllabus, but I do wish that we used it to address larger questions of the point of a museum, the challenges of building a collection and communicating with an audience with such limited space and objects (and, to be honest, audience attention). The main strength of the course was the sheer number of topics covered in the readings and in what we were expected to write about for homework. I do like the idea of researching five topics a week and writing crisp precis of them, because after 14 weeks, you might have covered 50-75 topics and learned many new histories. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course was the discussion, which was partly due to the instructor and partly to the students. Discussions were elementary. People offered observations, but rarely elevated to inference, and *never* made it to analysis. Discussions rarely grew from person to person for more than three or four comments. Students were absolutely unwilling to offer an opinion that everyone might not agree with, and more worryingly they were unwilling to challenge another students view. A discussion can only grow so far if everyone agrees with each other, like a civilization that can only travel downwind. Professor Bertucci did put in some effort to guide and grow discussion, and I wish she could have done slightly more. Students seemed relatively engaged -- everyone had a laptop out, but most were actually taking notes on them, but I have no idea what they were writing down, because nothing interesting was said.",
                "I liked the course and overall it was very engaging. However, my grade changed dramatically from the midterm to the final, and I didn't receive a lot of feedback along the way to know that this was going to occur. Professor Bertucci said she would provide feedback on our weekly assignments, and I only received feedback two or three times over the semester. In the future, it would be nice to receive more feedback along the way so that students can see where their grades are heading and not be as surprised at the end.",
                "The broad overview format of the course, where each week focused on a different instrument was helpful both for covering the material and keeping the course engaging, I also appreciated the guest speakers towards the end of the course. Some of the readings felt slightly inaccessible."

                "If you have taken and enjoyed HSHM or history seminars previously. Or if you have taken courses with the professor before and enjoyed them. It seemed to benefit some students that the professor already knew and thought highly of them.",
                "Yes! I was nervous about this course as an HSHM student who'd never taken a course about the history of science. However, it turned out to be very interesting. The readings are generally engaging, the guest speakers were great, and the opportunity to engage with actual scientific objects was neat.",
                "No. The class requires little effort to succeed in, and many topics are covered, but it is not especially engaging or, for that reason, enjoyable. I suppose if you are a pre-med student with nothing interesting to say, you will fit right in.",
