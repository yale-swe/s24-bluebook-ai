I learned about different film movements and how to analyze films which is so incredibly important for emerging filmmakers.",
                "Technical vocabulary about cinema, insight on the most famous film theorists",
                "I learned so much about how to analyze films, all the elements of film that are used to convey meaning, and I was introduced to so many great films that I would have never watched otherwise.",

As someone who is interested in film production and filmmaking, I feel this course gave a great background in basic film production and the underlying theory that allows storytellers to create compelling films. This course helped me develop the skills to closely analyze scenes and apply theory to the movies we watched in class and films outside of class.",
                "A lot of foundational topics about film analysis, a new lens to watch cinema through. A lot of interesting discussion about the point of the film, and an opportunity to write essays that try to capture what it is about the films you've watched that works on the viewer.",
                "My learning of film critical theory and criticism was absolutely introductory, but, both Yasmina and Prof. McKay knew how to build curriculum. I feel Ive developed a solid foundation to study film at yale and beyond.",

            "comments": [
                "While the course covers some basic concepts of film, it focused primarily on trivial points of knowledge and ignores how technique is applied to practically enhance storytelling.",
                "MacKay is a wonderful professor and speaks in an exciting, engaging manner. There is a movie watching every week which takes up 3 hours - this definitely adds to the workload significantly over the course of the semester so be prepared for this. Not too difficult of a course.",
                "Fantastic course, the lectures are well prepared and given, movie selection is expertly done, teaching fellows are great.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, Professor MacKay is wonderful and caring (hell sometimes stay for a half an hour after screenings finish just to answer student questions!), the TFs are understanding and insightful, the workload isnt too bad\r\nWeaknesses: the grading distribution is a little strange because the last 2 weeks of the course are worth about 70% of the entire grade, there were too many experimental films we had to remember (I was fine and interested watching them but it was a lot to memorize for the final)",
                "Strength: course's structure is excellent\r\nWeakness: lectures are interesting, but not amazing. I feel like the content seen in the lectures does not help much with the assignments",
                "Strengths of the course were the guest lecturers and the content of the course was very engaging and interesting. It provided a lot of information about film, film's history, and film's meaning. The weakness was that the screenings were sometimes longer than what they were meant to me so sometimes we would leave a little bit late.",
                "I found the lectures extremely engaging. Professor MacKay is always super prepared and passionate about what he teaches. The film anthology was wonderful. The final exam was fair. The TAs' gradings for the papers were pretty rough though.",
                "Course had a lot of parts, including section, screening, and lecture, so it was kind of a lot sometimes, especially considering this is far from my major. But all of the parts worked together to teach us a whole lot about film.",
                "The lectures were awesome and informative, and the readings were interesting, though sometimes somewhat complicated. The number of prompts available to choose from and the option to choose our own inspired creativity. The TFs were awesome and sections were interesting and informative.",
                "Strengths: Professor MacKay was a super engaging professor, and it seemed like he was always super excited to share the material about film with us! Very good feedback on the essays, and lots of discussion about film in general, which I didn't always agree with but found super fascinating anyways!\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe a bit too rudimentary for my liking, but then again, I had had experience with filmmaking before and I was already familiar with 90% of the terms presented, which may not be the majority of the audience.",
                "The course is strong in its providing a lot of digestible information on how to understand and digest different parts of the class and the topics of each week. I do wish some of the materials were more available though as some films were unable to be found on the yale online archives like others.",
                "I thought screenings were sometimes long and hard to stay engaged with. I really enjoyed discussion section, and thought the essays were engaging and prompts were thoughtful.",
                "I believe the course was structured very well.",
                "I think the only improvement that could be made is maybe choosing a different screening time because sometimes when it is late it is a little difficult to stay focused, however the rest of the course was fantastic to me. Maybe there could be more guest speakers but the ones that came in this semester were fantastic so I was satisfied.",
                "I appreciated the screening and the guest lecture opportunities, however I was sometimes lost in the lecture simple due to the nature of a lecture style class.",
                "Strengths: interesting content-wise\r\nWeaknesses: high weekly time commitment (2 lectures, 3 hour screening, discussion section); writing credit but don't feel like I learned more about writing about film; having both a final exam and a final paper which made up 70% of the grade was very stressful",
                "While the content is very engaging, it is presented in a way which is difficult to take notes on.",
                "The professor is a great lecturer.   I wished we could see more films by people of color.  I think our discussion of the canonical films were fine, but I wish we had even more discussion (especially in lectures) about the pervasive racism and misogyny that is prevalent in those because of the time they were made.",
                "more teaching in sections. We were expected to write based on loose information without any instruction. A lot of hours with screening, section, and class",
                "The strength of the course was probably the lecturer, Professor MacKay. The man is a wealth of information  I can't remember going to a class without MacKay jumping off into a happy tangent on why the class should consider watching a \"rather marvelous film\" that he mentioned for only ten seconds. And, if I didn't have a heavy STEM workload, I might have. In a similar vein, I think that even as a student studying outside of the field of humanities, the class was accessible. Even so, thanks to MacKay's strong lecture skills, I barely had to reach outside of lecture material on the final exam. In terms of improvement, I think the class was a bit scattered in terms of the discussion sections. It's okay if these sections are going to discuss completely different things from week to week, like section A will talk about the latest movies, section B will talk about the latest readings, and section C will talk about lecture concepts  but please let us know in advance! I think some people could have been interested in having a choice as to what they wanted to discuss more often than not. Again, the deviation is fine, though I admit the discussion structure for several of my peers seemed to cover topics more interesting to me, and vice versa. Clarity at the start would be a nice touch!"

                "If you're interested in learning the things that are on the syllabus, and watching great movies from the 20th century, and don't mind writing a couple of papers really engaging with what and how you think about film, then absolutely take the course!!",
                "I would greatly recommend this course to anyone who enjoys film as it is a great writing course about the standard canon of film.",
                "Yes, I feel as if I am a much stronger writer and reader after this course, and I am much more interested in film.",
                "Definitely, whether for a simple interest, a writing credit, or an intro class. Take it!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because it gives you knowledge on a large part of pop-culture and it is extremely interesting to learn how films are made and how to analyze them.",
                "I would only recommend this course if the student was a film major because it gives a good background to classic films and is a requirement.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in film at all, because it provides basic foundational knowledge. However, it is important to consider the high time commitment that the class requires",
                "This is a very good introduction to film theory and film analysis. Definitely take it if you're interested in learning more about the art form of film.",
                "Yes, its a fun class!",
                "its a prereq, so yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Even as a STEM student, the class was accessible. But please, take this class only if you are interested in the subject  not because you like to watch the latest blockbuster and nothing more. You don't necessarily have to like everything presented in the class (some of the experimental films, which are often non-narrative films created to bend the rules of traditional cinema whilst usually on a budget under $10,000) went over my head. Still, it was only 1 week in a course of 14! There are so many topics of film  with weeks focusing on editing, documentary, animation, cinematography, narration, CGI, genre, experimental and more  that you are bound to find at least a few fascinating. So, if you have any spark of curiosity for anything about the film, feel free to join this course!"
