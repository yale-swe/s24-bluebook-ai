                "A key insight I gained in taking this course was considering a broad definition of medical technology. I gained an appreciation for users of medical technologies: both medical providers and patients. I developed specific skills around building histories of technology, primary source analysis, and effective usage of Yale library resources.",
                "Such an interesting course on the history of medical technology also helps develop library skills (finding primary and secondary sources) and writing skills!",

                "This course had extremely interesting readings, conversations and topics. Professor O'Donnell kept us very involved with critical thinking and bringing the issues into modernity. These were deeply personal conversations, yet entirely based in fact. The only weakness about the course was that it was later in the day and I was definitely sleepy as a result of it.",
                "Maybe have more of an overarching theme for each week",
                "One strength of this course was the building of student comfort level with library resources and gaining access to Yale's holdings in a meaningful way. Secondarily, the course provided a broad overview of medical technology from a variety of time periods and perspectives. Finally, guest speakers added unique perspectives to engage with throughout the course. Professor O'Donnell was very available to students for feedback on writing assignments and was really kind and considerate about assignment deadlines. I think my main point of improvement in the course would be the content of in-class discussions. I think that the readings offered a massive base of content for substantive discussion in class, however, our actual in-class time often derailed into personal medical horror stories and experiences. While I do think there is some benefit to discussing personal experiences in classes, especially in HSHM seminars, I think it was to the detriment of moving through the material and really learning about what we read.",
                "Strengths: Professor O'Donnell truly the best professor at yale. plans great activities to make seminar interesting and great readings. so knowledgeable",
                "Discussions in class are very synergistic, with peers and Prof. ODonnells thoughts opening exciting doors each time. I imagine it like we start class at one end of a hotel lobby and gradually make our way through, opening some hotel rooms and looking around, skipping some others, and by the end having a good picture of who lives in that hallway, why they do, what they do, etc. This is all to say that the class is well organized and conducive to learning, and Prof. O Donnell is a great discussion leader.",
                "Extremely well taught course, Professor O'Donnell created a really welcoming and positive classroom atmosphere and we had really thought-provoking discussions every class. No weaknesses.",
                "It was a really interesting course! I think that the course is very conducive to open discussions and everyone felt comfortable sharing."

                "I would recommend this course to another student for a few reasons. It provides a really interesting perspective on medical technology and gives space to consider a variety of such technologies and their users. Professor O'Donnell was attentive to student needs and wants in the classroom space and in one-on-one meetings. She prepared a reasonable but comprehensive list of readings (one of the few classes that seemed to have the right amount of reading so students could actually do it all and learn a lot!). The papers allowed students to consider their own interactions with medical technologies and critically analyze those they were interested in.",
                "ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND! Take literally every class with Prof. O'Donnell that you can",
                "Yes!! I will never see medical technology the same. Also I think I finally know how to write a history research paper.",
                "Yes definitely take any of Professor ODonnells classes. This one in particular was so well thought out and really challenged your perspective on what medical technology means. She is an amazing professor and an even kinder person.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much from this course that is applicable to more than just \"medicine\" -- I've learned about the histories of all sorts of technologies I use in my daily life which I had no idea even existed.",
                "Yes, I think it's important for anyone in the sciences or medicine to understand that not everything is as simple as good and evil. Technology is thought to be only devices that are objectively more accurate than human judgement, which is not the case.",
