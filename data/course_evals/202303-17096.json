Another strength is that the speakers were from such a wide variety of backgrounds I did really feel like we got a taste of everything.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Saxena is a gem, she's so sweet and it's clear that she really cared about how the course was presented and how we interacted with it.\r\nWeaknesses: This is more an inherent feature of guest speakers, but it was hard to stay tuned in and engaged for lectures week after week.",
                "Strengths: it was clear that the syllabus was very thoughtfully planned -- there was a really comprehensive variety of guest speakers who were a great launching pad for seniors considering different career paths that involve a BME degree\r\nWeaknesses: not enough engagement with the professor or my classmates; would have been nice if the final project was developed more during class (rather than on our own time)",
                "Shreya did an amazing job of selecting speakers for this class, and I wish that BENG 280 could be similar to this. I wish I knew about these different options as a sophomore when I just started doing BME so that I could better shape my experience into striving for one of these sects.",
                "We had a lot of consulting people come in, which was slightly unrelated to the major. Having people from an even broader range of professions would be great, although what we did have was lovely."

I almost wish it was when we were juniors and not seniors but I think junior year is so full of the 350 level classes that it'd be too tight to fit it in for a lot of people.",
