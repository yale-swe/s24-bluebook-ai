    "I have developed knowledge and skills about classical mechanics, and how to apply the knowledge of classical mechanics to solve problems of theoretical or real situations.",
    "The mechanics side of calculus-based physics.",
    "I learned a lot of physics and that physics may not be the path for me.",
    "I learned about classical mechanics: how objects move, how forces influence objects' motion and how energy conservation applies in different situations. We also learned about gravity, rotational motion and dynamics, simple harmonic motion and some thermodynamics.",
    "In the beginning of the semester, I learned a lot about how to think like a physicist and apply the laws of physics logically when solving problems. However, as the course progressed, I felt that I was learning less and less, and the topics we covered in class seem less and less relevant to solving problems on problem sets and exams.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of classical mechanics in an entirely new light, with a more calculus based approach to problems.",
    "Basic mechanics (including energy conservation, momentum, rotational motion, relativity, oscillators), but way beyond AP Physics C.",
    "Damped driven harmonic oscillators. Rotational motion.",
    "Covered the physics of Newtonian motion",
    "I don't feel like I really learned physics in this course.",
    "I learned that I might reconsider my major declaration. Other than that, I took AP Physics C: Mechanics so most of the stuff in the class, I kind of knew already. Specifically, I learned damped oscillators and a few new approaches to previously impossible questions.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about quantitative analysis and got to dive deeper into physics concepts than I did in high school. I learned a lot about where equations came from and was able to understand what I had learned before and see it in a different light.",
    "How to think of physics in a different way.",
    "I learned how to apply calculus to rethink all the basic concepts in physics and how to apply them to prove some relationships in the universe between variables. The topics themselves were not new but the approach to understanding them were entirely different. The pset problems were further challenging enabling me to develop some intuition to tackle such problems.",
    "This course gave me a strong basis in the fundamentals of mechanics, from Newton's Laws to Rotational Motion. It also helped me with math bu giving me a useful application of my skills in calculus. It also challenged my studying abilities and helped me grow in that respect.",
    "I learned the basics of classical mechanics and improved problem solving skills.",
    "Classical mechanics, mathematical tools for physics, and some thermodynamics",
    "Most of the content in an AP Physics C Mechanics-like course, except at a more sophisticated physical and mathematical level and understanding. Basically, you learn how to do physics well at a fundamental level (hence the name of this course).",
    "Better understanding of the fundamental principles of physics beyond the basics taught in high school",
    "Basic classical mechanics, some thermodynamics, some relativity, some mathematical methods.",
    "Physics, how to be bored all the time",
    "This course helped me form a solid foundation in introductory mechanics. The curriculum focused on skills such as calculating the moment of inertia for a given object about a given axis, finding the equation for the potential energy of an object in different scenarios, and other standard mechanics processes. I had only taken algebra-based physics in high school, and this class both supplemented with calculus what I already knew -- taking the things I know to be physically true and letting me see that they are mathematically true -- and also helped me to learn new physics along the way. As it was my first college physics course, it also taught me how to do physics problem sets and take notes in a physics lecture, two very helpful skills.",
    "Strengthened my basic physics knowledge and problem solving skills.",
    "First principles knowledge of the concepts in intro physics.",
    "Better understanding of mechanics.",
    "I had some physics background from high school, so much of the material was already familiar to me. I learned a little about harmonic oscillators and some new ways to intuitively think about some concepts.",
    "I developed great insight into the nature of college physics and qualitative reasoning when providing evidence for physical phenomena.",
    "From this course, we learned classical mechanics through a calculus-based lens. The course strengthened my problem-solving skills as I had to apply the equations and theory I had learned to solve real-world problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is pretty clear-cut, which is a definite strength. The problem sets occur regularly, and the expectations are clear. The midterms are also pretty consistent with the problem sets, so it is easy to know what you need to know. The main weakness of this course is that people thought it would be very much different from AP Physics C: Mechanics, and for most of the semester, it was not. Then, after a period of time, it became significantly more difficult conceptually, but the strength there is that office hours and study halls were very helpful.",
    "Strength: Lecture were engaging and the course had great TAs. Weakness: what we learned in lecture often times had little with what we did in class and that meant a lot of self teaching outside the class",
    "I thought the class was useful, I learned some classical mechanics; however, I felt there was not enough information given between the book and the lecture for us to do the problem sets. The book often had gave no aid in completing the problem sets.",
    "The lectures went far too slow at some points and far far too fast at others.  I often felt that lecture was not necessary since I would either already know the material or not being able to comprehend it.  The psets were comprehensive and enjoyable although quite difficult.  I would not have been able to even start some of the problems without the study halls.",
    "the homeworks are increadibly boring. The tests were pretty much based on the problem sets and on very specific parts of the lectures.",
    "Very well-organized; Prof. Harris does a great job outlining the lectures and making sure that each concept follows clearly from the previous concept. However, much of class is dedicated to deriving equations that we then use on the problem sets. Although it's interesting to understand where these equations come from, it would be nice if we spent more time talking about how to apply them, since that's what's tested on the homework and exams.",
    "While the lectures were very useful, the textbook was not at all. Also, the problem sets covered material that appeared almost two or three weeks in the past and made learning new material at the same time difficult. The exams were also much harder than what we were given in class or in problem sets.",
    "Strengths: It's not a lot of work, but you learn the material well. Prof. Harris's handwriting and lecture style are super neat and easy to understand, and it's pretty cool material, even for people who might have seen it before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class could be super boring at times. The textbook also isn't great.",
    "This class was very good, and I belieive that it is good as it stands.",
    "I wish we had more practice problems and did more examples (rather than long derivations) in lecture, which would have been helpful in doing psets and preparing for exams. Professor Harris is an engaging lecturer and his notes were generally very clear. The study halls were useful in that everyone was collaborating, but sometimes the TAs couldn't explain concepts that well.",
    "No real strengths when compared with other classes.\r\nWeaknesses include lectures that do not apply whatsoever with the textbook material, long-lasting tangents on topics that are considered prerequisites for the class, inconsistent harshness of grading by different TAs, and wildly variable difficulties of problem sets. In addition, supposedly the class is not curved, which is ridiculous considering that other, specialized courses (such as introductory organic chemistry), are curved and this course, considered an introduction to university physics, is not curved.",
    "Strengths: None\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is AWFUL (if you do decide to take this class, use the Halliday textbook he mentions in the syllabus) - it is way too brief, doesn't have enough examples, and tries to be funny. Lectures are completely unhelpful - he doesn't teach certain topics that you need to know for problem sets and midterms. I understand that in physics classes usually the professor derives formulas for the entire time, but sometimes he spent time on topics (like explaining to us what a derivative was) that were not worth our time. I did not at all learn how to approach physics problems and think like a physicist, which I think is unfortunate. Toward the end of the semester, the problem sets got really difficult (he made the questions so that you had to go to class for one specific formula he would give), and throughout the semester the problem sets were graded really harshly (dependent on the TA that graded that specific problem).",
    "Strengths: It's organized and there's a good amount of help available.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you have a basic understanding of AP Physics, you could not show up to maybe 90% of the lectures and get a reasonable grade on the homeworks and tests. It's pretty difficult to understand the lectures, especially when most of the time they don't have much to do with the homework or the exam material.",
    "I think the lectures were very engaging but did not relate much to what was expected of us on problem sets and midterms. The study halls were good, but I think making them more a requirement or adding a section to the course would be beneficial. Professor Harris is a great lecturer, but what he put on some midterm (the last one) was not what we really learned in class. Without having a clear knowledge of if the course would be curved (cut offs shifted) it was a bug anxiety of me and my peers as the average of one of our midterms was a D-. The problem sets were good and we had lots of resources to help us, but the peer tutors were much more helpful than the TF's. I think the grading and rubrics of the problem sets were not very clear.",
    "The teaching style was hard to follow but the psets were good practice for the tests.",
    "a bit too theoretical. i think that if there were more worked examples of problems in class the understanding of the material could be more solid.",
    "The study halls are greatly helpful to tackle the psets. Jack has great patience to run us through the concepts in class. However, the psets often require thinking that is not easily developed by extrapolating from the lectures, resulting in a dependence on study halls to solve the pset problems. It would be useful if the class also covered how to takle pset problems.",
    "I think this course was very well designed. The pacing of the lectures was sometimes a little fast, but I was always able to catch up in the end. The almost daily study halls are a great resource, and made completing the problem sets a much more enjoyable learning experience. The Shankar text may have been the most frustrating part of the course, as the problems were sometimes somewhat vague and occasionally had typos.",
    "This course only covered about half of the material that was on the original syllabus, so I was already familiar with most of the material.  I think it could be improved by outlining a more reasonable expectation of topics to discuss.  Additionally, the averages of the midterms varied by over 30 points, so more consistent tests would improve student's experiences.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures and study halls (with accessible TAs and peer tutors). Weaknesses: limited time to allow for more lectures on thermodynamics and relativity",
    "Given that this was the first time that professor Harris had taught this course, there was very little access to extra practice for the tests. I felt that the lectures in class loosely connected to the exams, making it difficult to study and perform well.",
    "Strengths: Easy-to-follow lectures, good feedback on assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Disproportionately difficult midterms that are graded harshly",
    "Weaknesses, everything; strengths, TAs. God bless these heros.",
    "This course is very solid. The lectures are clear and organized and a very nice supplement to the textbook; seeing the professor work through tough problems and derivations on the board and having the opportunity to take notes during the process was extremely helpful. I would say one weakness is the somewhat disjointed feeling of the class as a whole: Lectures and the textbook line up well, but the problem sets feel harder and not very related to topics covered in lecture, and the exams feel completely separate and thus very hard to prepare for. It would be great to have either a clearer sense of what is going to be tested, more time for midterms, or fewer problems on exams, simply because the problems themselves are problem-set difficulty, and to try to do four of them in 75 minutes is a nightmare. This is coming from someone who did relatively well on all exams yet still felt very rushed, and I wished that the exams could be a reflection of how comfortable you are with the problem sets and lecture material. Instead they felt separate and more challenging.",
    "The course was well taught but at times inconsistent with the Shankar textbook, and it wouldve been better if the textbook were referenced in class rather than not mentioning it at all in class but having entire psets lean on it.",
    "It appeared as though there were three different courses: the lectures, the PSETs, and the exams.  All were, for the most part, unrelated and performing well in one setting wasn't very translatable to doing well in the others.",
    "Intuitive learning process, but drawn out at times and a vast difference between what was taught in lectures and what was on the psets and tests",
    "The study halls were extremely helpful for doing the PSETs.",
    "Some of the lectures don't correspond to the problem sets and more midterm review could be usefull.",
    "I think the course could be a little more fast paced: to me, most of the classes felt somewhat boring. However, this opinion may be influenced by my prior physics background.",
    "The group work on problems sets was valuable and essential to my understanding of the material.  The course lecture could be improved with more interaction with the class through demonstrations and more time spent on tangible examples and explanations.",
    "Some strengths to this course include the cohesiveness of the problem sets and tests. The material on the tests ties very well to the problem sets so if one understands the methods and types of problems found in the problem set, the tests have similar questions just taken a step further. However, on the same token, a weakness to the course is the connection between the lecture and the problem sets. The lectures emphasized theory and felt vague at times. Since most of the solutions to the problem sets came from being able to apply the knowledge, it became difficult because I felt that the lectures did not provide the necessary structure for us to be able to solve the problems and some required outside knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as a happy medium for a person who is between being a total physics wonk and someone who is just taking physics as a requirement. It is more advanced, so it keeps up at a good clip, but it does not require a huge amount of mathematical knowledge. It is overall just an interesting course, and it is a great way to view the world in a different light, to be able to describe phenomena in everyday life. If you like lectures, it is a lecture, but if you don't, you can also show up to study halls and get more one-on-one help or form a group of physics friends to do p-sets with.",
    "Depends. If you know you want to major in physics, and had a solid physics\/math background, go for it. But if you're going to major in engineering, might be better to take 180.",
    "If you are good at math and have taken physics C, take 260.",
    "I took this course as a bio major because I got it into my head that it would be better than 170 or 180. Although I can't speak to the relative quality of these other courses, PHYS 200 was pretty good overall. Not sure I'd recommend it to someone in my situation, since there's really no need to take this level of physics when 170 or 180 would suffice, but I don't really have any complaints. The problem sets were difficult but manageable; the midterms varied wildly in difficulty, but c'est la vie.",
    "If physics is what you want to do, then I would recommend this course. The pace of the class is very fast.",
    "Yeah, it seems like it's a lot better than 170\/180 and less work than 260. If you're not already interested in physics, it's not going to light a fire under you, but it's a good introduction to mechanics with calculus and not too much work either.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in studying physics because if you really like the class (as I know some people did), then you can feel very secure in knowing you want to study physics. However, if you end up not liking it, you will realize that physics is not for you. If you are not at all interested in studying physics, I would not take the course.",
    "Yes, as it is important to understanding the fundamentals of physics that are necessary to learn in order to progress.",
    "Not necessarily, unless you want more of an intellectual challenge. The content is interesting and the psets were reasonable but the exams became exponentially harder and unpredictable in terms of difficulty level. I chose 200 over 180 but perhaps that was not the best decision.",
    "No. Instructor doesn't teach the material, you basically have to teach yourself physics based off the textbook. You'd be better off taking 180.",
    "Yes.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN PHYSICS. If you're premed\/bio\/chem, take 170\/180. If you have the physics background, take 260. This class is not taught well as an intro class, and problem sets are too difficult\/not graded fairly. This class single handedly made my semester horrible (I'm not kidding), and I didn't come out of it having learned anything. The average for the first midterm was a 90, but the average on the third was a 60. Professor Harris is good at speaking (so the first lectures seemed fine), but what he says is not actually useful for an intro physics class, so don't be fooled during shopping period.",
    "Yes, if you are already pretty confident with algebra based physics, this is a pretty good introduction to calculus.",
    "Not particularly. I would only take this course by this professor if you really have to, e.g. for a major or something. The workload isn't too heavy but it was consistently my most difficult course, even if you attend every lecture and work with others.",
    "I would. I would just say that you NEED to go to study hall, and if you feel like you need more help in learning how to solve problems than go to 180.",
    "I probably would not unless they had a really good understanding of physics because it was often very confusing.",
    "I would as an introduction to college physics, for the intuition that is developed and the mindset that is taught.",
    "Absolutely! This course was an excellent experience for me, and gave me a good idea of what studying physics at Yale is like. I can confidently say that anyone who is considering majoring in physics would enjoy this course.",
    "If a student had previously taken physics C (or equivalent) and has a strong background, I would recommend.  The lectures were very well done, but often did not cover the physics required for the problem set.  Only take this course if you are a confident test taker, as the tests are difficult and were not curved.",
    "Yes, the lectures are interesting.",
    "Although I found the actual content of the class very interesting, the exams and problem sets were very difficult to do even with assistance from TAs and fellow students. As someone not looking to become a physics major, I would not recommend this to someone with a similar background and intended major path at Yale.",
    "Yes. For any physical science major deciding which physics to take, take 200. It's intellectually demanding sometimes, but it's a rewarding intellectual challenge offset by the less-than-typical amount of work this class assigns (only PSETs).",
    "If you need to take a physics class, 200 is a good choice. It's interesting and goes beyond the basics taught at the high school level but is still to those without a serious background in calc-based physics. Know that the midterms are significantly harder than the psets and are graded harshly.",
    "If you're looking at this review, odds are you don't have much of a choice to begin with. That being said, still do not choose this course. Take 180, talk to the DUS, change majors if you have to. Good lord how my disdain for this class knows no bounds. It is not that this class is the hardest class I have taken at Yale, nor is it the class that was the worst taught. By all standard metrics, you might say that this class is perfectly average. However, The dread of the mind-numbing hour-and-twenty-minute-rant about NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL(!!!) only to receive the hardest fucking pset of my life each week, every week without fail was enough to put this class thorougly in my nightmares and at the center of every conversation with my psychiatrist. If you're in this class, I assume you have learned what an integral is before. Would you like a 80 minute review about the definition of a Riemann sum? No? What if I told you it will in no way help you when you eventually have to do a homework problem about the differentiation of a complex form of e that you have never seen before? Are you interested now? I hate this class. It would be forgivable, if (a) the teacher were pleasant and interesting, (b) the midterms were easy and the class was essentially a test of effort, or (c) it was fucking right during lunch time. But on all counts this class fails! the same way 90% of the class failed the third midterm. Please, please read this. I know you're not going to because, as I said, you really don't have a choice do you, but please listen. This class sucks! ESPECIALLY with Jack Harris, the uninteresting, boring, careless man I have ever met. He won't care about you, and he won't care about helping you either. I know they say 180 is harder but it's gotta be better than this garbage",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! If you're interested in physics and trying to choose between 200 and 180, I don't have much to say. But if you're choosing between 200 and 260, I would put in a good word for 200. I had many friends this semester who took 260 and were constantly complaining about the problem sets and how rushed the curriculum felt; in 200, Professor Harris took the time to build things up from the basics and make sure everything is very clearly explained, rather than try to cram in all sorts of things. If you're very comfortable with calculus-based physics and did well in AP Physics C Mech. and E&M in high school, 260 might be more interesting, but otherwise, 200 is a very solid course and paced quite nicely.",
    "Yes, definitely interesting regardless of whether you need it for your major. DEFINITELY take it over 180. Save yourself some time and stress.",
    "Not a bad one for the prerequisite requirement if you have a background in HS physics",
    "If you need to take it, take it. It is a challenging course that teaches you the computational side of physics.",
    "If you are interested in physics a good, higher level intro class.",
    "No. My experience in this class doesn't nearly embody what I love about physics, so to a non-physics major, I would probably recommend they take a different course in a related discipline that has more potential to pique one's scientific curiosity and interest (I am only a first-year, but I imagine such classes must exist). And to a physics major, I would recommend PHYS 260, a class that covers approximately the same topics, but (from what I hear) is taught in a much more captivating way, and in greater detail.",
    "Unless the student was set on physics or engineering as a major and had some backgound in physics, I would not recommend this class.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they had a solid background in physics. Some of the questions I had trouble with were due to my relatively weaker background compared to others. In addition, they have to be able to keep up with the integration and derivation techniques that come into play with forces and newton's second law."
