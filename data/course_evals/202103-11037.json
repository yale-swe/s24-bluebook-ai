                "I improved my speaking and comprehension skills, learned new vocabulary and how to apply it, and reviewed essential topics in grammar.",
                "I practiced my conversational French, as well as my ability to communicate literary analyses of Boule de Suif, Le coeur  rire et  pleurer, and Art in a foreign language. We didn't really talk with each other one-on-one much, as it was much more of a class-based discussion style. I learned about the social structures in France post-Franco-Prussian war, the history of Guadeloupe, and how French literature approached the growth of contemporary art. I felt that my writing skills also developed a lot, since I wrote four major essays in this class, all in French.",
                "This course helped me develop my oral and reading comprehension skills in tandem with each other, given that class discussions were dependent on comprehension of the selected francophone texts and films as well as application of the learned vocabulary. I also got the opportunity to diversify my writing style in learning new grammar rules and applying them to the required essays.",
                "All around it's a great course for refining French skills in all areas. You learn a ton of vocabulary, do a lot of speaking and the grammar is extensive and digestible.",
                "I gained confidence in my French speaking skills throughout the class as I learned to think on my feet, put together the correct grammar structures, and use the correct pronunciations with ease. I also gained insight into various French sources, readings and films, which improved my writing abilities.",
                "Throughout the course, I developed my knowledge of French grammar and vocabulary, and I developed my ability to read and write in French. I also developed my listening comprehension skills. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, reading, writing, and grammar exercises were supplemented with literary and cultural materials from the francophone world, including books, movies, and songs."

            "comments": [
                "I like how Professor Schneider led class discussions and made sure each student got the chance to speak. I wish we had read more books by black authors/ had more diversity in the films/books we read as the one by Maryse Conde was my favorite.",
                "I thought the class was great - the work was challenging but manageable, everyone was encouraged to participate, and I gained confidence in my speaking abilities.",
                "Strengths: if you're fully engaged, you get so much out of this course. Madame Schneider encourages participation from everyone, so if you want to talk, you will. This makes for a great environment to develop your spoken French.\r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes felt that I had already forgotten the grammatical structures earned earlier in the course. Sometimes, I hadn't had time to review my vocab or grammar exercises in depth before she was asking for questions in class. This made me a little confused in class, and I felt like I was behind in my understanding of grammar/vocabulary.",
                "The course places particular focus on applying new vocabulary terms and grammar structures to oral practice, and students learn to utilize these newfound skills at a rapid pace. However, at times, class discussions moved too quickly from subject to subject, requiring quick thinking and a somewhat competitive approach, as students prioritized the number of vocabulary words or grammar structures they could incorporate into their contributions, rather than depth of thought.",
                "Strengths- the course packet is so useful, also the vocabulary\r\nWeaknesses - do not expect to learn from a diverse range of authors. Also the last book, one of the only pnes written by a non-white author, doesnt appear outwardly to have nearly as much resources or time poured into it",
                "The class forced me to work on my French on a daily basis during and outside of lessons. This consistent practice meant I made a good amount of progress throughout the semester. I found the grammar exercises especially helpful and thorough. \r\n\r\nThe workload of this course was very high, but in my opinion it was worthwhile because I was very committed to improving my French.",
                "The professor was a major strength of this course. I appreciate that she would make an active effort to solicit responses from all students in any given class period, so that everyone had an opportunity to practice their spoken French. Of course, this meant that conversations could sometimes feel quite forced, but did ensure that everyone had an opportunity to practice speaking within the short class period. Furthermore, the professor was very enthusiastic about the course material, and so the class was never boring. I also appreciated that the professor was always willing to make herself available for office hours, and was patient with students' questions. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the major writing assignments (the \"rdactions\") were split up into two parts: an initial draft, which would receive commentary from the professor, and then a final edited/corrected version. This structure provided an invaluable opportunity for students to receive constructive feedback and corrections on the rdactions as we worked on them. Personally, I loved this aspect of the course. Had I not had this opportunity for direct feedback from the professor in between drafts, I would have been reluctant to experiment with more complicated sentences and grammatical structures, and higher-level vocabulary. I feel like I was able to push my bounds a bit, and receive constructive feedback, which helped to advance my writing. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by placing greater emphasis on developing students' spoken French. The only time that students actually got to speak the language was within the short class period on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Because of the number of students in the class, this amounted to very little time actually speaking the language. In previous French courses at Yale, teachers incorporated spoken/pronunciation practice into homework assignments by having students send in audio recordings of their response to a prompt, for example. Incorporating something like this could help students receive clearer feedback on their pronunciation."

                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to any student interested in French who wants to continue to engage with grammar/vocab & gain more experience speaking before moving on to a higher-level French course. I feel more prepared for having taken this class.",
                "Yes! Taking it with Mme Schneider made for a very rewarding experience. She's the grammar expert. As long as you can laugh at your mistakes and are willing to do all the homework (every time) before class, you will have an excellent time perfecting your spoken French. It was so much easier to communicate my ideas at the end of the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in gaining exposure to a variety of francophone texts and films. In the process of studying these works, students get the opportunity to develop their oral, auditory, written, and reading comprehension simultaneously, as long as they are willing to invest the effort required to thoroughly understand the works.",
                "If you didnt have to take it, I probably wouldnt recommend it. But, it improves a lot of your basic French skills so its a trade-off",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is very committed to improving their French quickly. Taking class makes the most sense if you have room in your courseload to do a significant amount of work every day.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone hoping to learn French. The course and homework materials were very engaging, the vocabulary lists were extensive, and the professor explained grammatical concepts concisely and well. This class is a great way to improve one's understanding of, and ability to use, the French language."
