                "Gained excellent context for global black movements!",
                "Although I studied South African history in Professor Magaziner's lecture course last spring, I had never before learned the history of Pan-African movements until I enrolled in this course. Beyond introducing me to entirely new histories, this class greatly honed my abilities to synthesize archival materials and historical discourses through our weekly reading material, response papers, and seminar sessions. The final term paper also taught me how to conduct a long-term research process online and in the archives on an original topic. More than any other history course I have taken at Yale, this class improved my critical thinking and research skills as a historian while introducing me to people and histories I had never before encountered in the classroom."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were the syllabus/readings and Professor Magaziner. Professor Magaziner was amazing - he was great at shaping the class discussion and was really supportive. The readings and class material was really interesting as well. In regards to improving the course, I would suggest maybe adding the option to drop one of the weekly reading responses and also giving more feedback throughout the semester on student work.",
                "The class is really good at giving an overall understanding of the history of PanAfricanism. It covers a lot of ground in both spatial and temporal terms. However, this means that it doesn't go as deep in each of the events it covers. That said, I'm not sure such depth was the goal of the class; I still loved it the way it was.",
                "Strengths: Curriculum, professor, papers are straightforward but really do help you to grasp the material, discussions are great. Weaknesses: wish that I got more feedback on my papers throughout the course. Sometimes a book in one week was really hard to accomplish, but I suppose the alternative would be less readings covered over the term, and I valued pretty much everything we read.",
                "Very good, though it often felt like we were missing a lot of the political contexts of the cultural contributions we were learning about. Lots of analysis of themes around the globe kept the class engaging for a wide variety of interests.",
                "This course was incredibly well-organized and well taught. Without a doubt, its strengths were its fascinating subject material and the incredible discussions Professor Magaziner facilitated about that material each week. No other history course has introduced me to as many new historical topics and modes of thought; indeed, the discussions we had a class were the highlights of my weeks throughout this semester. While not necessarily a weakness, something to note about this course is the challenge of reading and synthesizing a large reading load into a weekly response paper each week. With that said, the reading list for this course is incredible, and I came to enjoy the practice of writing the weekly response papers every Monday for the ways it improved my skills as a writer and a historian."

                "Yes! This class was excellent and I highly recommend it.",
                "Definitely. This class exposed me to so much history that I didn't know and might not have had a chance to learn anywhere else.",
                "Absolutely. Every week was a delight and by the end of it I felt like I had a deep understanding of the topic, and at least a few of the texts I read in the course (from curriculum and my final research paper) I now consider essential texts in my personal/political development.",
                "Certainly. I found the workload to be a lot for a student who was credit/d/failing the course, but weekly assignments gave me a good chance to explore my ideas.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was the best history seminar I have taken at Yale. Pan-Africanism is a fascinating and wholly understudied movement in history about which any undergraduate student should learn. Moreover, Professor Magaziner and the other students in this course were incredible, and I looked forward to our discussions more and more each week. This class disrupted the Western-centric historical narratives that so often define American classrooms, challenging us to question the past as well as the processes of historical production themselves. The subject material, the insights of my classmates, and Professor Magaziner's instruction simply made me a better student and historian. Indeed, listening to my peers' independent research presentations at the end of the semester was one of the highlights of my time as a Yale student thus far. If not this seminar, every Yale student needs to take a course with Professor Magaziner before they graduate."
