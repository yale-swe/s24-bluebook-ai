Ostad (the professor) has very reasonable expectations and was very understanding, ensuring that we were learning first and foremost!",

                "The main strength is that Ostad has no tolerance for messing around you need to work hard in the class, or you won't do well, and I think that's great. One of the weaknesses, I think, is the textbook other universities use books with much more vocabulary, and I feel I would be better able to express myself with a more official text. (But I don't learn well unless I am under extreme duress so that could just be me.)"

We also met with partners outside of class time to write longer dialogues and present them to class. The teacher had a whiteboard that she used to show us how to write different words. The TA played games with us during language table that were accessible virtually, which was fun and helped us learn to read quickly."
