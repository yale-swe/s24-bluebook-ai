I learned about the flaws of the medical system in treating overweight patients, the racial capitalism that underlies it, and the biases that medical practitioners carry that perpetuate obesity. Through insightful guest speaker, I realized that you can be overweight and healthy! \r\n\r\nPersonally, I also developed a healthier respect for fatone of the most underlooked organs in the body."

                "I loved the way this \"leminar\" course was taught and I thought that it was interesting to hear about. I wished that the course felt more open to other opinions and less similar opinions.",
                "Strengths:\r\n - The assignments and projects, though frequent, encourage students to think critically rather than just rinse and repeat knowledge from class\r\n - The loose deadlines, but firm deadline in the middle, gave students healthy wiggle room\r\n - Guest speakers enriched the syllabus. One piece of feedback is to thoroughly contextualize the speaker before they present to the class.\r\n Weaknesses:\r\n - More delineated times for questions, because I often felt that they bled into the lecture a lot and sometimes only served the speaker given the very accessible nature of fat"

The content and projects are interesting but if you do not do the readings or work to engage with the content, it can feel like you're just going through the motions and I don't think it will be worth it to take the class. The class is a leminar format and quite large for a class of this nature, so sometimes it can feel that your contributions or ideas were not really valued or heard because the professors are trying to get to everyone.",

It is very accessible to a range of disciplines, as it deals with broad societal issues of fatphobia and human health that involve all of us.",
