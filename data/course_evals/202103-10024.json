                "Strengths: having a community to struggle through the thesis with !!! + tangible research skills readings etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: having to have a prospectus + adviser two weeks into the semester was quite a steep ask... giving an extra week or two might have helped me choose a more daring project rather than defaulting to a more readily imaginable one due to time crunch panic",
                "My main feeling about this course is that it's generally great but that if you are doing a creative project instead of an essay, it isn't really \"built\" for you. The course is really geared towards students who are writing traditional research papers, which makes sense because that is the majority of students. However, if you are working on a creative project, you feel a little confused/behind/unsure of how to handle your work. I think Amstud should have either two separate courses for people working on essays and people working on projects OR they can be taught in the same course using different syllabi/timelines/deadlines."
