                "It was difficult to balance both writing, researching, and the smaller weekly assignments. For example, I didn't use many of the sources I mentioned in my initial literature review. I wish there were more writing milestones instead of the other assignments. I think having a midpoint (10 pages by Thanksgiving break) or smaller writing milestones in between could be really helpful for students. Our mentors advised us to keep writing small chunks throughout the semester, but it was difficult to find that time in addition to the other assignments and responsibilities we have. I think that providing more structured writing goals could really help students especially during the last push of finals seasons. I loved the small group format and appreciate how friendly and supportive my fellow students were. It was also nice to hear everyone's projects at the end of the semester. Lastly, I think the initial presentations were a bit intimidating (esp. for week 1) and think that a midpoint presentation might give students more time to structure their thesis topic.",

                "Flexible small group time meetings based on the needs to the people in the group. Good virtual engagement! Maybe some ideas for helping students connect outside of scheduled class times, connecting students who are working on similar topics. Prof. Park did a great job with reminders and being clear about assignments and expectations. The fact that there were so many professors was also an amazing experience and I am so grateful for the engagement of all of the EVST senior colloquium professors.",
