                "The course was very strong overall and the professor's ability to reproduce what was being taught helped with understanding. One comment I have is that the course definitely needs to advertise using a virtual piano (or physical if available) more as this was something I found very helpful.",
                "Such a great intro course that focuses on basics and building blocks to developing a mind for music",
                "The course is excellent. Professor Lalli is kind and funny and brilliant. The pace is great; class participation flows easily and naturally. Homework for each class can get a little heavy\/ tedious in terms of worksheets but Professor Lalli was receptive to feedback and made some of these optional. But a lot of people ended up doing all of them anyway because theyre a great way to practice and reinforce the material in preparation for the exams. You also get very regular feedback on your work so thats great.",
                "I think the way Professor Lalli set this class up was great. The small seminar structure allowed him to build the class around us as a class. He is very knowledgeable and skilled at what he does, and he enjoys doing it",
                "Strengths: the class was very well taught and engaging for it being online. Professor Lalli did his best to make the class as participatory and engaging as possible, which I really appreciated. The class is taught in a very easy to understand format. I learned a lot, and now feel like I have a really good understanding of the basics of music theory.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is mainly just due to the fact that it's online, but obviously trying to tap along to beats and sometimes sing along to music suffered due to zoom lag."

Even given the circumstances I cannot think of flaws in the course's proceedings. It was difficult at times to sing as a group during class because of Zoom's (probably unsolvable) latency problems.",

They allowed for direct feedback in a course where it may be hard to see every single student in class.

Definitely builds up your sight reading, listening, analytical and even singing skills along the way (only the first three are really evaluated, so dont let the singing bit hold you back). Some people in the class will grasp things a little faster\/ slower depending on prior experience with sheet music but Prof Lalli does a great job of keeping everyone engaged and in the loop between class discussion, worksheet feedback, always being available for one-on-onea, etc. ; I suspect everyone was pretty good at the material by the end.",
                "I would definitely recommend! I am not musically gifted in anyway and I felt like I could still keep up in this class! I had to put it a lot of work but it was very rewarding!",
                "Yes. I had a little bit of prior music knowledge, but not very much, and found the class to both be an extremely good refresher for what I already knew, and a great introduction to some of the topics I was less familiar with. Even if I had no previous experience I think I still would have really enjoyed this class. If you're at all interested in music and always wanted to learn about the theory behind it, even if you don't have any experience, I would definitely recommend this course. Prof. Lalli especially makes the course really fun and enjoyable."
