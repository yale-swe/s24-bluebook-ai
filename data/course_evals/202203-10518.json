                "I got some further insight into music theory and was able to see music in a new light. This class did well combining the aspects of music with mathematics and could be interesting for both STEM or humanities majors.",
                "Set theory applied to chords and groups of notes, both under the chromatic and diatonic scale; relations between Pythagorean tuning, just intonation, equal temperament; voice leading in 2-note/3-note space; discrete math applications",
                "I learned a lot about how music theory and mathematics are connected. Learning from Professor Cohn, who is currently writing a textbook all about this topic, was a really cool experience.",
                "Tools of mathematics applied to various concepts in music",
                "I gained knowledge on combining math with music and the different applications of math.",
                "I learned about mathematical structures that underlay music. We studied how music is connected to subjects like number theory, combinatorics, and topology.",
                "How to represent musical concepts using mathematical models, set theory, graph theory.",
                "I learned really abstract math concepts about musical \"space\" which sounds cool but its a lot less interesting than it appears to be.",
                "The highlights of the course are a series of relationships between fundamental concepts in music theory (meter, chordal harmony, tuning systems) and mathematics (set theory, number theory, basic topology). Both math and music are taken seriously, but the content remains accessible enough that no prior experience is strictly necessary in either field. I'm interested in math and music, but I'm not majoring in either field. Coming away from the class, I feel I have a much stronger understanding of both than I did 12 weeks ago, and I am more able to notice and curious about parallel threads between other related fields.",
                "This class gave me a new way to think about chords and relationships between chords. Math is usually an easier subject for me to understand, so changing the way I interpret a chromatic scale, for instance, by using numbers helps me think of keys and chords more efficiently. This class also taught us different structures of tuning, which as an instrumentalist was quite eye opening. Finally, I learned a little bit about set theory which I found enjoyable.",
                "The Mathematics of Music provides a fascinating view into the underlying geometric and topological structures hidden within music, most of which youd never have the opportunity to learn from a standard music theory class. The problem sets were interesting and provided great opportunities to solidify and apply what we learned in class. I honestly wish there was a second semester sequel to this class.",
                "I improved my quantitative skills around music.",
                "This course applies math skills in set theory, modular arithmetic, and graph theory to the field of music theory, covering topics such as tuning theory, chord theory, and voice leading. It gives interesting perspectives on music and why we create music the way we do. It focuses on the western musical canon mostly, but branches slightly into other traditions as well.",

                "The course is very interesting and well-presented. The problem sets follow well from the lectures and the assignments are usually interesting. The textbook presentation format is not ideal, but it is still easy to understand.",
                "This course, while it did provide me with some interesting insights, ultimately failed to grasp my full attention except for a few rare (and random) instances. As much as it pains me to say it, I feel like this course was a huge letdown. Both mathematics and music are strong suits of mine, yet I failed to maintain any interest during lectures. The frequent redundancy throughout the course curriculum makes it tempting to zone out for a moment or two, yet suddenly new course material will be taught.",
                "Definitions and ideas felt a bit too contrived and niche, it felt like some mathematical connections were forced and it wasn't emphasized why it was particularly interesting or mattered",
                "I really liked the format of the problem sets which were super connected to the content learned in class and the corresponding textbook notes. I wish there were more projects where we had more chances to explore the topics deeper rather than just problem sets.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, cool to see the intersection of math and music\r\nWeaknesses: psets are on the longer side",
                "it tends to over complicate simple music theory concepts. i recommend incorporating more musical elements into understanding these mathematical ideas to keep students more engaged.",
                "I think some of the points were interesting and some not as much. I think if more of the content was applicable to direct musical examples, it would be much more engaging.",
                "Strengths: the problem sets tied in very well with the material we learned and the professor and TAs were all approachable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the problem sets were not released at regular intervals. There were also numerous corrections being made after each pset was released, which was somewhat inconvenient.",
                "The material taught in the course was very interesting, and there was an effort to make a connection between the mathematical concepts and the musical concepts. The professor and teaching assistants were also very receptive to answer any questions. However, the material was sometimes taught in a way that was confusing, and it was very difficult to complete assignments without seeking extra help.",
                "It would be awesome if the class discussed music more. Its a lot of abstract math that's never actually used in music.",
                "The greatest achievement of this course is to make pretty subtle and advanced concepts intuitively accessible to students who are not deeply experienced in the typical \"prerequisite\" material. Professor Cohn has done a remarkable job of presenting concepts clearly and directly without sacrificing nuance or rigor. If you're interested in the material but questioning your experience (as I was), I can't emphasize enough that by attending lecture and reading the (relatively short) course materials, you will be well-prepared for the problem sets and final exam.",
                "Strenghts: professor and TAs are a very laid back group of people. They teach us new things, they allow us to offer different perspectives on how we see the course material, and sometimes they teach each other things right in the middle of lecture. I'd also say they do a great job of helping students when there is a disconnect. Finally, only students who found the course to be interesting signed up, so the class discussion is often enthusiastic!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The office hours are at competitive times (meaning that you're likely to have a meeting or a class during these office hours), which imposes a barrier to being able to get help. Additionally, the content is so unique that the textbook is still being developed by the prof. so if you have a serious concept question and you can't go to office hours, it's going to be hard to find someone who can help you immediately.",
                "Professor Cohn and his work is the great strength of this class. You learn about fascinating relationships youd probably never have the chance to learn about in a standard music theory class (whens the last time your music professor taught you about orbifolds or the ways seventh chords can be plotted on a tesseract?) Honestly, the only way I can think of improving this class is by letting more people take it (I think there was an enrollment cap) because I wish more people had the opportunity to learn from Professor Cohn.",
                "More office hours and guidance from professors.",
                "The course lectures are very good, with the professor and two TAs collaborating to give their different perspectives on the material. Office hours from both the TAs and the professor were very helpful for homework assignments. Two things I think could be improved are the homework assignments themselves and the textbook. The homework assignments were occasionally somewhat vague, incorporating material we had not yet studied. The textbook is still in the process of being published, and therefore has a few typos and organizational problems.",
                "Very interesting content. Teacher and TAs were useful and helpful. It would have been interesting and felt more relevant if more of the mathematical concepts were directly related to music in class. The math was quite difficult to understand from someone who is a lot more music- savvy than math. The course was very interesting overall."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, if you're interested in music theory (especially as a non-music major) I would recommend taking this. Note that this is primarily a music theory class. There is a math focus, but math is very simple and is really just used as a tool to explain certain music theory concepts. For a math-oriented person, this is likely to be a very good and relatively easy way to learn about certain aspects of music theory in a pretty intuitive way.",
                "Not unless they are very passionate about repetition. Not only is the course curriculum designed in such a way that you are re-learning things each lecture, but problem sets are often filled with questions that require hours of tedious repetition of the same things over and over again. It was a very frustrating way to learn, and often just left me more confused.",
                "I'd recommend if you're looking for a Hu credit that only has problem sets and no essays/actual writing. It'd be helpful to enter the class already knowing basic music theory since concepts do get confusing sometimes; for STEM majors the math isn't difficult but more about memorizing definitions or terms and being able to apply them.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in math and music, this course will make connections which are creative and unique. I greatly enjoyed it and the new understanding of music that it gave me.",
                "Yes! It's a great QR humanities mix and a great class to take alongside classes with higher workloads.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the intersection of math and music",
                "only if you have a strong background in mathematics, particularly sets and other areas emphasized in this course. i would not recommend this course to any humanities major looking for an easy QR.",
                "I would say yes, take this course if you are really interested in discrete math and music theory. However, be warned that there is a considerable learning curve in the course and that collaboration on problem sets is not allowed.",
                "I would recommend this course if a student has a strong background/interest in both math and music, as the class is a bit difficult without this.",
                "Absolutely not. I took this class bc I like music and I thought it would be a cool way to get my QR credit. Big mistake. I had such a terrible time in this class, I did not learn anything about music. If you're really into music AND math it's probably cool but still there's very little interesting about the class. Believe the reviews, it's really dry and unengaging. Get your QR somewhere else.",
                "This is my favorite course I've taken in my four years here. The only regret I have is that I didn't take it sooner. If you're interested in the questions raised by the syllabus and you can make room on your schedule, please take this course. Especially if you can take it with Professor Cohn, I can't recommend this strongly enough. I've been a musician for as long as I can remember, and this course has helped me to answer questions I've been asking literally since I was six years old.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has a pretty good handle on music theory, and is interested in taking a course in number/set theory. If you come in without knowledge of music theory, the expectation is that you self study the requisite information during the first month of class. Trying to immediately apply it to the evolving math concepts might be difficult, but commitment and interest will bring you a long way. Additionally, the problem sets can be very time consuming, but they are often so much fun.  In short, yes, to someone who is truly engaged and enjoys the material.",
                "Definitely! Coming from someone whos incredibly interested in both math and music, this is truly an incredible course that opened my mind to new ways of thinking. The problem sets were interesting and provided great opportunities to solidify and apply what we learned in class. I honestly wish there was a second semester sequel to this class.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! I am a math and physics major, so I took this course to fulfill a humanities requirement, which worked out really well. I would also recommend this course to humanities majors, but I would say that the math, while certainly easier than that in MATH courses, is not all that easy.",
                "Yes, it opened my eyes to a new realm in music theory. Id recommend if you have a strong math ability."
