                "STRENGHTS: The professors are very knowledgeable, kind, passionate, and teach well. The skills taught in this class are also very useful and have important real-world applications. The professors and TAs are all very responsive to questions and emails. WEAKNESSES: Coding in MATLAB was often times difficult because we did not have much practice yet we were expected to know how to use it for our PSETs. Although the topics we covered in class were interesting, the lectures themselves were sometimes not very interesting and difficult to follow.",
                "I really liked how the course was set up. The problem sets were tough, but manageable. The final was especially tough, but doable. I liked that there were no in-class exams or quizzes. It took off some of the stress but the frequent exercises forced you to keep up with the material.",
                "It is well structured.",
                "Strengths: Very informative and logical, very useful in terms of MATLAB and model analysis. Teachers are really friendly and being very nice to everyone, and all instructors involved were highly responsive and answer questions efficiently.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe a bit hard for those who did not learn ODEs previously. Readings are sometime not provided in time, which is kind of impeding me from understanding everything during the lecture--rather, I have to read the readings after the lecture to catch up.",
                "Strengths: I think the TAs and professors were very helpful in answering questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of the topics could be made more interesting other than doing equations on the board or going through a paper.",
                "Strengths: The class starts slow and builds up on itself gradually. Both the professors are extremely caring and will take the time to answer questions after class. The TAs are also super responsive. The point of the class is to end up with a toolkit for mathematical modelling and the canvas page was organized in a manner so that one could treat it like that, with all the slides, papers, and codes in one place\r\nWeaknesses: Different kinds of assignments in canvas would be created in random times, instead of having a fixed system for that.",
                "Strengths: TFs are AMAZING. Gustavo was so accommodating and committed to helping students with their problem sets over email or during office hours. He's awesome. Additionally, I liked that the board notes were posted on the canvas because the slides were at times disorganized so that really helped.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times the content could get confusing which made some of the p-sets confusing. The content is cumulative so if you're lost for one unit you're done for the next few units.",
                "The class had really cool content overall and I found myself really intrigued by each new topic. I think the format of the class was generally really nice.",
                "A major strength of this class was the format: reasonably-spaced problem sets of an appropriate challenge, low-point exercises to ensure understanding of the relevant material, and a take-home final exam all served to reduce stress while still making sure students understand the material. The professors were also a strong point, as their enthusiasm and familiarity with the material were both very helpful. One downside was the lecture notes\/slides-- while these were posted, they were often incomplete or hard to parse without additional information, and in general could not be used to \"reconstruct\" the lectures for the purpose of studying. While I understand the hesitance to post recordings as this may reduce attendance, if recordings are not posted then improving the slides\/notes would be very helpful. Another (somewhat minor) downside was the pacing-- while I realize that everyone's mathematical background may not be the same, I felt that the course moved a bit slowly in class. Even if the core content stays the same, spending less time on algebra (while still including the full derivations in an improved version of the slides\/notes) and potentially replacing that with additional examples or MatLab content would be more engaging."

                "Yes, because the skills learned in this class are very useful. Being able to model biological systems mathematically and simulate them in MATLAB is very important. However, the concepts are difficult and not easy to learn just by attending class. Time outside of lecture is required in order to truly understand the material, since lectures are very dense and involve lots of calculations and derivations that are difficult to follow while taking notes.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in math and biology and how they intersect. There was a lot more learning ODEs than conceptual biology.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, especially if you enjoy mathematical thinking and analysis. This course requires very basic biological understandings and is great for people who need to do a biology class but are not good with the usual jargon heavy biology lectures.",
                "Yes but only if you like math, matlab and are ready to do some coding. Be prepared to be totally in over your head and make some friends because collaboration was really important. This is definitely not a gut class so if you're just taking it for fun maybe don't.",
                "If you're interested in the modelling of molecular processes and you have a decent background in programming in languages somewhat similar to MATLAB, I'd certainly say the course is manageable and interesting to take.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's an interesting subject, the professors are good, and the course organization makes it relatively low-work and low-stress. Especially for those coming from a less quantitative and\/or computational background, this course is a good way to ease into that while still maintaining focus on a topic with very high biological relevance."
