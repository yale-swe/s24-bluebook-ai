                "I think most people who consider themselves \"a writer\" at Yale have one or two preferred genres among this course's four: personal essay, fiction, poetry, and drama. (I don't personally know anyone who has undertaken coursework in all four, anyways.) I don't intend to say that I in any way doubted the premise of this course, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the time I had \"written my way through all of the genres,\" so to speak, and saw how greatly my grasp of my chosen theme had actually improved. One of Professor Zarin's many morsels of wisdom is that it's necessary for any creative to take hold of a question and turn it, to look at it from a different side, to see how the light hits it differently as it moves. By the third and fourth genres I wrote, I was seeing recurring motifs in my writing that really deepened my thinking on my themein essence, opening my mind to a level beyond what I thought that I *should* be thinking when writing about a chosen topic, and allowing me to draw some really interesting conclusions and associations.",

                "Strengths- fun \"tour\" of literary genres, I especially loved ending with plays.\r\nWeaknesses- really appreciated prof's written feedback on my first assignment, would have loved to have line edits on my other work too.",
                "I would have liked there to be more focus on the craft of each new genre and some guidance as to the conventions of each, rather than solely focusing on the readings. For genres where I had little to no experience, I felt pretty lost as to how to begin and how to fine tune my work.",
                "This course wasnt particularly well structured. Some people got workshopped more than others and there wasnt a lot of guidance in how we should explore the genres. However, Professor Zarin provided a lot of helpful feedback on our writing.",
                "Being made to work outside one's comfort zone is an extremely valuable experience, and I think that writing outside of one's comfort genre is a very effective means of doing this. You'll learn a lot from that structure, and you'll find Professor Zarin's guidance through the process to be immensely helpful. The course's weekly layoutreading one author per week, two excerpts in two different genres concerning the same themewas compelling at first, though its intrigue fizzled out later in the semester as the selections grew very heavy in dramatic scene excerpts and generally seemed to weaken, as though the more impactful selections had been front-loaded in the course. Also, the course's somewhat erratic use of Canvas and email threads was a bit disorganized; there was often confusion regarding whose piece was being workshopped, when and how comments should be submitted, etc.. I think that issue could have been resolved pretty easily with a periodic, centralized Canvas announcement or email decree from Professor Zarin as opposed to the word-of-mouth/grapevine structure that we maintained throughout the semester.",
                "The strength of this course was that we had the freedom to really push ourselves creatively. I think I really grew from being able to sit in the idea of cross-genre writing. Professor Zarin was also a great strength, in that her insights into writing and \r\n\r\nI think the course would have benefitted from more organization -- it would have been great to have a canvas that listed deadlines and when we were each workshoped (or at least who would be workshopped the following week). Also, I think it would have been really helpful to have some portion of class that served as basic instruction for genres we were less familiar with. Even twenty minutes from the time we spent discussing readings would have been quite helpful -- sometimes I felt I was taking a bit of a shot in the dark in the genres I hadn't written in before."

If you're looking to learn how to write in different genres, be prepared to be teaching yourself most of the time. The workshop element is fun, especially if you have a good cohort of students, but the actual writing is pretty unguided.",
