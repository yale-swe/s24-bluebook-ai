She also helped me fine tune the grammar and mechanics of my writing.",

                "I learned about the most common diseases and medical conditions in the context of Spanish culture. I also learned how to write well-composed and grammatically correct short essays and a research essay in Spanish about medical conditions and hot-topic issues in medicine.",

As a pre-med student, this class was particularly helpful in increasing my awareness of health issues within the Spanish-speaking world as well as how to discuss those issues in an insightful \/ informative way. This class also helped me improve my reading comprehension skills, particularly by introducing me to some of the more formal \/ professional jargon used within clinical contexts.",

                "Strengths - relatively easy\r\nWeaknesses - not super interesting or engaging",
                "Strengths: interesting material, feels very applicable to the real world\r\nWeaknesses: lots of homework the first few weeks, not much support\/no office hours",
                "Strengths: environment--the class is very laid back, so I felt encouraged to speak and participate; Profesora Carreras does a great job of encouraging students to speak and helping them when they don't know certain words\/phrases\r\nWeaknesses: content--I sometimes felt like the content was not as intellectually engaging or stimulating as it could have been for an L5 course.",
                "One of the main things that could be done to improve the course is to make it more consistent with the syllabus. In the syllabus, it said we would get two writing assignments per week, but in beginning, there were some weeks when we were getting 4-5 writing assignments, but there were also some weeks when we only got 1-2. A lot of these assignments also kind of felt like busy work. In general, though, Profesora Carreras is pretty generous with grading and provides decent feedback on the assignments.",
                "strengths-- interesting lectures, videos, and readings; easy grading; not too much work; helps to improve your written spanish\r\n\r\nweaknesses-- very little discussion (did not improve my spoken Spanish at all), did not really feel engaged a lot of the time, no chance to practice speaking in class, expensive textbook that was used very little",
                "This class did a good job of encouraging students to think critically about its topics through the homeworks. I thought it was a bit difficult (and intimidating) to participate in the class's lecture format.",
                "This course does not have a heavy coursework but does have weekly deberes (homeworks that can be up to 80 sentences a week). I wish we could have gotten more practice speaking spanish, there was hardly any time to work in works or parters to practice our speaking skills.",
                "The lectures are very chill and the professor prioritizes exploration rather than memorization, which I love.",
                "Strengths: Professor Carreras was amazing, and so understanding of any difficulties relating to schedules \/COVID. The homework was consistent and not burdensome.",
                "Great in all aspects.",
                "The strengths of this class lie within the assignments given. The long writing homework assignments were very helpful. The interactive nature of the class made it very enjoyable and a comfortable environment to speak in.",
                "I loved the lecture and seminar combination style. Many people who wanted to practice speaking go to do so, even in a 50+ student class",
                "Strength: I got a lot out of the weekly writing assignments. They helped me to synthesize what we had discussed that week and practice my writing skills.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures were not very facts based and not super engaging.",
                "I loved this course!  Sra Carreras is a wonderful professor and the content was very engaging.",
                "The course wasnt very interactive and difficult to engage in with practicing speaking Spanish. The course also focused on Spain Spanish or just showed videos in English, making it not representative of all dialects and the majority of Spanish speakers.",
                "I think its a good course but there could definitely be more student involvement and conversations rather than a more lecture style course.",
                "Strength: Gives us the opportunity to write and discuss in Spanish. \r\nWeakness: Could have explored more of the ethical and moral aspects of medicine, not just different diseases.",
                "I think that the class could have a bit more structure, it would be helpful if we grouped illnesses together and focused on one of them at a time. I think a strength of this class is how much feedback we get from our writing assignments. The professor takes the time to give in-depth comments on your writing.",
                "All of the topics discussed in class were very interesting and Dra. Carreras was always a very engaging lecturer and professor. However, I think that this class suffered from being too large (over 30 students). I think this class would have functioned better if it were the size of a seminar.",
                "I enjoyed the group project at the end of the year because it allowed me to better get to know my peers. However, I'd like for there to be more discussions (potentially in smaller groups) throughout the class period.",
                "A strength was the final project and final paper. I think these two assignments were a great way to end the course and were very relevant. A weakness was the required booklet. I think that this was an unnecessary cost and material, as many of the sources could have been found online, so assignments could still be done without this.",
                "I think the main difficulty was a lack on interaction with such a large class size."

                "Yes! Very easy way to get your language requirement out of the way. Haven't taken L1-L4 Spanish, but I've heard those courses are probably more difficult than this one.",
                "yes, it's a very fun class",
                "Yes. Going into this course, I hadn't taken a Spanish class for around 2 years and needed to complete an L5 credit for my language distributional requirement. I had heard that it was a gut, and I was deciding between this and Advanced Spanish Grammar (SPAN 243). I am very happy with my decision. While I initially thought that Advanced Spanish Grammar would be more up my wheelhouse as I had studied a lot of grammar in high school, I have a friend in the class who has significantly more work (that is harder) every week. If you need an easy L5 for Spanish, this is definitely the course. There are no in class exams; your grade is dependent on an end-of-semester presentation, final essay, homework, and participation. Do keep in mind though that it is difficult going in if you have not taken Spanish in a long time. The first few weeks I could barely understand what she was saying (my high school teachers were all Latin American and she is from Spain) and the readings\/homework assignments took me quite a few hours. However, after about a month I got used to it and started to remember a lot of the vocab I had forgotten. She also assigned a lot of homework at the beginning (4-5 2 page essays\/week) and then slowly decreased it in frequency to about (1-2 2 page essays\/week) which was very manageable but overwhelming at first. Also, if you haven't taken Spanish in a while, I highly recommend getting a free tutor through Yale's program. It's super easy to request one; I met with mine for an hour weekly the entire semester, and she was super helpful to get up to speed with a lot of the Spanish I had forgotten and make sure I was comprehending the material properly. Overall, Carreras is a wonderful prof who really cares about her students and is a very sweet lady. I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "If a student is looking for a casual class to fulfill an L5 requirement, then yes. I feel like this class would benefit from a few changes to the curriculum that made it more intellectually engaging and diversified. I also think that the class should be smaller--it felt too much like a lecture and not enough like a seminar.",
                "It depends on what you want to get out of a Spanish course. If you're interested in medicine and\/or want a pretty laid back Spanish class, then go for it. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",
                "Yes. It's pretty fun.",
                "would recommend only to pre-med students or students interested in learning about niche medical jargon in spanish; this class does not help to improve your spoken spanish, only your written spanish (participation and discussion is extremely limited)",
                "Yes. Professor Carreras is very smart and sweet. The workload isn't too heavy and the topics are fun for those interested in medicine.",
                "Yesssss! Professor Carreras is amazing and the assignments are relatively easy.",
                "Yes! Low workload and you learn a lot! Its more of a class about medicine thats taught in Spanish, but I still highly recommend it.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in medicine and have an interest in studying the Spanish language, this is the perfect class for you.",
                "yes it was a great way to learn about the medical field.",
                "Yes absolutely!! Professor Carreras is a gem and she cares a lot about her students!",
                "Yes! Its as engaging as you make it.",
                "Yes, great class to learn about medicine in Spanish",
                "Definitely!!  Anyone looking for a fun L5 Spanish, especially premed students, should take this course.",
                "Probably. Its a good spanish course to help your listening comprehension and also combines the language with medical interests.",
                "Yes, it is not a hard course, and I enjoyed going to class. The feedback on the assignments was helpful and it really improved my writing.",
                "I would, Professor Carreras is a joy to be around and learn from. She does an amazing job motivating her students to speak in class and to feel confident when speaking Spanish.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in improving their Spanish. However, this class would probably only appeal to pre-med students or students interested in public health and\/or health policy.",
