                "I was able to further my Japanese ability. The course specifically focused on learning Japanese while also interspersing bits of Japanese culture which helped to contextualize a lot of the course material.",
                "I continued to develop the ability to express thoughts and ideas, ask questions, read, and listen in Japanese. This semester I became more comfortable expressing longer and more complex thoughts, and learned new grammar structures that allowed to create more nuanced responses."

                "I think the strength of this course was how organized and engaging it was. Although there's not much room for improvement, I wish we had more time to practice coming up with answers on the spot and not on reviewing homework. I also with my TA for clinic was more willing to be strict with my Japanese. Clinic was not as beneficial for me as in past semesters.",
                "Overall, I think this course is very well structured. It certainly moves at a very fast pace, but the way in which we clearly use the textbook and move from lesson to lesson works very well.",
                "Perfect course setting.",
                "The projects were fun.",
                "The class was very good as is! There is a lot of work from time to time, but this is mostly an unavoidable problem in the pursuit of a foreign language, especially one like Japanese.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it meets everyday but was always relaxed and fun. Most of class time is just answering questions, going over the homework, and practicing dialogue. I think this is a strength because language learning takes a long time, and progressing slowly in a low-stress environment helped prevent me from burning out. I think the many skits and speeches we did were also a strength, as they helped get me more comortible presenting in Japanese. \r\n\r\nOne weakness may be that we did not practice formal or academic writing much at all, but honestly this may just not be in important skill at our Japanese level. I expect that as we get to advanced levels writing will become more stressed. Overall this was a great course and I'm not sure there is much I would change."

                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student! Although L4 Japanese is certainly difficult, I think that this course truly allows one to use Japanese on the daily and develop not only as a speaker, but as a learner of Japanese language and society. I would say to students in similar positions to me (heritage speaker, not quite ready for L4 with regards to reading and writing), that if possible, level down.",
                "Yes! The Japanese course here is great!",

                "Yes I would! 4th year Japanese is really exciting because it was when I really started to feel familiar with the language and when I started to be able to express a wide variety of thoughts and Ideas!"
