                "The organization of the course was quite frankly terrible. I took this class in conjunction with Econ 121 (intermediate micro) to ensure I had the mathematical skills needed for intermediate economics, which is how the course was advertised. By the time we got to the concepts relevant to Econ, we were already at the end of the semester, and I had to learn the mathematical concepts of econ individually. Moreover, this course leans heavily towards linear algebra and only touched calculus for 1-2 weeks at the end of the semester.",
                "Very disorganized, hard to know what we were supposed to be learning. The content isn't that hard, but you really cannot rely on class to actually teach the material. You do have to go to class to learn what you're supposed to be learning, though, because there are never slides and no comprehensive list of the material you're supposed to know. It's kind of nice that there are weekly quizzes instead of psets, but still have to do a lot of homework to be prepared for the quizzes. The review sessions are helpful, but basically a necessary third weekly class, and if you can't make it to that you're not in a great position.",
                "I think the class is perfect for learning the math needed for higher level econ classes. The material covers many useful topics, apbeit focusing too much on linear and not enough on calculus. Not needing to  submitting psets was incredible. \r\n\r\nThe professor struggled to explain abstract ideas, and the later ideas in the linear stuff was very over and under explained. Also, these things would have been much easier if some kind of visual explanation was paired with the mathematical one.",
                "I thought the curriculum of this course was very straightforward and enjoyable! It was well-paced, and having weekly homework quizzes (instead of turning in graded psets) forced me to focus on understanding concepts rather than merely regurgitating homework answers, which I personally REALLY enjoyed. Prof. Rosenthal was very accessible, and his optional weekly homework review sessions were incredibly helpful (although lectures were occasionally a bit convoluted/ difficult to follow). Also, there weren't many connections to economics in this class. Although the specific skills we learned are applicable to intermediate micro and beyond, none of the problems we specifically worked on in class were focused on economic topics.",
                "The strengths were that the professor was very passionate about teaching. Furthermore, the material learned was useful. The weaknesses are that sometimes organization was lacking.",
                "- Strengths: Content & introduction to concepts used in econ courses as well\r\n- Weaknesses: don't spend as much time on multivariable calc (more than 3/4 of semester was on linear algebra); would've been helpful to do more calc given that it's what is used in econ courses",
                "Strengths \r\n-Very practical\r\n-Teacher really cares\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Felt rushed at times and the Calculus book was not very helpful",
                "The strength of this course was the weekly quizzes, which made sure I understood the content. The weakness of this course was that the lectures were not very engaging, and I couldn't follow many of the answers that the professor made to questions directed to him by students.",
                "the strengths are that we had a quiz every week, which helped me stay on top of my game and learn the course material in due time. the weakness may be the knowledge gap between students",
                "The course content was good and well calibrated to economics majors maths requirements. The omission of integral calc was perhaps odd. The teaching was generally poor unfortunately. The professor put a lot of effort in but sadly his style is not conducive to good learning. He is impatient with students who dont grasp material quickly, did not have the ability to teach underlying mathematical intuition and misallocated teaching time during the semester such that the calc section was under covered.",
                "Strengths- I really liked Prof Rosenthals teaching style. It helped keep me on track with the pace of the course and the quizzes tested my knowledge frequently. (I found that students who struggled with this teaching style though didnt go to the review sessions or maybe didnt read the book before or during material review. That was key to doing well).\r\nWeaknesses- multivariable part felt rushed and it was hard to get a good footing on it.",
                "Very much disliked the Prof's teaching style. Jumps around from place to place, goes on tangents, overall makes it extremely difficult to follow an otherwise not very difficult subject matter."

This class is a terminal course, meaning it's hard to continue into either math 120 or math 225 afterwards, and I personally wished I had just started with one of those two classes instead of taking 118 (which introduced bits and pieces of topics from both courses). Additionally, although the professor was hilarious and very caring (in a joking manner), I often found myself having to self-teach myself some of the material or attend peer tutor hours to understand fundamental concepts.",
