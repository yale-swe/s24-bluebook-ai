   "comments": [
    "This course provides an introduction to legal studies, a thorough examination of the contract model, the economics of trade, and an analysis of contract law through Mesopotamia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and Rome. One learns the different motivations of contracting and trade depending on renegotiation, legal remedies, enforcement and in situations with transaction insecurity. The course includes a terrific negotiation workshop which was particularly revealing.",
    "I learned a great deal about contract law, ancient legal systems, and economic transactions involving contracting. This course gave a great introduction to the interdisciplinary aspects of economics\/law, while also allowing students to dive into more specific topics.",
    "Economic analysis of contracts concepts",
    "Technical skills in economics and some substantive law.",
    "I learned a lot about the bridge between economic theory and law.",
    "This class allowed me to consider contract law from an economic theory perspective - breaking down the efficiency of different contract remedies was especially helpful to me in my consideration of different remedies. Through this class, I also realised the value and limitations of economic models. \r\n\r\nThis class also allowed me the space to consider my mediation skills. As a law student who is interested in venturing into ADR and international trade, the class was perfect in allowing me to think about the benefits\/drawbacks of ADR, and even allowed me to practice skills that would be required should I venture into the field.",
    "In this course, I learned about the history of contract laws and structuring, and how legal institutions adapt to and are shaped by economic forces like transaction costs. We learned about game theory and used it to analysis the economics of dispute resolution and litigation. We acquired practical negotiating techniques, and we also examined the basics of commercial law under modern common and civil law systems.",
    "I learned about contract law and many things related to it, as well as how economics and law are connected."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Brooks and Yijia Lu are phenomenal--wonderful lecturers, mentors, and instructors. Further, that the course includes ~13 Yalies and ~18 French students from ESSEC and Assas is incredible. The French students are super friendly and took us around Paris--in fact, the class got very close and departure was tough. The guest lecturers are interesting--I particularly enjoyed Professor Manning and Professor Sanga. However, you're debating attending--Professor Brooks and Yijia Lu are reason enough to participate.",
    "Richard Brooks was amazing! Yijia was amazing! Most guest lecturers were incredibly intelligent and interesting. I wish we would have scheduled more visits during the week, but aside from that no complaints!",
    "it would help if we spent more time on the math and perhaps less on the history in the beginning of the course",
    "Professors were very knowledgeable and experienced. Prof Brooks in particular was very well researched.",
    "I wish we had more time to learn the material: towards the end, it felt rushed and was at times hard to follow along.",
    "Unfortunately, this course was extremely theoretical, and I wish we had learned more about how contract enforcement actually happens. In the future, I hope this study abroad experience features more field trips and discusses more real world applications of the content being studied.",
    "The class was an extremely holistic one and we managed to cover a lot of ground - it was fascinating approaching contract law from an economics and historical angle - as a law student, it helped me to see contract from a rather practical perspective as well. \r\n\r\nThe course material provided by Prof. Richard Brooks was also comprehensive and well thought-out \/ well written. The lecture notes that were provided were clear and lucid, and the class discussions that we had were often productive as well. Prof Richard Brooks, Prof. Claudine Desireaux and Prof. Genevieve Helleringer stood out as great lecturers - receptive to the needs of the class and clear in their delivery of the lessons. \r\n\r\nWhile the course was a well thought-out one with a distinct trajectory, I felt that Prof. Richard Brooks could have made the trajectory more clear at the beginning of the course (e.g. what the conclusions of the course would be, talking about the flow we were going to take at the beginning). As we were unsure what the goal of the course was, it was difficult to see how parts of the course would fit together, and the revelation only came in the last session.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I felt that Prof. Richard Brooks could have spent more time explaining the economic model and the math of it. A significant amount of time in the first two weeks were dedicated to talking about different aspects of economic\/legal history and game theory, which were relatively easier to understand in a shorter amount of time. Most of the class struggled with grasping the economic model and the corresponding mathematical formulas as they were learned in a span of two lessons.",
    "This course was great. The readings were good, and most lectures were outstanding. Professor Brooks and his guest lectures were very responsive to questions. I do wish that we had spent more time on practical negotiation skills; that was one of the best parts of the course, and we could have used a few more lessons and practice rounds.",
    "Strengths include the high level of engagement with the professor and TA, as well as the interesting nature of the course. The only real weakness is that much of the material is not tested."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. For one, the course provides an economics credit and the workload is nothing to sweat over. We had 3 problem sets, a short negotiation report, a final exam and interesting reading throughout. However, the opportunity to study in Paris, and with French students was incredible. The teaching staff is really a marvel--big names from Yale, ESSEC, Oxford, and Assas. You certainly do not need a background in contracting or law, but an ease with math may be helpful.",
    "Yes!! Great way to explore Paris while receiving an Economics credit. The faculty is incredibly invested in students' success and are willing to address any\/all questions.",
    "Yes, the experience is a great one and the professor and TA are very great",
    "Yes. The substantive elements were intriguing and the experience was overall very good!!",
    "I would probably recommend this course to another study because of the Paris component. I loved being Paris, and this course was a good way of meeting french students.",
    "For sure! Especially to a student from Singapore who is undergoing legal training, this course certainly complements the knowledge of contract law we have in Singapore. Given the Professors' general receptiveness to discuss and share about their perspectives despite being from other jurisdictions also allows for a more enriching experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. If you invest in it you can learn a tremendous amount, while spending a summer exploring Paris. Additionally, the program includes several worthwhile trips that are included in the course.",
    "Yes; the overall experience was very fun and the course is interesting."
