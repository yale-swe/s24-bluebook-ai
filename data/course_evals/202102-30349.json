                "Improved my Spanish grammar and most importantly learned to appreciate the culture of Peru",
                "I learned about the history and culture of Peru in the context of various art forms (culinary, visual, music, dance, textile, etc.). I developed my reading, writing, and discussion skills by collaborating with other students to learn about interesting examples of the art forms we covered each week. I also improved in conversational skills and learned about Peruvian culture from a unique point of view by speaking with a student from Peru each week. I definitely have a more open mind about the significance of art (and even about how things that I normally don't associate with art can be symbolic) and a better understanding of how global events in history can impact many cultures and traditions today.",
                "Great overview of different aspects of Peruvian culture and to some extent, history.",
                "I learned a lot about Peruvian culture and history, including prehispanic history through cuisine, colonization through visual art, independence through music, and political instability through dance. All of these subsets of history were connected to modern day Peru, and we also learned about textile art and fashion in the 21st century. I also developed a much better fluency and comfort with speaking Spanish."

                "The strength of the course was that it was very interactive and fun. Its weaknesses were that it was a bit disorganized at first, but it got better.",
                "A major strength of the course is the variety of themes. This allowed for the class to feel much less stale and more interesting compared to if it were all about visual art. Another strength of the course is the integration with the PUCP, a university in Peru. This type of connection allows for the interaction with Peruvian culture to feel much less abstract. We had several teachers or associates from the University talk about their field and we got a conversation partner, a student from the university, to talk to for the summer session.",
                "Strenghts: engaging material, included a variety of mediums (listening, reading, discussion, etc)",
                "Strengths: weekly conversations with students from Peru, discussions with invited speakers about the topics we were covering each week, class work in groups to help with understanding/engagement, understanding and encouraging professor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt like I didn't completely understand some terms that were brought up in class assignments/readings, but this might be due to my own lack of historical/artistic background. Maybe it could be helpful to include a short historical background presentation to give an overview of the timeline/meaning of various events that we discuss later in activities. Sometimes I was also not sure when exactly an assignment was due/couldn't check to see what was really planned for the class until it actually started, but I think this was an issue with Canvas hiding some modules/assignments/grades until the day they were scheduled(this got better as the class went on and we realized what was happening). Because of my lack of previous studies in the general material, I also felt a little unsure about how in-depth to research for my project, but Profesora was always willing to answer questions and met with us to give feedback about our first parts of the project. It might be helpful to have more written comments on the rest of the parts throughout the class (I'm not sure I can access this still) as well to understand if we are on the right track in terms of depth of details, but this might be difficult due to the compressed nature of the class. \r\nDespite some technical issues on my end throughout the class, I really enjoyed learning with an enthusiastic professor and nice students!",
                "Strengths: engaging professor, course used different formats (written works, videos, etc) \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not ideal as an online course",
                "The strength of this course was the sheer volume of subjects covered: the whole of Peruvian history taught through the lens of five different types of art was pretty well condensed into 5 weeks, and I ended up getting a lot of insight in a short amount of time. Bringing in guest lecturers was a really valuable way to get a window into the intricacies of some of these subjects and, along with the weekly meetings with conversation partners from Lima, helped a lot with fluency and understanding of the language. The weakness was that the course was disorganized at times (e.g. our syllabus was never correct), with a lot of confusion over assignments and technical difficulties; having a more organized Canvas would definitely improve the course."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! Professor Leon is very kind and will work with you outside of class for any problems you may have with your work. There is also a conversation component in the course, in which you get to talk to a student from the PUCP in Peru. I had a great experience with my conversation partner and learned a lot about the culture of Peru by listening to him describe his everyday life.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. During the summer this course was very manageable and the three hour sessions went by quickly because of the interesting topics covered. Even if the student has no interest in art in the traditional sense, the variety of art explored means something will likely pique their interest.",
                "Yes: the professor has great energy and it is always interesting to learn about another country and appreciate what makes it complex and beautiful",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to work with others to learn about the traditions of Peru while also discovering various historical events that have contributed to the art and culture of Peru (and other countries). I enjoyed having the opportunity to speak with students from Peru once a week and hear about our weekly topics from invited speakers. Although we didn't cover much grammar specifically in class, I felt that my conversational skills improved because of the collaborative nature of the class, covering material that I sometimes had to discuss in informal terms when I wasn't as familiar with the technical/historical background.",
                "If you're looking to learn a lot about Peruvian culture and/or get an L5 language credit done over the summer, I would recommend this class. It's not an insane amount of work (although there's a lot that goes into the project), and the professor was super flexible and accommodating to all skill levels of Spanish (you don't have to be the most fluent speaker to do well in the class)."
