                "Strengths: Shelly and how he organizes his seminars! Some philosophy classes spend a huge amount of time discussing what particular authors think and trying to interpret those textsthis class encourages students to come up with their own, original (or, at least, original to them) thoughts. If this is a new skill to you, I would personally encourage you to take Introduction to Ethics or Normative Ethics with Shelly first, as the learning curve may be quite steep if you haven't engaged in this particular kind of philosophy before.\r\n\r\nBut it is, quite simply, fun. I hardly felt like I was working for this classI enjoyed coming to discussion every week, positing my own ideas, responding to my peers, and the way Shelly could elucidate so well the complex points my peers were making when they were unclear to me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths:\r\nCovered an interesting and, to my mind, pressing question. Attracted students both undergraduate and graduate and both from inside and outside of Philosophy. This improved the quality of discussion and brought home how people with different trainings have different things they find most pressing. Some of the readings were really excellent and felt like I was thinking about really important questions I had never even considered before (or showing why my original position was actually just wrong). Shelly's feedback and willingness to seriously engage with student's ideas both in papers and discussion is of course a highlight, as he pushes you to really take a non-trivial position and then he rips into you to make sure you actually have some support for your position.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis was the first time this course was taught, and I think this led to some sub-optimal scheduling. Certain weeks felt like there was less to say about, whereas others felt like we could have productively kept talking for way longer. I expect if the class is taught again some changes will be made which will mitigate this, but also part of it is just what I found interesting (so to that extent the issue will persist). A part of any Shelly Kagan class is the stress of having to present your ideas to him only to have him shoot them down, a process which can be quite discouraging (so be warned), but on the other hand this is really a plus as it forces you to think more seriously about the issues and not just coast through.",
                "Taking an ethics seminar with Shelly is always an intense and rewarding experience. It was very satisfying to get to explore a new area of the ethical literature on a certain problem with Shelly. Like many a philosophy seminar, the conversation is sometimes monopolized by a small number of students, which is annoying but not a dealbreaker.",
                "Lots of engagement in the seminar. It's very student-driven -- but I suppose sometimes that led us into unproductive paths of discussion. Maybe could use more guidance from the professor, but not much."

                "Yes! Be warned that for a Shelly class, there is a substantial amount more reading, but that's to be expected in what I believe is the highest-level course he teaches. The amount of reading is still on par with other lower-level philosophy classes, and, I imagine, less than other upper-level courses, but if you have taken other courses with him it may still be helpful to know when setting your schedule to expect a bit more reading. \r\n\r\nBut this is a fantastic course that anyone with interest in ethics should take.",
                "There's not much I can say about Shelly Kagan that's new. The course and his instruction are incredibly well done. He is truly at the top of his field as a philosopher. If you take this course, you will learn. But you will not do well academically. Your work will compared at least to much more experienced graduate students and at most to established philosophers with much more space and information to make their arguments. If you care about your GPA less than philosophy, I would recommend taking this course. If you want to learn about long-term ethics without sacrificing your chance at graduate school, you may be better served to simply peruse the reading list.",
                "Yes, but make sure you come in knowing how tough Shelly's criticism can be.\r\nThe class covers a topic which could be of potentially overriding concern, and it is not clear to me what the right take on the issue is. Given these two facts, it is pretty important to sit down and carefully think about the issue, and this class is probably one of the best possible ways to do that with other people who care about about the topic (there is obviously some self-selection in who chooses to take the course). The class introduces you to more nuanced understandings of several interesting sub-questions in ethics, and also forces you to seriously engage with that material since otherwise the papers you write won't be any good. The opportunity to thus have your ideas critiqued by Shelly is pretty special, just be ready for harsh criticism if he thinks your papers\/ideas warrant it.",
                "Absolutely, as long as you've done some non-trivial work with ethics in the past. It was so rewarding to get to explore a big, unresolved question in ethics with Shelly. The topics of population ethics and longtermism are truly baffling, and it is worth taking this class to see just how difficult it is to find satisfying answers to the hardest questions in ethics. As with many philosophy classes, the conversation is sometimes dominated by a small number of students which is annoying, but not a dealbreaker.",
