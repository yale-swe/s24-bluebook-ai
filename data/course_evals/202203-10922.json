                "A standard overview of computational complexity: beginning computability theory, the time and space hierarchies, polynomial hierarchy, P vs NP, more on completeness, logspace computation, circuit complexity, probabilistic computation, interactive proofs. We also had one amazing lecture at the end of the semester on Kolmogorov complexity, which was a welcomed extra lecture because it's hard to find good explanations of it. The psets were also very well put together and a perfect balance of challenging but not impossible; they introduced new topics and had us prove some really interesting things.",

                "I think complexity theory is fascinating, and this was one of, if not the best CS class I've taken at Yale. We began from turing machines\/computability, then talked about most of the common complexity classes, and ended with some more advanced topics (randomized algs, interactive proofs, etc.)",
                "You learn about different complexity classes and the relationships between them (beyond just P and NP that you see in Algorithms classes). You also learn a bit about undecidability, Kolmogorov complexity, and some other additional topics.",

                "The structure of the course is great.\r\nThe course is a little bit hard for me.",
                "I loved this course! Dylan McKay is an amazing professor, and he's very knowledgeable about the subject. I was always super excited to come to lecture, and every lecture was on a different interesting topic. I have no major complaints.",
                "Dylan McKay is awesome. My only critique would be to include a syllabus containing a tentative schedule of what will be covered each day. Uploading the slides to Canvas for the later lectures was also really helpful.",
                "The course is well-structuredit is fast-paced and dense, but Dylan is an excellent lecturer and I found all the topics and lectures interesting and engaging. No major weaknesses, though a (provisional) list of lecture topics and the corresponding textbook sections would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Prof. McKay is a great teacher, he puts a lot of care into how he presents the material\/structures class (discussions, examples, humor)\r\nWeaknesses: No syllabus before end of add-drop period (although this was his first time teaching at Yale).",
                "The explanations of different topics in class were clear. However, there were sometimes issues with the homework assignments, like us not learning the necessary material in class before the homework assignment was due.",
                "This course is very balanced, I like how lectures avoid the low-level details to favor understanding and intuition and then assignments force students to challenge themselves and fill in those details. Another strength of the course is the instructor, Dylan is very passionate about complexity and great at promoting interaction with students. His intuition is also excellent, which is inspiring and motivating to engage with the material. One weakness of the class is the use of slides, I personally prefer board-style lectures, but this is not all negative because it is also nice to have material to go over later. I would also prefer more explicit references to the textbooks before each lecture to guide the student's self study.",
                "Course contents are very useful.\r\nCould be good if the last couple of classes can be on the topics that are suggested\/selected by students."

If you don't know what CS theory is but enjoyed algorithms, I would strongly recommend taking this class, or at least shopping it to see if it's something you might be interested in.",
                "Yes, if\r\n1) You like Math\/CS theory\r\n2) You have space in your schedule (for me, the class had pretty dense workload - the psets are not easy, although they are well spaced out) \r\n3) Have some exposure (Turing machines, P vs NP) - the course moves pretty fast so it's good to be comfortable with the basics.",
                "It is a good idea to take the course if you're interested in Theoretical CS. Also, consider how much time you have during the semester. Some problems on the problem sets took a lot of time to figure out, and most problem sets took a long time to write up.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is definitely a challenging course and subject, but it is also rewarding. Any computer scientist should see the beautifully elegant mathematical foundations of the field given by complexity theory, and this is the course for that.",
