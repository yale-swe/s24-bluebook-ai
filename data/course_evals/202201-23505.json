It also was a really fantastic way to reinforce my learning in other intro science classes I took concurrently (intro bio and chem). Gained insights into how scientists think and work in their fields; it felt really valuable to get the perspectives of so many different experts.",

                "This class provided a broad overview of many areas of science that are currently being researched. I was able to gain very basic literacy in a wide variety of topics, ranging from stem cells and cloning to GMOs, viruses, exoplanets, and cosmology.",
                "By taking this course, I learned the importance of exploration in college. Although many of the material covered in this course did not necessarily implicate my major, I learned how to be willing to learn and explore areas beyond my academic interests and apply this skill elsewhere during my time at Yale."

                "I think the main strength is the variety. The instructors are all nice and accomplished. Having Professor be present in all of the classes was cool. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course was differences in difficulties. Some sections were much harder, or lectures much more advanced than others. The grading was also a weakness. I don't like how 60% of the class got an A-. My grade was above a 93, but the curve dropped me backwards? Not a fan.",
                "Strengths - Varied and changing topics and professors\r\nWeakness - High level of pre-requisite information required for some of the topics. Final topic required massive understanding of biology that I lacked",
                "A strength is definitely Professor Kankel. He served as a sort of course director, although he also taught two modules  he is extremely kind and understanding, and does a great job fostering an environment where non-STEM majors feel encouraged to participate and arent intimidated by technical jargon or lacking background knowledge.",
                "This course was well-structured in that there wasn't a huge time commitment required of students, and most of the time spent on this course was revisiting material, rather than studying for tedious assessments. I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of this class, since it was a nice way to wrap up my week. My biggest suggestion would be to diversify the modules presented. Although I really enjoyed most of them, it would be nice to have fewer biology-related modules and more modules in other areas, such as engineering."

                "Yes! it was so interesting. Dr. Kankel is really nice, and it was truly a pleasure to learn about so many different topics that are so relevant to the trajectory of society, the world, and the Universe as a whole.",
                "Would recommend - a relatively low-pressure way to explore several interesting and relevant science-related topics.",
                "I would reccomend this class to people moderately interested in science, and looking to fulfill their science requirement. It was a fun class I and appreciated having a constant between first and second semester.",
                "Yes, I think this is good course for non-science majors as a introduction to a variety of science topics.",
                "Yes! I built a close relationship with all of the people in my class. It was an experience for all of us, both academically and socially. The information had sections that would interest everyone.",
                "Yes! Professor Kankel is extremely nice, the modules are generally super interesting (e.g., Ive talked about what Ive learned with people outside of class several times), and the workload is very reasonable (there also arent any high-stress exams, which is very nice). \r\n\r\nI also really like the concept of this course. Im very grateful that I was able to learn about so many different cutting-edge topics in an accessible way, which is an opportunity I probably would not have had in any other class. Overall, I recommend it very highly.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, both science and non-science majors, since this course covered useful baseline knowledge in so many different areas and helped me explore some of my interests not related to my major. This course conveniently fit into my schedule and was one that I really enjoyed taking as my first-year seminar."
