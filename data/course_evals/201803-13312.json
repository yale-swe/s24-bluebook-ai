    "I have learned a lot about reading scholarly papers, understanding classical texts, and gaining a background in classics.",
    "In this class you read different versions of the Oedipus myth and evaluate and compare them. It was a really great way to learn how to better analyze works of literature, pieces of art and films. Professor Kraus is great and makes the class fun and engaging.",
    "Analytical insight into classical and modern version of the Oedipus myth, greater understanding of the western literary tradition.",
    "What being a myth entails; the universality of the Oedipus story; how to analyze plays",
    "I learned a lot about the myths surrounding the semi-historical figure of Oedipus, especially when it comes to the sheer volume of different adaptations. I learned how to compare the adaptations to one another, as well as learned how to discuss literature in the lenses of psychology, sociology, and history.",
    "I learned oh so much about Oedipus! I  feel like a more cultured individual after taking this course."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths: the texts are engaging and the scholarly papers help to better study the ancient works, professor Kraus is a very engaging teacher\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses: the class, which I hoped would teach how to write at a college level was not at all focussed on writing, Professor Kraus sometimes became tangential",
    "This was an amazing class- the only flaw came in the form of the discussion sometimes bleeding into lecture (sometimes this was intentional, which is fine). I recommend there be some sort of assessment on a given reading to ensure students have read the material. If many haven't, it's not really worth discussing it in class.",
    "Strengths: the readings were not overwhelmingly long and were usually engaging, the writing assignments were enjoyable to complete\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were difficult to comprehend, making discussion difficult",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and I had a blast reading and discussing each of the plays and stories. I think the breadth of the class adds a lot, as you read from authors from antiquity to the modern day. This course can really appeal to anyone of any major, and I think the wide array of ways we viewed each of the readings helped bring in interest from the entire class. The only weakness I saw was that we didn't always have enough time to discuss as many aspects of each story as I would've liked, but other than that this was a fantastic class.",
    "The class discussions were always fantastic. I  enjoyed answering the generally broad essay questions as well as engaging with each of the texts.",
    "This course exposed me to a much greater variety of texts than I anticipated given that the basis of the class is on one myth. The iterations of the Oedipus myth that have been created since the Sophoclean version is truly staggering. One of the greatest strengths of this course is the breadth it manages to fit within a class clearly focused on depth. The class was also approachable for students of any background, and while some knowledge of myth was helpful, it was not necessary given the thoroughness of the class discussions.",
    "Strengths include that the reading schedule was not unbeatable and in fact for in quite nicely with the work from the other courses I was taking, that the professor always took the time to give really thoughtful and helpful criteria and suggestions to the students, and that the small class site made the discussions personal and gave each student an amazing opportunity to learn by participat I on and contribution. Disadvantages include the lack of time to explore world's other than those concerning Oedipus Rex and the lack of enough time to discuss everything wanted."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but not as a freshman seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to take a great first year seminar. It is a super interesting class and a very unique topic.",
    "Absolutely! This course was fun and challenging, though could definitely fit into a schedule with other rigorous courses. It demanded focus, but the dynamic of the classroom was really fun!",
    "I think this is one of the best first-year seminars one could take, as the content is super interesting and the professor, Dr Kraus, is amazing. I really enjoyed the readings (which don't take up too much time) and the essays (which are also not time-consuming). If you're looking for a fun interesting course first semester, this is the one for you.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this class because it allows the student to compare one soak across different authors, thus looking at literature in a different way than would otherwise be done."
