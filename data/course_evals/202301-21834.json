I definitely grew as a writer in this class, and really enjoyed thinking about the ways each of the books we read has been \"problematic\" for readers and reviewers since its publication. The class discussions with Professor Yeazell and Colton were always thought provoking and engaging, and I gained a new appreciation for some books I'd read before, as well as discovering others I hadn't.",

            "comments": [
                "This was one of the best courses I've taken during my time at Yale!  Seminar discussions about power, femininity, and social custom were some of the best I've had, and each of the books were worth multiple reads in their own rights.  I looked forward to every day I had class.",
                "This was a really amazing class. I looked forward to it every time, and had a blast in each discussion. The reading load *can* get heavy (they warn you about this day one!) but it's mostly manageable, although the last book pushed me a bit with some readings close to 150 pages needing to get done between Monday and Wednesday. The writing requirement is just three papers, but they are not easy papers to write. However, if you make use of the instructor office hours they are definitely doable - they are willing to workshop ideas with you and discuss drafts as well, so really helpful. There are a number of curated secondary sources made available to you, and you can also bring in ones of your own if you find them. Overall, great class!",
                "The greatest strength was certainly Prof. Yeazell and Colton's expertise and excellent teaching. Beyond that, the biggest strength of the course was the quality of the discussions. It was really amazing to take in everyone's brilliance, even when it felt a little overwhelming. \r\nThe reading load was higher than any course I've taken here, but no weaknesses.",
                "Both instructors were immaculately prepared. Excellent discussions. Excellent feedback on written work.\r\n\r\nTry to get through Woman in White in a week? Or nix it. I felt it wasn't of the same order as the other novels on the syllabus and consequently the discussions weren't quite of the same quality. \r\n\r\n4 weeks on Bleak House also felt a little much. It's not actually that much longer than Middlemarch which can be done in 3. That would adds in space to get another 3 week novel in place of Woman in White, or even two shorter novels (1.5 weeks each)",
                "Strengths: the texts were interesting and important; Professor Yeazell and Colton had great chemistry and the class was quite engaging. Weaknesses: this class is A LOT of reading (which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for)! I found that the papers were also a bit restricting, with prompts being centered around a review of the literature. The two papers were quite short and then the final paper was very long which I found to be slightly jarring. That being said, the feedback from the professors was very thoughtful",
                "I absolutely loved the four novels we read for this course. Professors Yeazell and Valentine did an excellent job of co-teaching the course by alternating who lead the seminars. I occasionally wished that discussions could be more grounded in the texts; my favorite seminars were the ones when our professors came in with a key passage or two, and we expanded outward from there. The Bleak House screening and Beinecke visit were wonderful additions to the course. As far as assignments go, I particularly enjoyed interacting with Victorian critics in the Villette paper and might have enjoyed the second short paper more if it had focused on Victorian rather than modern criticism.",
                "This course is a lot of work but well worth it to be in such an engaging and interesting learning environment.",
                "srengths: the books were well chosen, written by popular authors but not works I had read before \r\nweaknesses: the high reading load was difficult to manage at times, even though we received warning of that at the beginning",
                "Strengths - Prof. Yeazell & Colton were AMAZING. Great co-teaching pair, and they facilitated amazing discussions. Weaknesses - a lot of reading",
                "If you don't like the books being discussed it's not great, if you do it's wonderful",
                "I think this course was well-structured and taught and the classroom discussions were thrilling. At times I would have desired a bit more feedback or assistance on papers.",
                "Both Colton and Professor Yeazell were very knowledgeable. They took it in turns to lead the class, which worked well enough."

                "Yes!  Victorian literature is a fairly underrated literary time period.  It definitely doesn't get as much attention as other eras might, but this course made me fall in love with all the authors and characters on the page!  You learn to read, but also to notice--we spent so much time in class discussing character foils, triangulations, and all the fascinating patterns that novelists weave into the pages.",

There's a lot to talk about, since they are \"problem\" novels, and the class discussion was always the best part of my day.  Do be ready for some heavy reading though.",
                "Absolutely. If you have an interest in Victorian literature, take this course!!",

                "Absolutely! Everyone seemed to love the four novels we read in this course. If you're willing to put in the time to do the readings (around 120 - 150 pages per class), it's worth it.",
                "Yes. This course is challenging with the workload and the level of engagement expected from students, but definitely worth taking. The professors were excellent and gave very helpful feedback.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in the material! Its a lot of reading but very intellectually rewarding.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the subject matter and were prepared to undertake a large workload. This course has a lot of reading and many of the novels are very complex. I think for students who are ready to undertake a challenge it is a worthwhile course, but I would recommend people do not take the workload lightly.",
