   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: well-organized, professor Koleske is great, all information made accessible through Canvas, straightforward policies, discussion in lecture\r\nWeaknesses: course moves fast so prior knowledge\/AP Biology are in a way prerequisites to really do well, no feedback on homework unless you do well on an assignment",
    "This course is very well organized. The weekly quizzes, though tedious and perhaps a little stressful, were critical for me in keeping up with the material which made the overall learning process a lot smoother. I do think, however, that the material covered in class was sometimes explained poorly so that without a prior background in biology, it would be difficult to keep up.",
    "Weekly quizzes are a great way to ensure that everyone is studying\/learning\/mastering the material at roughly the same rate throughout the duration of the course. The only weakness of this course was that quizzes, which make up over a third of the grade for the course, were handed out willy-nilly in a large auditorium 5 minutes before class every Monday, and students would continue to look at their notes\/electronic devices after having received their quiz. Students were encouraged to write their names on the front of the quiz and circle their section number then flip the quiz over, but many would scan the first page of the quiz and then look up something in their notes or online. There may not be a solution to this other than ensuring that everyone puts everything away before any quizzes are handed out.",
    "I think the weekly quizzes are great because they helped enforce the content and did not make studying for the final that hard.",
    "This course was taught very well, but at some points it was difficult to understand what was important to remember and what wasn't.  I really enjoyed learning very specific mechanisms of the body to illustrate larger concepts, but I also found it difficult to study for quizzes sometimes because it was unclear in how much detail we needed to know certain facts.",
    "A strength of the course is the many opportunities for students to show what they have learned through the combination of quizzes, homework, and discussion sections. A weakness is the large size of the lecture can make it less engaging, although Professor Koleske was a good lecturer and always kept students involved in the lectures.",
    "I really liked the organization with the study guides and lecture slides - made it very clear what to study, what to bring to each class. What could be improved would be having less quizzes. I liked having the quizzes because it forced me to keep up with studying, but maybe bi-weekly instead of weekly would be nice, because I was constantly stressed about biology.",
    "Overall, the course is very well-organized, with the grading divided into many areas, and the discussion sections helping to emphasize concepts that come up over and over again. The weekly quizzes keep you on your toes. The homework did the same but didn't seem to quite match the lectures; sometimes we'd learn the relevant material after completing the homework. The provided powerpoints are very clear and not too overwhelming. Sometimes it felt like class was mostly just reading what was on the slides though.",
    "The course was very organized, and the logistics were explicitly stated at the beginning. For example, I liked having the slides for the lecture available before the class so that I could print them out and take notes on them. The professor was engaging and made learning biology fun! I don't think there are any major weaknesses.",
    "A strength of this course was that we were given much help and advice in terms of how to succeed in this class, including how to stay on track. A weakness was the lack of interaction between the Professor and students in the class (but that goes for all lecture courses). Also, the weekly quizzes were worth so little points that they were very stressful, and making a small mistake could bring our grade down dramatically.",
    "I wish this course could be taught in a smaller setting, I found it hard to learn in the lecture environment.",
    "I felt that material was briefly brushed over and that  the course emphasized breadth over depth. For me, the course was manageable because I had taken AP bio in the past, but without that background I think it would have substantially more challenging. For example, the class spent a few minutes discussing super important topics like signal transduction and transmembrane transport, and while we were never required to know more than what was covered for the tests, I felt like the course wasn't touching on a lot of critical topics in detail. By that I mean more of the specific step by step reaction mechanics of biological processes.",
    "I generally felt like this course was not always flexible with student needs. By having quizzes at the beginning of class, the majority of my chem class would have to pack up early and leave as my teacher still taught because otherwise we'd receive a zero in the quiz in biology. The could have made the classes closer together or added more travel flexibility. Same issue with my discussion section-just like every single person in the class, we are all taking chemistry. Therefore we have 10 minutes to get to the other side of campus (from science hill to old campus) otherwise we get a zero, thereby encouraging people to skip chemistry or leave early. I thought that many things were considered 'policy' to justify being unfair and unflexible about things such as not posting powerpoint slides from discussion sections. I think there should be a removal of 'policy' to make things more enjoyable and fun for students. I liked the material being taught and it made me interested in biology, but I think this course should be taught as 3 shorter classes per week because I completely zoned out after the first 40 minutes because it is so densely packed with information.",
    "It is well taught, the peer tutors\/professor\/TAs are really approachable, knowledges and helpful\r\n\r\nMaterial is kind of dry.",
    "Strengths\r\n- Biol peer tutoring helped answer PSET\r\n- all the extra enrichment readings provided to offer a different perspective on topics \r\n- professor was funny\r\n- enrichment with Professor Lin was amazing\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n- lectures were sometimes boring",
    "I was often confused in lecture but the daily quizzes really helped keep me on track. Enrichment was the most rewarding experience. Everyone, from the peer tutors to Prof. Koleske and Professor Lin, were very approachable and really cared about their students.",
    "The strengths are the peer tutors and I thought they did a good job of going further into the topics that were presented in lecture. One of the ways this course could be improved is offering more convenient times for office hours and peer tutors.",
    "The course is very well organized and I am quite happy with it.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer, good discussion groups, weekly quizzes\r\nWeaknesses: fast and hard to keep up with sometimes",
    "The course is taught well and is a good introduction\/review into biochemical foundations as well as a good introductory course to the biology sequence.",
    "The course was very well paced. The instructors made sure that the students were able to follow the material and did not make assumptions about the students' prior knowledge. Lectures were interactive, which engaged students and also acted as a benchmark for their understanding in real time. One improvement could be the use of a 'clicker' app, like poll-everywhere, to make lecture even more engaging. A criticism of the course is that the connections between the concepts were not apparent until the very end of the class. It is hard to continually tie together a broad introductory course, but I think that if this were achievable, students would learn better, as they would have to keep recalling old concepts when learning new concepts, instead of learning them in isolation. This will both make it easier to learn new material and to better understand the past material.",
    "The lectures were generally engaging, but sometimes went very quickly. The quizzes were often stressful and hard to do under a time crunch, but they let me keep up with the material.",
    "Strengths: very well-organized, teaching was clear, expectations were clear\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "The class was very structured and organized. The slides were sometimes a bit confusing to understand but still pretty organized.",
    "I come from an under resourced high school that wasn't necessarily a STEM heavy school and a lot of the material that was covered assumed that everyone had AP biology understanding when I very much did not that. I wish there could have been a BIOL 100 or something to help combat this but it was very difficult and the enrichment session was at an inconvenient time for me,",
    "Generally, the discussion sections would have been more valuable if they were held before the homework deadline. I had section on Thursday, and homework was due on Wednesday. My peers in earlier sections had gained knowledge (for example, the paper on DNA application) that helped them complete their homework assignments.",
    "Strengths: Professor Koleske was good, lots of resources to do well, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I always forgot that Piazza was there. Also, why is the Bio Sequence split up like this? It does not make sense.",
    "Strengths: The powerpoints were exceptional, the quizzes and exam were very fair, it was taught in an engaging way, and it was very very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any",
    "It was taught really well by Professor Koleske and in discussion but sometimes felt like we went over a lot in class and the quizzes every morning were a little stressful.",
    "The lectures are very engaging for me. I feel as if both professor Koleske and professor Lin were an essential part of this. I benefited tremendously from the formatting of the lecture and the course in itself.",
    "The course is taught well and the content is interesting. The quizzes were difficult at times, but reasonable.",
    "Strengths - interactive discussion sections, thorough lectures \r\n\r\nWeakness - concepts are not always broken down so it was difficult to understand sometimes",
    "The pace was adequate and the material was interesting, and the professor really tried to be engaging.",
    "The course really emphasized the importance of understanding concepts rather than rote learning. At times, however, there were very specific questions on the quizzes that essentially required rote learning.",
    "I like how they try to incorporate discussion and I enjoyed discussion sections. One major weakness is they are very big on terminology and I do not think it is as useful as understanding baseline concepts. I saw many students who did not actually know concepts but just remembered specific words, which was eventually detrimental to their learning.",
    "Great lecturer, great slides, great TFs",
    "I think it moves very fast and the basic knowledge is not explained very well they expect that you know a lot even though many students dont.",
    "I know there is a lot of material but I felt that for there was an equal amount of time given to all material and that harder concepts should have ore time allotted towards explaining them.",
    "Koleski is an absolutely fantastic Professor, and he presented the material in a way that was interesting yet digestible.",
    "Strengths were that the class was very well organized, Prof. Koleske was a very good and engaging teacher, the slides were very understandable, and I felt like a got a good understanding of the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThere weren't really many weaknesses with this class",
    "The course was very well organized and structured. I have no qualms about it.",
    "Strengths: Amazingly well designed. Taught well. \r\nWeaknesses: Moved too fast for the average biology student. Seemed to have a soft prerequisite of basic to intermediate biology and chemistry knowledge.",
    "Goes pretty fast. I appreciate the weekly quizzes. Grading could be a little more lenient.",
    "I felt like we were learning  surface level information but rarely understood the actual complex innerworking of biological systems.",
    "Strengths- good lectures \r\nWeakness- grading not immediate, discussion sections still big",
    "Strength: Well taught, ran very smoothly\r\nWeakness: None posed",
    "strengths - good explanations and teaching style\r\nweaknesses - couldnt really tell what was important and not that important",
    "The class went really quickly but was organized pretty well. I think enrichment was extremely helpful and professor koleski was great.",
    "I thought it was a lot to understand all the extra help available and I didnt start taking advantage of it until a bit later in the course than I wouldve liked.",
    "The course was structured very well so that I always knew what to expect. Quizzes, lectures, what to do in discussion sections, etc. However, I think an issue I had grappling with was keeping up with my classmates. I don't think the instructors made the course intimidating, it was the number of students who already had a huge grappling of the topic before the class. This sometimes made me feel like I wasn't up to par with what we were learning in class. Although enrichment and support are offered, I don't feel like it's fair for students to have to spend a ton of hours into a class just to keep up with their peers who had already learned this content.",
    "It's such a ridiculously large lecture that your education is really what you make of it and your level of interaction with the course is entirely dependent upon yourself.",
    "Grading was very harsh and the quizzes usually were harder than they had to be. The professor was amazing and truly cared about the subject and teaching.",
    "Huge lecture, often quite intimidating to ask questions or ask for help.",
    "Dr. Koleske was a very engaging lecturer.  I loved the weekly quizzes.",
    "I like the weekly quizzes and the structure of the class. The lectures and discussions were also very helpful.",
    "Strengths: lecture and discussion sections\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "The quizzes were weighted too much and often damaged my grade despite me actually knowing the material.",
    "The course was very clear and organized.",
    "Lectures felt very impersonal - I felt like I had very little agency in my learning. The content was interesting for the most part.",
    "Strengths: Prof Koleske does an excellent job of breaking down material for students to throughly comprehend at a good pace, quizzes were useful in forcing students to keep up with the material making it easier to study for the final\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "Overall, this course was great. I appreciated the organization of lectures aloha with weekly quizzes as it helped to keep me accountable.",
    "Strengths: information\r\nWeaknesses: mostly tested on information not emphasized in class.",
    "Good lecturer, well-structured.",
    "Strengths: very organized, easy to follow, very clear what is expected, relevant course material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures could be not so engaging.",
    "The course was fairly strong and interesting. It was well paced and the discussion sections were helpful. The weekly quizzes were graded rather brutally, and in one instance points were removed for a correct answer because the previous answer was incorrect, and requests for a grade change were denied, as the two questions were linked.",
    "Weekly quizzes were actually an upside to the class because by the time the final came around it felt as though I was prepared and had already reviewed everything. A weakness was that the lectures were long and content- dense and so it was sometimes difficult to remain focused for the entire time.",
    "Strength: how section tied in well with lecture material.\r\nWeakness: more information could be useful to help with quizzes.",
    "Enrichment was probably the only thing that saved me, I believe it should be offered to more students",
    "The professor, Tony Koleske, was amazing. He was very knowledgable and engaging. The class was well structured. A weakness of this class were the peer tutors provided. They were knowledgeable but did not share any insights or explain anything well.",
    "I think it was a good course. Solid. Maybe provide answers to the red questions",
    "Seeking help when I don't understand something is something I need to work on. Also, I need to develop a better way to decide what information is important to study\/where to allocate my time.",
    "Strengths: a lot of resources available, highly structured\r\nWeaknesses: not a variety of enrichment section times. I was not able to attend them due to a conflict but I wish there were more options.",
    "It is well taught and interesting. There may be too much of an emphasis on the lecture slides.",
    "quizzes hurt.",
    "The course was very strong in its ability to care for the student and aid in teaching how to learn. The style of the course, with the set slides for each lecture, use of Piazza, discussion sections, and enrichment, was very geared towards helping students succeed. My only suggestion would be to allow a few more minutes for the weekly quiz.",
    "I like how there are many forms of tutoring for this course.",
    "Strengths: VERY well taught, Koleske is great and very understanding. If you did AP Bio in HS, the class is super manageable. Lots of teaching resources available as well.\r\nWeakness: relatively heavy workload, quizzes every Monday and a pset every Wednesday was a lot at times.",
    "I think the course is overall very strong. I think the one problem is the weekly quizzes vary in difficulty to significantly and thus it is hard to understand expectation.",
    "Taught at a very fast pace.",
    "I thought this course was very organized and run very well.",
    "The pace of this course is quite fast; however, discussion section for this class really helped clarify and solidify material covered in lecture.",
    "Strengths: slides and lectures were organized very well; it was very easy to follow along in lecture and take notes on the lecture slides, which were always posted in advance of class. The assigned readings in the textbook were also extremely helpful in understanding the material taught in class; it always cleared up any of my confusion. The weekly quizzes were very helpful in reviewing and reinforcing the material taught in class each week, and made studying for the final much easier. Weekly problem sets were also very helpful and interesting, because they encouraged us to critically think about class material in a new way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt as though Professor Koleske did not fully explain certain topics covered in class, but if I went to peer tutoring or read the textbook my questions would be answered.",
    "It was not too difficult, and we were definitely given a lot of support throughout. My TF was fantastic and this made it even better. Professor Koleske did a great job of making lectures entertaining and interesting. I highly recommend.",
    "I thought the weekly quizzes, though annoying, were actually really helpful because it forced you to study every week rather than trying to cram everything for a midterm, and studying for the final was not as stressful. The p-sets could probably be improved because they usually didn't correspond with what we'd learned that week.",
    "Some strengths were the way the class was structured and the many resources available for the students to understand the material. The discussion sections, peer tutor office hours, and piazza were helpful. A weakness was the last few lectures were trying to squeeze too much information in. Especially since it was midterm week, I don't think many people got the most that they could out of those.",
    "Strengths: Lecturer was very good. \r\nWeaknesses: inadequate preparation for quizzes, slow feedback.",
    "Weekly quizzes were annoying, but forced me to study and were good. The only thing that I would change is enrichment. I never took anything but basic biology my freshman year in high school, and would have liked to take the enrichment class. However, it was only on wednesdays back to back which was a time I could never go to due to lab. If enrichment could have had an option that wasn't on wed, that would have been great.",
    "Goes very fast paced and there is a focus on going through very large amounts of material without attempting to actually teach or understand it. If you are coming in to the course without a lot of experience with biology it is very difficult to keep up.",
    "The strength of this course was that it provided a great foundation for which biology is built upon. A weakness of the course is that it is not as engaging and interactive, seeming very mundane at times.",
    "This course is really well organized. Its always clear whats expected of you. Professor Koleske is wonderful and he moves at an appropriate pace. The quizzes are a bit of a pain, but they help you stay on top of the material and work out any questions while theyre still fresh in your mind. The discussion sections arent really necessary, but theyre also painless.",
    "The course seems to be somewhat cookie cutter style, which makes sense since it is an introductory course and so many people take it, but it makes it hard to become engaged.",
    "The class is well structured for all ranges of prior knowledge. Tutoring and enrichment sessions are helpful and readily available. Problem sets were gone over during tutoring in a way that helped you retain information, and this information came up on quizzes and exams in a similar way.",
    "Strengths: good lectures, interesting slide shows, fair grading\r\nWeaknesses: NA",
    "Strengths: I thought that Prof Koleske was very engaging and he made the class very interesting and easy to follow. Many resources were provided to help you understand course material.\r\nWeaknesses: My section leader was not very helpful or clear, so I think that the section curriculum could've been stronger in aiding our understanding of course material.",
    "The course was very well taught and organized. Lectures proved to be very useful and ample extra help was offered through peer tutors and the option to take the enrichment class. The content was very interesting and allowed for exploration of landmark science papers and ways new knowledge can be applied to analyze, or solve data\/problems. I feel the course could be improved by having the final be worth more than the weekly quizzes, as it provides more time for students to fully grasp and assimilate all the content.",
    "The course is very organized and that is incredibly helpful for students! I do think that I have had an unsatisfactory experience with the Teaching scholars as I don't really like mines that much and I think he grades differently than other TSs.",
    "The course goes very fast and seems to gloss of over fundamental concepts that the students are expected to know. This is not a good introductory class for students with little experience in a biology class.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Availability of peer tutors and professors (many tutoring\/office hours for those who need help)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Too much information taught in not enough time",
    "Sections are a great aspect of this course that allows students to ask questions and work with other students while reiterating ideas learned in class. I also liked when Prof Koleske would have questions in his slides and ask students to answer them with a neighbor."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in taking biology\/had taken AP bio in high school or were pre-med. If the student hadn't taken AP bio in high school, this course would probably be a much larger time commitment outside of class because of the need to review the basics of the material (and it could be easier to get behind or feel behind).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to strengthen their foundations in biochemistry, which is critical to understanding almost all biological concepts.",
    "This class is a great introductory biology course, and I would recommend it to another student. Even though students may test out of certain courses in the biology sequence, I would recommend that students take 101 anyways because the class goes deeper into each concept than the AP Biology curriculum.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course even if it not a pre-requisite. While there is some in-depth material that is learned, I think I learned a lot of important material about how life works in general and it is nice to put together the reason why life exists the way that it does.",
    "Yes, this class is a very good introduction to biology - even if you have taken AP Bio in the past you will learn something new.",
    "I mean, if you really like bio. I would say most people in the class were just taking it because they have to for their major, and if that's the case for you, I'm sure you'll take it anyway.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it gives the background necessary to take higher level biology courses, and exposes students to scientific primary literature.",
    "Yes, but maybe only for pre-requisite purposes. It is a lot of work if taking purely for enjoyment.",
    "If you already have some chemistry experience and you're interested in bio, this is a good introduction to the subject -- and even a good introduction to research in the field with the experimental methods and scientific papers that were discussed.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it to another student because it's a good intro course for the sciences. Most of the time, courses like this will be a decisive factor for whether or not a student will continue to pursue STEM. If they can make it through this, they can continue along the path of science courses.",
    "Yes, though it does require a bit of work and is a bit stressful at times, the course is a good introduction to biology at Yale and the General Biology sequence. It really helps us develop the fundamental knowledge we need to succeed in further biology classes\/research\/labs\/other scientific environments.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a great introduction into the biological sciences.",
    "Yes, but only if you are considering a field\/major\/career where biology is required. If you are just interested because you think bio is interesting, I would recommend taking a less rigorous biology course.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in science courses as it is a necessary introduction.",
    "Yes, Koleske was so great and he made information accessible and fun to hear! Its definitely an intro course though and if students have a strong background in bio they should consider skipping.",
    "This course was ok, I thought that although at times it felt like a premed weed out class it was overall alright. I enjoyed Prof. K's trying to connect to students, inviting us to lunch and generally the content of the lectures.",
    "If you think you are interested in biological sciences, I would recommend it b\/c 1) it's required and 2) it's a pretty good class",
    "I would recommend this class. If you don't understand something, there are resources to help you understand.",
    "yes.",
    "Pre-req for some STEM majors, so not really much of a choice often. With that being said, the majority of the material was quite interesting.",
    "Yes, I thought this class was a good introduction to biology and the professors were very helpful and willing to get to know their students.",
    "absolutely! this is a great intro course and you learn a lot of information about disease (HIV, for example) that can be useful even if you're not a bio major.",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot through this course though it may be difficult (especially if you have not taken AP Bio in high school).",
    "This course is required for many majors but if you like biology, I'd also recommend it as a science credit if needed.",
    "Yes. This course provides a critical foundational knowledge of molecular biology and biophysics. If you have any interest in the fundamental nature of life, take this class. It will let you think about biological processes on a much more precise, mechanism-based level that is crucial for deconstructing complex biological questions.",
    "Yes, mostly a review of AP bio, but some interesting and new concepts at the end. Well-taught and highly organized.",
    "Only if you're fulfilling pre-med",
    "Yes, if the student has been exposed to biology in high school. The pace of the course quickens around the middle, and the content may be difficult for students who are first learning biology.",
    "If they are premed or majoring in a biological science or biomedical engineering, then take the class. Off sequence was a pretty good move. But if not, then probably don't take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it was so interesting and taught so very well that you enjoy going to each and every lecture.",
    "Yes! It was a great intro to Biology.",
    "I definitely recommend this course because it a great introduction. Many will have to take it as a prerequisite, but I found that I really did enjoy the class because it is structured very well.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course to get an introduction to biology.",
    "Yes. Its a great way to learn about molecular biology and it is a fascinating course taught by an enthusiastic professor.",
    "It's an adequate introduction to basic biochemical processes, but only take it if it's required",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it emphasizes critical thinking rather than rote memorization. It also prepared me to analyze and discuss scientific research papers, which is an important skill to have in the future.",
    "Its a good intoduction to biology but the sequence seems pretty disjointed. The class itself is a bit interesting, and good for people who have little background in biology. For people with a strong foundation, it may not be the best course.",
    "Would recommend if you're STEM",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to pre med students who need to take the bio sequence.",
    "No because it is a necessity not an easy course and not very well done",
    "Absolutely. The interdisciplinary nature of this course considerably deepened my understanding of biological processes.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this class. It might have been a bit more difficult had I not taken a biology course in high school, but for someone who enjoys biology, I would definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes. BIOL101 with Prof. Koleske is amazing.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly; as long as it is taught by Professor Koleske.",
    "Only if required. If looking for a science credit, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, good intro to bio",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in the MB&B major!",
    "yes",
    "Yes I think both professor were really helpful and willing to answer questions.",
    "Yes, anyone who wants to learn about the processes that drive life should take this class.",
    "Yes definitely. I was super interested in the material.",
    "Sure, it's taught well and there is help available if you need it.",
    "I would take this course if you are looking to start the Bio sequence or if you are interested in the subject material. Grading can be unreasonable at times but overall a solid course.",
    "Yes.  It was a very fun class, structured in such a way that made it easy to learn and keep up with the materials presented to us.",
    "Yes if you need it for your major\/premed",
    "I would recommend this course because it was enjoyable, and I learned a lot about biology. It was engaging, but not difficult enough to be unpleasant.",
    "Yes, it sets the fundamentals for study of higher level biology.",
    "Yes! Very good course!",
    "I would recommend this course only to students with a significant interest in biochemistry.",
    "Yes - low stress, many assignments but manageable, great professor and teaching pace, material is very interesting and applicable especially for STEM majors",
    "Yes if need as prerec.",
    "Yes, good for fundamentals of biology.",
    "I would recommend this to those who are interested in biolochemistry because it gives a good basic understanding of the biological discipline as well as relevant experimental methods to work in a bio lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to those pursuing any kind of biology degree, as it is an excellent introduction.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, the biology modules are well organized and are made to facilitate students learning. They have clearly been modified over the years to make this strong working model.",
    "Yes, because it was generally interesting while providing the necessary information",
    "Yes, I would recommend. I learned a lot in the course overall.",
    "Yes. To get a good bio background.",
    "I found I learned a lot of new information about biology in an engaging way. I would recommend the course.",
    "I went into this course not knowing what to expect, and I came out pleasantly surprised. Even though the first few lectures might seem daunting, the assessments are all generous and fair and Prof. Koleske does a fantastic job of pacing the class just right. Enough challenge to keep me engaged, but not a lot of work if you realize that just paying attention to the lectures will earn you a solid grade  even if you haven't been doing work in a biology lab since middle school.",
    "Yes, if they need to take the class. It's a lot of work if you are not needing to take the class for your major.",
    "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this course.",
    "yeah sure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great place to learn more, not only about biology, but on how to study and how to think.",
    "Yes, it challenges you intellectually in my opinion.",
    "I would, if you're pre-med or a bio major, its a manageable course and taught very well off sequence. If you can test out of it, though, you should. AP Bio covered a lot of what we covered and even more.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I love learning about biology and the professor was great!",
    "I would recommend this course because I thought it was very interesting material. There is a lot of basic memorization of terms, which isn't particularly exciting, but that's necessary as an intro bio course.",
    "Yes, very engaging lecture and great support system if you ever need help.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in majoring in biology or who has any vague sort of interest in the subject, because it provides a very interesting and strong foundation for anyone interested in biochem and biophysics! The course went in-depth but not so much so that non-STEM people couldn't follow along.",
    "I would. You have to take it anyways, but I'd recommend the off-sequence intro bio because the teachers are supposedly better. It helps to have a little bit of chemistry already, so taking it after chem 161 was good.",
    "Yes! If you've taken AP bio before, this course won't be hard at all.",
    "Yes, if it is a prerequisite.",
    "Yes, because it gives a very brief but comprehensive review of biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "Yes! Koleske was amazing and bio was very interesting. I though I was going to hate the class but ended up having a new interest.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student wanting to improve their basic knowledge of biology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Its engaging and interesting, difficult, but manageable.",
    "This course is required for many majors and career paths but is by no means a boring requisite. The class is taught in an engaging way and help is available everywhere.",
    "Yes. This class is mostly painless and a great introduction to biology.",
    "I keep track of how much time I put into all my classes. I did 22 hours of work outside of class for for this class, which is about the same as I did for gen chem up until this point. If you have taken AP Bio you will have at least heard of most of the concepts in this class before. It gave me more confident about my understanding of the material.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about Biology, or if you plan to major in MCDB or MB&B, then you should take this course. You learn a lot in just 6 weeks, and you'll be happy to have a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are happening inside of us right now, as well as information about HIV\/AIDS and our immune system. if you have any interest in Bio and want to see if it's something you may want to pursue, take this class with Prof Koleske.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The class was well lectured, very organized and the content was very interesting. The class provided a great introduction to biochemistry and biophysics and touched upon a wide range of topics.",
    "if you really need to",
    "Yes! Biology 101 is a great way to step into STEM at Yale.",
    "I enjoyed this course, but a lot of my friends didn't and had weekly panics about the quizzes. I would hesitate to recommend taking this if it isn't a requirement, but I do think it's a good course.",
    "I would recommend this course as it is a prerequisite to a lot of classes",
    "Yes, this course was a great intro to biology and quite interesting. It is not too much to manage at all."
