The first few weeks of the class are focused on reading other published short stories and seeing how authors work with and manipulate the parts of a short story, the second half of the class is focused on drafting your own short story and working with classmates to edit and develop the stories of the class.",
                "We learned about the structure of a story as well as how to craft a story through POV, dialogues, description, etc.",
                "This class defined and discussed the basic elements of narrative writing in a very clear and tangible way. I gained valuable insight on the elements of a successful story as a \"machine for reading\", and learned to separate analysis of craft and style in a piece of writing. Through workshops, I also gained practice giving both positive feedback and constructive criticism in a group setting.",
                "I learned to study story from a craft perspective, breaking down the details and skills crucial to constructing a narrative, and I learned how to combine those necessary elements of narrative with my own voice to write stories in a more methodical and consistent matter than I had before."

            "comments": [
                "Pros: Although I wrote fiction before this class, I feel after taking it I genuinely understand how all the moving pieces work together and can identify weak points in my own stories. I enjoyed reading professionally published stories at the beginning of class. The criticism from my classmates was excellent and also made me better at providing constructive criticism for other stories/being a better writer.\r\nCons: I wish we were provided more student-written/younger author works at the beginning, as seeing the level of professional work for several weeks and then being asked to write our own stories was a little daunting. I also would suggest providing more checkpoints for our short stories, like having a required 1 on 1 meeting with Professor Sexton would have helped students learn and build their own short story better and be on time with writing.",
                "I really enjoyed that the first half of the course focused on learning from other writing and analyzing what makes an effective story. The quick writing exercises that we had throughout the semester were very engaging and fun, and I wish we had a few more of those. I think that having our own stories critiqued and analyzed in the second half of the course is also a good thing, but I think that maybe draft 1.5 should be mandatory (not graded, but required) because it encourages people to dive further into their stories and improve them.",
                "Strengths: I like that the course emphasized craft over style, allowing students to practice particular skills and making it more accessible for writers of all levels. The workshops were a highlight. Professor Sexton requires all students to offer unique, positive feedback and suggestions for improvement on each workshopped piece. This encouraged me to read each work closely and to become more comfortable offering constructive feedback in a group setting.",
                "This course was well-constructed, with readings paired to themes such that we the students were easily able to concentrate on how elements of writing work together to compose novels and short stories. I did wish that we spent more time discussing some of the longer readings, like Beloved and A Severed Head. The workshops at the end of the class were great, with plenty of enthusiastic discussion of each student's short story."

                "Absolutely. Especially if you're a fiction writer or have always wanted to try it out. This course is excellent and the professor and peers are awesome. I feel the urge to go out and write more now that I've finished the class. It was also pretty cool and helpful to see the various forms of writing assigned to read and provided by your classmates.",
                "Sexton is a harsh grader but otherwise this class rules",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "Yes! My writing and workshopping abilities both improved from this course. I feel more confident as a creative writer and editor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I thought that the readings and discussions helped me to develop my writing skills more consciously. From a critical perspective, the methodology used to read the texts and student short stories expanded my style of academic analysis."
