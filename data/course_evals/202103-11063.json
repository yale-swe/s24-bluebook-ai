Marla and Imad were amazing and super accessible and provided tons of support throughout  this is not your typical science class where the prof leaves you to flounder on your own and fails to explain things. The problems were tough, but I never left office hours without the help I needed to solve them. You get out what you put in, and if you come to lecture and do the work, the final project isn't as big and scary as it seems at the start. The psets also scale back significantly in length and difficulty once you start working on the final project, and Marla and Imad were incredibly responsive and adaptable to the needs and pacing of the course. They were also very amenable to discussing and re-explaining anything we were interested in learning about, instead of sticking to a strict schedule.",
                "Strengths: the problem sets are genuinely helpful for becoming familiar with new coding techniques.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",

Both were super accessible, and everyone who wants to do anything in physics/astronomy NEEDS to take this course. Also super useful for those not going into research, because Python skills are universally in demand.",
                "Hands down one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Would definitely recommend.",

                "Absolutely. If you're an astronomy or physics major it's a must, but for anybody interested in a comprehensive dive into a variety of programming topics I would recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this class, particularly if you are interested in programming and astronomy and want to develop your skills! The assignments are unique and the final project was a ton of fun and very gratifying!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! The skills we learned are invaluable for the field and the instructors were very accommodating. I would just preface my recommendation by saying that I would spend hours upon hours working on psets, so this is a class to prioritize more than others."
