The professor is amazing and will likely spark some level of curiosity/fascination in you\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course material is disorganized. However, it's totally up to you how much you want to dive in and really flesh out the content. Professor Zucker really intends to spark intrigue in you so you want to dive deeper and learn more beyond the course material.",

So, the main weakness of the course ended up being the finitude of time itself. I think the most rewarding aspect of the course was the level of effort that went into understanding each lecture, though this was at times also frustrating."

The material is absolutely fascinating, and Professor Zucker teaches it in a way that will make you excited.",
                "This class was my favorite CS elective so far. The material was fascinating, albeit presented in a \"drinking from the firehose\" fashion. Fortunately, you are only \"responsible\" for a trickle of this stream, so this is not as stressful as it may seem. If you think you would be interested in learning advanced mathematical, biological, and computational ideas and lectures on a (mostly new, to you) branch of math and its relevance to computational vision sound exciting, take this course. The hardest part of this course is perhaps not the level of the material, but being able to absorb the main points as elucidated by details without worrying too much about the details themselves. The workload was overall light: 5 enjoyable but, at times, tricky homeworks and a final project; additionally, Professor Zucker made the final 3 due dates flexible."
