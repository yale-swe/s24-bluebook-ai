    "I learned a great deal about England's response to the French Revolution. I feel I have a good grasp on that era's intellectual discourse.",
    "A deep-dive into literature of the 1790s.We learned about political rhetoric, literary analysis, and simply how to think. A class for anyone who cares about politics, literature, or being a human.",
    "Critical reading, interdisciplinary thinking",
    "You study the writing of famous poets and political philosophers that were inspired by the French Revolution and who wrote during the French Revolution."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is excellent, and Bromwich is a fantastic teacher who knows everything about the material. The political materials in the class were somewhat front-loaded. The lengths of the readings were not always evenly distributed, and some of the political texts I found too dense to try to read so much of so quickly.",
    "Professor Bromwich knows how to teach. Period. This seminar ran like a well-oiled machine. The feedback on assignments was some of the most helpful I've received at Yale thus far. Really this is a perfect course; I have no suggestions.",
    "No weaknesses\r\nFantastic professor who is highly skilled at listening to students and leading discussion",
    "Strengths are David Bromwich is a great Professor and really engaged discussion of the reading during classes."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course highly to anyone willing to engage deeply with the material. The course is listed only as an English class, but more than half of our group was made up of PolySci-type majors, and there's quite a lot of political theory in the class.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Bromwich is a gem, and the material we covered is some of the best in all of English literature. I was amazed that someone as smart as Professor Bromwich never made anyone feel stupid. He challenged us to think harder all the time, but never made you feel as though your ideas weren't worth the class' time. If you care about learning, take this course.",
    "Yes, this is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Bromwich is a kind, brilliant professor who gets to know his students and leads seminar better than any professor I have had in the past.",
    "I would reccomend this course to a student that wants to mix political philosophy with the poetry of the romantic period. And who wants to learn about  the French Revolution."
