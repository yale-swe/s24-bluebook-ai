The course is based off of the readings we do, so reading middle-aged text is really the only skill. Some analysis too.",

I left feeling like I knew everything I would need to know in that topic, and eager to make connections to the present. TF Amanda Griffin was incredible.\r\nWeaknesses: I am not really sure this is a weakness, because I would agree that all the text that was assigned was relevant but I would say the readings are a bit over assigned. They are long and very dense, most weeks I came to section without having it all done. The TF seemed to know that, though. The lectures were not always engaging, but again I think that might be the fault of the topic being very dense and sometimes a bit boring.",

                "Strengths: the course is incredibly well-taught and highly engaging, Amanda is a great TF, and the course material is super interesting; no weaknesses come to mind!",

I felt like I learned a lot and would be very surprised if I did not find myself making connections to future courses.",

Professor Eire almost has a saint like quality to him which is almost fitting. He is incredibly knowledgeable and cares about his students. His lectures are riveting and I challenge anyone to remain unmoved after one of his lectures.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course or any course taught by Carlos Eire to another student. It is definitely an interesting class, and it is not an overwhelming workload either.",
                "Yes! The course is really fun and interesting, and the subject matter is fascinating. You don't need to be Christian to enjoy this course; I'm an atheist, and I loved it!",
                "For people interested in religious history or history more generally, definitely yes. If not, the nature of learning about ancient mystics might not appeal to everyone",
                "Definitely! Too many people fail to understand mysticism. I, as a non-Christian non-mystic, still found it incredibly thought provoking (and, in many instances, persuasive).",

                "Yes! You dont have a complete experience as a humanities student at Yale unless you take a course with Prof. Eire, and this class has the least requirement for background knowledge."
