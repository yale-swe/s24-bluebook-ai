I also didn't really benefit from the breakout rooms, particularly when they were small, three person groups of students. Generally, in those small groups - we didn't know how much time to allot to each other and often ended super early with nothing else to do. I think that I had the best critiques when the class was split in half or all together.\r\nI also really liked sharing work on Arena but that platform is so hard to navigate that I often just got lost and didn't know where to submit my work to. Some alternative to Arena would be great."
