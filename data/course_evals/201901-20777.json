   "comments": [
    "Strengths: small size, philosophical view of childhood & its portrayal in movies. Students were able to propose films to watch & Professor was very flexible in terms of allowing for student input on what films to watch & was very welcoming of different ideas for the most part. I also LOVED the project where we analyzed units that real teachers had created about teaching through film. This could be made into a more intentional project on a shorter timeline, though, so we could get to it earlier.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: somewhat loose \/ unstructured seeming in terms of overall outline. Could probably be defined in the future as this was the first time it was offered. Did not actually offer a very \"global\" view of cinema. We mainly focused on films from the US, France, Iran, & China. Although these were good films for the most part and I did feel like I got interesting insights out of them, more overall structure could help us see films from more regions, even if it meant limiting the number of French and American films we got to see. Professor kept referring to \"Africa\" as though it was one country which is very false and should be corrected in the future.",
    "Weakness: We had a very long seminar period discussion once a week (2 hours), and it was sometimes hard to keep focused and engaged the entire time. Perhaps splitting this up over two days would be beneficial? \r\n\r\nI wish wed had time to cover more films from around the world! It felt like we spent a disproportionate amount of time on the US and France and only dabbled in other countries. \r\n\r\nStrengths: I loved that we supplemented our discussions of children and schools in film with readings by different educational theorists! I also felt that this class exposed me to an extremely broad range of films Id never otherwise see. Finally, I loved that we had the option to create a teaching unitthat is, a class plan incorporating film that could feasibly be taught in a schoolfor the final project for the class. This was a very unique and engaging opportunity for me.",
    "The strengths were the films choices and Prof Andrews' willingness to tailor the course to us, including changing the films we watch and the texts accompanying our discussion. Prof Andrew is also very accessible and gives good criticism. My main point of criticism was that the class felt very unstructured and I was often unsure of how everything tied together. The films and the readings felt disjointed, and sometimes we would gloss over entire films entirely because we would spend so much time on one film. The discussions could've been more balanced."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for more of a philosophy \/ film as literature approach to children and childhood as an idea.",
    "If you are interested in learning about schools and teaching practices around the world and especially interested in film, I would recommend this course! Keep in mind that this is probably less of an Education Studies-focused course than others with this listing, because Professor Andrew has an amazing background and film and literature but none in education studies. That being said, its an exciting course, and you have a lot of opportunity to suggest films and readings for the class that you think might contribute well to the course!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a chill class in which you watch a bunch of pretty good, mostly foreign films. You gain a new appreciation for foreign films. But be warned that Prof Dudley's expertise is in film, not education, so you're not going to be learning a whole lot about education studies, nor will that be much of the focus (we actually tend to talk more about children and their psychology from a humanities perspective)."
