What the title of the course doesn't tell you is that you'll learn various acting techniques that allow you to build characters, improve improvisational and observational skills, and overall become a performer who can truly embody any character they choose to study. I also learned how to write a script, and how to make my dialogue feel authentic. I was also able to develop a writing regimen that has allowed my creativity to expand and my writing to improve in all aspects of my life.",
                "Read many one-person plays and learned about the different techniques the writer and performer employed to engage an audience, such as switching points of view, the artist's date, morning pages, and the art of imitation (of physical mannerisms/postures, voice inflections, and diction). Also learned, in acting, how to switch between multiple personas in a clear way.",

                "I think this course really helps aspiring actors. It focuses on each and every individual, fosters a community where everyone helps each other, and has great readings/videos. I hope there are more in person office hours.",
                "I think the strengths life in the hands-on content. Prof. Brooks knows what he is talking about; one person plays and new play development are his specialty, and it shows in his teaching. I learned the most when I had the opportunity to go up in front of the room, perform, and give feedback. The process of being able to both give and receive feedback from my peers was invaluable as well.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved most by dedicating more time to practice, and a little less to discussion. That's not to say the discussion wasn't valuable, because it was. But there were were weeks when not everyone was able to perform, which made sense, due to time, but I think in many ways, the learning comes most from the \"doing.\" I also think that more time in class could be devoted to peer-reviewing the midterms and finals. If there was a class right before each where students could go and get creative feedback from the professor and their peers as like a test audience, it would be very helpful and maybe take some of the stress off of students the day of the exam. Prof. Brooks encourages students to go and rehearse with other peers from the class on their own time, which myself and several others did, but I'm sure there were times when some students did not and probably could have benefitted from it, so dedicated time in class could rectify this.",
                "STRENGTHS: Hal is a brilliant teacher and a director with many years of experience. You'll learn so many different ways to develop your own creative process as a writer, actor, and artist. Hal's feedback is also very clear and helps you improve. Personally I was pretty comfortable with writing but knew very little about acting going into this, and now I've gotten involved with some Yale Dramat shows! It's the PERFECT class if you want to get a taste of all the aspects of theater. I'm very glad I took this class. WEAKNESSES: There was a lot of analysis of how other people wrote/performed plays. This is great if you're able to apply the techniques to your work on your own, but there's less support when it comes to actually writing/performing your own one person play. We were encouraged to meet up with other classmates outside of class time to get feedback (which is super valuable, the people who take this class are so kind and engaging!), I just also wish there was structured time for all of us to get more feedback directly from the professor as well. Other than this one tidbit, I think everything else was great.",
                "Loved it! The readings and exercises were helpful! Professor Brooks's guidance is also wonderful!",
                "Strengths: The freedom you get to write about something you care about and test different skill sets in theatre.",
                "The strengths of this course are the community this class builds and the artistic freedom afforded to students. This course could be improved with more frequent and less long meeting times.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The assigned readings and videos were engaging and relevant for the coursework\r\n- Receiving feedback on our plays helped us refine and learn on an individual basis\r\n- Class exercises were fun and classmates provided constructive criticism\r\n- Class trips and bonding experiences helped contextualize the acting and writing techniques we learned in class, and I felt they helped me grow closer to my classmates! \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Meeting once per week made the writing process feel lonely\r\n- Essays felt more focused on technical writing and composition ability than theater studies\r\n- I feel like I wrote more in the class than I did in my dedicated writing class; I think the class placed more emphasis on \"composing\" than \"performing\"\r\n- I felt disappointed to not receive a writing credit for the seminar, given that I wrote more in the class than I did in my dedicated writing class"

However, I'm not sure this course is best suited for someone who is not, to some degree, seriously interested in these topics. If this is your first experience with theater, it might seem a bit daunting. When describing my classwork to my friends not in the class, they remarked that it sounded like \"a lot.\" I personally didn't find it to be that much, because I was passionate about it. But if someone did not already have an interest in these topics, I think they could be easily overwhelmed by the idea of writing and performing a whole one person play. In essence, if you're looking for a gut humanities credit, this is not it.",
                "Yes, you get a cool overview of writing AND acting AND directing all in one course. It was great to try out all of them - I don't think there are any other courses at Yale that are as multifaceted like this one. The morning pages (3 pages a day for the whole semester) might seem intimidating BUT I found them highly useful looking back. It's a creative tool that's important to try out, and I'm glad I did them. So don't be afraid to take this class! Try it out!",
                "Yes! Yes! Yes! It opened me to new artistic possibilities, making me passionate about playwriting and performing.",
                "Absolutely! It's a great course if you want to explore your creativity and create something you can be proud of. The class environment is also awesome!",
                "Yes! This class is so much more than a theatre class. It's a chance to discover your own voice and create work that is meaningful to you.",
                "If you're interested in theater studies, this is the seminar for you! However, if you do not have background or serious interest in theater, I would not recommend taking this course.",
