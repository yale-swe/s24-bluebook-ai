                "Strengths: lectures were very well-recorded and the professor explained the concepts very clearly. Exams were fair, and there was plenty of opportunity to get help from TAs, Peer Tutors, and the professor herself. I also really liked the group-work structure, where we all made groups of 5-6 and worked on assignments together.",
                "The recorded lectures were amazing, and so helpful. I feel like this class was well structured, and despite the circumstances, I learned so much.",
                "The lectures are very engaging, and the provided notes are thorough, so studying and working through problem sets and tests is both easy and reinforces the material. However, problem sets can lean a little on the long side, particularly for a class conducted remotely.",
                "Strength: The professor. Prof S is smart.",
                "The strength of this course is hands down Dr. Steinacker. She is brilliant, caring, and truly invests herself in the course. I wish I could have taken it in person! The psets are long, however, they are helpful. If you work hard in this course you will be successful. Test corrections are wonderful -- they really help decrease the anxiety from test day and encourage engagement with the material. I learned so much from doing test corrections!!!",
                "Strengths were that Professor Steinacker made each lecture engaging despite the recorded format and was always there to support students and answer questions. The psets were long but definitely helped me to learn and understand the material and also helped me prepare for the exams. Given the circumstances of the semester I can't think of any weaknesses, Professor Steinacker put in a lot of effort to make this a good course.",
                "I thought that the lectures were delivered very well, but I think that we could get feedback a little sooner on the problem sets. It took a few weeks for our first one to be graded, and by that point, I felt behind in the class because I wasn't able to use the comments from my first pset until about the 3rd or 4th one.",
                "This course is incredible and really well suited to facilitate learning. Professor Steinacker really cares about her students and puts so much time and effort into making the lectures\/demonstrations and helping you until you fully understand the concepts.",
                "Lectures are clear and nicely segmented to accommodate for online learning. Steinacker definitely put a lot of effort into making the course well adapted for online learning and I appreciate that a lot.",
                "The class was very engaging despite being being pre-recorded due to class participation. There were many opportunities for help and access to the professor.",
                "Steinacker is amazing but this course is really hard.",
                "The course was extremely engaging, and I learned a lot from every lecture. The exam reviews were extremely helpful. My only suggestion is to provide solutions to the exams. Otherwise, Professor Steinacker and the TFs are some of the most helpful teaching team ever. They really care about your learning. For example, rather than not talk about the problem set like other professors, they openly offer any help.",
                "Professor Steinacker is great. She cares about students and tries her best not to make the course stressful. She has lots of her own office hours in addition to all the peer tutor office hours. The material is difficult and there's a lot of work, but there's also a lot of support from Prof Steinacker and the peer tutors.",
                "The lectures have been well planned out and incredibly informative. The office hour schedule was the greatest strength of the course as it allowed for interaction with the professor and TAs. Recorded review sessions were also helpful. There was a great deal of information to get through, but it was handled well.",
                "The course load is very high, which mainly presented itself through the p-sets. However, take advantage of the office hours and please don't wait until the last moment to do the work.",
                "Strengths: accessibility for students in other time zones\/with conflicting classes due to pre-recorded lectures, the sheer number of available office hours, and Professor Steinacker's demonstrations\r\n\r\nWeakness: lack of office hours on the day before the psets were due, so if you had to start the psets later during the week, these office hours weren't an available resource",
                "Strengths: Fun\r\nWeaknesses: Huge time commitment",
                "I just really enjoy learning physics in general, I think all the concepts are really interesting. This is a really good intro class that sets the foundation for future physics and STEM majors. \r\n\r\nThe lectures are recorded and non-synchronous, and the only opportunity to ask questions is through office hours. This made learning some of the more difficult concepts more challenging.",
                "Strengths: Steinacker is great and very kind. She really tried to encourage participation and student understanding by building participation questions into the recorded lectures (this forced us to watch the lectures on the day of each class period, although I would have appreciated if they were due just a day later). The study groups she had us form were also very helpful. TAs hold office hours almost all the time so it's very easy to get help.",
                "Please stop making the psets so hard, I am one person. Also, more office hours to work on psets.",
                "This course satisfies requirements, and offers sufficient office hours such that the psets are made possible through brute force. However, it is simply not enjoyable for many students, and I doubt any intro-level physics course, including 170, would be. The biggest weakness of this course is the structure of the psets, as it typically lags a few weeks behind the actual taught material, making it difficult to relate the week's lectures to the homework. The biggest strength is Professor Steinacker's enthusiasm for the course, which almost made it bearable, but if you are like me (a student in a vaguely related life sciences major with plans to enter a graduate program thoroughly not based on physics), there is simply no good option for intro physics at Yale. In regards to this course compared to 170, I can confirm from students in each class that they both wish they took the other. This is slightly harder than 170, but the problems can be solved with logic, while 170 is more esoteric but slightly lighter on the math. Honestly, I considered changing majors to avoid a physics requirement period, and all I can say in favor of this class is that its lenient grading policies will allow you to succeed (or at least pass) after a huge time investment.\r\n\r\nThis course will be the most time-intensive you take, unless you are also taking something on the level of organic chem or math 120. Plan accordingly.",
                "I cannot think of any way this course could be enhanced. Steinacker is the bomb",
                "This course is really well taught and organized so expectations and due dates are clear. The workload is pretty high, but it pays off by the end in a much greater understanding of the concepts. It's helpful that Steinacker encourages collaboration with other students, as this is a very difficult class to get through by yourself. Sometimes, homework problems would be incredibly hard, but study halls and office hours were super helpful and there was really no reason to struggle through those difficult problems alone.",
                "I love this class! It is so well-taught and the PSETs can be worked through if you pay attention to the lecture material and notes that Professor Steinacker provides.",
                "The course does a great job of making people learn through the weekly problem sets. While hard, they provided a great feel of what problem-solving is. Availability of peer tutors was incredible and they really saved me.",
                "It went through the lessons very thoroughly, making it easy to review for exams later on. Because the homeworks weren't in sync with the lectures, sometimes I would forget a topic and have to reteach it to myself.",
                "This course has a knowledgeable teacher accompanied by a strong base of teaching fellows and peer tutors. If there are any weaknesses in this course, the weaknesses are fundamental to the subject.",
                "Interesting material, more examples could have been helpful",
                "I think that a strength was all of the office hours and the availability of the Instructor.",
                "This course needed improvement in that occasionally the questions that were on the exams were tougher than expected, but I would be more willing to say that is a weakness on my part rather than the courses. Furthermore, if the questions were harder than expected there was always an opportunity to go over them afterwards and learn from them for the future. This course was strong in the areas of availability to the professor, comprehensiveness of how the lectures were formatted and where we could access the information needed to help us succeed, as well as usefulness of what we learned.",
                "I have no weaknesses to list here. The course was incredibly well done. The recorded lectures worked well, the grouping of students to work together was great, and there were always ample resources to get help!",
                "For someone who has never taken a physics course, it was very challenging. Learning new concepts AND learning how to apply them were tough.",
                "A huge strength of this course was how collaborative it was. Professor Steinacker encouraged us to form groups prior to the start of class, and this ended up being a great support system for me. There were also a lot of office hours offered, and Professor Steinacker, the TFs, and the peer tutors were all very helpful. There are definitely many resources available for this class.",
                "The lectures were very well structured and delivered, but I do wish that there had been a synchronous option for the lectures.",
                "The strengths include the robustness of the teaching team. During a virtual semester, it was super helpful to have TFs or ULAs available to help at a plethora of times throughout the day.\r\n\r\nFrom the recorded lecture side, I particularly enjoyed the ability to rewatch, slow, and speed up the videos. It could be improved by providing closed captions, as I used it in another course while studying for exams and it provided a really nice additional level of synthesizing information.",
                "I think the course promotes a deep understanding of the underlying material, but is unbalanced. The material that is on the homeworks focuses less on understanding the concepts and more on raw ability for mathematics. I felt constantly overwhelmed by problems that seemed not to test my knowledge of physics but my resolve to slog through a problem whose answer has seven terms and cannot be simplified. I also do not feel like I was taught. The recorded format made it impossible to directly interact or help students engage with the pacing of the course. I did appreciate the many study halls. They were what I wish the class was like.",
                "I enjoy seeing how math is applied, so it was fun seeing math used in a creative way. The lecture videos were very organized and the demos were entertaining. The class went at a reasonable pace, but we were not able to learn most of the material that was mentioned on the syllabus at the start of the semester.",
                "This course has many strengths. Even though the lectures were recorded, Prof. Steinacker was still able to make the class fun and interesting. She also provided us with many resources to succeed, such as study groups, many office hours and study hours, and detailed lecture notes. I cannot think of any significant weaknesses of this course.",
                "strengths: office hours (!!), lecture notes, PCLs, exam corrections",
                "One strength of this course is that the organization and layout of topics was manageable and aided greatly for a smooth learning experience. One weakness was great difference in difficulty level of the exams compared to homework and lecture assignments.",
                "Recorded lectures are sometimes hard to concentrate during.",
                "The concepts in the recorded lectures were well explained and organized.",
                "It would be better if the instructor could release the class note beforehand so the student would have a better understanding of the topic during lecture",
                "Professor Steinacker's notes are amazing and so are her lectures. She puts so much thought into her course and the assignments and it's really facilitated for student learning.",
                "I think a major strength of the course was the amount of help that was available. A lot of the problems and tests were extremely hard to figure out on your own, but there were so many resources for help that it didn't feel as if you were going through it alone.",
                "There is usually a long problem set posted for each week and only about half of the problems are required. The other problems are practice problems and are useful when studying for exams. Adrianne made sure that we kept up with the recorded lectures by having \"participation\" questions in each lecture that we had to solve and submit for some lectures.",
                "One strength of this course is that you can learn a lot by completing the weekly problem sets. They help you stay up to date on course concepts and reinforce approaches that are important when taking exams. Also, the TAs are very helpful and the availability of office hours throughout the week was useful in getting help on challenging problem set questions. \r\n\r\nI think the only downside is that this course is pretty math-based, and so I think if you like conceptual physics then this class may not be for you.",
                "Strengths: very informative and clear lectures, many office hours and peer tutoring sessions, very knowledgeable and approachable professor, challenging and engaging material",
                "I think the class could have benefitted from having a weekly section.",
                "Honestly, the setup for this class was great. The homework was reasonabledefinitely challenging but doable, and there was a lot of office hour\/peer tutor support. It was great a strengthening understanding and preparing us for the exams. The pre-recorded lectures were good, and the participation questions were also reasonable and helped keep me on top of the lectures. The only weakness I encountered was that sometimes there would be no explanation for points lost on homework and participation, which would have been useful to know for future reference.",
                "Almost nothing could go wrong with Professor Adriane Steinacker, the queen of physics teachers. Her brilliant mind and sweet heart will definitely help you tackle any (if not all) problems\/difficulties\/curiosities that might arise in PHYS 180. Just religiously attend her office hours, watch (attend?) her lectures on time, and start the psets early. Things will be in good hands!\r\n\r\nPro tip: I feel it is really helpful if you have AT LEAST SOME experience with physics before taking this class. Even though it is designed with \"no-exposure\" students in mind, those with prior acquaintance with the topics in the class will defo cruise through the class (provided that they put in the necessary effort, of course!). I am even tempted to say that at some points the class could even be considered a \"gut\" for you. So if you can, try to use Khan academy or some \"student-friendly\" textbook to briefly acquaint yourself with Mechanics\/Waves topics. You'll thank yourself later for that!",
                "I thought that having study groups was a really important part of this course- it gave me an extra resource on psets and also kept lectures engaging.",
                "Classes were a little long but this isnt a major complaint.",
                "The recorded lecture format worked very well for a remote semester because of the flexibility it offered. The many office hours options that are offered every day are a huge strength of the course because the psets would often take about 10 hours a week for me. However, because the psets were so long, the coursework often became overwhelming. I didn't think that the participation credit questions were necessary since the concepts would be tested in the psets, which were already very time-consuming.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the office hours\/study halls. The TAs as well as the professor are very very helpful, and only want to see you do well!",
                "I didn't find the lectures super engaging. I found the professor knowledgeable and the examples riveting, but for some reason I got bored in this class specifically."

                "The virtual lecture style was just as if not more engaging than in-person lectures would have been, in in my view, and the transformation of the tests into open-note exams greatly improved my learning experience. However, the experience at office hours could be chaotic at times, despite the great number of available office hours each week.",
                "I liked it. The recorded lectures were nice. and the availability for OH and peer tutoring was good.",
                "I think the format of this course succeeded. Having the lectures recorded was nice because it allowed me to pause them and rewind and really make sure I understood everything being taught. Although students couldn't ask questions live with this format, Professor Steinacker and the TFs and Peer tutors all had a lot of office hours so it was easy to get help with any confusing concepts.",
                "Professor Steinacker was super flexible as a result of the pandemic and was very generous in allowing the exams to be taken throughout the day and lenient with homework and participation submissions.",
                "Breaking up an hour and a half lecture into 3 thirty minute lectures was very helpful. I also really liked that Steinacker recorded all the lectures and then posted them. This was certainly more effort on her part, but she produced lectures of far higher quality than some other online classes as a result.",
                "The time given to do assignments helped immensely. The focus of the course was on learning and not grading. Course was very organized. Review sessions helped as well.",
                "Lots of virtual office hours were key",
                "The recorded lectures were informative, and they succeeded in teaching me basic principles of physics. I also appreciated the demonstrations that were fascinating yet really facilitated learning. We even put in study groups at the start of the semester, which really helped feel connected throughout the semester as I at least knew someone in the class.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures format of this course because I could watch them at my own pace. I also liked that Prof Steinacker had office hours focused to the lecture material and separate office hours for the problem sets. I think she set that up well and she was still flexible and willing to answer any question. My physics study group that was created as part of the course didn't meet much, but I was still happy with that setup because I made a close friend and I met some other students as well. And, when we did meet, we were able to help each other and have fun. \r\n\r\nI didn't like the lecture participation questions as much because it was stressful to have to submit another assignment for a grade, even though you only had to get an 80% on participation.\r\n\r\nThe virtual study halls and office hours were so helpful and I felt like I had plenty of resources to be able to understand the material and do well in the course. I liked that the peer tutors were able to give me direct feedback (including whether my answer to a pset problem was right or wrong), as that really helped me understand the material and figure out what was going on in a problem.",
                "The live virtual office hours and recorded help sessions were a great success.",
                "This semester the professor added participation questions throughout the lectures to improve active engagement, but I feel like they did not exactly help.",
                "Virtual live lecture rather than a recorded one",
                "Going to a ton of peer tutoring office hours.",
                "I appreciated that this course was completely asynchronous, so we could take other courses concurrently. However, the participation component in the lectures was an aspect of the course I didn't like, especially because they were graded on accuracy. I often found myself skipping through the lectures just to find the participation questions. I also found that the take-home exams were much more difficult than the normal 3-hour exam. I understand why this happened, but I wish that we had been given warning or been informed of how long we should have been expected to take on them.",
                "N\/A. I worked best with the recorded format. The one thing would be to have participation due the end of the week, not the end of the day.",
                "I appreciate Professor Steinacker's attempts to standardize the curriculum with an average year through some demonstrations, and I also very much appreciate her flexibility on the psets and exams compared to non-COVID years, with the exception of her inexplicably making the final pset 3 questions longer. She made course materials quite accessible, even without a textbook, and I found her and the tutors' office hours to be quite helpful. That being said, I did at times have panic attacks based on the level of work that remained--while these were mitigated with the help of the peer tutors and the student groups she asked us to collaborate with (a good request that helped dramatically), it should be known that this course will be remarkably hard and take up a remarkable amount of time.",
                "The recorded lectures were a great choice. I also loved how many office hours there were",
                "I thought the recorded lectures were very clear and there was a lot of available help if you are confused about the content. I thought the participation questions due at midnight the day of each lecture were sometimes a bit unnecessarily difficult and they were graded for accuracy instead of completion. That was good because it made it hard to fall behind, but it also wasn't very flexible if you were struggling or behind.",
                "The lectures were truly wonderful, and I am so grateful to Professor Steinacker for all the the time, effort, and thought she put into these recordings. They really made me feel as if I was in the classroom. \r\nI think that there is a big communication component in this class which is inherently difficult to translate online. I was really happy with the study groups that Professor Steinacker created for us to somewhat bridge that gap.",
                "Recorded lectures are never fun to do. THey really threw me off my game and made me dislike physics, although that is a personal concern. I feel that if this class was taught live or if it were in-person, I would have a much better experience. The daily check-ins helped me stay on top of the lectures and were a nice addition to help keep people in check.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures worked well because it gave me more flexibility in my schedule. The office hours also worked well over zoom and wer always very helpful\/informative (especially when they screen-shared).",

                "Recorded lectures were great!",
                "Although I did not love that the lectures were prerecorded when I first started the professor I came to appreciate this because it allowed me to go back and review information when I needed to verify something for homework or because I needed to study for an exam. I am not sure how the information in this class in normally made available to students, but having the ability to look at Professor Steinacker's lecture and homework notes made a huge difference in my experience with this course because I was able to always go back and verify my own notes. The office hours and study hall hours were also well adapted to the situation at hand because I felt like I always knew when I could get help if I needed it.",
                "As listed in the previous question, it all worked really well and I don't think anything needs to be changed. The recorded lectures worked really well, especially since students could watch them on their own time. Further, the availability of the professor\/TAs really helped the educational experience.",
                "The exam times were very difficult to work with. With a limited window to take it and in the Pacific time zone, the first exam coincided with many different things. I ended up skipping dinner (goes through dinnertime) and taking the test for the full time. During this time, I was starving but could not go to the kitchen in fear that I would lose time and sharing a room with my family, I had many distractions. I don't think its fair to have a closed window for test taking for students in these circumstances. Please consider giving the full 24 hours for all exams. Exam 2 and 3 went very smoothly. I was able to choose my own time to take the test and even with distractions I finished the test without pressure.",
                "Lectures were prerecorded, and I tend to focus better in live virtual lectures then prerecorded ones, so that made it a little more difficult for me. Also, some of the prerecorded lectures ran a little long while others ran a little short, and there were discussion\/participation questions asked throughout that did not count towards the time. I think this averaged out to a normal or maybe slightly long amount of class time, but it could be kind of stressful because I try to watch the lectures during our normal class time and I had classes before and after so it was sometimes hard to fit it in. \r\n\r\nHowever, the zoom office hours worked really well for me and I appreciated how many of them were offered",
                "Asynchronous lectures were effective, but were not as engaging as live ones. Office hours for homework were frequent and extremely helpful for completing the homework and understanding the content. The instructor made sure that every student had a study group to discuss lectures and work on homework with, though my group never worked on anything together. Exams were not proctored and worked well, though they did create a significant opportunity for students to collaborate during the exams, despite contrary rules, which made the exams somewhat unfair towards those who did not work with others.",
                "As said above, the recorded lectures could be improved by providing closed captions to follow along with in addition to the audio.",
                "Adding appendices which amount to extra lecture time need to be abolished. Its harder online lets not add material.",
                "I wholeheartedly support the video lectures since that gives most flexibility. Even in virtual mode I had a very tight schedule but the recorded video format for Physics 180 contributed a good amount to keeping time management under control. A weakness I found with the virtual setting was collaborative learning. Working with my good friends on problem sets actually took more time than working individually, which was very surprising to me. I found the participation assignments pretty useful, too, especially since they grant some independence and support virtual learning for this course.",
                "Having prerecorded lectures was actually more helpful than live zoom lectures would have been. This class is difficult, and having recordings made it easier to go over the material several times.",

                "Professor Steinacker took great care to ensure our success in the class from partnering students with peer tutors right from the beginning.",
                "She gave us 24 hrs to complete exams, offered office hours every day of the week for psets and was so amazing and accomodating.",
                "I believe almost all the practices in this course succeeded. Almost everything was recorded, from lectures to review sessions, so you had a plethora of resources and information to refer back to during assessments, making everything well organized and easy to find. While the information was sometimes dense, these resources made virtual engagement easier to follow.",
                "Adrianne made sure that everyone could do their best in the new environment by giving opportunities to submit exam revisions. She was notorious for not accepting late submissions when there were \"accidents\", i.e. people submitting the wrong file.",
                "Really great format of the course. I felt I could learn well and pause\/rewind videos if I needed to clarify concepts.",
                "The recorded lectures and review sessions were very useful as I often reviewed lecture concepts multiple times to ensure that I was understanding them properly. Also, the TAs being able throughout the week helped because I was able to receive help on pset questions whenever it was a good time for me. In addition, Professor Steinacker extending pset deadlines to Sundays were very helpful in permitting me to spend a decent amount of time working on them.",
                "The recorded lectures were very informative and effective and I really appreciated the plentiful office hours and that the exams were open note. \r\n\r\nBecause the problem sets were complex it could be difficult to show work\/communicate questions via zoom in peer tutoring hours, but in general the peer tutors did a great job adapting, answering questions, and using online writing tools.",
                "There are many opportunities to work with other students in groups and attend virtual office hours. The extra time for exams helped a ton, and the online exam review is extremely helpful. Still, the class participation questions were sometimes daunting, as I would spend more time contemplating them over the content of the video itself.",
                "Pre-recorded lectures with short participation questions were great for engagement and integration of concepts covered in lecture. The tests were challenging but reasonable and the professor did her best to accommodate as many students as possible in terms of timing. She was also very kind to her students and it was clear that she cared about our mental wellbeing throughout the semester. She would cancel participation on weeks where she felt it would be appreciated, or would extend deadlines by a few days to give us time to complete our work but also stop to breathe. Professor Steinacker was a great professor and while it was a shame to not have been able to experience her lectures in person, her personality and teaching abilities still shone through in the online lectures. I personally never made it to her office hours, but she was available often and encouraged students to come to her with questions about the recorded lectures. Also, I love that she sets us up into study groups at the beginning of the year. It was a very helpful to have other students to discuss lectures and homework with.",
                "I thought the entire structure was really successful, and I think changing the exams to have a whole day was really helpful.",
                "I appreciated us having a wider window to take the exams due to different time zones. It made it much easier to schedule my day. Having the lectures recorded also was really nice, getting to play them at a faster speed, at whatever time of day we needed to.",
                "The virtual lectures were largely solid. However, sometimes the PCL problems added ~30 min to class time. Additionally, sometimes there were appendixes that were essential to the class but exceeded normal lecture time by a lot",

                "Having a mix of recorded and live lessons could improve the overall engagement and learning process in the class.",
                "the format of lecture was very good, since it was split into multiple videos so it wouldnt feel like a very long class. We were also provided online notes for each lecture, with additional examples which was useful. The study hall format through zoom was very helpful since it was easier to follow along with the problems, as well as ask questions and bounce between other zoom rooms for other homework problem questions.",

It's a lot of work, and I don't think I would have taken the course outside of it being a pre-req. However, Prof. Steinacker is amazing at what she does and puts in so much effort into making problems that work out perfectly or beautiful diagrams etc. Plus, the grading scale and exam revisions are a godsend.",
                "This course requires you to put in a great deal of time, but is structured and conducted in such a way that that time will be rewarded by a real and comprehensive understanding of the material. It falls victim to the pitfalls of all quantitative P-set classes in that small mistakes can be hard to find and cascade into huge point deductions, but relative to other QR classes the knowledge gained is much higher.",

                "Yes. Steinacker is a great teacher and seeing how much she enjoyed physics during the demonstrations made me enjoy physics more. If you find some good friends to take it with it's quite an enjoyable time. As long as you give your self enough time to digest the information and do the problem sets you should be golden.",

                "I would recommend this course. This was my favorite class this semester because of the engagement of the teaching team. Even though the problem sets are difficult, they really help you grow as a problem solver, quantitative reasoning, science, etc. There is so much help available.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in STEM. There's a lot of work as the problem sets take a lot of time to complete. However, there are tons of office hours and study halls, so it's completely manageable if you spread out the problems over several days and work on the problem set for 1-2 hours each day at study hall. If you're not interested in physics, I wouldn't recommend taking this course just to get a science credit since it is time-consuming. But, if you like STEM, the material is interesting and Professor Steinacker is such a kind person and a great instructor. She also allows revisions on the two midterm exams to get back 50% of missed points and you only have to have a 90% homework average to get a 100% in the homework category, so the grading is reasonable.",
                "This is a great introduction to physics. For the majority of engineering majors, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes!! The professor is amazing and the course is great for student's with little to no physics background",
                "Not particularly, especially not if you don't need physics for any requirements, but if you're pre-med and debating between 170 and 180, I'd suggest just taking 180. Professor Steinacker is quite engaging and even though the course is pretty challenging, especially if you don't have experience with calculus-based physics, I think it's worth it.",
                "Not really",
                "Yes, because it is a really good intro class that covers a lot of physics and math in detail. Some of the ideas are difficult, even for someone who has taken two years of physics (IB) in high school. It is a lot more math, and I suggest taking this after or concurrently with MATH 120.",
                "Yes, but not to everyone. I took this course to fulfill a premed requirement. I had taken AP Physics C in high school (quite a while ago) but chose to take 180 because I felt that Steinacker had put a lot of thought into designing her zoom course so at least it would be well-organized -- which turned out to be true! It's also asynchronous, so you can take overlapping courses. It's a standard mechanics course and I think the psets are well-designed. If you've taken physics before, they probably take around 5 hours\/week and are not very difficult (especially since there are office hours all the time so you can ask for help). The exams are fair as well, although I felt that the take-home final was a bit long and more difficult than the other exams. However, if you like physics and are looking to learn something new, this course doesn't teach anything outside of the AP curriculum so you might feel dissatisfied -- in this case I'd recommend 200 or 260, although I can't speak for the quality of teaching there.",
                "If you take it with Adriane, yes. She is very kind and accommodating.",
                "I would recommend this course to students with a background in calculus over physics 170, but I would seriously consider working to avoid either if possible. If your major and career is dependent on it, such as if you are a premed or plan to do research, take this if you have the math chops and time, 170 if you do not have the math chops, and 200 if you recently took a high-level physics course in high school--it, from what I've heard, has more conceptual-based homework assignments. If there is anything you can take that is not physics to satisfy your requirements and you expect to dislike physics based on your history, take that instead.",
                "Yes, if you need it for your major. Steinacker is great so don't be scared",
                "I would recommend this course to students like me who don't have a very strong physics or math background entering Yale. The workload is very high, but there's really no way around that. The weekly PSETs were difficult, but there was plenty of help at study halls or office hours. I don't think it's as difficult as people say if you know how to use your resources, but I also wouldn't go through this just for a QR or science credit- if you need a physics course for your major or are really interested in the subject, take it, but you can probably get the distributional requirement in another (easier) class.",
                "Yes, I would! It's a great class taught by a very inspiring professor.",
                "Yes. Great course, and a great way to hone in on your QR skills.",
                "I'd recommend it to someone interested in physics because it is taught very well.",
                "If you are interested in taking physics take this course with professor Steinacker, she is amazing and she will make the process of learning this material much more enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend because the professor understands what students go through and accommodates for that.",
                "Yes. Professor Steinacker is so passionate about teaching this course that even if someone is not entirely invested in learning physics she will spark an interest in them. If your major tract requires you to take physics then you definitely want to take the course with her.",
                "YES! Especially if it's taught by professor Steinacker. She is one of the most highly motivated professors I have had and is truly dedicated to her students. (Not to mention how enthusiastic and funny she is!) You will learn an incredible amount of information, but it won't feel overwhelming. The class is set up with ample resources so you never feel lost. I recommend this course for all students at Yale. You learn so much and have a greater understanding of the world around us!",
                "No, too much work and unless the exam policy changes to 24 hours or more, it is very stressful.",
                "Yes, Professor Steinacker is a wonderful professor so if you are interested in physics\/ required to take physics definitely take this course!",
                "I would recommend this course as a way to learn a lot of interesting physics, though anyone thinking of taking the course should be aware that the problem sets are very difficult.",
                "No, but if youre taking it, its probably required.",
                "No, only take if absolutely necessary and at that take it during the summer.",
                "I would recommend it to those who have no previous physics background, or took AP Physics 1 and\/or 2 or equivalents. If you have some prior physics experience some concepts might feel repetitive, but they do throw in some calculus that you may or may not have been exposed to.  If you have no previous background in physics, I recommend seeking guidance from Professor Steinacker, TAs, and classmates. This will not only help you through the course, but will also make PHYS 180 all the more fulfilling. HOWEVER, if you took AP Physics C courses, I would recommend 200 or 260 instead. The workload for PHYS 180 will get heavy regardless of your background, but students who took Physics C will find the material extremely repetitive and unfulfilling.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you took AP or IB physics in high school, this class will definitely teach you new things and instill a love for physics.",
                "yes, especially with prof. steinacker!",
                "Yes, if this course is required or you are interested in gaining an in depth introduction to physics.",
                "Yes, very helpful for future careers.",
                "No",
                "Yes!! It's so worth it and I learned so much even though it was really difficult.",
                "It is a bit of work, and if you don't like physics it might be very difficult, but there is so much help available, from Peer tutors to office hours to study sessions, that if you work hard you can succeed in the class.",
                "Yes! Great foundation for physics.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone seeking an introductory physics course. It is challenging, but this is mainly because the problem sets take quite a bit of time to complete. If you break it up over the course of the week, then you should be fine though. The exam questions for the most part are fair, and honestly if you take the time to do some practice there are not many extremely conceptual topics that will trip you up.",
                "Absolutely, Professor Steinacker is amazing and the course was both challenging and interesting. But be prepared to work hard and invest time on the Psets.",
                "Yes. It was a great and comprehensive introductory physics course.",
                "Yes. Professor Steinacker is a great teacher with such clear compassion for her job and her students. She was very clear in her explanations and used good examples to illustrate concepts and introduce equations. The content was interesting and the professor was engaging, even through pre-recorded lectures. The homework was tough but very doable, and the office hours\/study halls were very helpful for the tougher problems.",
                "100% 100%............Hopefully, though, you're at least a bit interested in exploring physics topics. If so, Prof. Steinacker would greatly satiate your curiosity, I promise! :)",
                "Yes, I would, Prof. Steinacker cares so much and keeps the class so engaging, so even if you aren't super into physics, you'll still want to learn and do the work.",
                "If you are pre-med, I would recommend this course because of the support that it offers even if the content is challenging. Just be prepared to devote many hours a week to this course.",
                "I would recommend to take this physics course if it is on your requirements for your degree, and also for fun if you really love problem solving and doing physics! the class is a low stressor, and the professor is very accommodating! You have to put a lot of work in, like attending study halls for hw\/ doing test corrections, but if you do then the class will be fun and easygoing.",
                "I would because I think it can be applied universally once graduating college. Everybody uses physics."
