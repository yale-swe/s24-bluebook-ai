I also learned to look into what the self is and to question how the self is defined. I learned to analyze and evaluate different ideas and that sometimes seemingly opposing ideas can be combined together.",

Through understanding different systems of thought, my favorites being Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic and Leibniz's Monadology, I improved my logical thinking and critique skills.",

                "Strengths: The content of the class is interesting. The philosophy in the second half of DS is definitely more challenging but that can be fun. Weakness: The content can be challenging, Szabo is a bit harsh on papers",
                "The second half is much stronger than the first half.",
                "In a word, DS is great. But DS Philosophy could focus more on your interpretations and insights, and a bit less on just understanding the text.",
                "Strengths: the spring semester syllabus and material for DS Philosophy is fascinating and engaging \r\nWeaknesses: the pace of the course, but this is a feature of DS generally",
                "It is really for people that are passionate about academia, and that is in reality both its strength and weakness. It attracts the same sort of people, but if you're not in that sort of mindset, you'll struggle, especially with philosophy. This applies to the rest of the DS curriculum.",
                "The pace of the course often made it feel like we didnt get to discuss philosophers enough. I think removing a few texts could be valuable (spending less time on Kant for example, or removing Kierkegaard) to give us more time for others. I also feel like we missed out on a large group of philosophers by not reading Hegel (which allows us to read Marx and potentially Foucault)",
                "The philosophy lectures were a great way to get a condensed and straightforward summary of each thinkers' main arguments, and I think the learning experience could be improved through a more structured seminar. Since I wasn't familiar with the texts we were reading and sometimes struggled to get clarity on basic concepts, it would have been helpful to have a set agenda with topics we would cover in depth. I think that the seminars mostly consisted of various students asking their own questions about the text, which although helpful, was not conducive to maintaining a continued conversation. Also, something I struggled with this year was understanding how to best participate or structure papers in a philosophy class, since students usually have less of a background in that field compared to something like literature. It would be really helpful if professors can provide outlines on how to structure the essay.",

                "On DS philosophy in general: If you're on the fence about DS because you are not sure whether you want to take philosophy, I would say that the strength of the other two tracks and the fact that you will at least find some philosophers who totally change your view of the world make it worth it. As someone without philosophy experience, learning about immaterialism and monads was hard and Kant is difficult to read, but by the end, I truly felt like I had an introductory grasp of Western philosophy, and I'm very glad that I got to get it in a seminar with peers who often would be very knowledgeable and a professor who was active in facilitating discussion. \r\n\r\nOn this section: Prof. Szabo is good philosophy professor and very knowledgeable, but if you want someone who creates agendas for discussion sections and offers lots of office hours and feedback, perhaps look into other sections. Prof. Szabo is involved with his students and does offer feedback on essays and office hours by appointment, but you get the sense that out of his classes, a first-year philosophy seminar is probably not his top priority (which is okay and understandable and he was still incredible to learn from, but there are other philosophy professors who may have different priorities).",
                "This course provided a thorough survey of philosophers influential to the Western cannon, and I think that even if you're not interested in going into philosophy, it provides a good framework for how thought has evolved, particularly how. we come to understand the self and how we process experience. As a student, I thought that the spring philosophy prompts were more challenging compared to the fall, since the systems of thought became more rigorous.",
