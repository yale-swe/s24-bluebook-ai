                "The weekly homeworks are a huge problem with this course. They take a tremendous amount of time to figure out and are way more demanding than whats taught weekly in class. On top of that, feedback takes forever to get since grading goes so slowly, so you spend most of the semester not really knowing what your total grade is. Fundamentally the content of the course is also not interesting but that cant be fixed.",
                "Strengths: Professor McKay is a really nice and fun professor, and I learned a wide range of concepts and got the chance to apply all of them. The midterms were fair and not too hard, and the psets helped me practice the content we learned in class, even though they were very writing-intensive at times. Even though I didn't go to any, it was also nice to have optional discussion sections at a lot of different times. Weaknesses: The pacing could be faster, especially because there was material that the professor would like to spend more time on at the end of the semester but wasn't able to. The grading was also done in a rush, so it was wildly inconsistent between different people, and prevented us from getting much useful feedback in a timely manner. However, I'm not sure how this could be improved in a course of 300 people, where everyone is writing long proofs and the graders only have so much time to devote to the class.",

                "Prof. McKay is great. Office hours and discussion sections were good and very helpful. Course was a bit disorganised though with getting problem sets out and with grading in a timely matter.",
                "Strengths: I liked the pace of lecture - I felt like it was just fast enough that I couldn't zone out (or else I would be lost), but just slow enough that I had time to jot everything down and think about it for a second before we moved on to the next topic. Also, the pset problems were pretty entertaining (they had elaborate backstories as to why the character in the problem needed to achieve the specific task that you had to solve), which I appreciated. Also strength: Xifan's office hours!! Weakness (kinda): Dylan was always trying to get us to go to section but.. I really did not understand what going to section was for and I never went.",
                "good course",
                "Dylan McKay is a good instructor and the course was well organized plus the grading was mega generous",
                "Professor McKay is a huge strength! He took on a huge task this semester given the 300 students enrolled. But he rose to the challenge and created a very enjoyable course. He also had the help of a huge staff of TFs and ULAs who could offer help at practically every hour of the day. Although the content was challenging at times, the support from course staff ensured everyone would realize success.",
                "The class is extremely well taught. Lectures are very easy to digest, and since they are recorded, it is also easy to go back and review anything that may be confusing. Prof. McKay also set up several resources for students who were falling behind on certain topics, with MANY office hours options, discussion sections, and peer tutoring. The class sets every student up for success, it is up to the students to decide whether they want to engage with material or not. \r\n\r\nI personally cannot identify any weaknesses of the class, the lecture was very engaging and the course staff was very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Content is very, very cool. The proofs are fun and satisfying to complete.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture is dull. Professor talks too slowly, but then rushes through the hard parts of the proof. The book is far more effective in my opinion, and perhaps this is reflected in the fact that no one went to lecture. He should post the full syllabus of what he's going to cover. He started to do this at the beginning of the year and then got lazy with it as time progressed. Makes it harder to come prepared for class.",
                "I would say that the lectures were well organized but did not explain *how* to do the problems, Prof McKay would just go through examples of them. Unfortunately, this left me pretty lost most of the semester in terms of starting problems. \r\n\r\nAlso, several hours of office hours are basically required. Im sure there were people, but I dont know anyone who was able to do the PSETs without office hours. While office hours are a very good resource, a minimum of several hours to do decent on the PSETs is too much. The course also tried to incorporate 2x a week discussion sections. These were optional but the professor did make it seem like you would need them to do really wellwhich just isnt practical.",
                "I personally really enjoyed the content, but the course could be paced quicker.",
                "Class is way too easy. I feel like we could've learned so much more in the same amount of time. Lectures were good though. I wish problem sets were longer and more difficult.",
                "Strengths: office hours (frequency, quality); Weaknesses: Some of Professor McKay's lectures felt a bit rushed.",
                "The material was well taught. The professor was excellent. However, the organization of the class needs work. The first exam was written without much proofreading, causing much confusion after the fact. Grading is very arbitrary. Undergraduates should not be allowed to be involved in grading. Only PhD students should grade.",
                "Strengths: The topics are very relevant, teaching is clear, only 2 midterms and 10 psets. Weaknesses: Some homeworks are much harder than others, even though all are weighted equally.",
                "Strength: well structured, great lectures, great teaching staff (probably the best CS class Ive ever taken as a CA major) \r\nWeakness: none!",
                "Strength: a lot of OHs",
                "One of the best CS classes at Yale. Good examples, intuitive understanding. Very strong TF team.",
                "The lectures were great. The abundant textbooks felt like very helpful resources, even just knowing they were there if needed. The grading and the office hours and sections felt a little ad hoc.",
                "The course is one of the best taught courses I've taken in computer science, but the exams were frustrating since many of the decisions for them were made last minute (resulting in one exam having an incorrect question), and since grade distributions for the exams were never released.",
                "If you have prior competitive coding experience, this class wont feel that challenging. The psets are a good level of difficulty but it often felt tedious writing out the entire proofs rigorously. If algorithms are new to you, the powerpoints and content are taught rather well so you will get a good amount out of this class,",
                "Strengths: I think having the content follow the Algorithms Illuminated textbook was helpful. Prof. McKay's lectures were different enough that it didn't feel like he was copying the contents of the textbook, but similar enough that if you wanted a second source to support the lecture content, it was there. Many students complain that Yale's Algorithms class is theoretical instead of implementation based/practical. In my opinion, the problem sets were difficult but really interesting and helped me understand a lot of the content in a much deeper way than I would have if I were simply implementing algorithms. Coming away from this class, I feel very comfortable with the content that implementation, esp for recruiting, comes a lot more naturally and intuitively. Additionally, Prof. McKay is a very reasonable and fair professor when it comes to issues outside of lectures. He was happy to work with students, check in on the difficulty of the problem sets, etc and seemed to genuinely care about how he was teaching the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was Prof. McKay's first semester teaching Algorithms at Yale. The lectures felt very disorganized, especially as the semester went on. There were a few lectures that were supposed to cover very important topics, but it seemed like he had not adequately prepared the lectures or thought through how he was going to teach them. By the end of the semester, I was reading textbooks instead of going to the lecture because it became very hard to follow. Second, I think the schedule of the midterms was a terrible system. Midterms were taken in the evenings on weeknights. However, Prof. McKay would test on topics he taught EARLIER IN THE DAY of the midterms on top of new topics that were presented that week. The course should be better organized and timed such that we have ample time to learn and study the midterm content, instead of trying to learn things in the hours between the lecture and midterm. Lastly, the course organization itself could have been better. This is a trivial issue but was just a small annoying part that spoke to larger organizational issues of the class. The canvas pages with syllabus, readings, topics, etc was not regularly updated and they simply just stopped updating it halfway through the course. It was hard to keep track of what we did and did not cover or were expected to know because the lecture schedules got moved around or changed as the course went on.",
                "This course was really well structured, had fair exams and homeworks, and they really covered the knowledge in the course well! That being said, the course could have covered a lot more, or gone further in depth with a few concepts; lectures kind of tended to drag on for a while about one concept. Besides that, though, everything was great!",
                "Courses were overall good! I have no suggestions!",
                "This course was all around a very good course. Professor Mckay was one of the best computer science professors Ive had. There was also a lot of support and helped given in this course. The homeworks were also very well written and really stretched my brain to the max.",
                "The course was very well taught and organized, however the only thing is that sometimes there were errors in the midterms or psets that made the problem far harder (nearly impossible) than intended.",
                "The class is very well-organized and well-taught in that every concept is explained to the very details and lots of examples are given for students to understand the materials. The homework problems are also good practices. There are also a myriad of ULA/TA resources (dozens of sessions each week), so students need can be readily fulfilled. The exams are very closely related with class materials and are definitely manageable if one has understood everything covered in class.",
                "Algorithms is a super interesting course. I wish we spent more time on being able to solve harder problems. We would get previews but never were expected to really excel on psets and push ourselves too much. I was able to do all of them without office hours, which sometimes cost me a couple points on proofs, but was a shame because I missed out on the benefits of harder psets and oh. Professor is a good lecturer and cares about the course. Very knowledgeable and engaging. Exams are always a mixed bag. Tbh the true false unsure questions are awful. Generally exam questions are fun and not too crazy although the final had a dp problem with 4 base cases, which was more than we had seen but not too hard. The true false unsure questions are the worst part of the course by far because its a mind game to try and balance your score and decide if you want to be conservative or shoot higher, which would work if grade cutoffs were announced before exams, but they werent. An A was a 95 or above which is just something to be aware of. Overall a required course and a good one that challenges the way you think. Small issues with inconsistency in grading and communication, but still worth it by far.",
                "strengths: ta support, weaknesses: especially with the harder topics (dynamic programming) I found dylan's lectures to be boring",
                "The course was very well organized. There were a lot of resources to provide support if needed. The professor was very engaging and truly cared about the intellectual development and well being of his students.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Great TAs + course manager\r\n- Dr. Mckay's lectures are clear and it is evident he cares a lot about teaching and the course. \r\n- You learn a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Weekly problem sets that could take ~15-20 hours felt like a bit overkill. It was difficult to prepare for a midterm when you just had a huge problem set due the previous week. I've heard others talk about how in previous iterations there were ~6 problem sets, with one being a 202 recap. This class teaches you a lot but it is a constant grind from day one. \r\n- Exams were hard, although they were graded pretty leniently. \r\n- Almost an 'anti-curve' where you needed a 95 for an A.",
                "Strengths: I thought Professor McKay's lectures were clear, and I liked the challenge and length of the problem sets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor McKay's lecture style involves asking a lot of questions of the class, and as lecture attendance dwindled, very few people ended up participating in the lecture, which could get awkward. I sometimes felt like lectures were a bit slow, and I wish the department would bring back the option of Advanced Algorithms (CPSC 366).",
                "Strengths: The ULAs!  The constant office hours were very helpful and they helped me understand the content so much.  The late policy was really generous and very helpful because the problems could be very difficult and/or if people had personal things or other work to attend to, it gave them some flexibility.   I think McKay is a great lecturer and genuinely cares about students and going to his office hours was also very, very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses:  This is probably not a weakness because it will help us in the long run but this class was tough! It was very demanding timewise and mental capacity wise."

                "ABSOLUTELY NOT",
                "Absolutely not. The class is very tedious and boring and the workload is very high. The psets assigned are intentionally very difficult and take a lot of time to finish. Same can be said for the two midterms. The class is only survivable with gratuitous ULA help. Unfortunately its a requirement for the CS major so anyone taking it doesnt really have a choice so sorry to you folks.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about algorithms or think you would use them for something.",
                "Definitely, as someone who isn't a comp sci major and doesn't have much comp sci background, I feel like this class has opened my mind to a whole new and different way of thinking. It was my favorite class this semester!",
                "Yes! Even if you're not a CS major, I think it's a great way to develop computational thinking skills, although some of the topics might be a bit pedantic if you're not already interested in CS. Highly recommend.",
                "If you love math, problem solving, or brain teasers, it's great!",
                "Yes. Professor McKay is great and there are a lot of office hours and student support, it is a great introduction to algorithms.",
                "If Prof. McKay is teaching algorithms, take it with him. I've tried to take this class previously and had to drop because I wasn't understanding it. Much clearer and easier to learn from Prof. McKay",
                "Good introduction to theoretical computer science. Currently required for CS majors, but I would also recommend it to anybody with a strong proof based math background as a computer science gut.",
                "Probably one of my favorite CS classes so far in that there is basically no coding but lots of training on your problem solving skills with respect to problems that you might get in research, SWE interviews, or more. There's really great TA support from review sessions to lots of OH and discussion section, and Prof McKay and the course staff are very receptive to student feedback. At least 5-8 hours on PSETs just to break down problems and write it up, but the paradigm building that you get around algorithms is incredibly useful.",
                "yea, intro to algos",
                "You're only taking it because it's required",
                "Yes, the material is very interesting and fun",
                "Yes! Youre probably taking this for some sort of requirement, but I would recommend this course even more broadly. You dont need extensive programming experience. Just some basic background in discrete math would suffice!",
                "Yes absolutely. Since it is a required class for computer science, most students are taking it because it is required. However, I would like to specifically recommend Prof. McKay's version of the course because it is very well taught and organized. Since this is his first semester teaching the course, I expect future semesters to be even tighter.",
                "Yes honestly. I think this course teaches you a new way to think and view the world. If you have any interest in proof based math, I think it's a very cool class to take. It's aimed at CS students, but I think offers useful lessons to all.",
                "If youre taking this course, you probably have to.",
                "I would recommend this to any student with a logical mind.",
                "Yes, probably my favorite course in my first year.",
                "Take CPSC 366 because CPSC 365, at least this semester, was a mickey mouse class.",
                "Yes. It was a great introductory course in Algorithms.",
                "It is a requirement.",
                "This is a good course to take for anyone looking to do CS related jobs",
                "Yes! Its required for CS but if you are interested in this aspect you will not go wrong if you take it with Dylan McKay. I learned so much!",
                "You have to take it if you are cs major",
                "Yes. For sure.",
                "Would recommend! If it's required for your major, obv, but even if it's not... Even if you don't have much programming experience! Take it, try it out, can always drop it if it's not your thing... But it's really interesting! These core CS classes, and even the elective ones, I think they really shape the way you look at the world. Data structures, algorithms, OOP, they're all frameworks, mindsets, paradigms, and they're really cool.",
                "This is a required course for computer science, but would otherwise be with taking if you are interested in solving interesting computing problems and enjoy proofs",
                "Yes if they dont have prior competitive coding experience. Otherwise, Id recommend taking the more intensive version of algos (CPSC 366).",
                "I would. I believe that this course teaches one the fundamental skills necessary to be a successful programmer.",
                "It's required for the CS major! But it's also a really interesting class and helps you think about algorithm structure a lot, especially if you don't know a lot about it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Good course to take if you want to land a tech job.",
                "I would recommend this course. It was one of the best computer science courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "No.",
                "Definitely. Mckay is a super engaging and the thorough professor. He takes his time to make the lectures digestible. Although the material can be boring, Mckay is funny and tries to make it more interesting which is really appreciated. Since this class has people from many different math/cs backgrounds, I think his accommodating teaching style and the teaching staffs commitment to discussion sections was really admirable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in computer science, since it sort of provides a new way to think of the world in terms of algorithms and finding patterns.",
                "Yes to both CS and non-CS majors. This class covers the fundamentals of algorithm design and analysis, which are both very helpful for any technical task. Also the class is well-taught so it might save you some time from self-studying.",
                "Take it if youre interested in algos. Theyre very cool and a fascinating new way of thinking. Although there are many pros and cons to the course, ultimately theres nothing that should discourage you if you are interested in the content. Be prepared for some frustrations with organization and communication, but also be prepared for fascinating lectures and content",
                "If you need to take it, yes. I wish the harder topics were taught in a way that was more engaging because Algorithms as a subject is so fascinating",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course and Dylan is fantastic!",
                "Yes, Prof. McKay was a great lecturer and the course was very well designed to facilitate learning. Additionally, the content learned is pretty useful.",
                "Yes, I would. Depending on the detail of your proofs, the class is a fair amount of work, but it's rewarding. We covered a lot of different types of algorithms, which I think will be very helpful--both for CS in general, and for coding interviews. Some of the algorithms were really clever, and I personally enjoyed writing proofs.",
                "I do recommend taking this course with McKay but make sure to pad the rest of your semester with some lighter workload classes.  I am a CPAR major who took it and I would recommend it to CPAR majors who want more CS in their curriculum and to improve how you view and solve problems.",
