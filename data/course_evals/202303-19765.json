We touched on some design history, learned to design a typeface, used softwares like indesign as well as hands on making and book making, we learned how to set print settings and how to print materials, how to choose paperstock, and how to talk about your work. I learned a lot through seeing my peer's work and also seeing the examples Alice would bring in and show. In critique, we learned how to critique others works and generate feedback. It was a good glimpse into what graphic design might be like professionally, and I especially appreciated it when Alice and our TF Claire would talk about their work and their professional careers and journey with design."

                "The strength of this class is that there is so much time for feedback from your peers and Alice, and you get a lot of rounds of critiques before getting to the final critique. There's also a lot of projects in this class and we are working on them all simultaneously, which allows you to put in the lessons you learned from one project and apply it to the next. One weakness is that some of the projects had a lot of guidelines on them (i.e. book cover project felt very limiting because we were given the book to design a cover for), and I wish we had more creative freedom.",
                "Strengths: Good range in different assignments (posters, book-making, designing a typeface) with different phases to develop each one further\r\nWeakness: Jumping back and forth between projects was nice in that it allowed you to explore more and take a break from one and come back with a new perspective, but I also felt like this resulted in some confusion and forgetting what was mentioned at the last crit about it. Would have also appreciated more classes not being a crit.",
                "Great teaching and personal feedback from Alice, but sometimes confusing feedback from students that may clash with the recommendations of Alice and Claire.",
                "Strengths: Alice is wonderful as a professor. She always gave thoughtful, useful, and actionable feedback. Her feedback was always insightful and given in a skillfully gentle way. Alice is also deeply supportive, and I feel that she really has our best interest in mind and is flexible and generous with her support. I thought the course set up and the structure was incredibly effective, I thought notion was a great organizational tool and acted as an effective point of reference for deadlines and assignments. We covered such a wide variety of assignments, and I really appreciated the multiples round of revision and the sort of rotating array of assignments we had. Looking back, I'm really impressed with just how much we covered and how much work we were able to do in one semester. It feels really fulfilling. Each assignment was well designed and always left enough room for your own creativity. Our TF Claire, from the MFA program was also always incredibly helpful and willing to support us. Claire, like Alice, was similarly thoughtful and gave great critiques and was a cool presence to have in class. I think they did a great job fostering a friendly and supportive environment for the class. Like intro to graphic design, I felt that there was a great sense of community in the class and I think a lot of us bonded over the assignments and our time spent printing in the annex. The class can be a little time intensive, but I think it is definitely manageable, and our page on notion and the syllabus effectively allowed you to look ahead and plan ahead, and I think you definitely get back what you put in. Critique time was effective and it was always inspiring to see other people's work. No major weaknesses stand out to me. One small thing would maybe be that I would've liked a round of feedback or maybe a check in for the typographical journal perhaps midway through the semester."
