    "I learned probably around 1000 Chinese characters, I learned the mechanics behind different grammar structures instead of having to rely on my (often-wrong) intuition, I learned how to speak and write coherent paragraphs, and I got a lot more comfortable just speaking Chinese on a day-to-day basis.",
    "I learned about reading, writing, and speaking in this class. I also learned about different aspects of Chinese culture.",
    "A lot of Chinese.",
    "Learned a lot of Chinese characters as well as the functions of various grammatical structures.",
    "As a heritage speaker, I went into the course thinking that I already knew a lot of what I was going to learn, but that wasn't true at all. I was learning something new every lesson, whether it be a grammar structure (grammar in Chinese was something that I never thought about before) or a piece of Chinese history!",
    "Chinese words and grammar in casual life.",
    "I learned a lot of Chinese in this class. This class does teach you a lot of reading, writing, and speaking. You also learn hundreds of characters which is quite amazing. It's a great class, but a lot of work.",
    "Learned a lot in the way of reading and writing and improved my vocabulary and spoken fluency a bit."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: you learn a lot. Chinese 132 is pretty intense, though apparently not as much as the non-heritage classes, since learning characters and more formal vocabulary is the main focus of the class instead of basic grammar. After taking the class, I feel like I have a much better grasp on a lot of grammar and vocab that I didn't have previously at all. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really didn't like how we learned characters in the first half of the class, when we had to hand in our 10 characters written 10 times each every day. I feel like there are better ways to learn characters than just by having to write them over and over in a row, like by using flashcards. The classes themselves also felt a little repetitive in the beginning, but that's understandable since we were just starting, and the last half of the class picked up considerably.",
    "I really like the way the course is run. It has helped me to learn a lot even though it is hard. It might be helpful to have review sometimes to go over things we have learned before as it felt hard to remember everything before while keeping up with the pace of the course.",
    "A really good first year heritage course! The professors are incredibly kind and helpful and genuinely want their students to succeed.\r\n\r\nIf anything, a possible issue is that many of the students are coming in with different language backgrounds and skill sets, and while the professors do the best they can to account for it, it still definitely affects the dynamics of the class. Not sure what else could be done about it, however.",
    "Provides a fast introduction into the Chinese language.",
    "Though the workload is high, it definitely is balanced--I never felt overwhelmed. The level of workload (homework every night, quizzes every morning, exams\/essays\/presentations almost every other week) really pushed me to improve my understanding of Chinese. However, I feel that a better textbook can be used; the one we use has some poorly written passages.",
    "Almost everything about this class is fantastic. Lectures are engaging, professors are very kind, helpful, understanding, and good at teaching, assignments have just the right amount of challenge. The only thing (very small) thing I would change is the weight of multiple choice questions on the test. They are weighted too much compared to everything else.",
    "This course is a lot of work. This is both a strength and a weakness because it is probably the only way you can learn a lot of Chinese, but it really is a lot of work. I don't know if it could be any other way while allowing you to learn as much as you do.",
    "Sometimes it was hard to know what information was really important or not, because the powerpoints all followed the same format but we would talk in class about other things."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! I learned so, so much in Chinese 132 and don't regret a single bit. It's a lot of work, but any language class is. As a heritage speaker, I really loved being able to be more fluent in my conversations with my parents and grandparents and use what I learned in class to talk to them in Chinese in person and on WeChat\/over text. Taking 132 was so rewarding for me because it felt like the completion of what I had started before.",
    "I would recommend this course if they want to study chinese and really learn it well - if they only want a language credit, this is a hard course. It is worthwhile if you put in the effort and actually want to learn chinese.",
    "Yes, especially if you're a heritage speaker trying to finally learn Chinese in a formal setting. Class everyday is surprisingly not bad and you bond with the other students in the class a lot. The one-on-one tutors are also really helpful and engaging.",
    "Yes.\r\n\r\nThis is a good course for students who have a Chinese cultural background and\/or have had some exposure to the language at home.",
    "I 100% recommend this course to another student! Although the workload leans toward the higher side, it really is worth it. I came into the class knowing how to write virtually 0 characters and now, one semester later, I can write essays in Chinese! My pronunciation has also improved (according to my mom).",
    "This is the most solid class I have ever taken. The professors are so nice, fun, and understanding. Classes are small and engaging. Homework is very manageable, probably around an hour a day. Grading is lenient, and the professor takes into account improvement as well. Tests can be a little strenuous though, not because of difficulty, but primarily because they are very long (there just is never enough time within the actual class time to finish, we always take an extra 10 min or so). The final was a pain, but again, not too difficult. Would strongly recommend if even contemplating learning Chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! If you want to learn a lot of Chinese and you're willing to put in the work, you will get a lot out of this class. The professors are great and my classmates were great too!",
    "It seems like a lot of work but it's really not terrible, and the professors are really nice. You'll learn a lot and the class is honestly a lot of fun because by the end, you get to know the people in your class and your professors pretty well."
