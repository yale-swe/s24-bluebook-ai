   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course lie with the Liang Laoshi, who makes the daily grind of class fun and interactive. I think the level of work was also a strength, because though there is a significant amount, it is spread out in a regulated way that makes it easy to keep up with daily. In terms of weaknesses, I wish there were more interaction between students speaking during the class period.",
    "Strengths: everything, this class is testament to the beauty that is the Yale Chinese department\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Well structured, set up well for learning.",
    "a very fast-paced class (if you took L1\/L2 it is SIGNIFICANTLY faster paced) but if you have the time to commit to learning everything in the time given its a great class, if not it is very stressful",
    "The strengths of this course are: \r\n-Liang Laoshi!!! \r\n-Speaking practice in class\r\n-Essay writing (with teacher revisions)\r\n-Mandatory work with characters\r\n\r\nThe only things that I think could be improved: \r\n-A bit more practice with listening\r\n-Some of the Quia assignments are quite hard!",
    "Strengths:\r\nParticular emphasis on character writing and pronunciation which suited my needs well\r\nI enjoyed the partner discussions we had in class and found them to be helpful for developing ideas on the spot in Chinese\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
    "A strength is that the course is rigorous and we learn a lot. A weakness is that the course is sometimes too rigorous, especially in homework workload and strictness in grading. It is really hard to balance this course with the rest of my workload."

    "Without a doubt. I took the class because I'd taken Chinese in high school and wanted to fill the language requirement and now am thinking about sticking with it all the way through because of the incredible teachers (the entire Chinese department is incredibly kind and welcoming).",
    "Yes. Great teachers, great curriculum, great everything.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to develop their proficiency in Chinese.",
    "Occasionally the work feels like endless busy work. I would only take this class if you seriously want to learn Chinese.",
    "yes if you really care about improving your chinese! my chinese definitely improved a lot but its also an extremely difficult course",
    "If you are genuinely committed to improving your Chinese then yes, take it! However, make sure you are prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Yes. I was an important stepping stone between beginners and advanced level because we really focused on specific skills. I also enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes, the course is a lot of work but the work all has a purpose and helps you learn.",
    "If one has the time, he or she should take this course. However, taking this course requires a great sacrifice in terms of time, and I worry that it is not practical for most."
