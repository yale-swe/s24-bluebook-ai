    "Scattered (but fairly broad) knowledge about many aspects of ancient Egyptian history, even including some basic hieroglyphics.",
    "All sorts of information pertaining to ancient Egyptian culture from the origins to the New Kingdom. Interesting class that covers the basics and exposed me to a culture I never otherwise would have studied and come to admire.",
    "I learned a significant amount about Egyptian history, the history of Egyptology itself, and a whole lot about Egyptian ceramic fabrics.",
    "Developed research skills and the combining of information from a variety of sources into coherent ideas for written assignments. Developed historical writing skills and basic Egyptian Hieroglyphic language skills in the context of interpreting Ancient Egyptian archeological papers."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: small class (because its a first year seminar), very passionate and kind professor, flexible schedule\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are sometimes a little unorganized and it is often difficult to take notes in a logical order that will be helpful later on when studying. Also, most of the lecture slides online are close to useless without context, so reviewing the slides to study is not very practical.",
    "Strengths: Fun and engaging. As a first year seminar, can also be easily tailored to one's specific interests on the subject. You learn a lot and get a very solid understanding of the basics of the subject.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The PowerPoints are either extremely specific or not at all. The amount of content to be learned is overwhelming, which is normal, except that one is never certain as to whether they should learn the larger concepts or the very specific details. The uncertainty makes studying difficult."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are VERY interested in Egyptian history. The topics we go into are very specific (like the different fabrics of pottery) and very involved, which can get a little mundane if you are not really really interested in ancient egypt as a whole.",
    "Yes. Having a STEM background, this was a step out of my comfort zone but was well worth the trouble. It has spurred in me a newfound interest in Ancient Egypt."
