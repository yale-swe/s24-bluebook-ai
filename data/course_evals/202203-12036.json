                "this class totally shifted my perception on so many different things, from animal rights to capitalism. I learned a ton and it was fascinating. I also got to engage in a style of writing that was much less academic and very different from other Yale classes, which was an awesome experience.",
                "My worldview was completely transformed after this class. I learned to think about animal activism and the more-than-human world in a way that felt right to me, in that it addresses anthropocentrism, colonialism, imperialism, industrialization, slavery and science as ideologies that shape our understanding of the nonhuman.",
                "I learned more about the relationship between humans and animals during the Anthropocene from a variety of perspectives. The course feels like it could be an anthropology, american studies, environmental science, philosophy, or religion course. I learned to connect disparate texts and to work to unpack systems of oppression and violence.",
                "This was the first anthropology course I'd taken, so I learned how to write papers in the style of anthropologists.",
                "This course taught me about multispecies worlds; how all species are interconnected, and the terms humans vs nature\/animals is highly exclusive.",
                "Totally changed my perspective on the role our species plays on our planets stage.",
                "I learned all about the systemic causes and effects of global climate change, as well as ways humans can reimagine their relationships to animals, plants, and the entirety of the world around us. I also was able to greatly improve my ethnographic writing skills."

            "comments": [
                "Strength: great readings, short papers were a good format to summarize what we learned in each unit, workshopping sessions were super helpful. Weakness: I think not everyone was on the same wavelength, given that the class does push you out of the academic norm where we're asked to write in first person, attune to our subjectivities, and think beyond reason\/intellect. Because of that, sometimes our class discussion did not feel most productive. But it is a really good class.",
                "Strengths: The books each week are incredibly interesting and probably the highlight of the course. Professor Dudley encourages you to only read the sections that interest you which adds to the enjoyment (and makes the book-a-week syllabus manageable). Professor Dudley and Kate McNally are both very kind and generous people. \r\nWeaknesses: The class conversations often felt like glorified reading responses (an hour of class is spent going around sharing what you learned that week). I also felt like there was a specific answer that Professor Dudley often wanted to students to reach which made the discussions feel a bit more orchestrated or performative. I would have liked to get a bit grittier\/down-to-earth with the conversations. The papers were okay but I didn't take away all that much (admittedly partly because I wasn't fully engaged with them).",
                "strengths: some of the books (esp. The Wake of Crows and Porkopolis), the general intention of the class--the ways in which it wants to push students to analyze and think the world they inhabit\r\nweaknesses: class time was not spent well, there was little actual conversation or collaborative thinking--we didn't really get anywhere! (in large part because of the practice of going around the room and having everyone say something about the readings, which took up the majority of many class meetings--especially unnecessary because of the [therefore somewhat gratuitous] reading responses); the rigidity of format for the reading responses and especially the papers.",
                "Strengths- course brought together a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives on multispecies worlds, and the reading load was really reasonable while being very interesting; Weaknesses- the 3 essay prompts seemed to blend together and felt like they could have been structured differently to allow for more meaningful engagement with the text.",
                "strengths: The readings, hearing my classmates' very interesting analyses of the readings during class discussions, and our TA. I also enjoyed the few times we had small group discussions.\r\nweaknesses: The class discussions felt disjointed and forced. Professor Dudley wanted each of us to talk, so we went around in a circle and each said something about the readings until everyone had contributed. This guaranteed our participation, but many of us said something for the sake of it because we didn't feel ready to share, and many of us wanted to respond to something one of our peers had said but coundn't because the next person in line had to talk.",
                "Strengths: Great readings assigned! I also liked how we were encouraged to have class discussions on topics, where we could agree or disagree. I also liked how everyone had to speak at least once, as I am one of those students that tends to be shy and not speak as much, but this course pushed me to always voice my opinions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I sort of felt like I ended this course with no real conclusions. I have so many questions still, as the professor never really gave us concrete answers. How do we mend our relationship to nonhuman species? Should we all be vegan? Will animal cruelty across agriculture, culture, etc ever end and how? However, the topics we discussed were so massive and still unanswered so maybe this is the point.",
                "Discussions and feedback were very clear.",
                "This course was phenomenal. The books were engaging and illuminating, pushing me to see beyond the limits of my own imagination and past relationships with animals. I would most likely advertise to students that this course will be an intellectual, personal, and emotional challenge. I struggled greatly with many of the texts and believe I am better for it; yet, it did take a great deal out of me. I would warn students who may not be at a stage in their life to engage with these difficult materials on this level to ease their way into the course."

                "absolutely! it was an incredible class and I'm so glad I took it. it was completely unrelated to my major but was one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "YES! Please take this class if you want to think about the Anthropocene differently. The class will equip you with the language and analytical framework to articulate what it means to grapple with the legacies of colonialism, slavery, capitalism in an age of climate crisis.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to think pretty philosophically about human-animal relationships. The readings are excellent and varied. The class time itself sometimes dragged on and fell short of what I'd hoped. I hope future semesters change up the class format to allow for more free-flowing and generative conversation.",
                "I would not recommend the class that I took to another student. Based on conversations with those who have taken previous iterations of the course, I believe that at least some (and perhaps many or nearly all) of my deep frustrations with the class were due to its dramatically expanded size (relative to the other times it was taught). If that's correct, future editions might be well worth taking (as might a class of this size, if rethought pedagogically).",
                "I'd recommend this course if you want to write papers about human-nonhuman relationships in the Anthropocene. If you want to engage with these topics during class discussion, I would not recommend this course; our discussions were structured and rigid and therefore we did not have free-flowing conversations where we could easily respond to one another's comments.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. I would recommend this course to ANYONE with any mindset: vegetarians, meat-lovers, environmentalists, climate deniers. I believe this course had especially interesting and insightful readings that forever changed my thinking about multispecies worlds. The most impacting book for me by FAR was the photo book Hidden. I will never get those images out of my head, and I believe everyone should see these types of uncomfortable and violent images to truly understand the level of violence humans are imposing onto nonhumans.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Dudley is a leader in her field and sharing a classroom with her is a privilege",
                "Yes! In fact, I have recommended it to several students as a must-take course at Yale. Oftentimes, the threat of climate change can feel immense and terrifying, yet this course provided me with the intellectual capacity to examine its causes on a smaller scale. It is one of those courses that changes you so thoroughly that you will never be able to see the world in the same way."
