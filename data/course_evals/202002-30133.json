   "comments": [
    "I learned the mechanics behind macroeconomics and the differences of it from microeconomics. I learned about how economies react in the short run vs the long run and how GDP is calculated via different approaches.",
    "You learn basic macroeconomic concepts (Solow model, AS\/AD, monetary policy, etc.) and Professor Amand does a great job at tying in real world examples to make the material in the class more relevant and tangible. For example, we talked about the Great Recession of 2008, the Greek financial crisis of 2015, and the coronavirus recession.",
    "I gained an understanding for the basic principles of macroeconomics. Its a different way of looking at the world, and it adds to the microeconomics material that I had studied previously. There are also certain analytical skills which were gained.",
    "an introduction to the field of macroeconomics",
    "This course is great for giving anyone a basic introduction to how the US economy works in the aggregate. You learn all about recessions and booms, how they play out in recent events, and also the mechanics behind the Great Depression and Great Recession. It also gives you a crash course in GDP, growth, etc etc. I know now that I can pick up a newspaper and understand what is being said about interest rates, the Fed, monetary policy, which is empowering.",
    "AS\/AD curves. How to predict changes in short-run booms and recessions, and effects on inflation based on analyzing supply or demand shocks. How to make policy recommendations. How to predict long-term economic development. How to make economic models and test them empirically in the real world. How to understand the macroeconomic news in the world (e.g. what the Fed is doing, what is fiscal policy, what is up with banks).",
    "I got a great overview of what macroeconomics is, and learned ways to model economic growth and recessions\/booms.",
    "I had not taken a macroeconomics class before at Yale, and I found this one to be very interesting. I was able to look at the economy on a larger scale and for the first time learned how to use models to represent the intuitions that we were learning about in class. I also learned the details of the financial crisis and other economic events that I had heard mentioned before but had never fully understood.",
    "Macroeconomic models, long run, short run behavior of economies",
    "In this course I learned a general overview of important topics in macroeconomics. In addition, Prof. Amand focused the second half of the course, which, living through a period of enormous economic uncertainty, was very interesting.",
    "better understanding of the us economy as a whole and different interactions between firms as a larger whole",
    "More info than AP Macro but you use real life examples (Great Depression, Recession, COVID) to analyze what you are learning.",
    "Knowledge of the macroeconomy and some of the feedback loops that occur in general equilibrium.",
    "I developed a foundational knowledge of macroeconomics and a functional use of common models that economists may use.",
    "I learned about macroeconomics.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of how the world's economy functions, and simple models to explanation growth and discrepancies in a large-scale economy. I can confidently read articles on the Financial Times now and understand what's going on.",
    "I gained an understanding of the history, performance, structure, and behavior of the economy.",
    "Basic overview of macro.",
    "Learned about macroeconomic topics such as the determinants of long-term growth, short-run output fluctuations, inflation and central banking, and the current pandemic-induced recession.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the live lectures which served more as a discussion that highlighted key points and relevant topics. The only issue I had was the dated lectures that we watched in lieu of real lectures that followed the updated power point slides. Overall, it was a well run course given the circumstances.",
    "The class was well organized and the content was interesting. I liked the flow of the class and how each topic built upon the one before it. Because this was a summer session course, the pace was quite quick so there were often times where I wished we spent more time on the content, but the office hours and Piazza were super helpful supplemental resources.",
    "It was difficult to have so many streams of information. The textbook, prerecorded lectures, live classes. It sometimes seemed like there was too much repetition. But there were also differences between the sources which made the material difficult to keep track of.\r\nIt was great how Professor Amand allowed us to ask questions about current events.\r\nAlso, the textbook questions are different from what Professor Amand expects us to know. So it was sometimes frustrating doing the assignments.",
    "I greatly appreciated that participation was a component of our grade. I might not have participated otherwise, lowering my engagement with the course.",
    "Strengths: the professor! Marnix is a captivating lecturer, and he is able to break down economic explanations in ways that are palatable and make sense for newbies to the field. He's also really entertaining!\r\nWeaknesses: honestly none. I loved this class",
    "Strengths: Marnix and his European examples help give more scope than just the US economy. Marnix is also incredibly patient and sets entertaining questions (even if sometimes quite hard). Marnix is also super responsive to questions regardless of what they are. The quizzes are also amazing for testing understanding.",
    "Strengths -- the professor was very clear, and his lectures were engaging\r\nWeaknesses -- this is difficult in a summer course, but sometimes the number of videos we had to watch before class was very overwhelming and some of them turned out to not be on concepts we ever used in class. If there was some way to cut down on the sheer number of videos and focus a bit more on the really necessary material, that would be ideal.",
    "I thought that the class was very interesting and that the professor was very clear and easy to understand. I also really liked the review sessions before the exams and the interactive Zoom calls. For improvement, I think that the problem sets were not always super related to the material and since they were not graded, I felt like we never really went over how to apply our knowledge from class to those questions (it was fine because they were low stakes and not graded harshly, but sometimes that could make them a bit stressful).",
    "Well explained, I could understand the concepts from the lectures and book even though I did not take economics in high school. As a summer course, the tempo is very fast so be prepared to work aggressively.",
    "I think the strength of this course was that the larger topics were explained well, and had a good flow from concept to concept. I also appreciated how Prof. Amand focused on us understanding the big picture and revelant themes, rather than get bogged down in minor facts and equations. \r\nI also liked how Prof. Amand took a moment during each of our live lectures for us to ask questions about current applications of macroeconomics. It was very interesting to hear his thoughts on current trends and how they pertained to macroeconomics. \r\nI also thought the support structure in the course was very strong, with Prof. Amand allowing us to ask clarifying questions during our live lectures, answering questions online on Piazza, and Sourav holding office hours two days per week. \r\nOne weakness of this course was that for some lectures, the required video recordings were long, and for others, they were small. In terms of budgeting time it might have been nicer to have similar length video lectures to watch.",
    "This was no fault of this course specifically, but having two five week sessions rather than one ten week session where you can take more classes seemed like a poor choice and is not conducive to learning.",
    "Strength - Lots of help from the profs and TA\r\nWeakness - If it was one more week then I feel we couldve learned more information and it wouldve felt less rushed.",
    "I think this course glosses over some of the more interesting technical aspects of general equilibrium that would make it easier to understand the concepts that are covered.",
    "Strengths: the online form provided discussion sections for class times, and this enabled a strong understanding of the material that was brought up in lectures. Professor was awesome. TA had frequent and productive office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: we had to cut out some material because of time which was sad.",
    "I loved the flipped-classroom structure; it was so efficient and allowed us to completely devote our time to more nuanced explorations of the topics, students' questions, and applying macroeconomic concepts to current events. Great, great call by Prof Amand to have pre-recorded lectures and devote himself to students' questions and needs during actual classtime.",
    "This course had many strengths, I have no complaints",
    "Weakness was that it was much too fast-paced. I consistently felt as though I was drowning under work. I would recommend shortening the lecture videos.",
    "The course did very well at explaining macroeconomics concepts to someone with no prior background in the subject, like me. It's truly an introductory class, but is very fast-paced. Recorded lectures aren't great on their own, but they complement the textbook readings really nicely.",
    "The strengths was that it was well structured and well taught. The weakness was that the course was taught virtually so students are not able to ask questions while the lecture is being given, though it is understandable given the current circumstances.",
    "Well-organized and engaging. Seem to be a lot of 10 min lectures. Would be nice if less disrupted lectures for 25-30 mins at a time. Also, The videos are somewhat outdated in comparison to the slides.",
    "This course provided a solid foundation in the principles of macroeconomics. Perhaps the organization of the online lecture videos and live sessions could be improved, but I was generally satisfied with the course. I would have enjoyed more supplementary readings and materials, however.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I enjoyed the smaller class rather than the large lecture, because it allowed for more interaction and engagement with the professor.",
    "Yes! Professor Amand really makes this class worthwhile and the content is also well-organized and interesting. If you are curious about understanding things like the COVID recession, this is a great course to dive into to build that foundation.",
    "Yes",
    "I DEFINITELY recommend this course to all students. Either you find out that you like econ a lot and want to take more econ courses (like me), or you find out that it's not your cup of tea. Either way, you gain a lot of useful knowledge that I think everything should have.",
    "Yes. Well-organized for learning. Marnix is a good teacher. Intro econ classes at Yale are typically all quite amazing.",
    "Yes! I found this class fascinating, I feel like I know SO much more than I did just 5 weeks ago, and Professor Amand was great.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found the material engaging and interesting while also being practical and easy to understand. Whether or not you plan on majoring in something economics related, this knowledge is definitely very important to have.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was very interesting and Prof. Amand taught it extremely well.",
    "Yes, very helpful to gain an economic understanding of the world. I now see how countries have developed over the years and can better analyse news on my own.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The courseload was challenging but not overwhelming, and the amount of support available (through plentiful office hours as well as Piazza) allowed me to get all of my questions answered. In addition, it contains extremely relevant topics that will allow one to better understand current events, simply by knowing a little bit about macroeconomics.",
    "its a good course if you want to learn about our economy, and if youre an econ major you have to take it.",
    "Yes I would. Taking this as a summer class means there isnt a limit on the number of As so the class feels less competitive and more so that students are eager to learn.",
    "Yes. Macroeconomics is so different than microeconomics and the thinking doesn't transfer over. Plus, taking this class helps make sense of current events.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student! The lecture videos were great and the discussion sections were even better, and workload was doable.",
    "Yeah!",
    "Yes, excellent professor and important material",
    "Absolutely! It provides a clear insight into how the world economy functions at a larger level. It's focus on growth and modeling is particularly interesting to anyone interested in learning the basics on why the world runs the way it does (financially speaking).",
    "Yes! Even if you don't want to study economics, intro to macro is extremely relevant and applicable.",
    "Yes, because it was perfect for online.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about the ways economies function on a large scale. It is an engaging and interesting course that someone can learn and benefit from with no prior economics experience.",
