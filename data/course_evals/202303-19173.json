                "This class was good for exposure to many different aspects of Italian culture. I do think that it was difficult to connect with other students in the class and many students were disengaged during class. I think that more structured reading assignments could lead to more preparedness for class. Also, the minipresentations often felt like conversations with just the professor, so maybe if there was a more conversational component of the minipresentations, this could possibly increase discussion during class.",
                "The low workload allowed us to take the class stress-free and really focus on meeting our individual Italian goals.",
                "The course started quite well, with a written response due every Monday and a mini-presentation every Wednesday. I felt the workload was very doable (if anything a little light) and we learned a lot each class about Italian culture. However, the last month of class consisted mainly of watching an Italian Netflix TV show, which, while engaging, I felt perhaps detracted from our ability to learn more about Italian culture at the same speed that we did during the first half of the semester."

Anna is very open to student suggestions and the assignments and topics outlined in the syllabus are not exactly what you'll end up doing.  Also the class gives a lot of freedom in regard to the topics that you can research for homework assignments.",
