                "Pros\r\n- Shira is an amazing instructor! Her love for the stories is simply infectious. \r\n- There are no in-class exams\r\n\r\nCons\r\n- We wasted so much time with the student presentations. We should ideally have spent only 5-10 minutes on the student presentations before moving on to the more interesting class discussion. \r\n- There is too much homework. There should be one homework assignment per story.\r\n- Some stories take up 3 sessions. This is too much time for one story. Each story should have a maximum of 2 sessions to make room for more stories, especially those published after 1945.",
                "There was quite a lot of work. It was good for me because honestly I needed it to get back up to a high level of German, but I anticipated it being less and some of the readings in German were quite long.",
                "This is an amazing course. It's very fast paced, but you learn a lot.",
                "Although the texts explored by the course spanned multiple centuries, they were tied together well by the course topic, \"Das Fremde\". Shira masterfully facilitated advanced discussions of the texts, despite the fact that that this was a foreign language seminar. The weekly written and oral responses were quite a bit of work, but completely worth it--our in-class discussions really profited off of them, and my German improved over the course of the semester.",
                "This course was wonderful  Shira's syllabus was well thought-out and ambitious without being unattainable. Frequent reading and oral reflections ensured a steady improvement in my ability to express myself in written and spoken German and helped me focus my reading. The class included a mixture of group-work, presentations by peers and the instructor, and seminar-style conversation, which always made the class feel fresh and facilitated sustained engagement. Longer-term assignments gave us the freedom to engage very deeply with texts we were interested and learn to express nuanced thoughts in German.",
                "The strengths of this course was the amount of content to read assigned. We often read 10-20 pages per class, which was a good amount considering the difficulty of some texts. Another strength was the variety of texts.",
                "The course was time-intensive, but Professor Miron is an amazing instructor and she put a lot of time into the course, too. By taking this course I improved both my German language skills and my ability to analyze literature in any language. There is nothing I would change about this course.",
                "This course had a great selection of texts that all explored the theme of Fremdsein or the Foreign in interesting ways, therefore allowing us to build on our understanding of the concept in each text. The weekly seminar discussions really helped us to practice how to discuss themes with each other in German, and the instructor gave a presentation on the main themes for that selected text that week."
