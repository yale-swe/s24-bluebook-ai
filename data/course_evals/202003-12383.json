                "Overall, the course was great. Professor Lopez-Pena was extremely knowledgeable and engaging. Although the course was student-run (and this was the intention), I would have loved to hear more about Professor Lopez-Pena's own work and opinions on each of the articles and topics that we discussed.",
                "I really liked the materials in the course, but I wished that less time was spent on student presentations and more time was spent on discussion and Professor Lopez-Pena's insight and experience in research.",
                "Strengths: facilitated a lot of class discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the presentations every week could get a bit repetitive",
                "The course is what you make of it. The students do the readings and then present on it. It would be helpful if the professor could also spend time going over the main points of each paper and how it relates to global context of poverty. Very interesting readings however. More help and guidance from professor for final research paper as that was a really new process for me and could have used more office hours or formal guidance.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lopez gives you several chances to present to the class (1 20 minute presentation, and 2 5 minute presentations). This was the only class I've taken here that has had so many public speaking opportunities, and it was a very valuable opportunity in and of itself to learn how to give a TED-esque-style talk. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I believe this was the first time this course was offered so we were definitely working through some kinks, but I thought this class was good overall. Could've had fewer presentations per class in order to facilitate more discussion time.",
                "Strengths: great reading, great writing experience, great presentation experience. weakness: I wish Paula had given one class about appropriate data science methods.",
                "The subject matter of the class was fascinating and the large amount of student presentations gave everyone an opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the class material. Having said that, I do wish that there was more time for discussion rather than simply presenting.",
                "Strengths: good overview of topics in economic development, professor provides good feedback on presentations\r\nWeaknesses: format of the class was redundant, in that multiple students would present the same paper multiple times; discussion was pretty limited to econometric techniques over more substantive critiques",
                "I think the primary strength of the course is the literature included in the syllabus. Students get an interesting array of economics research in order to understand the psychological and economic determinants of poverty. This class touched on topics I hadn't really considered in economics before. One weakness of the course is the lack of support in performing your own empirical analysis at the end of the semester. For the range of comfort levels with econometrics in this class, it felt strange to just be sent off to do my own analysis. I would also say that expectations for each assignment were not clearly conveyed, so a lot of the work done in class was iterative in the sense that I would make mistakes the first go-around, get feedback, and finally get it right the next time. This could've been avoided if I just knew what I needed to do in the first place.",
                "Student taught, honestly a little tough to stay motivated to stay up to date with readings especially it being both online and student taught. Paula is such an amazing economist and I would have loved for there to be a little bit more lecture from the professor herself.",
                "Before classes, students are expected to read papers and class consists of multiple students presenting on these papers. Towards the end of the semester, some presentations were about our final project, but bottom line: this class is literally just listening to student presentations on the same topics or even same paper (since we chose from maybe 2-3 papers per week). These presentations needed to follow a specific structure, which made them super repetitive. On top of that, participation was required but the only way to participate each class was to ask individual questions to the presenters. Because the class was packed with back to back presentations, we had to keep questions and answers short and there was little to no room for discussion. In theory, this class is on a cool topic and the prof is brilliant I'm sure but this was just absolutely NOT conducive to learning, growth, or discussion of any kind. I also felt that the guidelines for assignments\/what was expected out of our final project\/feedback was not super clear throughout the semester, so I often felt lost.",
                "I thought the readings were very good, some more engagement from the professor might have added more value to the class but I understand that the format did not permit this.",
                "Almost all the allotted time was taken up by student presentations, followed by short discussions after each one. I would have liked to see more direct teaching from the professor, just about the key aspects of each topic."

This gave students lots of room to zone out after the first presentation, as much of the information would just be repeated in later presentations.

The papers we read were pretty interesting, but the format of the class presentations was rather dry, in that students would present the same paper over and over again. This would cut down the time we had for actual discussion, so I felt that I wasn't getting as much out of this course as I could have.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who is very independent and self-driven. The assignments are vague, and Professor Lopez-Pena has high expectations of her students. If you are motivated and you seek feedback\/help early and often, you will get a lot out of this class. Professor Lopez-Pena gives great feedback, especially on your presentations. I would not recommend this class if you aren't interested in hearing other students present the entire time (which might change) or if you don't feel ready to do your own empirical analysis.",
