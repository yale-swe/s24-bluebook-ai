                "I really enjoyed the personal level of engagement between the professor and student. Furthermore, I enjoyed how we were able to learn from each other's song critiques. I would only recommend that there would be more structure in the actual musical process of songwriting (developing melodies and harmonies) more so than lyric writing.",
                "This class was a lot of fun. Listening to professional compositions as a class was definitely one of my favourite parts, and it introduced me to a lot of great music from a variety of musicals. The set up of the course is typically each person plays their composition and Prof Rosenblum gives them feedback for about 15 minutes, which is useful on an individual level, but can make the course feel a bit slow, especially as it's virtual. I'd say that limiting each person's feedback to around 5 minutes in the group setting and emailing individual feedback would be more beneficial, as we'd then be able to spend the extra time looking at more works from shows and learning about form, etc.",
                "Strengths: I liked that each week had its own focus and I liked getting to hear everyones pieces and then to hear feedback given. Listening to examples was helpful, and the collaborative element with the lyric writing class was great. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like there couldve been more background at the beginning, not necessarily to the genre of musical theater but to composing as it relates to musical theater. I understand that its difficult because musical theater as a genre is much harder to pinpoint than something like jazz or classical, but I feel like itd be possible to discuss some basic rhythmic accompaniments, the basics of transitioning from verse to chorus or chorus to bridge, and other sort of structural pieces. \r\nAll of the feedback I got on work I submitted was super helpful\/invaluable, but I wished I had had more time at the beginning to feel like I had a clue what I was doing\/had some sort of basics to fall back on when trying to write accompaniment or just lay out a song structurally.",
                "I thought it was really good how the class eased you into the process of songwriting if you hadn't done it before - it started with an analysis followed by separate music and lyric writing assignments before asking students to combine it all into a full songwriting assignment.",
                "This is a strong course all around. It has a LOT of work, so be prepared, but its absolutely worth it."
