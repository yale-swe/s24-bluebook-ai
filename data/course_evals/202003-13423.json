                "I think that this was an extremely well-organized course that did a good job explaining a theoretical lens for understanding China as an authoritarian country. I think that it was extremely useful to look at new types of knowledge as well as ways of researching and presenting the information. We looked at theoretical perspectives, specific case studies, qualitative narratives, and quantitative studies. While China was our main focus, I think I really learned a lot about how stories can be told in political science.",

                "Many strengths to mention: good and varied selection of course readings, topics were interesting, discussion among students was always lively, the professor is great at facilitating discussion and adding his own insights.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wish I knew what topics\/readings we would be focusing on in seminar beforehand; not all topics and readings got equal discussion time, so this would have been helpful.",
                "Great content and professor, learnt a lot more about Chinese politics, very good class, wish discussions could have been deeper\/more oriented",
                "Strengths: Mattingly is a fantastic professor, I highly recommend taking a class with him. The book list. My classmates, many of whom had much more experience with China than I did. All things considered, our zoom seminar had great discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had found a way to make the 1 hand 2 hand system work so that class discussion could run more smoothly. Perhaps staying unmuted the whole time (unless there is background noise) would help the class vibe, so that Professor Mattingly wouldn't have to call on people and they could just jump in.",
                "This course was fantastic! The readings were excellent, Professor Mattingly facilitated wonderful discussions, and each class offered something new to be learned. Professor Mattingly's organization was a defining highlight to the course.",
                "This course was really good at keeping us all engaged. The structure including reading responses, a couple of minutes to gather our thoughts at the beginning of class, breakout rooms, and then overall discussion really helped facilitate conversation. Professor Mattingly did a fantastic job moving the conversation forward as well as introducing new topics throughout the seminar. I think that it was impressive how our conversations progressed as the semester continued, especially because so many seminars usually loop back to the same questions. Professor Mattingly did a great job making sure that we stayed on topic, which I appreciate. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by adding a bit more structure to the final essay. While there definitely were deadlines, it would have been helpful for me to have more iterative deadlines, especially since there was only one final paper.",
                "The strengths of the course are definitely Professor Mattingly and the careful selections of readings each week. I found the seminar discussions to be particularly helpful in hearing different perspectives and understanding key takeaways and Professor Mattingly is incredibly knowledgeable about a wide range of topics! The only suggestion would be to start with domestic politics then move to the international arena since the topics we covered toward the end of the course were interesting and important to understanding China's foreign policy.",
                "Taught super well, great class with an expansive set of literature",
                "I greatly enjoyed this course because it provided students an opportunity to study China from a variety of perspectives both in terms of its international relations and domestic affairs. The readings by academic authors were at times esoteric but mostly informative."

                "Similar to what I mentioned above, Professor Mattingly's use of time to reflect and breakout rooms was very helpful in the COVID-learning situaiton.

Discussion was always robust, my classmates were super thoughtful and always challenged each other (in a good way), and Professor Mattingly is a great teacher. \r\nIn my opinion, you'll get more out of this course if you have previous experience with China, academic or otherwise. Definitely a class geared towards upperclassmen.",

                "Absolutely! One of my favorite courses of all time. I came in with a decent background in many of the topics being discussed but came out of it with a much deeper and refined base of knowledge. Professor Mattingly is a fantastic teacher and I'm grateful to have taken this class! Definitely take it if you get the chance, wonderful class!",
                "If you have the opportunity to take this class and are remotely interested in China, take it!",
                "I definitely would recommend this course! Professor Mattingly is incredibly engaged both with the material and with the students in his class. It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about China and research design. However, I would say that it is very helpful to have some prior knowledge of Chinese history before entering this seminar. I think a lot of the depth would be lost without it. That being said, I think that this seminar should require that background, rather than take up time with too much historical background.",

                "absolutely, especially if you have a personal attachment to China.",
                "I would recommend this course to any students interested in doing a deep dive into China from a political science perspective. This course offers more detailed perspectives on matters which are only covered at a high level in introductory level courses."
