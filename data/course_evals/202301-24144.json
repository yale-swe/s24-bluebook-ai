                "The aim of the course seemed to be to develop a solid working knowledge base of the history of American culture by examining significant movements, events, and people. At other times, it seemed to be of a critical American studies class that wanted to evaluate a slew of movements. In both regards, the class had an aversion to any cohesive narrative or throughlines that killed any advantage of either approach. I ultimately left with a little more knowledge of American history (mainly from the readings, not lecture) and not much else.",

                "This course was so great and it really helped me develop as an historical thinker. I went into this class expecting more basic lecturing on historical events, but instead, I was introduced to not just this, but many different methods of historical thought. I was shown how different mediums, keywords, etc., influence our understanding of history. Thus, this class taught me about the development of American Culture over the last century AND about how we have thought about this development. This added insight was invaluable and caused me to have greater engagement with history and American Studies than ever before. Also, I had never written research papers before, so I really appreciated the opportunity to develop this skill.",

Weakness: The entire class was so disorganized and not engaging at all. The prof just rambled on and I left each class being very confused by what I was supposed to have taken away. I had a lot of trouble understanding how the syllabus and class lectures related and found the lectures to be Prof. Nyong'o rambling on about things that were unrelated or did not add to any level of understanding.",
                "Strenghts: some cool readings, interesting discussions in section\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are really scattered and unengaging, feels like there's little thru line between them (and sometimes inside of them), often seemed to do a poor job of connecting lecture, readings, and broader point of course.",
                "Strengths: The material that is covered and the readings are very interesting, enlightening, and make you think about America and your day to day life as an American differently and more critically. Discussion sections were also interesting and where the large majority of learning happened honestly.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I often was incredibly confused in lecture, there never really seemed to be an overarching theme or any idea of what the takeaways from the lecture were supposed to be. Lecture also sometimes failed to relate to the readings, which left the course feeling disjointed at times.",
                "Weaknesses: extremely unorganized class. Syllabus constantly changing. Grading expectations still unclear to me. \r\nStrength: TAs were invested in course",
                "Strengths: I liked the reading list, and the keywords and movies\/plays\/literature were a great addition to the class. Daniella was also a great TF!",
                "The readings and course material were insightful, but the course lectures were hardly related to the assigned readings and lectures were often hard to sit through and not beneficial to the whole understanding of the course.",
                "I think the discussion sections were a strength of the course as they helped me get a better understanding and see a through line among the texts, clarifying any questions I had. In terms of weaknesses, I felt that the lectures sometimes made it difficult to see the connection between the events discusssed.",
                "looked amazing on paper, but did not live up to my hopes in reality. selected readings were amazing. however it was hard to grasp how the readings often fit into lecture. lecture felt like a close reading of the readings rather than explaining how the readings help interpret larger themes\/trends of the time. each \"unit\" of the course lacked a real arc.",
                "The material was interesting, but extremely disorganized. There needs to be more continuity between the lectures and readings. One week we were learning about Big Mama Thornton, the next was about IBM. The potential for this class is so high, but I was very disappointed with it.",
                "The course lacked coherence and failed to make any overarching points or insights into the formation of American Culture. On top of this, lecture felt discombobulated and slow, often placing emphasis on unneeded clips or assuming intimate familiarity with films, books, or other media that the students simply did not have, and then getting sidetracked explaining aforementioned media. The course needs a point, or a set of points, or a tension that it wants to point out, or anything to make sense of what is at present a very poorly curated reading list.",
                "I thought that the topics were interesting but that the lectures were not especially. I felt like the lectures did not deliver a lot of concrete information about the topics and were much more lofty\/theoretical --essentially, I wish they had been more rigorous. I liked when we watched clips of performances in classthat was really cool.",
                "The overall structure of this class was non-traditional. Lecture time was utilized to analyze the readings for each week. Discussion section was also utilized for the same thing. It would be easier to engage in this course if lecture time was used to learn the historical events that the readings talk about, while discussion section is used to actually analyze the readings and apply it to the historical events we are supposed to learn.",
                "I thought this was a very weak course. The lectures were mildly interesting at best, and often disjointed and unrelated to eachother.",
                "The class was poorly structured - in particular, the lectures. Given the broad scope of the class, it was hard to go into depth on any one topic while still covering all the material. In the end, the class felt jumbled and unorganized.",
                "Strengths: assignments and readings were interesting, clear. Strong effort made in regard to accommodating schedules\/student preferences for coursework. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures felt disorganized",
                "Weaknesses: really disconnected topics and confusing timeline.",
                "The course was taught out of chronological order and felt like an examination of various different subjects rather than a thorough, continuous examination of American culture. Also the lectures were a snoozefest.",
                "I thought the lectures could be a lot more engaging and interesting.",
                "the syllabus is great but the class is super boring and disorganized in reality",
                "The course subject and use of music and film really strengthen the class. If I had to pick a weakness I think the readings are a little bit too much. I loved the variety of readings, but it was difficult to stay organized. The course was also strengthened by the flexibility of prompts, which allowed me to pursue my individual interests in a detailed way.",
                "I thought that the readings and class materials were really interesting. I also really enjoyed my discussion sections, and I found that they really facilitated my learning. However, I found the lectures themselves to be very disconnected and difficult to follow. There wasn't really a through-line in this course; every week was just a different topic, and the overall course did not feel very cohesive to me.",
                "This course had many strengths. The selection of texts and lecture topics was well put together to facilitate our learning. The quality of the lectures got better over time and I bet this trend would only continue. The paper topics encouraged deep thinking, allowing students to demonstrate what they had learned from the course while bringing in their own ideas and interests. The midterm and final were fair and genuinely enjoyable ways of assessing our engagement with the material. The only weakness of the course is that it (at least initially) assumed a greater background understanding of American History than I had, so some of the material was overwhelming. However, this did not hinder my ability to succeed in the course and did not pose a problem after around a month. This is a great class.",
                "This course was incredibly helpful in thinking about history through the lens of culture and music, I think a rigid timeline starting out from the beginning could have helped.",
                "The syllabus was filled with relevant and interesting texts. The texts were incredibly diverse, ranging from plays, textbook-style works, American studies theory, and biographies and memoirs. I absolutely loved that Professor N'yongo opened class with music and there was a course playlist on Spotify to follow along. I would have liked it if there were a few more films, videos, or pieces of art for us to consider. \r\nHowever, I didn't think the lectures were particularly strong or effective. Many lectures felt unplanned, random, and like a tangent. Professor N'yongo introduced specific and interesting moments and stories throughout the period, but I didn't always understand why. I struggled to see a thru-line between all of the voices he uplifted. \r\nI think more of an emphasis on the thru-line and more moments in class and assignments that are collaborative would have been great. I loved my discussion section; that was the highlight of this course."

                "I would if it was more structured because the subject matter was interesting but not well taught",
                "NO. Do not take this course so long as Prof. Nyong'o is teaching it. It had such great promise to be a good course and it honestly really missed the mark. I found myself constantly frustrated because the class was not structured and was so confusing. The only saving grace was my TF who was quite frankly a better lecturer than Prof. Nyong'o. This class lacked structure and engagement and I really wish I hadn't taken this course because I feel like I got nothing out of it. This class needs to be majorly restructured if it has any hope of being a good class.",
                "No. I think the topics are interesting and the syllabus has good reads but Prof. Nyong'o wasn't an engaging lecturer and I felt like the point of the course was confusing. Sometimes it focused on what formed American culture (be it neoliberalism, Jim Crow politics or the expansion of new technology) but other times it just felt like a basic overview of cultural\/social movements or just a thin 20th century U.S. history course or an attempt to introduce us to the field of American studies.",
                "If you are fine with doing a lot of learning yourself through a lot of reading and discussing instead of lecture, and are willing to be confused a lot of the time and are really passionate about cultural analysis then you should take it. Otherwise I would avoid taking this course, I spent most of my time just confused and puzzled, which made it hard to complete the papers or do the exams or know if I was doing anything in the course right.",
                "Not unless the organization is improved.",
                "Sure! I think I learned a lot, and the readings were interesting. I also liked that we had four different dates where we could turn in the essaysit meant that I could adapt my workload so that it was manageable and didn't conflict with other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course as the content is quite interesting and fun to learn about. The texts we read are also less traditional and they made for fun reads. The course was structured in such a way that it was not too much to handle, as the course load was not too much. Professor Nyong'o was very passionate about the content throughout the semester, which transferred to helping us learn the material.",
                "Honestly, no. I really wish I could. It was underwhelming, despite being a great topic. I will say that I loved being exposed to important thinkers\/authors of the 20th century through the readings. But overall, it felt like there were some important holes in teaching style and also material covered (e.g. baby boom impact, more discussion on the export of American culture to the world need, as well as the role of suburbia, more about WW2 impacts on society\/culture, more interrogation of social movements of the 60s and 70s)",
                "The class had high ratings, so I must assume that it was a good class in years prior. But I would not recommend this years course to another student. The professor was disorganized, the material was disconnected, and I didnt feel that I learned much.",
                "Under no circumstance would I recommend this class as is. There is simply no value in taking this as a class rather than doing one or two readings due to poor teaching and organization. Even then, any interest in American history, political or sociocultural, would be better served by one of many other classes at the college.",
                "No. I don't think that the lectures were especially well done.",
                "I would reccomend as an easy class, but I can't think of any other reason for someone to take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in going into American Studies, but only if the class was reorganized. I think the intent of the class - to teach about the discipline of American Studies - is sound but right now the class is not structured in an effective way to give a true glimpse into the major.",
                "Yes, mainly for the parts outside of the lecture hall, like the readings and personal research.",

                "I definitely would, it filled in the cultural gaps between historical events I'd studied in IB History of the Americas, and I loved the creativity and personal interest allowed in the options given on exams and essay prompts.",

It teaches you both about the development of American culture and the history of how we have thought about this development, allowing deeper thinking. The readings and papers are engaging without being overwhelming. The professor and teaching fellows are intelligent and helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in US History and culture.",
                "It depends on the person. If they are interested in the period and material, maybe. The readings and assignments were thought provoking and worthwhile. If they are looking for a course to fill a requirement or an intro to American studies, then probably not. For someone not specifically interested in the subject, I think the lectures would not be fun and it would be difficult to feel successful in the class."
