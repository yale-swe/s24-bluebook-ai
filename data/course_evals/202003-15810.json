I also felt I gained a more solid understanding of how to analyze poems and write papers about them.",
                "Reading Poetry",
                "The class should really be retitled. It is not so much \"poetry and ethics amidst imperial collapse\" as it is \"a survey of Du Fu's poetry throughout the Tang Dynasty.\" And of course I knew that going in, and that is all we learned. I'm not entirely sure why this class isn't cross-listed in the philosophy department to be honest, because so many of the secondary articles were rooted in philosophy. To be frank, I learned more about the readings of the day from the secondary readings themselves than the actual primary source material, which legit makes no sense whatsoever. And sometimes a connection between the two could not be found. Anyway, we covered Du Fu writing \"hire me please senpai!\" letters, to trying to be a recluse with \"it don't bother me none because I'm super tough\" but in reality crying in the club, to \"son, read this poem to the slaves, they shall surely understand our foreign language\", and \"omg what is my legacy going to be i'm scared halp\" altogether with a mix of poems I didn't understand before class, during class, or after class. We really covered the entire gamut of his life. The writing load is remarkably low, but the prompts are kinda elementary: \"how is violence depicted in one poem,\" \"pick a secondary text and use it somehow to analyze a poem,\" and \"free choice\" which was actually very frustrating. Feedback was so not helpful in any way in improving my writing for a variety of reasons and it was a bit of a dread to have to go to class on Friday afternoons. Sure, Luke is a great guy and all, but after reading a ridiculous amount of raving 5 star reviews I'm left wondering whether we took the same class??? I just don't understand and I'm a diehard humanities fanatic. The skills I acquired really aren't very applicable to anything.",

The wide range of disciplines tackled - philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology - also shed light to the intricate, rich implications of Du Fu's poetry.",
                "Strengths: openness and availability of the professor and the TA, poems were fun and interesting, the translations provided were quite nice (especially with the footnotes that Prof. Bender created), and the flexibility of the course. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish I had more structured feedback on my papers and more designated time with the professor to go over my writing. Although this course was listed as a WR credit with an emphasis on improving our writing, I didn't feel like I improved all that much. Also, the readings can be quite dense.",
                "great discussions and fantastic professor, I wish thee readings had been aa bit shorter + more focused.",
                "WEAK: Time and time again, I wished Luke would give us a lecture contextualizing the material. Every class, there were poems, a secondary article, some biographical chapters, maybe another background article (or three; useless really), and some long sections of text written by Luke talking about the assigned readings. Everything was organized really well and thematized succinctly, but that did NOT mean that when we got to class everybody knew when a certain poem was written or what was going on in Du Fu's life when he was writing at that particular point in time. Literally just 2 minutes of \"this was happening now\" would've helped. That's not a large ask. And before asking for our opinions, actual GUIDING questions would've been helpful--none of us (except for some native Chinese students) had any experience with Chinese poetic form, and he would just be like \"thoughts on this poem?' I'd share my thoughts and get either a summation of my thoughts in more cogent terms (wow, impressive Luke tbh, that was actually really cool and so nice) or the uninspiring \"thanks for that.\" Every time I got the latter I wanted to scream or go back to bed. It was ridiculous. Luke sharing his personal opinion is something that has definitely been brought up before-and it's certainly not like he hasn't gotten this comment in the past--because he DEFINITELY has. Look at previous reviews, they all wish he said more. I'm not paying to hear the insights of some mediocre Yalie muse about what they think they know; I'm paying to hear one of the foremost scholars on Du Fu talk about just that. And, with a discussion format on Zoom during a pandemic, it was like \"yes king give us nothing <3\" because that's definitely what it felt like. Look, you might read a ton of comments about how great this class was, but in reality it was just your standard run-of-the-mill mediocre literature class. I mean the TF Yang said it was \"nice knowing you throughout the semester\" on my final paper and I turned to my mother and was like, not once did we speak to each other EVER? Felt like copy and paste for every student. If it wasn't my apologies, but jeez he never said anything in class and I was never compelled to go to his specific office hours, given the lackluster office hours I attended with Luke, so did we even know each other at all? Very strange comment. And the comments themselves were utterly useless. 37 college classes and As on every. single. literature paper I've ever written and now \"this was structured poorly.\" Look, sure I will take the criticism-BUT THAT'S ALL HE EVER SAID. There was no explanation as to HOW it was structured poorly! Or, \"this paragraph has no argument\" well it shouldn't need one, read one of your own paragraphs of text that you made us read? Or \"pick simpler words\" well, then don't use \"lacustrine\" or \"ineluctable\" in casual speech during class and assign texts from the 90s that were incredibly dense and ridiculously hard to understand because of the word choice and verbosity and expect me NOT to emulate that. I cannot express how frustrating it was to also get the TF saying \"beautiful paragraph\" and Luke saying \"actually no, this was trash\" [not like that obviously, but you get the point] on the. same. freaking. paragraph. Either a lack of communication or no communication at all between them b\/c that was absurd. This class left way too much to be wanted. And I got an A in this class, too, so don't think I'm just complaining to complain. I've taken great lit classes and terrible ones, and this one was just mediocre. But why oh why would you give handouts on structure and style AFTER the papers were due? Makes no sense at all. STRONG: structure was identical every single class (a bit monotonous, but I'm sure some enjoyed that). Both prof and TF (who literally never said a single word in class and seemed like literal wasted space on the screen) graded and put comments on our papers (however drastically different their opinions were)."

However, if there is ever a sense that the students aren't really getting to know each other (which I don't think was a problem with this class), then the breakout room could be applied sparingly if given a very specific task (i.e. a debate on the ethics of bewilderment vs the ethics of ease)\r\n- Hearing the poetry read aloud in Chinese more often, and to the extent possible for those who can't read Chinese such as myself getting a toolkit for doing more formal stylistic analysis and learning more about Classical Chinese poetry forms - I enjoyed learning about five-character verse and parallel and chiastic structures, as well as the character-by-character breakdown done in week one, and even more of this would be great!",
                "First day of class, Luke covers the basics: who is Du Fu, what is the Tang Dynasty, what is Chinese poetry and its structure, and what's to come. AND HE USED A POWERPOINT with pictures! I was like, wow this is actually going to be super engaging and we're gonna have visual aids and it won't just be floating boxes on a screen!!! We even looked at Chinese high schooler memes! Yeah no, dream crushed. Not again did Luke ever pull up a powerpoint, use a visual aid, share his screen to show us a selection of text (like none of us printed, and the poems were super small, so I had a notebook in one hand, the poems in half my screen, the Zoom screen somewhere else on my laptop, AND my pre-class notes\/quotes\/summary, along with the Canvas discussion forum open-that's a bit absurd, especially given that ~all~ he had to do was share his screen. ugh), or do anything other than lead discussion. There was so much potential and it was just cast aside. Success: I mean it was a lit seminar, not anything particularly atypical that worked for COVID that was noteworthy or different from a regular year, and if anything it was probably less engaging."

Honestly not a space I knew too well beforehand (never took a course in this department before) and even thought it could be too narrow for my interests but it turned out to be an incredibly pertinent, engaging, and organized course. The questions you'll ask while reading about Du Fu's and his poetry really get to the core of what it means to live and what it means to create value and meaning within your life.

In this course, you will most likely become an unabashed fan of Du Fu, get to enjoy Prof. Bender's endless enthusiasm and knowledge, ponder how to live a good life (and what a good life truly is), and get to analyse the ebbs and flows of Du Fu's brilliant and sometimes bizarre poetry.",
                "Yes! Great professor and super interesting subject.",
                "No, not really, unless you want to take a course solely on Du Fu (title is misleading, but rest assured, I did know what I was getting myself into). When we read some poems and I said something that 6 other students agreed with, Luke would then be like \"actually, I don't see that\" in one of the rare instances he actually inserted his own commentary on our analyses--exciting indeed, but like, how can you disagree with half of the class and invalidate all of our opinions? That was the single most frustrating thing about this class, b\/c it was always \"share your thoughts! does anyone think differently from x?\" and if you did, well guess what!? You're actually just wrong! Way to boost our self-esteem. Or he'd be pushing for an analysis that just was not coming out. Moreover, the discussion posts WERE AN UTTER WASTE OF TIME. Luke did read them, but what the hell did we do them for??? No one looks forward to writing a discussion post: \"woohoo! my favorite part of 3am! struggling thru the readings and writing 'I really liked your point' when you're only responding b\/c it's required as part of your grade!\" No, they were not engaging, fun, or invigorating, and they especially did not foster actual ~discussion~ when the grad students and native Chinese student would offer a very background knowledge specific and astute analysis that an American student simply could not have gotten to. And Luke would never ever reconcile this problem in class (or on the discussion forum). I would ask questions, hoping for responses, but never got them from Luke, when in the end, his opinion is really the one I cared about. Plus, he got a little frustrated when none of us really enjoyed reading Yearley's super complicated piece on an \"ethics of bewilderment\" b\/c it just didn't resonate with any of us? And why did we have to read the biography of Du Fu along with excerpts of the Jiubian or poems of Tao Qian if we were literally never going to talk about them? It got to the point where I'd read the secondary articles and the underlined poems (b\/c there were always more available than necessary to read, and it was unclear whether we should have been reading Luke or Stephen Owen's translations, b\/c Luke always used his own in class; literally just pick one and stick with it please!) and nothing more b\/c we just wouldn't discuss it. Ever. It was like reading nothing. The texts were difficult enough. And, as for the essays, Luke is an incredibly easy grader. But his comments were stupid. If he didn't agree with your analysis (even though literature is supposed to be subjective, I thought?) he told you with a trite comment--but didn't give any suggestions. Yang and Luke would give you a \"letter\" explaining the merits and demerits of your paper at the end, but it never led to anything fruitful. Handouts on how to write a good paper were given AFTER the papers were due. The TF and prof frequently disagreed in many places in my writing: one said \"nice\" while the other said \"I don't get it\"; how do I interpret that? EVERYONE will probably say this was a life-changing course. Yes, I learned a lot about Tang era China and Du Fu's life, but it didn't enlighten me. With slight changes, this could have been so much better, even though it seemed great from the canvas page. I had a lot of difficulty understanding the first few weeks of poems, then all the sudden it clicked, but then it went downhill again. The paper on Freudian psychology was really hard, and while explained in class, felt kinda dumb to read alongside Du Fu. Week 13's secondary article was a bit stupid too, it was a lot of \"reviews\" and ways in which Du Fu was used throughout history, which didn't add to our conversations. I'd leave class wanting more or thinking I should've just picked a different class. AND NOTE: I GOT AN A (actually an \"A+\" whatever that means) ON every single assignment, so no I'm not complaining to complain. Listen if you want to likely the only negative review, it's up to you!",
