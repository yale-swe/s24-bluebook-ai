                "I learned a TON about different areas of humanitarian aid and current controversies and problems in the field. We had several guests come to class (either in person or virtually) including the former president of MSF and it was amazing to be so immersed in the field. Professor Panter-Brick is also incredibly accomplished and knows so much about the field - she is often able to pose challenging questions to guest lecturers and offer nuanced feedback on critical analyses that really makes you think and represents real conversations in the field right now. She also emphasizes concise and punchy writing so I definitely learned how to summarize ~100 pages of reading in 2 pages which is a great skill.",
                "Got a great overview of the humanitarian landscape and all the factors that are considered in delivering aid. Gained skills in writing short-form pieces throughout the semester. Readings were assigned a couple of days before the critical analyses were due so also gained skills in reading and summarizing quickly.",
                "Critical thinking and analysis of readings, how to write concisely and precisely.",
                "Thanks to Prof Panter-Brick's feedback, I feel like I really learned how to write more clearly and concisely. I learned about a lot of the challenges, drawbacks and nuances of humanitarian work."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: AMAZING professor, great small seminar format, class guests, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: not many...the only thing I would have found helpful is some sort of primer on humanitarian aid field areas as I often didn't know the full context about a particular area or crisis (ie Jordan, Syria, etc.) and it would be helpful to have some resources on that before diving into more nuanced readings",
                "Strengths: small seminar format makes things very comfortable, Prof. PB is very engaged in students' success and is always available to help. \r\nWeaknesses: None major, really enjoyed my time in the class!",
                "The strengths of this course are the variety of topics covered, the great syllabus, the guest speakers, and the passionate peers in the class. Professor P-B's insights are always interesting, and she does a good job playing devil's advocate in class discussion. In terms of content, I wished we examined more case studies and sometimes it felt like we wrapped up class too quickly without reaching a main point. Maybe next year give students the opportunity to share a bit about their final papers with each other?",
                "Strengths: Great feedback, help from the professor, fascinating readings, great guest lecturers. \r\nWeaknesses: the critical analyses were really hard to figure out initially. They are a big part of the grade and it was hard to know what she was looking for.",
                "The course welcomes discussion and different opinions, and Professor Panter-Brick ensures to foster a welcoming environment for all opinions to be heard. The readings are very informative and offer great discussion starters for the class sessions. The class sessions are lead with ease and there is no stress for students to constantly be talking or express opinions on things they do not feel comfortable talking about. The class sessions had a good balance of student discussions and exploration of different topics through either guest lectures or student-led presentations. It might be good for the course sessions to have a bit more structure and organization. At times, sessions felt a bit floaty, and so providing some structure could significantly help with that."

                "Absolutely! Professor Panter-Brick is amazing and you will gain exposure to the field of humanitarianism that moves beyond academic-level critiques and pushes you to engage with actual conversations in the field. The workload is manageable and Professor Panter-Brick really cares about her students. I always looked forward to class!",
                "Yes, unique Global Seminar focused on an industry that there is not much general knowledge about. Helps breakdown lots of misconceptions about aid.",
                "Yes! If you're remotely interested in humanitarianism, this is a great first class to take. The readings and discussions and critical analyses offer something for everyone, no matter how much they know about the field.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students interested in contemporary issues in humanitarianism--I have yet to see another undergraduate course like it that ties together these themes.",
                "Yes absolutely if you are interested in humanitarian work and/or challenges. I really liked the course. Prof Panter-Brick is super kind, interested in helping you succeed and helpful! I really liked this course.",
                "Absolutely! The course was very engaging and informative and offered unique experiences to be exposed to a great diversity of ideas within the field of humanitarianism. The course strikes a good balance in between talking about notions and ideas and anchoring down to case studies and pragmatic applications of perspectives. In doing so, it avoids being a philosophy course on practices in humanitarianism, and allows students to understand the realities that humanitarians in the field many times experience. If you are interested in gaining a realistic perspective into the work of humanitarian aid workers, and being exposed to very cool speakers then take this course. Also, Professor Panter-Brick is such a kind-hearted professor and deeply cares for her students!"
