   "comments": [
    "Through English 120, I learned a whole host of tools to write better literary nonfiction. We developed our own names for all of these through our seminar, so it wouldn't make as much sense to detail them here, but I am absolutely coming away with a number of insights on how to be a better writer. Also, by virtue of reading a lot of really good nonfiction, I was able to see so many different examples of what really good writing can look like.",
    "I learned about what makes for a great work of short-form nonfiction, and improved my own writing dramatically. I also gained exposure to a ton of writers and writing styles, which gave me the opportunity to develop my own literary tastes.",
    "I have learned so much about the craft of writing. My writing has improved exponentially.",
    "This course very much helped me to improve my writing. Leaps and bounds.",
    "I improved my writing skills significantly and learned how to read a piece for technique for the first time. In addition, I leaned how to workshop and be workshopped. I have a very difficult time editing my own writing and this class forced me to let go of my first draft and adapt.",
    "I learned a lot about the mechanics of writing well in essays, and how to read others essays critically and give good feedback. The discussions in this class were also amazing, and my writing improved a lot.",
    "I learned how to write creatively in a way that was both logical and visceral. I took so much away from this class but the biggest thing I took away was simply to be comfortable and willing to share my opinions and beliefs regardless of what others were saying. Everyone in this class was incredibly smart, so so insightful, kind, and hilarious, and all these qualities in large part were able to come together because of the David and because of the structure of the course. I learned to be comfortable just speaking my mind even if my thoughts weren't fully formed, I learned how to write an essay that matters and means something."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "120 is a solid course. It's been taught so many times that they really have the formula down. The assignments are eclectic and engaging, the feedback structure is really helpful. The syllabus could definitely be more diverse--we read a lot of white, male authors. Let's change that up!",
    "The class' format - reading great works on a variety of topics and discussing what makes them so effective - is not only insightful, but also fun. It felt the right amount of work to be challenging yet still enjoyable; Professor Gorin's judgement call to cut the number of essays from 5 to 4 but enforce high expectations for our writing was a good decision. My only issue was that Professor Gorin was too busy to give us feedback or grades back in a timely fashion. I got feedback two days before the deadline of our penultimate essay, and still haven't received a grade on it.",
    "The draft process where we get feedback is awesome and super helpful. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course is a joy. The reading assignments are interesting, relevant, and helpful, and the writing assignments are manageable and fun to write.",
    "Strengths: there is no way to short-cut, this class really forces you to contemplate deeply and create something you are proud of. Often, students will be in a crunch and not submit their best work, but the two drafts gives you ample time to create a strong piece AND encourages lots of self reflection.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did a lot of readings that we never got around to discussing or talking about.",
    "The class discussions were amazing, and David Gorin is an awesome professor both in class and in office hours.  My writing improved a lot over the course of the semester, and I also learned a lot about critiquing and improving others work. He can sometimes be delayed in returning essays, but he makes up for it with extensive comments and suggestions for improvement and hes extremely helpful to meet with during office hours. He really cares about your learning in the class and you learn a lot!",
    "The strengths of this course were mostly in the way in manifested in the classroom. The discussions and concentration we are able to spend on pieces makes the course feel intimate and meaningful. The main weakness was that I simply felt like we often didn't have enough time to spend on readings or on entire units as a whole. Even though our class was more flexible than most other 120s in terms of timing and units, there were many classes we weren't able to discuss the readings I enjoyed most or most wanted to hear other peoples opinions on."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, especially for a first-year or someone who is relatively new to non-fiction. It's an ideal introduction into college-level writing--it'll give you a professor dedicated to developing you as an essayist, a group of students who are coming in at a similar level, and a syllabus that's full of important nonfiction to read.",
    "Yes, ten times over. Seriously, if I could retake English 120 I'd do it in a heartbeat. You will read so many incredible works of nonfiction and receive so much helpful feedback on your writing. And it wasn't just the class  Professor Gorin in particular made my experience in 120 as phenomenal as it was.",
    "Definitely! It is a fun way to improve your writing.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great course. It's well-taught, the seminar style provides for an excellent learning environment, and the course itself is a wonderful way to improve your writing, especially if you've tired of strictly academic writing or research papers.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. I am leaving it with a portfolio of essays about myself that I feel proud of and lots of skills that I believe will apply to all my other writing-based courses I will take at Yale.",
    "YES 100%. My writing got so much better over the course of the semester, I learned a lot about the mechanics of writing well, I learned a lot about my classmates and had extremely fulfilling discussions, and David Gorin is an amazing professor. It is a bit heavy on the paper writing, but he is a very fair grader and the papers get easier to do over the course of the semester.",
    "Absolutely. To anyone."
