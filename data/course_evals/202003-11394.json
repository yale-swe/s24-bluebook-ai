                "A strength of the course is the variety of topics covered in class. Nothing we ever discussed was ever \"boring.\" Our writing also recieved plently of feedback which was helpful for improvement. However, the class was not as focused on how to write as much as I had hoped. We do alot of reading and discussion and not a lot of techqniues for writing. Since this is an into writing course, it would have been benefical if the class was more focused on how to write.",

You let your high school or community college writing grades put you in a false sense of comfort and this course will bring you back to reality. Im so glad I took this course. I feel more confident in my abilities to expand on my thoughts. I can ask the right questions and speak clearly to a defined audience. And it was all learned while talking about celebrities!",
