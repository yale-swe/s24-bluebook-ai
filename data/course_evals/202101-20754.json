                "Strength: Professor Van is so kind, and it is so important to have more POC professors at Yale to empower under-represented students!\r\nWeakness: the lectures were not that stimulating to me, a regurgitation of what we read",
                "Strengths: really good readings and guest speakers, grader was also great\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, presentations felt a bit disorganized, and a lot of materials or assignments were uploaded to canvas late. Awkward silences tended to linger",
                "Strengths: Professor Van is very smart and kind. His insights into Vietnamese literature was a joy to listen to, and it was also great to hear other Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese students give input into the readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The larger size of the class at times made it seem intimidating to speak in.",
                "strength - strong and interesting syllabus, even when there were changes made throughout the semester. reflection papers were a good way to think about the syllabus materials, but i would like it better if it was a public Canvas discussion post where we could learn from each other. perhaps the students can be split in half where one group is responsible for responding to posts, while the other half writes the post, since there's not enough discussion going on in class because no one feels comfortable enough to do so, but everyone has plenty of personal reflections about the material\r\n\r\nweakness - it doesn't look like the Prof has updated his slides from when he first started teaching this course, so it's much less engaging because it feels outdated. he does not have presentations for the newer materials on the syllabus. overall the presentation of material would be more engaging if the Prof provided analyses or shared significance of the readings or films we watched. he tried to drive the conversation in class by asking questions to students, but it's much better if he started with an interesting interpretation/argument of a piece and asked for our thoughts. sometimes he would ask leading questions and there would not be room for students to share their own thoughts; he seemed to be searching for a 'right' answer when it should be better for there to be room for discussion and open interpretation. the Prof had many opportunities to lecture about vietnamese literature and culture in a more meaningful, perhaps emotional/personal way as there are Vietnamese students in the class too who would benefit from greater depth of the material, but he ended up allowing the poetry speaker event and the vietnamese american speaker panel at the end of the course to deal with that. would be interesting if the class discussion topics could be more student driven based on student interest - maybe even having the speaker panels at the beginning of the course for students to get an overview about what is meant by the 'vietnamese' experience",
                "I wish we had more opportunities for smaller group discussions. Especially during the first half of the course, most of the classes would be Professor Van lecturing for 1 hour +.",
                "The class is very poorly structured in that there is no clear expectation for assignments and the class would never follow the syllabus, making it hard to expect what we should be doing for homework until the professor posts the assignment the day before it is due. Because of the lack of structure, I found that it was harder to engage with the material.",
                "The course has some excellent readings and Thay Quang is an incredible man. I think more discussion-based learning would have been nice, perhaps individual presentations. Also, having a more defined and specific syllabus at the beginning of the course would be helpful.",
                "Great professor",
                "I loved how the course allowed students to choose when and what to write reflection papers on. This made me feel like the connection I made with the material was very genuine. I also appreciated the flexibility of the final project and the guest speakers.",
                "One of the strengths of this course were that Thay Quang was extremely lenient in terms of the grading & due dates of the reflection papers to accommodate for the difficulties of this semester. On the same vein, Thay Quang allowed for a lot of flexibility in terms of what the reflection papers discussed and what the final project was. Students in this course were thus able to explore a lot in regards to what interested them and intrigued them in this course, and the resulting final projects were very varied and unique (translation projects on V-pop songs, Viet food tours, children's books, etc.). Another strength was that Thay Quang was also willing to change the class schedule if he found that another topic was more important to discuss. In doing so, he integrated a lot of ViSA events and movie screenings into the class schedule, and that made it so that there were more forms of engagement and discussion in the class. Of course, this did mean that ultimately there were some things in the syllabus that we were not able to cover and/or spend much time discussing, so that may be a weakness of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Van is great and often brings in very interesting guest speakers.  Very approachable workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Reading load is pretty high but not very necessary at the same time.  This definitely caused the readings to take a spot on the back burner a lot of the time."
