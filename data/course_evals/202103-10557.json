                "The class is very structured with packets that provide plenty of information on techniques and organisms you're working on. Directions for lab reports are clear. While some experiments take time and require focus, the classroom atmosphere is relaxed enough to let people learn. We received comments on all graded assignments stating why points were taken off. Moreno looks for overall improvement throughout the course, which is nice especially for those without prior lab experience. She is also understanding about due dates as long as students communicate with her. There is a fair amount of writing, but considering it counts as half a writing credit, that makes sense. Only weakness for the course is sitting still for 4 hours once a week and only getting half a credit.",
                "This course was extremely unorganized and I wanted to cry almost every single class because I was so confused. I think a major weakness was the lack of instruction or help from the TF's. There were not a whole lot of strengths, if any.",
                "Strengths-- the activities during lab are very interesting and engaging. I liked that it was very collaborative work.\r\nWeaknesses-- there is a ton of writing (which is why it gets a writing designation, but only a half, so it isn't very helpful) and the reports take MANY hours to complete. Additionally, it is a lab course, so it is only 0.5 credits even though the class lasts for 4 hours (sometimes longer).",
                "Strengths: The TAs are exceptional. My TA always took time to answer my questions and respond to my emails and seemed genuinely excited about the course. Dr Moreno is wonderful and cares about her students. She also set up the course to be very collaborative with a focus on student learning, regardless of current biology background. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes didn't understand the concepts because I had yet to learn them in intro bio. The first lab report was also very very long (double the workload of any other lab report) which was jarring.",
                "Although there was a lot of scientific writing involved and harsh grading along with it, I'm not sure I really gained any skills in scientific writing. Grading of lab reports seemed unnecessarily harsh. Conducting lab experiments was interesting, and I could tell the teaching team put a lot of effort into preparing.",
                "I thought the course was very good but it would have been nice to receive a little bit more feedback.",
                "It's a pretty easy lab credit with an interesting syllabus."

I know it's not required for the Bio sequence, but taking them with bio 101 and 102 really helped reinforce some of the concepts.",
