                "I learned how to analyze and listen to (mostly) really weird music, which would've just been noise to me before.",
                "I learned how to interact with New Music post-WWII and tapped into a new way of thinking about music. As a casual musician, I got a lot out of Trevor and this course.",
                "I found a way into understanding contemporary classical music. Prior to taking the course, I had a lot of trouble understanding this type of music, but Trevor really guided us through the relevant repertoire. Now I feel comfortable holding my own when talking about new music, even if it still might not be my favorite genre in the world.",
                "Learned how to approach challenging works of music and how composers have been moving away from classical standards and changing how the audience interacts with music.",
                "We focused on a series of pieces that exemplified the diversification of repertoire after the second world war. Through the format of close analysis of these pieces, we looked at the cultural and historical significance of these works as representations of the canon during this time period. \r\n\r\nNot only did I learn a great deal about music and how to think about it, but I came to truly find joy and inspiration in listening to pieces which previously I would have disliked for being difficult to listen to. I began to understand how music can be so much more than entertainment and how it can be viewed as some of the most pure art that humans have created. I gained abilities in parsing new music scores and a greater understanding of the new symbols used in contemporary classical music.",
                "I learned some different ways to approach the analysis of music from the second half of the 20th century to the present. We began the semester with an introduction to notationboth classical notation and more modern variations / extensions of that system. We covered many of the general trends in the music of this period and the fact that the notion of \"general trends\" obscures the continuously increasing variations on such trends and musical pieces that reject the notions of such trends in the first place. Through the listening quizzes, I learned how to listen to music and to differentiate it into sections without just looking at the score.",
                "This course really taught me how to listen to contemporary music. I gained confidence in sitting with a piece and thinking about what differentiated sections in it, and also learned how to then teach in-depth about a piece of contemporary music.",

            "comments": [
                "The course, illuminated by Trevor's exceptional teaching prowess and fervent passion for his subject, transcends all expectations of engagement and enjoyment. Trevor's ability to captivate the class for hours on end is nothing short of remarkable; his lectures are so enthralling that boredom becomes an alien concept. His unique talent lies in his capacity to hold the entire class in rapt attention, united in their intrigue, as they absorb the eerie, high-pitched screams and unsettling scraping sounds that are the foundation of the course. This is no ordinary class at Yale - it's a singular experience, a testament to Trevor's unparalleled skill as an educator. The least engaging part of the class would have to be the student presentations, but they are also invaluable as they serve as the culmination of the skills we have been studying throughout the entire course.",
                "Loved that there was no readings, it really allowed us to dive deep into the music. I think Trevor has good taste, and even if I didn't like a piece we studied, I could still gain something from it. I might've been the only one who didn't really enjoy having a large chunk of student presentations at the end; it's important for students to gain experience teaching but I still would've liked to have some more professional analysis of pieces during that period. I know that Trevor was thinking of adding in more time for discussion for the next iteration of this course, and I'd like to caution against that. People generally made good observations about the music but they were mostly things I think we were all already aware of, so there wasn't actually the generation of new knowledge through our discussions.",
                "The course was perfect. Keep it!",
                "The course is structured around the growth of students, not around punitive grading. That allowed for real opportunities to take risks, ask for help, and go along for the journey without fear that our grades would suffer. Trevor is an incredibly engaging lecturer; I could listen to him talk about music for hours and not get bored.",
                "Overall, a great course for anyone interesting in exploring new territories of music and creation.",
                "This course is amazing! The course benefits most highly from its professor, who made the class incredibly engaging while providing a safe space for people of all musical or non-musical backgrounds to learn and grow within it.",
                "The only weakness I can think of would be that there is not enough time to cover more material. While the sparsity of content did make the class easier to manage on top of my other classes, I think I would have managed fine and enjoyed this class even more if we got to hear and analyze even more pieces. Strengths: interesting music, listening quizzes!, Baa.",
                "The format of the course where Professor Baa would lecture on the context and nuance of the piece on Monday and then we would start Wednesday with a listening quiz was fantastic. There was the perfect balance of challenge and curiosity in delving into each piece and I felt extremely motivated to take the required time to digest the pieces.",
                "strengths: collaborative, structured in a way to maximize learning/engagement without putting pressure on a letter grade",
                "This is the kind of class you look forward to and feels welcoming. Done a different way, with a different professor, this class could have easily felt uninviting or stressful, but not in the slightest with Trevor. The listening quizzes were a great non-stressful motivational tool to engage with the pieces.\r\n\r\nI will note: it is at least worth considering that adding assigned readings and papers to the syllabus could be beneficial. Yes, maybe the reading and paper format is not the ideal one for this class, but considering it is the one used by 95% of humanities classes, its absence makes me wonder if I didnt learn as much as I could have. Yes, this made the class much more manageable (that is, easy) and allowed us to focus on the most important part of the coursethe music itself. But Im sure theres something I could have gained from reading some texts about the histor(ies) of the last 50 years of Western art music and from completing analyses of aspects of the pieces and/or their historical contexts in prose form. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and did learn a lot from it, but Im not sure Id say Im walking away feeling confident in my knowledge of the history of this art form or in my ability to critically discuss it in a broad sense.",
                "Strengths: Where do I begin. Trevor is a genius and anything that comes from him is gold. This class had virtually zero flaws. My only complaint with the course was that the first assignment (score-copying) was a bit tedious but it wasnt that bad and Im just grasping for straws to think of something relating to this course that wasnt perfect in every way."

                "I'd definitely recommend this to other people passionate about music. I've taken so many music history courses where we barely listen to the music, and this is wonderfully the exact opposite. Trevor has tremendous respect for his students and treated us with kindness and care while pushing us to do things we didn't know we could do. By signing up for a class with Trevor you're also signing up for some unexpectedly long tangents, some fun and insightful and some not, but I think the rest of the course makes up for a few boring or frustrating moments.",

                "Yes! I would primarily recommend this course to students who are interested in modern music or art, but I believe any Yale student could benefit greatly by taking this course.",
                "Take this class if you have any interest in \"contemporary classical\" music or the developments in classical music over the past several decades. The music itself can be challenging to understand, especially when it intentionally sets out to defy understanding, but that challenge makes it all the more interesting. There is such a wide variety of music in this \"genre\" (broadly construed) that there will surely be a piece that makes it all \"click\" for you during the semester. This class really works when the people in the class buy in, so only take it if you are going to buy in and engage. That does not mean you have to make this class your life or speak up all the time in class or know so much about music already (I did not know nearly everything when I joined the class), but this is a special class and not one to take and blow off, so make sure you can give it the attention it deserves.",

                "This was truly one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. I left the course with not only an understanding of important contemporary music pieces, but also a deeper confidence in my ability to digest a piece of music, and then teach my ideas to someone else. Professor Baa is truly one of the most talented lecturers I have experienced and the course was extremely motivating in its challenge.",
                "YES! Whether you need it for the music major or are just looking for a fun class to take, this is a fantastic way to broaden your artistic horizons and find ways to engage with new material. The class is geared towards people of all backgrounds/experience levels, and Trevor did a great job at making sure the material was accessible  but also challenging/stimulating.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!! Trevor is so wise, kind, understanding, smart, and knowledgable. He knows what hes doing. You will have your mind opened to a type of music you never thought you could love. You will walk away from listening quizzes feeling confident in your music recognition abilities.",
                "Without hesitation. If you ever have the opportunity to take any course with Trevor, please do regardless of major or background. He is a truly brilliant person and I came out of every lecture feeling very enlightened."
