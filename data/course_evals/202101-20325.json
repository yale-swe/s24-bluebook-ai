                "A great introduction to a fascinating time in world history. Compared to some other history classes I've taken, I learned A LOT in this course. If you're looking for a course about broad historiographical theories applied to past events, this is not the course for you. It's focused heavily on people, places, and events, and is heavily oriented to what the life of the average person was like during this period in history, rather than just the elite. Also, don't expect to read hundreds of pages of scholarly articles in this course; most of what we read are relatively brief (but very interesting) primary texts.",
                "I learned a lot about Jewish cultural, political, and religious history as well as quite a bit about religious and ethnic relationships within Muslim caliphates. This course was especially enlightening in showing how politics, social, and demographic factors impacted religious life and the relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populations throughout much of the last millenium.",
                "I learned a lot about Jewish life in Muslim lands during ancient, medieval, and early modern times. I had never taken a course on Judaism before and I thought I might be over my head in this one, but Prof. Marcus did a great job giving us background information on Judaism before diving into the Jewish experience in Muslim lands, which is a huge portion of the story of Judaism in history. We learned about major Jewish figures who were able to exert influence from within Muslim governments, as well as moments of conservative backlash in which a Muslim majority population became angry that Jews were given power over Muslims and went on a rampage against the Jewish population of a particular city or area. Overall, however, I got the impression the Jews were treated better under Muslim law than Christian\/Catholic law around the same time periods.",
                "Historical analysis skills, specifically regarding how to extract information from primary sources without using any background knowledge. I also learned a lot about connecting time periods together by analyzing the different historical, cultural, religious, political trends that impacted those trends.",
                "Analyzing primary source documents, writing primary source papers, timed essay, knowledge of Jewish and Muslim histories (more Jewish focused: about 70\/30 split between Judaism\/Islam in content distribution)",

                "I learned more about the history of Jews in the Middle East, including times of the caliphate, the Ottoman Empire, and even the early Modern period. I also learned how to read and compare primary sources."

                "Ivan Marcus is the strength of the course. Professor Marcus is an expert in the subject matter and made virtual class feel the most human of any lecture Ive had.",
                "I loved this course. It was one of my favorite I've taken at Yale. The combination of personal histories and macro trends made me feel like I learned the big picture while keeping the content very human and therefore relatable and really engaging.",
                "This is a very good class. Professor Marcus is an amazing lecturer, and he makes the class super interesting. I guess the only weakness of the course is I wish the lectures were recorded.",
                "Strengths: The content is really, really interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Marcus is also a wonderful lecturer. The readings, which are not very long, pair extremely well with the content and lectures (he often talks about the primary source readings in class) and mix both primary\/secondary sources. The readings are also really interesting and approachable. Professor Marcus emphasizes the importance of the themes of the course both in lecture and exams, but he also explains them through unique individuals and accounts. The paper assignment was challenging for me but really rewarding, so I'd call that a strength.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you can't sit through a 75 minute lecture this might not be the class for you, but I'd definitely give it a try first because Professor Marcus is a great lecturer and the content is interesting. Can't think of any real weaknesses, a great course.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very passionate about what he is teaching, very easily approachable, and also very nice and supportive to students who may be intimidated or scared to ask questions during or outside of class. The outlines that the Professor gave us before each week's lectures were also really helpful to help guide our learning on what the main ideas would be. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wish the lectures were recorded, so we could go back to review some information, though I understand the Professor's intention to try to keep it as normal of a lecture class as possible.",
                "I understand that it wasn't recorded to encourage attendance but I do wish the lectures had been recorded so that it would make studying easier.",
                "Strengths: Prof Marcus is an engaging\/fun\/informative lecturer (speaks like how I imagine Bernie Sanders' cousin would),  well structured for learning through outlines which are useful for notes\/test prep, extensive focus on primary text analysis which is extraordinarily useful to anyone studying history. Content is surprising and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes emphasized depth more than breadth. For instance we spent a week on a controversy over kindling fire on Sabbath, which I found a little too niche. But other niche topics -- like the poems of Yehuda Halevi -- were very interesting to engage with.",
                "It was interesting but there was minimal student interaction",
                "Strengths: Ivan Marcus is a fantastic instructor who cares about presenting the material in an engaging and comprehensive manner. The workload is not too heavy, but the course material is so fascinating! \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, he doesn't have time to ask students if they have questions."

                "Yes definitely. Although the subject of the course may seem slightly niche, especially to those who are not history or religious studies majors, the course covered a wide range of periods, cultures, subjects, and events with a sense of continuity over time that is rare. Ivan Marcus is also a great lecturer who is always friendly and cognizant of the engagement and understanding of his students.",
                "I absolutely would! Professor Marcus is great, the lectures are so interesting and its a topic about which I could never have learned on my on!",
                "Definitely! Especially if you like studying interactions between people of different religions. But it's a good survey course for anyone interested in history.",
                "Yes. Very good class. Professor Marcus is an amazing lecturer, and you are sure to learn a lot about Jewish History in Muslim Lands.",
                "Absolutely. If you're interested in any of the historical bases of Judeo-Muslim interactions, this course is for you. There is substantial mutualism between Jewish and Muslim communities in history (obviously not perfect) that is not really well known about today. Definitely take it. Professor Marcus is also a great lecturer, gives solid answers to questions, and you can tell he actually enjoys the material and keeps up with new developments in it.",
                "Even though the topic is really niche, I still recommend this class to everyone (especially if you are just getting into history or maybe want to get a relatively easier history credit)! I took this class because I really loved history and learning about the Middle East, so this class perfectly fit my interests about learning about the whole complicated, complex, yet also interesting history of the region, its people, and its religions and cultures.",
                "Professor Marcus is a good lecturer and the workload is not bad at all--it's two written exams (define vocab and write a short essay) and a 10-page paper due at the end of the semester. For the essay, he gives us topics to pick from and they're all fair to work with. There are readings for each class but they're short and sometimes they're reviewed in class if you didn't read.",
                "Absolutely. Professor gives interesting lectures, content is generally interesting. Reading was roughly 50 pages per week, which allowed me to read sources in more depth. That said, primary source analysis skills improved significantly so I don't feel snuffed out of intellectual growth whatsoever. Well structured for learning with outlines that aided notetaking and test prep. Would have appreciated less focus on some of the less exciting niche topics but still overall very fulfilling.",
                "Yes; it is an interesting topic and not very intense",
