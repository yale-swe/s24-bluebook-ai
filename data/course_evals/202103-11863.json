The problem sets and exams are not too hard. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, though I will say that the professor could have been more careful with notation in the first half of the semester. Far too many u's and v's, and gammas that were sometimes functions of u and sometimes of v, that kept getting mixed up. The problem sets could also occasionally be confusing it that it was not very clear what was being asked.",
                "The content was very cool, though lectures could sometimes be confusing. To be fair, that kinda comes with the territory. It might be nice to follow a textbook more closely for the first half of the course, as I often had to skim through multiple different SR references to keep up.",
                "This course benefitted from clear organization and an engaging lecture style. If I had to suggest improvements, they would be a 30-second overview at the top of each class outlining what we will cover and perhaps soliciting questions a little more. Often it felt like not immediately asking questions in breaks was interpreted as understanding the material, but I think it was often the case that people were simply finishing writing notes or trying to think of what question to ask."

                "I am a math major who took this course to fulfill the requirements of the B.S. in mathematics, without having taken any other physics classes at Yale (or any other physics since my algebra-based classical mechanics course in early high school). Speaking only from that very specific perspective, this course is excellent. The course is rigorous and approaches the subject from a very mathematical perspective, which I enjoyed (for example, setting c=1 in the first lecture and never looking back). The problem sets are overall fairly light (most took me less than 4 hours, and in the latter half of the semester, a lot took less than 2 or 3). Special relativity is an extremely intuitive and fascinating subject, which doesn't require much in terms of physics prerequisites as long as you're willing to learn and expose yourself to something new. You will accidentally also learn a lot about riemannian metrics and Einstein notation (which is an INCREDIBLE invention that physicists made up so they would never have to do linear algebra) along the way, as well.  Skiba is a wonderful instructor and I think this course is one of the best options for fulfilling the B.S. requirements.",
                "I'd recommend to anyone who's curious about relativity and has somewhat of a background in linear algebra. We didn't use a ton of linear in the course (a little bit in SR), but I think it's conceptually helpful for working with tensors in GR.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Skiba is a great instructor and is clearly passionate about the material, which is interesting."
