    "I learned about the history of indigenous people in Latin America and thought much more deeply than I had before about the ethics of anthropological research.",
    "Insight into the themes and interactions between ethnicity, nationalism, and the politics of knowledge in latin america.",
    "I learned about some of the cultural and political tensions around indigenous communities and the development of certain Latin American nations in a broader sense. Learned how to write historically (meaning incorporate the perspectives of different historians into a conversation and not give any recommendations for future policy\/action this is what I was told).",
    "This course encouraged me to grapple with themes that I have only had exposure to at a superficial level. It was a perfect combination of theory and historical analyses."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were good and the class discussions were excellent. I would have appreciated more commentary\/feedback on my written work, however.",
    "Strengths - Professor Echeverri is extremely intelligent, readings and discussions were very interesting, and the final paper was so interesting to research and write.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none that I can think of!",
    "Great instructor, great discussion, I only wish we had talked about a few more concrete historical examples in class, but at the end of the day it was mostly theory and that was fine.",
    "Weaknesses are tons of reading, sometimes too much to get through and retain\/focus on all of it, a lot of its repetitive and unnecessary too. Also conversations in class were unorganized, not directed well in any particular direction and so people ended up just passively agreeing or having an out of context comment way down the line. Also the different weeks topics seemed very similar, and not branching out too much. Seemed like the same conversation every week and I cant say I learned a ton new in the second half of the semester other than writing skills"

   "comments": [
    "If youre interested in indigenous people in Latin America, this class gives an excellent overview. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, this course will really stretch you intellectually, and make you think about concepts regarding nationality and states. It also allows you to relate issues you learn in the course to things going on in the present day.",
    "Yes! Extremely interesting seminar in which you learn a TON! Readings and discussions were very interesting and Professor Echeverri is amazing.",
    "Yes! Great instructor and fascinating+important readings.",
    "I wouldnt, take a class thats more varied from week to week and better builds on itself, unless you want to drone through the same things every week. Maybe it was just my class that was very repetitive and searching for approval on every comment (ie just repeating the professors arguments and agreeing with everyone, while not attempting to tackle the more difficult questions. Also professor has a very specific demand for writing style and if it resembles policy recommendations (very relevant in this class) at all shell completely mark it off.",
    "Absolutely! This class is a great way to learn about Latin America via issues of race and nationality that have defined the regions history and present."
