This meant being able to read scientific papers chronicling the progression of cancer research, understanding the basic science surrounding cancer from, DNA mutations, oncogenes, DNA damage, biochemistry, genetics, carcinogens, and so much more. You learn a lot in this class and the knowledge you obtain from it is really unique and very practical given how omnipresent and prevalent cancer is in our world.",
                "I developed a much deeper understanding of cancer. The course mainly looked at the scientific explanations and research of the disease (cell types, apoptosis, angiogenesis, microarrays, chemotherapy, the role of the immune system, etc.), but it also incorporated the human toll and the disparities in access to preventive measures and treatment."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is that it is a seminar (nominally). By this I mean the professor lectures at you, but around a small table. This means that you have the opportunity to ask questions, although the professor moves really fast. Another strength was that the material was presented in a way that made sense sequentially.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of weaknesses in this course. Firstly, the uneven workload. Having weeks where we have an exam every other week, including heavy homework and huge readings of a novel about cancer. The other weakness of this course is that it attempts to cover more material than there is a reasonable time for, which led to the professor keeping us late every class and having giant \"quizzes\". Finally, the grading system was super unclear and the professor was not able to give me a clear and definite answer on what my midterm grade was. The professor often did not elaborate on how the \"curve\" would impact our scores.",
                "I felt overwhelmed most of the time with the information. Tests were much, much harder than the in-class discussions and excersizes which was very frustrating. I ended up credit\/d\/failing this class because of it.",
                "Strengths: I think that this course did force students to engage heavily with the topic making it so it was impossible to not engage with the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is a Science credit for non-STEM majors, but it often felt that we were treated as STEM majors. Much of the content felt rushed through especially as concepts got more and more difficult. I think this could've been better as a lecture course where there are sectioned off times for discussion.",
                "The strength of the class is that it is in a seminar style with a lecture. This allowed you to be more involved and engage with the professor rather than being in a big lecture where engagement is difficult. The weakness is that it's very important you study and test yourself on the material because there isn't necessarily homework or other things that help reinforce the learning beyond you own measures.",
                "Each unit was placed well within the semester so that new concepts were introduced when enough context had already been provided. The curriculum was well-suited to the non-STEM major group but still intellectually challenging."

                "Deeply valued and ***enjoyed*** every aspect of Dr. Belperrons MCDB 103 Cancer course  an introductory biology class designed primarily for freshmen and sophomores including those who have yet to take or complete college level biology classes. Whats great about this class is that while Dr. Belperron thoughtfully starts from the premise that students only possess a high school level exposure to biology, the course methodically helps students construct a deep foundational understanding of all aspects of the biology of cancer which includes deep dives on genetics, biochemistry, immunity, infection agents, as well as cancer prevention and treatment modalities and challenges.   \r\n\r\nBelperrons lectures are super insightful and straight-forward   helping students parse through complex concepts and gain a working knowledge of key topics. Assigned readings have been carefully curated for accessibility  providing pathways toward both understanding as well as jumping off points for additional investigation. Class assignments all make sense and are again, straight-forward; these include having students draft and submit weekly discussion questions, exams, participation in a group project\/presentation as well as an individual end of term research presentation and paper. \r\n\r\nThroughout all these assignments and exams, Dr. Belperron invests significant time and energy to consistently provide objective and actionable feedback that contribute to the learning process. Throughout the course, Dr. Belperron was readily accessible via office hours and email  and is always positively responsive; happy to make time to help guide and mentor students. She also invests considerable amounts of her time beyond office hours to conduct optional review sessions and has hosted her classes for working lunches. I was fortunate to take Dr. Belperrons MCDB 106: Biology of Malaria, Lyme and Other Vector-Borne Disease this past Fall and had such a positive experience  that I enrolled in MCDB 103 during the current Spring 2023 term.\r\n\r\nFor any student interested in a subject (cancer) that has global health importance and touches so many of us  whether on policy, research or granular clinical levels   I could not recommend Dr. Belperron and this class (along with her other class, MCDB 106 - Biology of Malaria, Lyme and Other Vector-Borne Diseases) more highly.",
                "Depends, not necessarily unless they wanted a unique experiences and were coming from a little bit of STEM background",
                "I would not recommend this to another student unless they plan to be an oncologist. I don't think this course was non-STEM friendly and it was heavy coursework including all of the quizzes and questions required for class.",
                "Definitely! It's a very rewarding class if you put in the work. It's not an easy science credit but the learning experience is one that you'll own get in this class. If you want to learn biology in a serious, comprehensive and manageable way, then this course is just that. Be advised the class is difficult but you can have a rewarding experience if you put in the work.",
                "I would recommend this course without a doubt. The topic is fascinating, and the lectures always incorporated questions and discussions. It helped me clear up some common misconceptions or simplifications of the disease and give me a more nuanced understanding of cancer."
