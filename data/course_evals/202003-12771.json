                "Strengths: Very broad range of topics covered, great experience with TFs, consistent interaction with peers, encouragement to be engaged in class, variety of ideas and understandings welcome, diverse lecturers and journalists in materials\r\nWeakness: Not all students did the readings each week because there was no way to verify if they had been done; weekend homework was almost overwhelming if I did all the readings, since my reflections were due Tuesday 4 am and materials weren't posted until 5 pm the preceding Fridays.",
                "The discussion sections were an amazing resource of the course.",
                "There could be more organization, but it was well taught.",
                "I'd like to have a wider variety of readings. Sometimes, it felt like we dedicated A LOT of time to Middle East but skimmed over many other areas of the world.",
                "The section on the Middle East (roughly the first half of the course) is very strong. Professor Sky's experiences make this the highlight of the class. However, the rest of the class consisted of online videos and articles.",
                "It was very difficult to remain engaged in the course after the professor stopped posting virtual lectures and instead posted Youtube documentaries. We also only had the privilege of speaking directly to our professor two times this semester. The level of reading was very manageable and engaging, however, and I highly recommend trying to get into a small discussion section. The midterm was particularly frustrating because I read the professor's book twice, yet still found the prompts difficult to decipher and adequately answer.",
                "Strengths: spectacular lectures from Professor Sky and excellent discussions in section. Impactful readings\r\nWeaknesses: lack of consistency as semester went on. Sky's lectures stopped and eventually lectures stopped altogether. I really missed these later in the semester. They were a highlight of my experience at Yale thus far.",
                "A strength is that the course content was interesting and professor brought fascinating real world experience. A weakness is that for the second half of the semester we didn't even have lectures. We would just watch youtube videos and read articles.",
                "The course was very strong in getting students engaged with discussions. A lot of emphasis on the middle east so maybe more time spent on other events",
                "Strengths: manageable workload; passionate TAs and professor regarding the topics we talk about in class; both a strength and a weakness but putting giving students vague guidelines and expectations allowed us to have some creativity with our work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough guidance for the students, kind of just like \"here's the work, do it\". as a first-year, this was kind of difficult; rules and expectations were kind of vague; extremely disliked the \"wow factor\" as part of the midterm rubric --> i do not believe that 4 out of 20 points of our midterm papers should be part of our grade. If anything a \"wow factor\" should only be a bonus point or two. I also felt like most of the information we learned in this class could've been done on our not, not necessarily at Yale. \r\n\r\nNot really a weakness, but I think the students just really wished we could meet with the professor more.",
                "The course content is very engaging. However, only interacted with Professor Sky three times this semester:  her greeting during the first section, her book discussion, and during my final presentation. I would've appreciated seeing more of her much more.",
                "We had a weekly discussion section, in which we talked about the lecture and readings. The discussions were informative and allowed me to hear and understand different perspectives. I think the course was disproportionally focused on the Middle East, as we devoted more than half of the semester to affairs in the Middle East.",
                "The breadth of topics is both a strength and weakness as it was all very interesting and great to see how everything connects, but it also meant that lectures were very long and there were a LOT of readings every week. It was kind of hard to keep up!\r\n\r\nLoved the final project",
                "Some strengths of this course were the amount of information presented and the opportunity to hear from guest lecturers and people at the Jackson Institute. However, this course was heavily skewed on the political spectrum and the required articles for weekly reading lacked variety in political thought and bias. In addition, some of the information presented in recorded lectures was either historically inaccurate or left out crucial details when attempting to retell history, particularly in modules on the MENA region. This created an echo chamber of a discussion section and likely provided students with an inaccurate account of history on certain conflicts or events.",
                "TA was very good at facilitating discussion sections",
                "This being a survey course brings unavoidable weaknesses such as the speed at which material is covered and the lack of depth that results from that. However, there's not really a way to change that. That being said, I think this course found a good balance since the Middle East was extensively covered while the other topics were quickly skimmed.",
                "The first half was good. I really enjoyed Prof. Sky's lectures. As soon as she stopped giving it the lectures it went downhill. Watching a youtube seminar or something wasn't as good as what she could've done. I really liked her history lessons about the middle east conflicts as well as her book, so I wish there was more of that.",
                "The global issues we learned about were very well selected!",

                "I believe the strength was the discussion section, mainly because I had a great TF. This course could be improved by the professor making the lectures more interactive. This could be done through more lecture slides.",
                "The recorded lectures were good, but the level of engagement with Professor Sky is low. Most of the course was run by the TFs. The material is interesting, but there is a lot of material covered each week.",

Having a live virtual seminar definitely gave the class a sense of consistency although I wish it had been longer. \r\n\r\nComments on the readings were due a very awkward time before class and it disincentivized me from putting much effort into it. \r\n\r\nI found that with any class on Zoom the more time spent in smaller groups of maybe 4 or 3 the easier it was to be involved because with bigger groups it was very easy to just sit back and be passive.",

                "Depends. The class didn't turn out to be the way I had imagined it, but this is also my first year at Yale. I think still for an introductory course for global affairs, this does get the job done for teaching students about recent important global events. However, I feel like much of what I learned in this class did not require coming to Yale. I could've researched all of this on my own elsewhere.",
                "While it gives a great overview of Global Affairs, it is probably much better in person. It's an easy class to take during an online semester.",
                "I would recommend this course because you gain an overview of global issues. I would especially recommend this for anyone interested in Middle Eastern politics because most of the course focuses on affairs in the Middle East.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Great introduction to global affairs",
                "If the student is interested in global affairs, I would say yes, I would recommend this course. Just be aware that the course, particularly in this virtual format, is highly dependent on your TF and that the course may lack diversity of political thought. My TF did not even attempt to remain politically unbiased. This created a poor environment for expressing thoughts beyond the popular beliefs and made discussion sections quite boring.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes if you're interested in global affairs\/international relations",
                "I'd recommend it but survey courses are dreadful in the virtual format so do it when it's in person.",
                "I think so, Prof Sky is pretty cool and is a good lecturer but just know that you'll only get to hear from her for half the course.",
                "This course gives students good insight into a multitude of important world issues and is a must take course.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! This class is super fun and gives you a broad understanding of a myriad of topics.",
                "Yes, but I would recommend choosing a great TF.",
                "Yes, it is a very helpful overview and foundation for anyone interested in global affairs of America's involvement in the middle east.",
                "Yes"
