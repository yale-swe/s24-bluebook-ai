                "The structure of the course, which consisted of learning material in class, doing the corresponding homework, then having a dictation quiz or test shortly afterward was straightforward and effective. It isn't hard to participate in class because Professor Back will call on and engage with each student, which greatly reduces the pressure of feeling obligated to raise your hand. The homework and assignments aren't overly time-consuming, and this class was sometimes a nice break from other thinking-heavy courses.",
                "Strengths: Lots of continuous practice. Words learned for the most part are actually used by native speakers and are thus useful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes expected to know words that aren't officially taught. Intonation was only mentioned during dictation sessions and very barely.",
                "The small class size was great",
                "I found it very helpful to regularly split into partners and groups with my classmates to practice speaking. Much of the class was very helpful and engaging, but to nitpick, I think a bigger weakness of the class were the skit presentations. It didn't seem as helpful to write out scripts and memorize lines instead of doing something that involved speaking in a more natural/improvised way since I'd imagine we're more likely to use Korean in that way. They were still fun to make though.",
                "Great in classroom engagement and participation. Would suggest to provide quick review of the entire lesson at the end of class to really reinforce the material",
                "I loved this course. I didnt feel put down because of my lack of skill or mistakes, but also felt encouraged to work to improve my skill and fix those mistakes. I loved the exercises wed do in class and the level of engagement we had. I really dont have a weakness to talk about."

Having an interest will make the course much more fun and may make it easier to keep up, as each class will be an opportunity to learn new vocabulary and grammar. Korean in general is very well-taught here, and all of the professors in this department are kind and patient.",
                "Yes if you have a legitimate reason to learn the language. The atmosphere was very welcoming and the material is not too challenging so if you are motivated at least moderately this class is worth it.",
