Moreover, there were plenty of office hours that were incredibly helpful. I only wish that the professor would post lecture notes on Canvas so that if I couldn't understand something from my notes, I could reference the lecture notes to see what I missed.",

                "Strengths: good overview of both SM and EM. I felt like I have a good sense of both topics, and I only had to take one class to learn them. The class moves quickly, but it's doable. Professor Padmanabhan is an excellent lecturer. The homework is difficult but doable, as well. It builds very nicely off of the course material. Problem sets graded quickly.\r\nWeaknesses: there were jumps in logic and shorthand notations that made it tough to follow lecture.",
                "Strengths: Professor P. is very knowledgeable and very helpful. The course was well structured. The PSETs helped me learn the material. Navya, our TA was great as well.\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any at the moment. There was a lot of information crammed into the last class, but this is hard to time perfectly."

                "This class helped me understand E&M in a way that I never could before. The professor is wonderful and very engaging. Both the lectures and the office hours helped me immensely. Moreover, both exams were take-home and non-cumulative (the first midterm was after the statistical mechanics portion of the class, and the final only covered electricity and magnetism), which I think, especially for physics, is the best way to test student learning. The only issue I had was that for the final exam, the exam was open for two and a half days during the end of final exam period (one of the days was the day the final exam was officially scheduled for), which was more than enough time to complete it, but felt a little bit unfair as I had three other exams during that time frame that I needed to study for and complete while other people could focus only on this for the entire period. I still had plenty of time to complete the exam though.",

                "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class to any non-physics majors, as it's definitely not the most interesting physics elective you could take. If you're a physics major you don't really have a choice, other than 430.",
                "Yes! SM and EM are fundamental to how we understand the world, and this class builds an understanding of both topics. Professor Padmanabhan teaches the material well.",
                "Yes, mostly if you're majoring in Math, Physics, APHY or ASTR. If you aren't, and want to take it, it's great class with Prof. P. Make sure you have the math background."
