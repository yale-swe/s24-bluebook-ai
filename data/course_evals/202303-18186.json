                "I really appreciated a wider view of food and culture, the intersections and it really allowed me to see food in a different way. I learned to analyze people from their written words and actions without needing them to tell me directly.",
                "I gained exposure to the early history of food in the US (amongst indigenous and enslaved people populations), food policy in school lunch and labor unionization, and also subjective accounts of body image and food. I also learned how to analyze food in an academic way.",
                "This course provides a truly unique opportunity to think critically about food: how we eat it, how we prepare it, what we eat, how we eat, etc. It will expand your perspective about food, inviting you to challenge your own understandings of food and health in powerful ways. The course also deals with deeply sensitive issues, including trauma of various kinds related to food and identity. Being able to dissect these issues in a close-knit, supportive community was wonderful. This class is also unique in that it offers embodied experiences and a beautiful kitchen to do it in!",

                "No weakness, I absolutely loved it, especially the final projects where we chose our own topics and presented food or videos.",
                "I wanted this course to go deeper than it did. The readings were really interesting, and the professor's personal experiences are clearly so relevant to the course topics, yet discussions often lacked depth and nuance.",
                "Strengths: embodied practice was incredible, student presentations were fun, and table group conversations created safe spaces for everyone to participate. \r\nWeaknesses: In group conversation, I think people had the tendency to pull from their own experiences more than they did from the text. The instructor can help us maintain focus.",
                "Strengths: The course is very well organized -- Professor Trumpler does a great job of ensuring we get exposure to a breadth of perspectives and mediums in the course material. The kitchen table discussions also make for intimate conversation and foster a sense of community throughout the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it felt like the kitchen table discussions could use a little more facilitation, as the conversation would lose momentum. However, I think Professor Trumpler does a great job at sparking conversation with the discussion questions.",
                "Awesome class that is super fun! Wish we could cook more though!",
                "This class is a fun and different take on the classroom environment that felt very intentional and inclusively designed to allow as many people as possible to participate. Professor Trumpler designed a syllabus with many interesting readings from different perspectives on food that made me reconsider the subject area. However, the class discussions were sometimes lacking as they focused narrowly on food and identity rather than holistically approaching the many amazing books and readings we were assigned. I would have liked to have had broader discussions about all of the themes presented rather than only talking about food and identity.",
                "Strengths are the unique setting, around a table and with discussions. Could be improved with less prescriptive classroom frameworks.",
                "The class environment was really wonderful, and different from most of the other classes I've taken. We had many insightful small table discussions, and it was always fun to reflect on readings and make some food while doing it! I also really liked the speakers that came to talk to us. I felt, however, that the content of the course didn't significantly deepen over the semester. While it was always great to talk to classmates, I think the focus on small-table discussions (often with new groups of students) for almost every class meant that, by the end of the semester, I didn't really feel like we were building upon knowledge. For that, I think this was a great introduction to food studies and WGSS/English, but I wished we had gone a little deeper into our topics.",
                "Great readings and structure. Preparation and class itself never felt like a chore- had so many wonderful conversations that expanded my perspectives on relationships to food. Wish we'd been able to spend more time on food service and structures."

While the class content is not hard, the assignments did take a lot of time and energy. The class, this semester at least, was quite big (~30 students), so if you prefer small seminars, you might want to consider the class size.",
