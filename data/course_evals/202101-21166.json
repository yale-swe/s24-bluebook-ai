                "We learned a lot about the intersection between cognition and perception, as well as the distinctions between the two fields. This class taught me how to think critically and analytically about scientific papers.",
                "This course presented a great mix of vision science and social psychology. It really helps you develop the skills you need to read and understand scientific studies\/scholarly articles as we read around 5 of them per week. We spent most of class time discussing the literature and thinking through the efficacy of different experiments. Overall I think it helped me become a better consumer of research while also indirectly making me a better researcher.",
                "Lots of critical scientific thinking. This class opened my eyes to the reality of perception and the limits of the term itself. It is surely fundamental but it is not all-encompassing. In fact, we observed many researchers blur the lines between higher cognition and perception (which is something to especially look out for in social psychology research). We had a great blend of experimental and conceptual learning on the topic of Social Perception to become more scientifically literate and overall better cognitive scientists. I also developed my own experimental study for the final paper that would be very interesting to carry out one day.",
                "Slightly better at identifying bad methods\/bad papers from doing our assigned readings and reading questions. Acquired the skill of developing a methods section by writing an experimental design paper."

He's extremely knowledgeable and always sparks more interesting discussion or brings up contributing studies in whatever we are doing. The weekly topics are very well put together and the prof. is willing to mold them to fit the students interests. lots of interaction with a prof. at the top of cog sci. These discussions were exactly what I desired from my dream Yale experience\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you don't really know how you are doing in the course for most of it as feedback does not really come into play until the final paper comes around",
                "The material is really interesting and the units for each week are well-thought-out. Sometimes it can be hard to understand the point of the conversation or feel like you have progressed beyond your own understanding of the many papers we read, even after the weekly seminar. There's a nice diversity in the intellectual level of questions that people ask and an environment that makes all of those questions feel welcome, even if they're not always answered to the same degree."

                "Professor Scholl is an absolute legend in my book. After taking intro cog sci with him last semester, I was blessed with the chance to take this seminar. My expectations were exceeded and so much more. Being able to discuss and dig deep into the realm of perception in general is limited at Yale, so this opportunity should not be passed up if you can take it. Always a great discussion with great participation that is so intellectually stimulating (and really the most intellectually stimulating class I've taken at Yale). With all that said, BE ABSOLUTELY SURE to actually give this class your all, for there is a lot of scientific reading and thinking that you should be doing consistently (in other words, don't get behind and do all of the weekly readings in one day). This really amped up my development as a cognitive scientist, and I am super thankful for it.",
                "This class is better as an upperclassman -- I wouldn't take this as a sophomore. You definitely can, and it won't be so difficult or anything, but it also won't be as enjoyable as it would be at a later stage. There's a ton of reading each week and it is not rehearsed in seminar. The material is very interesting but not foundational, so you should take some other, more basic classes first to a) have better perspective on what this course is and isn't about and b) not skip over the foundations by taking this class first. It also kind of feels like the answer to all of the catchy questions that draw you in to the course is \"no, x cool psychological phenomenon is not really a part of vision, as the cool question suggests, but higher-level judgment.\" Take it to open up some really cool topics that you might become interested in exploring in more depth and with more conclusiveness later!"
