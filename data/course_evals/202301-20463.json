                "This class helped me to think in different ways about queer spaces, how we define and study them, and what role they have both inside and outside of queer circles.",
                "This course provided an intersectional understanding of the way bodies and pleasure are perceived in Society and in queer nightlife. I appreciated the ability to freely ask questions in a way that felt secure and gave me the ability to use my peers as sites of knowledge and experience.",
                "Learned to engage critically with texts spanning widely different contexts.",
                "I think one of the biggest takeaways I have from this course is the kind of discussion and group culture I want to be a part of while I'm at yale. This was a really special class full of people with really one of a kind stories to share and I'm grateful I got to be a part of it. I think a lot of the frameworks we were working and thinking with can also be developed in other WGSS classes, but the way people show up for each other in this course is really unique. It definitely changed the way I think about approaching a classroom space here and making sure I'm showing up as me and showing up in the ways that I want to.",
                "Queer culture and nightlife, how to have a fluid discussion and how to form my own opinions on academic discourse",

                "This was an amazing course!!!! Professor Vargas is fantastic!!",
                "I loved this class! It was a really interesting dive into queer life and scholarship and addressed a different side than I have seen in other WGSS courses. Prof. Vargas did a really good job bringing in diverse perspectives and challenging institutional narratives of queer spaces. I also really valued the 'upgrading' model and the emphasis on engagement and consistency over grades and percentages.",
                "Strengths- class grading allowed for genuine growth and ability to learn without pressure, class conversations flowed well because there was trust and comfort within our group that was facilitated through the professor, and the final story map assignment option was a wonderful way to bring the class together at the end.",
                "Strengths: well thought out course design, never too much work at once\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes got a little off topic during discussions, but that's not really a fault of the course, didn't receive feedback on assignments",
                "I think one of the biggest strengths of this class is its flexibility. The fact that it's a two hour seminar once a week with a certain theme meant that discussion could flow without many barriers. I don't think it's a class for everyone because I think you get out of it what you put in and what you're open to receiving, in part because of that flexible structure. But at the same time, I don't know that I would suggest changing anything because on some level I think the class attracts people who are going to get a lot out of it.",
                "The professor was amazing. Everything was awesome",
                "I honestly cannot recommend this course enough, one of my favorite at Yale.",
                "Professor Vargas is the best. They really created a space for discussion, bringing their knowledge and insight into the classroom without disrupting the flow of the ideas that students also brought. The reading selection for the syllabus was STELLAR. The ungrading system, and weekly paper as opposed to big midterm\/final assignments, ensured that I remained engaged throughout the entire course and that I was not overwhelmed with everything at the end. Loved it."

                "YES, this course was not only wonderfully led by the instructor but the course materials truly provide scholarship that no other course on campus does. As a WGSS major, this class introduces concepts and conversations not often mentioned or taught by the department.",
                "Yes, regardless of if you are a WGSS major. I am not and was taking for a SO credit and it was awesome. Prof Vargas is an incredible professor, makes sure you are supported, and offers super thoughtful insight. Really enjoyed the readings and discussions, and there's no big final assignment, super chill throughout",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The syllabus was phenomenal and full of really incredible readings I never would have found on my own, and the discussion was even better. Everyone had so much insight to offer and I learned a lot from each and every seminar. I also really appreciated the culture\/dynamic of the class. Especially as the semester went on, it was clear that everyone felt super comfortable being themselves. I think we were able to create a really unique classroom space that will continue to inspire the way I approach classes at yale from here on out.",
