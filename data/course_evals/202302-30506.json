I improved my fluency and understanding of all the programs and also expanded my idea of what a website could be. On top of that, I still learned a lot that I didn't know before. The professor and TA were very nice and helped us with any coding questions. Very interesting conversations as well.",

I usually was fine, but would appreciate more guidance in terms of direction of projects.",

Best of all, there is lots of space to take individual initiative with your learning within the personally guided reading responses, discussions, and projects."
