   "comments": [
    "I further developed my Arabic speaking, listening, and reading skills - mostly in standard but also with some Levantine listening comprehension.",
    "Much more comprehensive understanding of arabic grammar and assimilated a lot more vocabulary.",
    "Al-Kitaab L1-L4, Learned more new vocab, practiced speaking and reading large text",
    "Improved listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills",
    "I am so grateful for the opportunity to take this course and to focus almost entirely on Arabic for several weeks. The level of immersion and rigor was almost like a study-abroad program; this was fortunate for most of the students, who were taking the course as a backup plan after summer trips fell through due to the pandemic. I grew as a reader, developing greater speed and accuracy when reading aloud and comprehension when reading silently. And though I hardly noticed as it happened, my listening comprehension and ability to transcribe speech also improved considerably with dictations and videos. These exercises increased in difficulty as the course progressed, so when I looked back on earlier dictations and videos at the end, they seemed much simpler. I also increased my vocabulary and became more comfortable with grammar concepts like verb forms,  and its sisters, and case markings.",
    "intermediate arabic",
    "I learned how to communicate and present in both Modern Standard Arabic and Levantine Arabic dialect.",
    "I learned how to comprehend and read long articles in Arabic, as well as understand Arabic films and videos. I also learned more about the Arab culture.",
    "My Arabic reading and writing improved immensely.",
    "I learnt a lot of Arabic grammar rules!",
    "Learned some more about Arabic vocabulary and grammar as well as culture and issues of migration.",
    "I advanced my skills in speaking, writing, reading, and comprehension."

    "The condensed summer time-frame forced me to spend a lot of time studying daily, which really helped me learned the language.  As expected, I have progressed a good deal more quickly than in the school year.  The unavoidable Zoom component, however, is less optimal.  It's harder to read facial expressions and conduct an effective class with so many people, and students (count me guilty sometimes) are more reticent to volunteer answers then in in-person class.  I'm glad we spoke more Arabic in class than last year, but I think I would have been happier had we tried to move to an Arabic-only classroom (or close).",
    "It was sometimes hard to stay focused\/ engaged during the two hour Zoom sessions. Maybe a slightly greater variety of activities (fewer drills from Al-Kitaab and more Kahoot and that sort of thing) or perhaps a 5-minute break in the middle of each session would be helpful.",
    "The online nature of the course worked well and I felt workload was pretty evenly distributed throughout the 5 weeks. I also liked that we got to do our own projects on Friday with the video analysis and recordings + it was nice to not have the burden of a two hour mandatory zoom every day of the week. \r\nThe only weakness of the class was that I felt we sometimes dragged out lessons and they could have been shorter\/we could have done more alternative activities since it followed the same patten every week by following the book.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Aziz is a great intstructor! Despite having to use Zoom, he implemented as many resources he could to the best of his ability to improve the quality of our learning. I also tremendously enjoyed listening to Tsunami by Ahmed Chawki.\r\nWeaknesses: Al-Kitaab is a very disorganized book. The vocab has no real structure, it's all over the place. Also, I wish we practiced more Shaami.",
    "Strengths: Lots of drills in the textbook, plenty of assignments to reinforce class work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much vocab in short period of time",
    "The workload was very intense, with many assignments per day, which is both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, the level of exposure helped us grow as Arabic readers, speakers, and writers. On the other hand, sometimes there was so much homework that I had no choice but to move through the assignments as quickly as I could, putting each word into a translator tool without pausing to remember the vocabulary, or making guesses on dictations instead of meticulously thinking through each exercise. \r\n\r\nThe amount of homework also meant that we spent most of our shared class time reviewing the homework; the rest of the class time was usually spent in breakout rooms. I understand that a heavy workload is necessary, but it might be more helpful if paired with class instruction that engages students, like asking students to explain grammar concepts, having conversations that involve the vocabulary, or having students write on the blackboard (in this case, the virtual \"whiteboard\" offered on Zoom). That being said, the time spent in breakout rooms was very helpful and my classmates and I learned a lot by sharing our knowledge! And I also appreciate the many forms of technology used to make this class interesting: VoiceThread, FlipGrid, Kahoot, and more.",
    "incredible TA",
    "The strength is that the work is outlined very well in the schedule so that you can stay on track and even get ahead. The weakness is that there was not a huge focus on the dialect in comparison to MSA.",
    "I think the class was well organized, and I really liked our use of multiple books. However, I thought the in-person class time was a bit long, and it often felt as if we were doing random drills instead of learning. I think class could've been shortened, and we could've focused more on actually learning the concepts in class, as opposed to just doing more homework-like drills. The other thing I would add is that there should definitely be more of an emphasis on speaking. Though my reading and writing levels have improved a ton, I can still barely carry a conversation because we never practiced.",
    "This course was challenging because it was so condensed. It was very heavy on the homework and at times it felt that this was at the expense of ensuring a strong understanding of what was being taught. In a regular semester, it might have been a better course as there would have been more time to review concepts and go over things. However since it was condensed, it felt rushed.\r\n\r\nThe main strength for the course is that it follows one textbook exactly so you always know where you are up to and can keep track of what is being taught. The main weakness was the lack of instruction. The course employed a flipped classroom style which personally wasn't very engaging. Most of the in-person\/online classes were spent going over textbook drills and homework type exercises, and there were only a few classes that involved explicit instruction.",
    "Learning on the internet was not very helpful especially test taking was marred!",
    "I wish the tests were more consistent with what we studied, or that we could at least go over them in class.",
    "This course was structured well and adapted to zoom to maximize learning."

    "If somebody wants to learn Arabic, the summer is a good time to do so (although if possible I'd suggest study abroad, as I was going to do before coronavirus).  You learn a lot of Arabic and for somebody like me with a different major, it allows me to learn my first summer so that I can spend later summers doing stuff with my major.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed my arabic career and I preferred L3 online arabic to normal class arabic due its brevity. i feel like in normal class time, because it is stretched out over twice as long, it is harder to absorb the information since less depth is gone into in every session",
    "I would easily recommend this course. I'm not playing, if you have even the slight interest... TAKE IT! Besides the excessive workload, this class or rather the arabic sequence has all positives. If you can take it with Dr. Aziz. Great Ustadh!",
    "If youre looking for an easy way to get L3 requirement out of the way and have the time to put in the work",
    "Certainly, learn some Arabic!",
    "I would recommend that students study Arabic abroad if they can get the funding; this was impossible for us this year because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.",
    "if you want to solidy arabc",
    "Yes, I would because I think it is a good way to learn the grammar and other tools necessary to master the Arabic language.",
    "Yes I would, I believe it's a great class to strengthen one's Arabic abilities.",
    "Yes, I think the summer course was very well organized and though it's a lot of work, it's a great way to learn Arabic. However, if you can couple it with some immersion that would improve your speaking, definitely do that. Your speaking will not improve from this course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who have a lot of time and energy to commit during the summer, as I spent the majority of my days doing homework for this course in addition to the two hour class that was scheduled every weekday. If this sounds intimidating, definitely choose to do this course as a regular semester course as that would only be a one hour class per day and would have a few more weeks added on so you have more days to revise the vocabulary of each chapter before rushing through to the next one.",
    "Yes. Prof. Aziz is awesome!",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in pursuing Arabic and want to challenge themselves."
