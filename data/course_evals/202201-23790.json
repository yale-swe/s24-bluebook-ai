                "Along with an in-depth knowledge of some of Foucaults work, I gained a new perspective on many issues like power, the family, and sexuality. I also learned better strategies for reading and writing in the humanities.",
                "I gained important knowledge of Foucault's work in his \"History of Sexuality\" books. We learned about how discourse on sexuality developed over time, as well as competing and complimenting theories such as feminist accounts and queer theories. In addition, I believe my writing skills improved with Professor De Souza's attentive feedback.",
                "This course helped me to improve my analysis skill as well as acquire and adopt different frameworks of analysis. Its use of Foucault as the main author of focus allowed me to learn from one of the names that have constructed our ideas of sexuality which is key to the WGSS major.",
                "A close reading of Foucault's History of Sexuality and commentary texts on the concepts inspired in each chapter.",
                "Great understanding of Foucault's main ideas, able to apply a wide variety of concepts\/techniques to real life situations, overview of how his ideas have shaped others'",
                "I developed a nuanced and detailed understanding of Foucauldian theory surrounding modern sexuality, especially that pertaining to Volumes 1 and 2 of The History of Sexuality. I also learned about challenges and criticism of Foucault's work, as well as how to apply it to my own beliefs and life. In this course, I truly feel that the way I view the world and themes of sexuality, power, gender, a repression have shifted.",
                "Very rare opportunity at Yale to study a thinker in-depth whose views are super relevant for so many different fields and for everyday life!! All with one of the most incredibly engaging, knowledgeable, and kind professors at Yale and probably anywhere. Could not recommend the class any more strongly!"

                "I really enjoyed this course - the class discussion was excellent and I feel that Igor was great at both teaching us and facilitating conversation during seminar.",
                "The course was incredibly well-organized and the readings were manageable, which allowed for fruitful discussions during class. Additionally, Professor De Souza does a great job mixing mini-lectures, small group discussions, and large group discussions during the seminar, which really helps the two hours pass by quickly.",
                "The strength is the instructor. He was really inclusive and effective in the discussions and allowed students to explore topics in whatever way most suitable for your own intellectual curiosity.",
                "Sometimes reading was a little heavy. Good balance of lecture\/discussion",
                "I think that this course is perfectly suited to a seminar discussion and that the readings are thoughtfully chosen to facilitate student learning. I do wish that there was perhaps a better outline for course content (maybe around themed units) but that may be specific to my learning style. I appreciate the writing assignments that I received in this course and felt that they were appropriately challenging and conducive to applying and developing my knowledge in a critical way."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! I loved this course, and I really feel like Igor cared about our learning and wanted us to have a good experience. Its only three papers, but dont underestimate them - Foucaults work is rather dense, and it takes time to read it with a full enough understanding to write a paper. The course is very illuminating and helps you to think about the world in a new light.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. As a philosophy major who had never taken a WGSS course, I found that the course material (as well as Professor De Souza's patient instruction) progressed in a way that was easy to follow. Overall, this course really challenges you to think not only about how you approach sex but also about how you view a variety of societal norms. I found myself discussing information from this course with suitemates and friends throughout the semester; overall, it is a very invaluable course.",
                "Yes I definitely would.",
                "Totally. I think this course teaches you to have a queer perspective, not in the way that conditions your sexuality, but in a way that forces you to question what things are and why they are made in such manner. Appreciating Foucault is a difficult task because of the reading difficulty, and having a class like this allows you to think the most. Foucault's method of analysis truly allows you to live like an independent thinker who is highly critical of relations of power and the construction of identities that span across history.",
                "Yes, Igor is great and the material is really interesting\/will change how you see the world",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course. It was a fascinating subject and always a stimulating and exciting discussion. While it is a lot of reading, and sometimes dense reading, it is very engaging and thought-provoking and most of my questions or confusions were always addressed in the discussion even without me asking. As someone new to WGSS and this type of course in general, I found it extremely rewarding to think critically about one specific theorist\/historian and his work from multiple angles. Moreover, although the class time is long, the discussion is generally very engaging and many times I would leave class excited to share Foucault's, my, and my peers thoughts.",
                "Yes for any major and any background! Excellent, informative course and Professor de Souza is absolutely amazing!!"
