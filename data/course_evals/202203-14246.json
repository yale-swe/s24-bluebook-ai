                "I know SO much more about North American Indigeneity than I had previously. This course gave a really fluent overview on Native American and Indigenous Studies and helped me keep a pulse on the present topics relevant to Indigenous communities.",
                "When I came into this course I was struggling to understand my place within the wider Yale community academically, socially, and culturally. Prof. Andrews created an environment for me that allowed me to grapple unabashedly with these tough questions. There are no words to articulate what this class has meant to me. The readings we were provided, the conversations we were able to have, and the medicine Prof. Andrews carries as, simply a person, made the class feel like my first encounter of \"finding home\" while at Yale. Even while navigating this space for the first time, she approached her students and her work in a good way and it was felt every class. Beyond academics, she reminded me that there are places for warmth, community, and rich creation on Yale's campus and within its walls.",
                "Different theories within the realm of Native and Indigenous studies that were not limited to simply North American Indigenous populations, but Indigenous populations around the world, including Japanese Ainu and the Sami population of Northern Europe.",
                "I developed an overview of Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS), particularly recent work in the field.",
                "Got a foundational understanding of the field of NAIS (Native American and Indigenous Studies). Lots of critical views and frameworks for understanding Indigenous Peoples relationship with each other, land, Nature, etc. Delved into the impacts of settler colonialism on Native communities and how resistance movements have survived, succeeded, and flourished despite the challenges imposed by capitalism. Lots of meaningful discussions with Native and non-Native students.",
                "I learned how story can be a way of telling theory. \r\nThe intersection between feminism, queer studies, and Indigenous studies. \r\nThe Indigenous style guidance is also very helpful. \r\nIt's just good to have a safe space and community to talk about colonialism.",
                "I gained a deep and wide understanding of the current state of anticolonial though and theory in this course. Through this understanding, I can more easily see settler colonial systems and structures in my everyday experiences, and can understand the actions of individuals who react poorly to knowledge of their complicity in settler colonialism. The insights that this course provided me are many and will continue to change my thinking long after I graduate."

            "comments": [
                "This course flies through such a comprehensive look at NAIS that I left the course feeling far more literate in the terms and subjects relevant to North American Indigenous communities. The course was well-structured as well as a consequence of the assignments; I felt as if the assignments held me accountable to engage with the readings and gave me a lot of room to improve my analysis of the course content and my own writing. I had a lot of fun with the Perusall assignments because they helped me understand how other students were interpreting and engaging with the material.\r\nHowever, the course could definitely benefit from engaging in more work about South American and African Indigenous communities. While I learned a lot about North American and even Asian Indigenous communities, I felt as if we didn't have as much investigation into African and South American content.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Andrews understands how to craft dynamic class conversations regarding the readings. She has the ability to bring the excitement to the class through her passion and knowledge of Indigenous studies. I also appreciated the kindness she always extended to us because she can recognize that we are people, too, and Yale is not always the easiest place to exist. Lastly, the creative project was the perfect fusing between theory and practice. It felt like an opportunity to embody the knowledge we had engaged with throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nWeakness: One point of tension in the course had to do with the fact that many of us were entering this seminar with different degrees of knowledge about Indigenous Peoples and NAIS more broadly. It would have been beneficial to offer a lecture course first--- possibly make it a series? By doing it this way, there is a greater chance that the students in this course will be (mostly) on the same page and time doesn't have to be taken away to catch others up. Just a minor suggestion!",
                "This course was great because Professor Andrews was very responsive to student feedback and needs. She also did a great job at selecting our readings. However, sometimes the texts we read were kind of dense and difficult to parse through. Additionally, there were a lot of graded assignments.",
                "Strengths: Incredible professor, engaging readings, insightful assignments and assessments, fair grading, thoughtful and understanding professor. \r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "The theories covered in this class are very progressive. Prof. Andrews offers great guidance and a safe space for our discussion. I think the depth and elaborateness of class discussion are more important than how many topics we have covered. Sometimes to cover the readings assigned I feel like we don't have enough time to dive deeper.",
                "The use of Perusall was a strength of this course. It allowed students to interact with each other and build thoughts off of each others' thoughts in a more conducive environment than a simple discussion board. I very much enjoyed reading the comments and annotations on the Perusall page. It helped me to understand my classmates' perspectives better. \r\n\r\nI think that the biweekly discussion responses were less valuable to my learning. It felt more a rote endeavor than the Perusall annotations. I would have liked to see more Perusall annotations and perhaps a short freehand response at the end of each week/section of learning to encapsulate the broad themes that were presented and learned.\r\n\r\nThe other weakness of the course was the division that existed within the class--both physically in the classroom and in discussion. The Indigenous students in the course wound up sitting on one side of the classroom and the non-Indigenous students on the other side. This presented a kind of weird energy in the classroom. Though this is not the fault of Dr. Andrews, maybe some thought could be given to how to facilitate more discussion and better discussion in future renditions of this class. Discussion did improve towards the end of the semester. Maybe it just takes time."

                "Absolutely! I think that a lot more students should take this course or another course similar to it because many non-Indigenous students are not literate in Indigenous topics at all. It helped me understand how to engage in conversations about North American Indigeneity and why our communities have the perspectives that we have in the modern era. This course has a little bit of something for everyone; whether you're a well-versed scholar in the topic or have literally no knowledge, this course stands as a really valuable point to learn more and engage in really productive dialogue regarding really nuanced and challenging issues.",
                "Yes! Every student will take something away from this course. It quite literally changed my entire perspective about my participation as a student at Yale. It was very informative for not only my academic interests, but personal questions I was tending to over the semester.",
                "Yes, there are very few courses like this offered here and it can reveal a LOT about the impact of colonialism in modern American society, in addition to Indigenous resistance against it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others. The material is interesting and relevant, and Prof. Andrews is a phenomenal instructor with so much knowledge to share. The readings are interesting and the assignments are useful and fun. For indigenous students specifically, I would just advise that you should be ready to deal with non-Native students who are not well versed in Native issues and will more often than not say things that affect the class atmosphere. Other than that, this course is wonderful and well taught, and Id recommend it for sure.",
                "YES TAKE THIS COURSE!! It is soooo amazing and the professor is incredible. The readings will help you think about the field of NAIS (Native American and Indigenous Studies) and Anticolonial Theory, and you will have learned and thought so much!! Trust me. Take this class!!",
                "Yes, Critical Indigenous Studies are an essential part to understand the contemporary colonialism.",
                "Yes, Prof. Andrews is wonderful and kind and this class has been a source of support and growth as an Indigenous scholar and writer at a PWI.",
                "Yes. This course is so foundational to expanding understandings of land, belonging, existence, and the United States. Additionally, Dr. Andrews is a fantastic teacher."
