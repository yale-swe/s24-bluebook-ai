                "The strength of this course was the breadth of topics to which you are exposed. Additionally, learning the proofs and rationale behind different theorems is very helpful in understanding the concepts. It would be helpful if they could post the solutions to the problem sessions, however. I couldn't attend them, and the problem session problems weren't as helpful without the associated solutions. But overall, it was great.",
                "Strengths? Couldn't tell you. \r\nWeaknesses: instructors, course material, peer tutors, psets, grading, lack of review sessions, lack of practice problems, lack of clarity on what's expected, question 1 on psets, useless help sessions\r\nThis course needs restructuring, better instructors, and please, for the love of God, some competent peer tutors (I don't know all of them, I've heard Supriya is good)",
                "I think the course was organized pretty well, although I didn't appreciate how the office hours were all in the morning\/early afternoon on weekdays, as I wasn't able to attend nearly any of them.",
                "I thought the office hours were very inconvenient for people with extracurriculars",
                "The course was very inhuman, and felt very isolating. In addition, there were no resources to help with homework, which were sorely needed.",
                "I think if someone was very interested in proofs and linear algebra they would succeed in this course, but everyone else is very unengaged and struggled in the course.",
                "We could focus more on the more challenging theories in class. Also having a more specific syllabus in terms of what chapters and sections will be covered is beneficial as we can read ahead",
                "This course is terribly taught. I had to write a 600-word complaint to the DUS just for them to force the professors to release answers to the practice problems. Imagine telling your students \"There's no need for an answer key, you should be confident in your answers\" while removing the cheat sheet that was standard in previous offerings of the course. Just a terrible course in general and the professors need to get a grip on the reality that they are teaching an introductory math course and not some higher-level one. If the statistics were available somewhere, I could bet that 225 had one of the highest credit\/d\/fail rates in all of Yale. It also confuses me why they would teach Gaussian Elimination as one of the last few topics in the course when everything they taught before it could have been simplified via Gaussian Elimination. At the end of the day, I didn't need this course for my major, but I pity those who do because they are not in for a fun time. Also, it is important to note that the syllabus has listed the cutoff for an A at 95 and there is no curve in the class. If you lose 2-3 points consistently on the PSETS you are already flirting with the A\/A- range.",
                "Strengths: engaging material, fun problem sets, engaging lectures (even if they were a bit fast sometimes)\r\nWeaknesses: lack of communication with ULAs and students (about problem sets, tests, etc.)",
                "I think the instructors behind MATH 225 were great but the organization of the course could greatly be improved. In short, the instructors of the course should take a better look at how the MATH 120 and MATH 115 calculus classes are taught. Before every class, readings followed by a quiz that accounted for 5% of your grade were required and this helped me show up to class far more prepared to investigate the content of the class in better depth with the professor than if I did not have those quiz materials. Due to the abstract nature of proof based linear algebra, I think this kind of enforced advanced preparation would help students be better prepared."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a prerequisite to many classes and majors and is generally very interesting and enjoyable. The grading scheme does seem very tough, though as you need >95% to guarantee an A. Hopefully, they modify it to make it more lenient. Definitely use LaTeX on the problem sets. It's super easy to use, saves so much time, and makes your proofs cleaner and more readable. Very much worth learning.",
                "It is badly structured, the instructors can barely teach, and the office hours are useless--they become group study sessions instead. The psets are difficult--more difficult the week after exams for some reason?--and so are some of the exams. The course does not facilitate learning--after a while I was reading through their solutions, trying to figure out what they wanted because even if you know the answer, you won't know how to write it the way they want you to write it because they don't tell you but expect you to know regardless and will take off points for the smallest things. And, then they have bullshit and pretentious first questions on psets where you're supposed to read articles or watch videos about the beauty of math and how best to learn math well when they are single handedly destroying any love I had for math--and I did like math quite a bit, wanted to take more than was required for my major. Not after this. If you don't absolutely need a proof-based class, I would strongly recommend going for 222 instead.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this course and it's the reason I've decided to become a math major. Just be prepared to put a fair amount of effort into the p-sets.",
                "Maybe the structure and the proof of all learned concepts was good, but homework needed more support.",
                "No, linear algebra is not taught until the 3rd month, the homework is almost always disconnected from what you learned in class and is often explicitly designed for you to teach yourself some concept by figuring out a proof. While this is sometimes a good method of teaching, the delayed feedback on the homework makes it so I never actually figured out if was right because by the time I got the grade bike we were on a different unit. The office hours were also not helpful for getting review or help on the pset, instead they just gave you a set of more problems to do and then sat in silence.",
                "Only if you are required to take it. Take 222 by every means necessary (especially if you already have proof experience).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any other students who enjoy math. MATH 225 is the class that really wanted to make me continue with math in college."
