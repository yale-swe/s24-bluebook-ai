By reading many tv pilots (and watching these tv episodes if youre up for it), you take a really deep dive into TV writing that helps you understand the craft so much more and feel comfortable writing a tv episode (or part of it). How cool is that?!!!",

                "Strengths: Professor Tracy has a wealth of industry experience that he brings to this class to teach all of the essential TV writing skills very well. He also brings prominent guests and creates a fun writers room environment that mimics that of a tv show. He provides excellent feedback, lots of it, and offers wonderful ideas. Weaknesses: Absolutely none.",
                "1. Groundwork: Reading scripts weekly provided an intuitive understanding of current conventions. Writing coverage felt like a directly applicable skill that I very much appreciated learning.  THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY I GOT FROM THIS CLASS is that the best textbook for learning how to write well is your favorite piece of media.  Analyzing it for structure, dialogue, theme, etc. and then mimicking it is a key form of practice.   \r\n\r\n2. In Class Production:  Breaking down scripts together helped me understand what scripts make it an what don't -- it also helped me understand what makes good literature as a whole.  The writers workshop day was superb.  The quick writing assignments initially very difficult, but learning to write under a time limit helped me to produce ideas quickly once finals rolled around.\r\n\r\n3. Speakers:  The speakers brought in were PHENOMENAL.  Jesse Stern especially stood out as someone who knew the industry and wanted to share as much knowledge as possible.  All of the speakers were stellar.",
                "Strengths: Tracy is a real-life TV and podcast writer, and he gave us a very interesting, knowledgeable view of TV writing, TV history, and the TV industry. He brought in some renowned guests as class speakers. The day that we did a mock-writers room was fun and a great hands-on experience. I liked the class structure of reading a script for HW and then learning a specific craft-based thing as demonstrated in the script during class. I also liked the progression of developing your idea by writing a story area, then an outline, then a full 30 pages of the pilot script (at each step, with written feedback from Tracy) throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with many teachers who also have a job outside teaching, sometimes it felt like Tracy was distracted / not fully engaged. (For instance, when he split us into small groups to work with our classmates, it would be nice if he walked around the room to engage with us and answer our questions instead of being on his computer.) I think if you want to become a better writer, there are other courses where you get a lot more built-in personalized attention to your writing (Tracy's feedback is helpful, just not that many opportunities to receive it). Overall though, this course does a solid job teaching the basics of writing for TV and Tracy is a knowledgable real-life TV writer!"

                "Yes, if you're interested in TV writing specifically!",
                "If you love tv, YES! A fantastic way to not only learn about different shows but to also push yourself to write part of a pilot throughout the semester. The fact that we stuck with one idea for almost the entire semester really allows students to dig into it and flesh the idea out in class with your peers. Also, the small class size is great!!"
