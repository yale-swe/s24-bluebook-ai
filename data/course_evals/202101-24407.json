                "Overall, there were a lot of topics covered that are important. However, one main takeaway was global health as an institution and the methodologies that guide where the money in global health goes. I'm not sure if that was the purpose of this course, but I do think I have a much better understanding of how those working in global health (mainly at the governance level) prioritize certain issues. We learn that there are so many global health issues out there but the governance level seems to have a zoomed-in view of global health - looking at certain issues once it gets bad or depending on who is getting affected.",
                "I learned about historical and ongoing interdisciplinary research and work done to promote global health. We studied case studies and important global health metrics to learn about inequities in health and disparities of resources in different regions of the world that affect the wellbeing of all populations.",
                "Fantastic foundation for thinking critically about issues in global health; the multiple causes, facets, and populations involved with each issue; and for understanding what is going on in the news!",
                "This class really gave me a good introduction to global health as a whole and touched upon many topics I have not learned about in other classes which I believe could be beneficial information for me to know in the future.",
                "While the course covered an incredible variety of global health topics, I think the most important skill I got out of this course was how to approach issues from a global health mindset. The course was incredibly relevant to current events, and Professor Fallon was always careful to highlight these connections. She also encouraged us to question the material we read and analyze it from multiple perspectives.",
                "I learned about global health and what it is. This was a typical survey course.",
                "So much! This was a great intro to global health class. Covered a lot and had a lot of repeated connections to things happening today. Great course",
                "I learned about global malnutrition, NGOs, medical tourism, epidemics and international responses to health challenges.",
                "I learned about the basics of global health",
                "A general topic of the most important topics in global health, global disparities in health outcomes, case studies of certain diseases/conditions and countries (such as maternal mortality in India and HIV/AIDS). I also strengthened my ability to evaluate health policies through the two paper assignments. I appreciated that the papers allowed me to delve deep into two diseases/conditions in country contexts.",
                "I learned about a variety of introductory global health topics such as non-communicable diseases, how social/environmental factors impact health (e.g. poverty), and how to critically evaluate current global health practices. There were many enjoyable guest lecturers and topics that made you think.",
                "i learned more about global health and how to think about it!",
                "The first half consisted of concepts like the definition of global health, metrics (DALY, etc.), CDs and NCDs, governance, etc. The second half focused more on case studies (like ebola, HIV/AIDS, connection to COVID-19, etc.)",
                "This course provided a wonderful foundation to understand health in many contexts.",
                "Gained a breadth of knowledge on global health and writing policy memos",
                "I learned about the various aspects of global health, such as ethics, its history, and global health mission trips. I learned how to critically think about these subjects and think interdisciplinary",

                "Learned a broad intro to global health",
                "I learned very little from this class. It really is very much an intro, which is fine, but you definitely won't be very challenged by the content. The assignments were also not very helpful. The two papers were extremely similar, I learned almost nothing, and they felt like a waste of time.",
                "I learned about global health, including what the field involves, issues, and how to reflect on these issues. I also learned how to write a policy memo and read global health papers. This course made me really reflect on the healthcare systems in the world and the many disparities that still exist.",
                "I learned a lot about global health from an organizational perspective, found out more about critical issues facing the world's health, and also considered ethical frameworks to addressing health issues.",

                "Strength - My TA Deanna was very warm and engaging.",
                "Strength: great \"survey\" course of global health as a field. Professor Fallon is such an amazing person and instructor. \r\nWeakness: I wish we discussed more about our individual thoughts of what the institution of global health should look like. in the future I feel like that conversation was mainly absent, and it was more about like \"it is what it is\". I wish I could have engaged in that conversation in this class to further my knowledge but also I think it would have been beneficial for some of the people who were a bit disillusioned by what the field of global health can achieve in terms of goals.",
                "This was an incredible class and I could not have enjoyed the lectures and discussion sections more!",
                "I am amazed at how much ground we covered in this course. I did not expect to come away with such a comprehensive foundation for thinking about global health, but I certainly did!",
                "The strengths of this class included the material as I really enjoyed the topics we were learning about and felt that Professor Fallon was a good lecturer. However, a weakness for this class was the way in which the exams were set up. The expectations for what we could complete in limited time frames felt unreasonable at times and when many students voiced their concerns it felt as though their concerns disregarded. Especially with how hard this year has been, I just felt that our concerns were not acknowledged and the structures of the exams ended up creating more stress than necessary. I do believe though that in a normal year this would not have been a problem, but more something specific to being on zoom.",
                "The course could be a bit faster paced, but overall it was very well done. The only minor thing that could be improved is earlier posting of the weekly readings.",
                "I feel as if the content we learned was very superficial and not in depth. This class gave a broad overview of large global health issues, such as ebola, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases. I think we could have gone through more policies that have worked in regards to combatting these issues rather than just describing the problems.\r\n\r\nI think the exams were unnecessarily difficult, meaning it involved rote memorization of statistics and lecture slide facts that don't test your understanding, but rather your memorization abilities. In addition, the exam was extremely long and I believe that was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBecause the class final was scheduled to be on the last slot of exams, Professor Fallon wanted to change the format to be more accommodating. In sections, we voted on a new final exam format and I know that a lot if not the majority of students voted to have the exam be take home, but the format didn't change. Instead we just got a new exam slot, which ended up being fine. I just thought it was weird to have students vote on a new exam format, and then disregard that a little bit.",
                "Only strengths! Amazing course, so much to learn, and Dr. Fallon is the best!!",
                "LOVED having guest lecturers! In general, Zoom lectures can get a little monotonous, so having guests come kept it interesting!",
                "The course had many guest lecturers who provided extra nuance to the content that we covered in the main course. I appreciated their expertise. The structure of the course progressed very naturally and each lecture seemed to follow from the one before it.",
                "I liked the lectures, especially when we had guests, and I thought the reading was perfect in length\r\n\r\nThe exams were a significant time crunch, so if there is a way to shorten them for future years, that would be ideal",
                "Strengths: Professor Fallon is incredibly passionate about the material and does a great job at making the course engaging. She's also very accomodating and cares about her students' well-being. She invited a variety of guest speakers whose backgrounds ranged from diplomacy to medicine, and it was very inspiring and informative to hear from these diverse experts on various topics ranging from mental health to economic development. The paper assignments really striked the right balance between length and depth, and I found them rewarding to write. Professor Fallon also had well-structured lectures and slides that made reviewing easier. The TFs provided detailed, timely feedback on the writing assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally, the material would feel a bit repetitive. The lectures about global health agenda / WHO priorities sometimes appeared too broad/vague, and it would feel like a list of empty phrases. I think picking out a few items from a long agenda would be more helpful. The midterm also involved more memorization than I expected, and the questions were a lot of words for such a time-constrained exam. I do believe the exam can be restructured to involve more interpretation/writing.",
                "The course was well-balanced with different topics and guest lecturers, and the assessments/assignments were fair. I enjoyed Professor Fallon's (and the TFs) positive attitude and vast knowledge of the materials, because it made the course that much more engaging.",
                "strengths: the content is definitely engaging and super interesting \r\nweaknesses: the professor and the TAs are super picky and harsh on grading",
                "Prof. Fallon is a great lecturer and presented the right amount of material every lecture. The midterm and final were a time crunch though.",
                "Strengths: broad array of topics\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some topics were repetitive. more time could have been spent on further investigation of a topic",
                "Strengths: Wide variety of topics! Fair assumption of prior knowledge, easy to understand, engaging material.",
                "Strength: the material is interesting and timely, assignments were relevant\r\nWeakness: it was a little disorganized",
                "I thought the grading and general assignments were extremely vague without much guidance. There also seemed to be a great deal of confusion between teaching team members.",
                "strengths-the material is fascinating and professor Fallon is amazing! she's so so nice and very excited about the material which always makes the course better. no weaknesses, but something I think would be a nice addition is a requirement to attend a global health talk and then we could write a short reflection on it or something",
                "There could have been more feedback leading up to and following the writing assignments, but overall good. Maybe a checkpoint would have been nice?",
                "Material is somewhat interesting but lectures can be boring and repetitive",
                "One strength is that Prof Fallon is really nice and approachable. At the same time, she did not listen to our feedback (even when she explicitly asked for it), particularly on which mode of midterm/final exam we'd like, considering COVID. In terms of weaknesses, the assignments were really poorly planned out. I did not feel like I gained much from them at all. The midterm was the most poorly structured exam I've taken at Yale, but hopefully this will change in future years. There were also way too many guest lecturers. I enjoy guests, especially in a class like this, but they were not always great, and since they were all presenting on their very specific area of expertise, we ended up skipping or barely touching on a lot of the more general topics that had been outlined in the syllabus. My TF was also not great. I never got any feedback on assignments beyond a very vague sentence or two.",
                "A strength of this course is how comprehensive it is. We learned so many areas of global health that I had not thought about before, such as conflicts, medical tourism, and more. The guest lecturers were engaging, and I learned a lot from their areas of expertise. The class was organized, and I could follow along what was being talked about. I could connect different topics, and I could apply topics from one case study to others. I appreciated the discussion section activities that enhanced our understanding of certain concepts. The teaching team is very receptive to students and supportive. This course can be improved mainly by providing more feedback and guidance on assignments. I felt that I didn't really get much feedback on the paper and policy memo. I also think that logistics of exams and papers could be more clear and use up less of class time.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThis course covered really interesting concepts, and I think I stayed engaged because I was curious about many of the topics included in the lectures. Also, I was excited by the fact that the course included many guest speakers from all different backgrounds in global health. While I would have preferred to hear from less academics, we did hear from a former ambassador and important people in global health. Our sections were also setup to help us succeed, as we reviewed important concepts from class and had great conversations about global health topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI throughly enjoyed this class and really liked Professor Fallon and the TF's, however I felt that the expectations for writing assignments and tests were not very clear. While we were given a prompt and a general layout for the essays, I feel like the grading seemed a bit arbitrary at times. The main weakness related to this course was probably the exams - while we reviewed concepts in class, it often seemed like the tests sometimes involved super minute details. That said, I spent quite a bit of time studying for them so I felt ok about it. Perhaps next year the teaching team could provide a study guide or something along those lines.",
                "One strength was the specific topics and lecture discussions to global health. One weakness is the lack of communication about exams specific such as time, length, and topics, etc.",
                "Strengths: covers a wide range of topics in global health, provides opportunity to focus in through the essays on topics of interest\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: focuses on breath rather than depth; I felt like most of the information could be googled; readings were not interesting; section discussions were not great.\r\n\r\nI think the class has a lot of potential but should focus more hard discussion, critical thinking and prolbem solving",
                "Strengths: Professor Fallon is definitely a strength for this course: she is incredibly excited about the material and is really kind. The topics covered in lecture were always really interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness: At times the lectures felt a bit disorganized and unclear. There was often a lot of uncertainty throughout the semester (what the exam format will be, how long exams will be, etc.). Many other students did not feel that a section was needed for this course since much of the material felt straightforward.",
                "Strengths of this course were providing a broad overview of the field of global health while allowing for some more in depth exploration through the essays. One potential weakness was that there were a number of class days canceled due to covid schedule this semester, which was nice at the time but amounted to feeling like missing some learning opportunities. Also, just thought of this but it would be nice if the information from the slides could have citations next year! The readings allow you to dig deeper, but it would be good to be able to look up a specific reference for where some of the stats and info come from",

I think that the cost of conducting the test this way does not outweigh the benefit of having the test not open book and \"proctored\"."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. While people may get frustrated by the teachings of the institution of global health, I thought it was a great way to know what the status quo is like, especially so that we don't get swept away by the vision-casting that is pretty prevalent in the field of global health. Furthermore, Professor Fallon is really knowledgeable and puts a lot of effort into making the class enjoyable (lots of guest lecturers who are extremely experienced in the field).",
                "Yes, it was a great introductory glass into global health!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you do not know much about global health and wish to gain a good foundation within one semester.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the material in class and feel that if you are planning on going into the medical field this is a really useful class for you to take. Professor Fallon is very knowledgeable and passionate on the material and was a great lecturer.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, not only for the content it covers, but for how Prof. Fallon emphasizes an interdisciplinary and analytical approach.",
                "Yes. It was simple and interesting, but the exams were annoying and the sections were useless.",
                "YES! Take it with Dr. Fallon. She is amazing, so kind, and really designed the course so well. Great to get involved with global health, and see connections to various areas and how you can get into it further. So much applicable knowledge",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This course focuses on many different challenges that impact the global health space and challenges some of the preconceived notions or biases that exist in the field.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. Global health is an incredibly important topic, especially post-COVID. The course is really well-organized a provides a good foundational understanding of a variety of topics in global health. It opened my eyes to the global disparities in health. Although I'm not going into medicine, the course taught me how interdiscplinary global health is, and what efforts are still needed to address global health challenges.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! A great course even if you are not going into public health. I learned so much about the systems and people that make up the global health field, as well as developed a critical eye for the areas that need improvement. It is a relevant course for everyone because it impacts us all!",
                "i would as far as content but be prepared to receive harsh grading",
                "Yes, it's a manageable course where you can still learn a lot. It's a good elective to take",
                "no",
                "Definitely! If you are remotely interested in health, this is a great and not too challenging foundational course. While the material may seem simple, it is thought provoking and will change how you view the health of yourself and those around you.",
                "No, I would not because the course felt extremely disorganized.",
                "Yes!! This course is amazing and it changes how you view global health. great intro course!",
                "Yes, for those who want to know if global health interests them or to just have that knowledge in general",
                "Yes I would for some students it is required too.",
                "No. Unless this course is restructured in terms of assignments, and mode of assessment, and unless some regulation is put in place for discussion sections, this class is not worth taking. It teaches you very basic principles that will not stimulate thought and that you will learn in any higher-level global health course.",
                "I would recommend this course because I learned so much about global issues surrounding health that I had not previously thought about. I gained so much insight into global health as a field and what I could do to improve the global issues.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is passionate about health and wants to take a course introducing them to the field of global health. This class taught me a lot about the fundamentals of global health work, and I think it provides critical background and raises interesting questions that I will carry with me going forward.",
                "Yes, if this course is required or you want to expand your knowledge on global health.",
