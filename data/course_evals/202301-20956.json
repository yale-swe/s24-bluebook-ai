Even though I was competent at solving the various problems in each unit, I have a very weak grasp of most of the concepts, especially the content that was rushed through near the end of the course (intro to organic chemistry and transition metals).

                "The course can be better taught by the professor and the midterms should be in person. The lectures should cover all relevant matter that will be tested, instead of doing practice problems for 30 out of the 50 minutes of class while barely skimming through the important content points and leaving the rest in the textbook.",
                "The strengths of this course include the level of  individual competency it teaches and the weaknesses of the course are cheating that happens during tests. It could be improved if there were more office hours.",
                "this course was not taught in an effective way, the lectures were very difficult to engage with and often felt unstructured and unclear on what we needed to note down. \r\nOne good thing was the continuous assessment through p-sets and pre-lecture questions, which allowed us to keep up to date with our knowledge.",
                "This course had reading questions that acted as checkpoints and motivation to keep up with the lecture content. The lecture slides for this course did not contain all of the information that you needed, and lecture felt unstructured at times. Therefore, it is crucial to attend section, office hours, and read the book to get a good grasp of the content.",
                "The exam format is strange and somewhat unfair. A one-hour online exam with fewer than ten questions (some of which are all-or-nothing multiple choice questions) means that one small mistake can tank a student's grade. I would have preferred a regular (in-person, multi-hour, partial-credit-possible) exam structure like in CHEM 161.",
                "The structure is easy to follow and there are many resources available. But I found the professor's teaching strategy very hard to follow. It was not always clear what we were supposed to know and I could not understand a lot of what he was saying. I found it hard to pay attention in class because the content was not engaging.",
                "Weaknesses: This course had many weaknesses, the most significant of which was the way exams were run. Exams were all held over canvas quizzes, and only 1 or 2 questions out of 10 would require that you show any work; the other 8-9 questions would either be multiple choice, or there would be a place to type in your final answer. This meant that it was not possible to receive partial credit for most problems, and that it was very easy to lose 10% of your exam grade on a single problem even if your only mistake was that you'd typed something into your calculator incorrectly. This also made it very easy for students to cheat, since they could easily share answers during the online exam without having to understand the work that went into getting that answer. Personally, I believe that when exams grade the process to reach a final answer as well as the answer itself, a more accurate assessment of a student's learning is obtained. \r\n\r\nStrengths: This course follows the textbook almost exactly, so even when I didn't understand a concept that the professor had tried to convey, I could read the textbook's explanation.",
                "Lectures were not organized and slides did not cover talked about material.",
                "The Psets were well designed to help learn the material, and I found that much of my learning came from doing the problem sets. On the contrary, I did not enjoy the exams. I do best when I have an exam environment, and since the exams were online I was left with my room, which was not a suitable environment for me. I wish that they could have opened a classroom with a TF as an option for students to take the exam in an exam room, as I would have benefitted from that. In addition, I found that the structure of the online exam, especially with the emphasis on fill in the blank answers where work is not considered was not conducive to assessing my understanding. Minor mistakes in work were considered to lead to absolute wrong, and partial credit was rarely awarded. The online tests were short and open text, so this did not impact my grade heavily, but I would rather my grade reflect my learning than be good. I urge that future years have a more traditional exam format, in person if possible.",
                "Strengths: Achieve problem sets. The unlimited attempts feature on the problem sets greatly facilitates learning without the stress of a grade. Dr. Parr's slideshows are helpful and informative.\r\nWeaknesses: There was rampant cheating on the exams because they were Zoom-\"proctored.\" Many answers could be looked up on the internet, which drastically undermined student confidence in the integrity of the class and distorted the curve. The grading of Canvas midterms minimizes opportunities for partial credit. For example, a question requiring significant calculations might only be worth one point as a numerical value entry with no opportunity to show work. At the same time, getting a single multiple-choice question incorrect on a midterm would decrease one's score by up to 12%, sometimes bringing that score down to the class average just by missing one multiple-choice question. The biggest thing that would enhance learning in this course would be handwritten, in-person exams.\r\nAlso, Dr. Parr's lectures often include extensive rambling that doesn't facilitate efficient learning of the material. While the slideshows are great, many lectures consisted of a projection of live handwriting (of example problems) on a notepad that was hard to follow. During lectures, it was very hard to tell what information was actually the content\/skills we would need to succeed on the exams and what was simply background theory or distantly related material\/fun facts.",
                "Midterms were a bit short and they always will have at least one question that may stump you. The online format was different than what I'm used to, and the \"open-textbook\" (not open-note) policy helped me learn how to effectively use my textbook. I was very appreciative of the live streams of every class, but class was much more engaging and easier to understand when I attended despite the live stream option.",
                "I believe the pre-class questions required by the professor was a strength of this course. Although having to remember to answer questions before going to class every day seemed burdensome, it proved very beneficial in understanding the concepts learned in class. I also appreciated discussion sections: my graduate student teaching assistant really helped clarify many of the topics. I also loved the open-note examinations this course offered; this prevented the need to memorize overly technical info and allowed me to better appreciate the general concepts surrounding many topics. I believe open-note examinations better parallel what professionals do in their daily life. The only info a professional likely memorizes is that which he\/she uses frequently, but he\/she likely uses references to refresh he\/her memory on certain topics. Open-note exams mirror this use of references by professionals and are thus a bit more applicable to career-life.",
                "The strengths of this course are the way material is covered in lecture and the helpful psets. The main way this course could be improved is by giving full-length in-person exams rather than unrepresentative, short online exams.",
                "The strengths of this course include the fact that the professor went step by step through problems throughout the lecture and he was always relating the topics we were learning to real life situations. The weakness of this course is that it did feel a little rushed and sometimes the lectures would feel repetitive, but not comprehensive.",
                "Strengths the TA staff. Weaknesses Parr",
                "Seems it has to cover a lot of content but this becomes overwhelming because it is very fast paced if you've never learned chemistry before. Meant to be an introductory course but I would say is very challenging for those who have not taken AP Chemistry before",

                "The way the exams and grading in the class is structured is very stupid. Definitely one of the most unfair ways to have exams. The online exams were \"Zoom Proctored\" and they just expected people to not cheat, but the average on the first exam of Chem 165 was around a 92 and the average on the first  exam of Chem 161 was a 68.

Additionally, because the class is on a \"class curve,\" where only a certain amount of A's, A-'s, B+'s, etc. are given out, it is unfair that the tests are online, which greatly increases the average score. It is unfair to those who actually work in the class, because they are stressed about their grades even though they likely know much more than people that are getting the same exam scores from looking up answers and such. Not a single person got a 100% on any of the 161 exams with Dr. Hazari, and yet there were 70+ total 100%'s on the 3 exams in this class, which is crazy to me. In person tests would be significantly better, especially for a Final Exam.",
                "The one strength of this course was there were three midterms, which meant that there was very little material left to learn for the final given that it had all essentially already been assessed. This made studying for the final a little bit more feasible. There were many weaknesses of this course, one of them being that the midterms were online. The exams were \"open book\" but NOT \"open note.\" This meant that you could have a textbook (online or paper) open during exams, but not your notes. However, it was acceptable to have annotations to your textbook available. The exams were proctored over Zoom which in my opinion is basically the same thing as no proctoring. It isn't realistic that a TA is going to be able to catch cheating over Zoom. It would've been very easy for students to collaborate during exams by either being in the same room and discussing, or messaging over text. Also, anyone could have used internet resources. It is unfair that people like me who were honest and followed the expectations of academic integrity are then put at a disadvantage given that this is a curved class. When people cheat, then do well, this affects the curve and therefore the success of other students. \r\nAlso, I did not appreciate the format of the exams themselves. There was barely any opportunity for partial credit. For the majority of the questions, you either received 6 (or even 12 points), or nothing at all. This was due to the online format because for most of the questions, you simply typed a number into a textbook, not showing any of your work. It was not an uncommon experience to use the right method\/process to work out a problem, and then accidentally mistype a number into the calculator, obviously leading to an incorrect answer. There were maybe 2 questions per exam where you could actually upload your work to earn partial credit. Given that these exams were pretty short, getting the non-partial credit questions wrong significantly decreased one's score.",
                "Lectures should go over more textbook material and actual notes, and maybe demonstrations did in class could be supplementary videos.",
                "Strengths: distributing a lot of general chemistry content in a short amount of time. Weaknesses: really not any weaknesses come to mind. Though, it would be helpful if there were study sessions or enrichment sessions offered.",
                "The fashion in which material was presented was often convoluted and hard to follow, which made learning the course material an often completely independent activity",
                "I enjoyed the fact that this class was available online so I could rewatch lectures and that the outlines for each chapter corresponding to the textbook and our schedule were available. I did not enjoy the style of teaching and thought that many times we focused on irrelevant things (aka deriving equations and doing one an example of a reaction instead of giving us the general method of understanding all of the type)",
                "A strength of the class are that lectures can be in-person or virtual. A weakness is the lack of opportunities for partial credit on examinations.",
                "Weaknesses: I personally encountered a lot of technical issues when it came to our online tests and even the final exam; I had to send some submissions via email after the portal was locked even though I answered them well within the time range. It also was not fair that most people did collaborative work and harshened the curve for the rest of us.\r\nWould much rather prefer an in-person test to evaluate our true understanding without external stresses with technology\r\n\r\nStrengths :appreciated how all classes were recorded so it was very easy to hop back on track; we also had 3 post-class quizzes per week, which were very helpful as we remained interactive with the course. the Achieve questions had unlimited tries as well, which was very excellent in honing our perseverance as I ideally would have skipped those questions. Overall the class was very great up until the online assessments",
                "This class is all weaknesses. Professor Parr is not very considerate of students, replies to questions with backhanded answers, and runs the class as if he does not want to teach. The exams are terrible. They are online so they are subject to so much cheating and they are only a few questions (7-8) with very high point values.",
                "Weakness - The online exams. There is no reason to still be forcing students to take online exams when COVID-19 is no longer declared a public health emergency. Moreover, the format of the exams encouraged cheating and academic dishonesty, which was evident in the grade distributions of midterms. Moreover, unlike in CHEM 161 (under Nilay's instruction), the TA's were not required to come to class, which caused a big discrepancy between what the TA's thought we needed to know for the midterms and what was actually tested. Also, there was not even a review session for the final exam, which caused a lot of stress since the final exam was cumulative and tested 10+ chapters of content. Plus, the reading questions due before class were unnecessary, as they soon became a way for people to quickly complete them rather than trying to learn from the reading questions. Additionally, the discussion section worksheets were not even available to the students as a blank copy, so they can practice on their own.\r\n\r\nStrengths - TA (if you have a good one) and peers (form study groups).",
                "The course is well paced. As a weakness, it is not super well structured, and it is hard to follow if you are not attending every lecture. I found the exam distribution methods incredibly inconvenient and stressful. With that being said, the course is clearly designed for students to perform well.m",
                "The strength of this course was the fact that the pre-class questions and problem sets were ungraded. This gave students an opportunity to test their knowledge without being penalized. Also, the pre-class questions were a great way to stay on top of the content as it was being taught. The weaknesses of this course were Prof. Parr's teaching style and the virtual shortened exams. Prof. Parr's lectures tended to be dry and always ran 10-20 minutes late. Lectures should start and end promptly. Additionally, the online open-book format of the midterm and final exams was designed poorly as most of the questions were multiple-choice and thus, did not give an option for partial credit. Also, the value of each question varied greatly; for example, a lengthy calculation question was worth 1 point while another conceptual question was worth 6 points. This meant that getting very few questions wrong resulted in a terrible score. Exams should follow the format of CHEM161 and be in-person on-paper 1-2 hour exams with given formula sheets to give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed and allow for partial credit.",
                "Strengths: accessibility of lecture material and structure of the homework (graded by completion)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: canvas structure of midterms and final exam, as the point distribution allowed for more room for error than for partial credit for work done.",
                "lectures could be better organized",
                "Strengths: Classes were offered virtually in live-time. So if you didn't want to go to in person class, you could listen into the class in real time virtually. The midterms were accurate representations of what we were learning in class, I believe. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Parr's teaching style did not work well with my learning style. Most of the examples he gave in class were very disorganized and did not apply to the problem sets. He is also very sarcastic and does not seem like an approachable professor by any means. I felt very uncomfortable asking him for help with anything. The final exam was also a very inaccurate representation of what we had been learning throughout the year.",
                "This course could be improved by more comprehensive communication of what is expected of the students.",
                "Better attitude when students come to office hours. More dynamic teaching style rather than illegible handwriting. No online exams.",
                "Overall I thought that this course was taught quite poorly. Unfortunately, I felt that the online Achieve psets and the textbook did a much better job at teaching\/explaining concepts than the actual professor was. One weakness was that the lectures were not straitforward and did not explain new topics well at all. One improvement could be starting from the basics (definitions, explanations, etc) rather than jumping right into confusing practice problems. I also felt that the exams could be improved. Although it was in theory nice that exams were open book, many students felt the tests did not provide a good opportunity to show what we have learned because they were either extremely brief or tested concepts that were not emphasized much in class. Additionally, I feel that the weighting of exam questions was unfair as students were overly penalized for small mistakes even when they could have demonstrated a firm understanding if allowed to include the work\/thought process that helped them reach that answer.",
                "The very high disparity between lectures, psets, and exams. Also, the way the tests were very few, high-point questions with no partial credit made it very easy to lose points for minimal mistakes, which means your grade ultimately did not reflect your knowledge accurately at all",
                "I appreciate that the lectures were recorded so that I could go back and review material as needed.",
                "I think that the earlier units were taught very effectively, but I did not like the teaching of the later units as much. I felt the online exams, although I understand the rationale of relying on the textbook rather than one's notes, was silly. I don't think grades fully reflected one's level of studying (as with 7-8 questions a test, one mistake on a multiple choice question is a significant loss).",
                "The fact that all lectures were recorded but in person required masks encouraged students to not attend lectures in person therefore decreasing in class participation, but allowed for ability to take chem from anywhere at any time which was very helpful.",
                "Strengths: unsure\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Parr is an awful lecturer. I attended every lecture and learned almost 100% of the class on my own during problem sets. Also, the Daily Questions were unhelpful and an unnecessary extra thing to keep track of. They were testing how late I went to bed, not how much I knew from the class.",
                "Strengths: good structure of the course in terms of exam content and lecture content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some topics were taught too deeply in the lecture to the point of confusion.",
                "Strengths: engaging, well thought out, amazing professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: none that I could think of",
                "Strengths - none\r\nWeaknesses - I could have learned more by either self studying or attending only the discussion sections instead of lecture. The lectures were not helpful  because Professor Parr explained things in the weirdest, most roundabout way.",
                "This course is unfortunately one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale and made me sincerely reevaluate whether I want to keep pursuing science here. The lectures were incredibly disorganized and confusing - rather than first going over basic concepts and definitions, Professor Parr would instead spend class writing out a number of examples that he often failed to explain fully and connect to larger ideas. The lectures themselves were also clearly poorly planned out time-wise, and we often were either unable to cover everything in class or had to rush to fit in very important topics in the last five minutes. As a result, I learned almost nothing in lecture and had to teach myself the material using either the textbook or online resources in order to understand what we were expected to know. Because lectures were so unclear, the TFs had to spend section trying to actually teach us the basic ideas of the unit instead of building on the lectures and going over practice problems. (The TFs, who generously devoted so much time and effort to helping us succeed in this class, are the one strength I can think of in this course.)\r\n\r\nMy other major problem with this course was the assessment style. The midterms and the final were all on Canvas and were open book (but not open note). Many questions, despite the fact that they required lots of calculations and multi-step thought processes, did not have any space to show your work and only had you put your final numerical answer into Canvas. Because you couldn't show your work, there was no partial credit, which often resulted in ridiculous grade deductions. And because the exams were relatively short, each question was heavily weighted. (For example, if you did everything right on a question but simply plugged a number wrong into your calculator, you could easily lose 14%). It seems somewhat ridiculous to me that questions which clearly require both conceptual understanding and multiple steps of work don't have opportunities for partial credit, and thus making a small numerical error results in the same score (a zero) as literally not even answering the question. To me, this reflects a larger issue with the assessments - they are not designed in such a way that allow students to demonstrate their understanding of concepts, but instead hinge almost entirely on tiny calculation details. I also do not understand why the assessments were on Canvas - I think it would make much more sense (particularly now that Covid does not restrict this) to have in-person assessments (or at the very least, if they have to be online, to make it open everything) so that all students are on a level playing field.",
                "The lectures should be geared more toward homework and how to solve the problems we will be asked instead of random knowledge.  But the discussion sections were very helpful in this aspect of the course.",
                "This course had many weaknesses that could be improved in many ways. Firstly, the lecturers were not engaging and often many students could not follow Professor Parr's presentation of the material. He often went on tangents and pushed through material without ensuring students had understood the material. Secondly, the weekly problem sets should be counted for accuracy, as opposed to unlimited tries. The online format of the exams was inappropriate, given there was no reason they could not be administered in person. On the exams, students had limited opportunities to show their work \/ thought-process and in-person exams should have been administered.",
                "Horrible exam format. Didnt test knowledge. The lectures only covered a fraction of the content and had to learn most from YouTube and reading the book. Poorly structured and timed class",
                "Strengths- the lectures are recorded and can be viewed later.\r\nWeaknesses - the lecture might not go in depth on all the concepts that are needed for assessments.",
                "strengths: there are many support resources such as discussion sections, peer tutors, and office hours held by the entire teaching team, exams are pretty fair in their assessment of our knowledge and they aren't too long, one exam grade is dropped\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the lectures are not super easy to follow, slides don't have a lot of the information and examples that are critical, daily questions and problem sets can be hard to keep track of",
                "na",
                "The camera was sometimes not focused where it needed to be in the recordings. It was also difficult to ask questions during exams.",
                "Strengths: broad-ranging curriculum with various chemistry topics, evident applications from General Chemistry I class, introduction to organic chemistry unit was helpful for exposure. \r\nAreas for Improvement: at times, it felt as if the course was structured around the assumption that students possessed prior exposure to topics. This made it difficult to understand concepts during certain lectures. I found myself consulting the textbook to understand the majority of content.",
                "One strength was the recorded lectures.",
                "This class is generally taught well until the end when it gets very confusing. Overall, I think the exams are not structured well, as there is so much emphasis on a single question (students lose points really quickly for smaller mistakes).",
                "Everything is good except for the online exam system, which makes it very hard to upload our answers in time, and it will not provide the exam environment that makes students focus.",
                "Lectures sometimes felt a bit disjointed.  Overall, reading the book as a supplement helped.",
                "No online exams. Redesign lectures so they arent rooted in the history of the topics we are supposed to learn. daily questions not helpful.",
                "The course covered a lot of material.",
                "The online exams have got to go. The professor was just completely oblivious to the vast amount of cheating that went on.",
                "very strong in exams",
                "As a large lecture, with less than half of the class attending, it is discouraging to the scheduled class time. As for strengths, the subjects of the class are quite interesting, but there is not nearly enough time to cover everything in depth.",
                "The lectures were not very well organized and the online\/open book exam format made them more stressful and so that I did not have to engage as deeply with the material. The topics were relatively interesting.",
                "I was able to learn a lot. There were no weaknesses.",
                "Strength: the lecture videos were recorded and the homework had an infinite amount of tries without point deductions\r\nWeakness: Since all the assessments were online, for some of the answers if an answer is incorrect, it is just incorrect, and six points are deducted. There are usually only 9 questions on each midterm, so if one question is incorrect, a student only receives an 8\/9. Be careful on the exams and study the math and basic concepts. During the organic chemistry unit, many TFs also did not understand the naming system, so students should learn that on their own. The lectures are always confusing unless you read the textbook ahead of time, so prepare to be confused after every lecture. Some students stopped attending lectures and just read the textbook.",
                "The class felt very disorganized and some of the material on assignments did not feel like they were covered in depth enough during class.",
                "N\/a",
                "The lectures of the course were very well taught. I especially enjoyed how sample problems were walked through from each chapter. I also liked the problem sets being unlimited attempts in order to further encourage growth instead of giving up through searching up the answer.",
                "A strength of the course was that it had a relatively lower workload than a lot of other introductory STEM courses. Additionally, all of the p-sets prioritized letting students try as many times as they needed on each problem until they got the correct answer and understood the process of answering the question. Another strength was how accessible lectures and lecture materials were, given that the lectures were recorded and live-streamed. A weakness of the course was that the class moved at a pretty fast pace and so it felt difficult to master the material when it was taught.",
                "Strengths: Some interesting content and more direct applications to other fields than Gen Chem 1. One midterm drop was helpful, and some TFs office hours were helpful. Having the ability to come to class via Zoom was also an asset. Section questions and Achieve homework were great learning tools and helped prepare for assessments well.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were pretty confusing, with slides that didnt provide much information and really fast equations done on paper in ways that didnt help connect them to the underlying concepts. Tests were much more stressful than they had to be. While shorter grading is understandable, with 7-8 questions on a test and almost no chances to show work, if you made 2 math errors and misremembered one concept out of 4 chapters on a midterm, you could be looking at a sub-60% score when it often did not represent what you actually understood. Information on the curve was also hard to find  grades arent everything, but particularly in a class with many premeds, tests with a standard deviation of 15 points and no clear curve policy make it really hard to tell how well you might do and prioritize time appropriately. Professor Parr often provided relatively condescending answers to earnest student questions, and approached office hours as if you didnt get it in lecture why should I have to explain it now? Overall, the course was frustrating and got in the way of just learning chemistry.",
                "I would recommend making the exams in person to more accurately assess some questions through partial credit. During some exams, the lack of partial credit may have given me 0 points on a question that I should have gotten mostly correct due to the virtual formatting. Maybe even a picture submission can be implemented for each question.",
                "This course was pretty chill. There were plenty of resources provided that allowed anybody do well in the class. I thought the class was almost too chill to the point where I was provided so much flexibility that I couldn't stay disciplined in my learning.",
                "I was not really a fan of the structure of the course. I found that the lectures didn't always translate to what was on the psets and then the exams, and I also found the structure of the exams being shorter and online more challenging and not always indicative of what I felt I had learned.",
                "The professor felt distant and unwelcoming at times, and the lecture style was personally hard to follow. The online test format was both a strength and a weakness, because I felt the tests to be less intense than the paper exams, but it also meant one wrong digit loses you 5 points.",
                "Strengths: \r\nEntertaining\r\nEngaging\r\nInformational\r\nAttentive to students growth\r\nOnline practice and problem sets \r\nMore focused on life-applicable examples then material strictly for tests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nA bit dispersed with recorded lectures offered (allows for less students to be present in the lecture hall)",
                "offer different medium to attend class, had the slides in advance, problem solved in class.",
                "I think to fully grasp the knowledge of the course, you had to do a lot of outside reading and studying. I enjoyed the remote nature of the lectures and the live recordings.",
                "This course was poorly taught. The lectures were extremely hard to follow and the tests were conducted online which made cheating by other students possible. Many times concepts on the test were not covered in class.",
                "I cannot think of any definitive strengths, but one of the weaknesses is that it is hard to be engaged in the class. The lectures are normal, but sometimes when deeper topics are discussed it is hard to determine what is meant to be retained and what is just being taught for the sake of it. Another weakness is that the tests have few questions which often dont have partial points, so making a small error can have a big impact on your grade.",
                "Overall, I think this course provides a good overview of the many different fields of chemistry. Moreover, Dr. Parr was enthusiastic about helping us and willing to stay after class to have our questions answered, which I always appreciated. I also liked how he gave us a lot of resources and practice problems, and how he had a clear outline of what we would cover each day. His lecture slides were also very concise but effective, and the tests provided a good assessment of the topics we should know. However, he sometimes went too in-depth when explaining topics (more so than the textbook and the tests), which sometimes made the concepts more confusing rather than clearer.",
                "I think that the online test format did not allow for enough partial credit on long written problems and made too many technical difficulties possible. To solve a problem on paper and then have to type out all of your written work to answer the online questions wasted too much time on the midterms. I preferred tests in the format of the previous semester of General Chemistry that were written, closed-book, and in-person. I did like how the lectures were recorded and therefore could be rewatched later when studying.",
                "strengths: offered fully virtually, goes along with the textbook\r\nweaknesses: open book tests made it very easy for students to cheat and did not help us learn the material as well. I much prefer the paper exams that were closed note in chem 161 because it was necessary to fully understand the material before the exam and facilitated an increased amount of retention of the material. also, the exams did not fully assess our understanding of the material as not all of the concepts were covered, and they represented too small of a sample of what we had spent time in lecture learning. it was also very difficult to receive partial credit on these online exams because you could not show your work for most questions, so the grades did not accurately reflect how much you actually knew about chemistry. paper exams would better reflect one's understanding of the material because you'd be able to show all of your work and receive better feedback as was the case in chem 161. overall, the class was very disengaging, the lectures were not interesting and not well-organized, and the professor did a poor job of explaining concepts and encouraging students to participate.",
                "Strengths: Course extends beyond topics covered in the AP curriculum to some pretty different and interesting topics (covers organic chemistry and coordination chemistry), TAs were available and helpful, feedback on assignments was clear, and the practice of having required daily questions (graded for completion) before every class definitely encouraged me to keep up with the material and helped me identify challenging topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt a little too dependent on technology overall, and I think my level of engagement with the course would have been higher if it were less asynchronous. All lectures were recorded and posted immediately, and midterms (three total, with the two highest carrying) were all open-book and online. By moving midterms to an in-person format and delaying the posting of recorded lectures, I think I would have been able to both engage with the course and learn the course material on a higher level.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it pushes the student and allows them to grasp a better understanding of more advanced Chemistry topics, some weaknesses are that it does not cater to students who may have a weakness in understanding certain topics and fails to consider students with different learning styles.",
                "Strengths are that it is recorded which is helpful in reviewing content for the final. Weaknesses is that the professor sometimes rambles.",
                "It's a pretty standard Gen Chem class so I'm not really sure what to say in regards to strengths. The TAs were all helpful and hosted numerous office hours, so that was definitely a plus. The weaknesses were pretty abundant, however: lectures were largely not worth attending because the teaching was so convoluted, the exams were open-book online but gave no room for partial credit, the pre-class questions were annoying, etc. I would say that lectures need to be a little more streamlined and taught more clearly. I think in-person exams are better, too.",
                "The strength of this course is the willingness of Professor Parr to allow student to take the education at their own pace. By posting all of the lectures online, I could go back and replay any parts of the lecture I did not understand really allowing me to cement my knowledge.",
                "i think the focus of the lectures were often scattered, where topics were covered without any clarity of what we actually needed to know. the homework assignments were helpful and pretty much the only way I knew what to study for the midterms. the grading overall was very fair, and the online midterms were nice"

                "I would, Dr. Parr is great.",
                "If youre going to take this course, its probably because its a requirement, so yes if you are committed to your major and it requires this course then take it. Definitely not a class youd simply take for fun though. The course is doable.",
                "Yes, I think that the material of this course is important to learn, especially for students pursuing the medical path.",
                "No I think this class was not well taught and we could use more clear instructions to understand the concepts.",
                "Definitely not. Obviously, you are not just taking this course just for fun, so if you have to take it, take a deep breath and get ready to self-teach the class to yourself the whole semester.",
                "Depends on who is teaching CHEM 165. If it is Jonathan Parr, then no, I would not recommend.",
                "Yes, it can be frustrating but it is designed for students to succeed.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were required to take it for their major or postgraduate study. This course is NOT a gut due to the current format of the exams. This course was incredibly stressful and every lecture was a struggle to get through. There were some demonstrations; however, for the most part, Prof. Parr would ramble for some twenty minutes at a time. It was hard to focus and remain engaged in class. Almost no one asked questions during a lecture or participated as they were most likely lost on the topic being explained. Sometimes, it felt that Prof. Parr expected us to intuitively know certain concepts despite us learning them for the first time. If you take this course, make sure you go to Office Hours every week and do lots of practice problems ahead of the exams!",
                "Yes if needed for major requirement or otherwise",
                "if required for their major",
                "Only if you need it for your major. If you can, I would try to place out of Gen Chem and start with Organic Chemistry, as Gen Chem is not very applicable to anything necessary in your STEM career.",
                "no",
                "No I would not recommend. Difficult topic.",
                "Given the disorganization, poor teaching, and strange exam format, I would not recommend this course to another student. However, I understand that it is simply a requirement that many students will have to take regardless.",
                "No unless it is a requirement",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as a good way of developing crucial STEM skills.",
                "Probably not. I liked the content okay, but it is an intro class that you're taking just to get through it. If you have to take it, then take it.",
                "Not unless you have to take it. Its doable if you do, so dont be intimidated, but this will not be a fun intellectually challenging class to add. Especially if Dr. Parr is teaching.",
                "Yes. Well, I mean, if you are a STEM major then you have no choice LOLZ.",
                "Yes! Gives you a good foundation of general chemistry",
                "Absolutely not. This was the worst class I have taken in my entire life. I understand that it is necessary for a lot of majors' requirements, but I would really try to avoid it if you can. I showed up to every single lecture and I came out understanding nothing. I only began to understand things thanks to my wonderful TA and the psets. The lectures were genuinely so unhelpful, and I honestly think my performance would have been better if I did the psets during lecture time instead of paying attention to the lecture.",
                "Absolutely not. There are many issues with both the teaching and assessment style of this course, and if you must take it for a prerequisite, I would not do so until these have been fixed.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it is taught by Professor Parr. His teaching style made it difficult to learn and there was little opportunity to receive help.",
                "Yes, I would. Although this course can be challenging and a lot of work, the knowledge you gain is critical for the sciences and especially pre-med requirements.",
                "I might recommend the course with a different professor.",
                "na",
                "Yes, I learned so much more about chemistry and it applications in the real world.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in chemistry, medicine, or science in general. Although it is a general chemistry course, it presents several applications to medical and biological industries. For example, we learned about different biological macromolecule structures and how they are targeted by commercial drugs. We also discussed how many forms of medical imaging use nuclear chemistry to produce highly-complex images of internal structures.",
                "I would only recommend if they have to take it for their major.",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes.  Gen Chem 2 is a good class for you to further explore your possible interest in the field of chemistry and be exposed to challenging new ideas.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is foundational to later chemistry courses.",
                "Not a chance. I know a lot of people have to take this course, but it was unnecessarily difficult for no reason.",
                "I would recommend this course to another Yale student. It advances the foundational knowledge of the chemical world and ensures that students are successful for more advanced chemistry courses.",
                "Yes, because it is required.",
                "Yes, this course was highly interesting and informative.",
                "I would recommend the course if the student is interested in chemistry and is self sufficient in learning content on their own.",
                "Yes this class is important to understanding the basics of chemistry.",
                "NO",
                "N\/a",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as this course is a nice introduction and preparation for chemistry courses at Yale. It is also a good continuation to CHEM 161 as it builds upon the material learned in the previous class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in chemistry and biology and also enjoyed CHEM 161.",
                "If you have to take this for a requirement, it has some interesting content and will be doable. The organic chemistry in the end is interesting, and equilibrium is a foundational part of biology. In case you are looking for a class to get exposed to chemistry or take a bit of a dive, it would probably be more helpful to take a class thats more accessible and applied to the field youre interested in. This course was pretty poorly formatted, with lectures being hard to follow and a slightly combative professor-student relationship. Tests were hour long, 7-question, open-book Canvas pages that were online with very little work shown, though the lowest-score midterm drop was helpful. Overall, unless youre passionate about chemistry, there is a lot not to like about this class, though some content is interesting and you will learn a good bit if you personally apply yourself well beyond what happens in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student although I would advise that review some of the organic chemistry material early as that is rushed through a little bit near the end",
                "Yes. There are so many resources this course offers that it's somehow possible to use none of them and do well in the class and use all of them and do well in the class. I felt that the amount of information given in Chem 165 is much more easily digestible than Chem 161.",
                "I wouldn't unless necessary. I found it unnecessarily stressful and frustrating and that took away from learning the material.",
                "All bio\/chem students have to take this course, so it would be great if chem 165 could be improved! This course would have been better if we had a more understanding and welcoming instructor.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who look to further their foundational knowledge in chemistry as well as STEM fields. As well as for those looking to take a course with a professor who looks at more than just the textbook to teach the material.",
                "This course is a stepping stone for most stem students either way. Take it if you love chemistry. If not, make sure to attend lectures, go to discussion sections, and read the textbook.",
                "I would recommend this class for a student who is very interested in the subject and is willing to put a lot of independent work into the class.",
                "No. Only take it if absolutely necessary.",
                "If they are in STEM and need an introductory course to chemistry, definitely! I certainly learned about many different topics of chemistry, ranging from electrochemistry to aqueous solutions. While I do not think all the material will be helpful for those taking the MCAT, it is very useful if you need to fulfill more chemistry requirements in the future.",
                "I might recommend it because it fulfills a requirement for some science majors, but if you are intending to be serious about chemistry or prefer a more in-depth education I would recommend Advanced General Chemistry more than this.",
                "no, i would not recommend this class unless you absolutely have to take it because the instructor is not supportive of student learning, the exams do not reflect the course material, and it is overall not engaging or intellectually stimulating",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if it is required for either pre-med requirements or for their specific major. This course is a rather challenging and intense introductory lecture, and it is not a great choice for students simply looking to complete a science requirement who may not be completely interested or engaged with the material to begin with.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is serious about entering a career in the medical field or in Chemistry, but otherwise I would not recommend this course if a student is not considering a career in STEM.",
                "Yes, it is interesting.",
                "No unless it was required.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The recorded lectures allows you to take the course at your own pace and the discussion section teachers all help greatly in processing the information. Professor Parr is very generous with his grading and is easily approachable if you have any problems.",
                "if you need to take general chemistry, I wouldn't worry too much about the class. it feels a lot different than Chem 161, mainly because of the different teaching styles between the two classes. that was difficult because I came into the class with an expectation that it would resemble the first semester of general chemistry, and when it didn't, it took me a while to adapt. However, if you consistently study and keep up with lectures, I think it is very possible to succeed in this class"
