The schedule has a very consistent structure which is helpful when planning your week.

This forced me to learn a lot of the topics on my own.",

The p-sets were manageable, but for my schedule, the Wednesday deadlines were a bit difficult. I also would prefer if the review sessions all followed the format of the first one, which was basically a summary of what we needed to know.",

I found that I wouldn't understand how things connect and what we need to know until the review sessions before exams, weeks after learning the actual material .",
