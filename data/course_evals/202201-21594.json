The schedule has a very consistent structure which is helpful when planning your week. However, my section fell behind halfway through the semester and we often had to complete preclass assignments based on what we were supposed to have learned during the previous class, except my section had not yet covered. This forced me to learn a lot of the topics on my own.",

I think it would be very hard to learn new material in this course unless you get the Course Admin as your professor. If you haven't taken calc 2 before, do not take this class with a grad student.",
                "Yes, if you need to take it. As far as math classes go, it is very well structured and there is a lot of support from peer tutors and review sessions to help study. The p-sets were manageable, but for my schedule, the Wednesday deadlines were a bit difficult. I also would prefer if the review sessions all followed the format of the first one, which was basically a summary of what we needed to know.",
                "Not unless it is required. Many of the instructors are hard to follow, and we're so flooded with information that it's hard to organize. I found that I wouldn't understand how things connect and what we need to know until the review sessions before exams, weeks after learning the actual material .",
