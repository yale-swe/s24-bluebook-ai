You end up thinking about movement in a completely different way and you subconsciously become so much more aware of how your body moves! Through our readings and movement practices, I learned new things about my movement and I explored ways to make my body move more efficiently. We also had several guest speakers throughout the semester, including a functional anatomy professor at Juilliard (who is an expert in her field) and a ballet costume designer."

There was never a day I didn't look forward to this class. The only weakness is that Professor Robinson doesn't release grades, so you really have no idea how you're doing in the class. She says we're all doing fine, but that's about it."

                "100% YES take this class!! I know this class is often thought of as a dance first year seminar, but that is absolutely not a prerequisite. We had some students with years of dance experience and one who had never danced, and by the end of the semester we were essentially all in the same place in terms of anatomy. You will learn so much about all forms of movement to apply to everyday life, and Professor Robinson is a gem. This class is also just really fun and very low stress, which makes it a great first year seminar. I just finished my first semester at Yale and I can already tell this will be a class I will remember for years as one of my favorites at Yale."
