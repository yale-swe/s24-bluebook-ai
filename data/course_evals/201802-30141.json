   "comments": [
    "I gained a much broader understanding of the Gothic medieval age.  Coming into the class, I had almost no knowledge about architecture, and the class was a very good introduction to that subject.  It was also interesting and helpful to be able to apply this knowledge to the real world in front of us.",
    "Understanding Medevial architecture",
    "I learned how to analyze medieval texts, architecture, sculpture, and stained glass artwork.",
    "We had the unique experience of having a replacement professor with a background in architecture. I definitely learned more about the architecture and space of each cathedral we visited in addition to the history surrounding the construction. Professor Hutterer was highly competent in her field.",
    "Learned the context of Middle Age History surrounding various Cathedrals in France. Also learned basic architectural terminology.",
    "I left with a good knowledge about the history and architecture of many French Gothic cathedrals and churches. Now, I have an understanding about the general structure, vaulting and arch choices, and window tracery and stained glass of churches in the Gothic and Romanesque styles. Through the readings discussed in class, we examined the rebirth of literature and academic thought in medieval Europe in the form of letters, tales and miracles, French fables, and chronicles. This material is important to medieval French history, but I would have liked if some more readings could have been focused on the Gothic architecture that we were studying."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength of the course was its broad scope of learning.  It was also engaging and the majority of the material was interesting and clearly relevant to the point of the course.  The course also helps foster a closer connection between the professor and students.",
    "Strengths, classwas interesting and well taught and overall a great experience \r\nWeaknesses: ambiguity in grading and a lack of transparency on what we were missing on worksheets",
    "Maile's analysis of architecture and medieval history was fascinating. She did a wonderful job of connecting the texts required for the course with their historical context. She also did a wonderful job of explaining the Christian ideology and history in the sculpture and stained glass artwork in cathedrals during excursions. \r\n\r\nThere was a lot of confusion about Maile's grading policy. The questions on the worksheet seemed to be designed to provide a general understanding of the text (we only had 1-3 sentences to answer them and Maile indicated at the beginning of the course that the purpose of the worksheets was to merely confirm that we read), but they were graded harshly. Students started to panic because it wasn't clear how %s translated to letter grades\/indications of academic performance since %s given for the worksheets were very low (ex: some worksheets resulting in a 79 average). The course could have done with some clarification about grading policy and expectations for the worksheet.",
    "The final paper at the end of the course id very rushed with the last week of class, excursions, and travels either home or to other destinations. I think it would be beneficial to push the final due date back to aid students who are leaving immediately after the course is finished, not to mention dealing with jet lag, etc..",
    "The program is strong in its day-excursions to seven different Gothic cathedrals and churches around France and in its interesting readings. The class was a comfortable mix of lecture and seminar-discussion and allowed us some time to spend in Paris with classmates.\r\n\r\nAlthough The Age of Cathedrals covered many topics, including Gothic Architecture, Medieval French Literature, and History, it was mostly graded as a literature course. The only big weakness in this course was Prof. Hutterers unclear grading policy. Halfway into our 2018 summer term, she replaced the participation grade which used to be a substantial part of the course under Prof. Bloch and instead increased the importance of weekly worksheets and the final paper. This course and its syllabus was designed by Prof. Bloch specifically to emphasis student learning while abroad, and participation was therefore a major part of this class. Because Prof. Hutterer thinks the participation grade is subjective, she arbitrarily removed the participation grade. Furthermore, the class is a seminar, and we go on one or two class excursions a week. Clearly, participation is an important factor; I have never seen a seminar without a participation grade. Weekly assignments, 6 questions to be answered in 3 sentences, have completely taken the place of the participation grade, and taken together, these worksheets represent the majority of the grade in a class that is more focused on student engagement than short-response writing. These two categories - worksheets and participation - are not replaceable as they demonstrate different skills and points of improvement. This is especially important to me because I am very interested in the subject and participating, yet this does not help my grade at all. This significant change to the grading policy should have been made clear on the first day of class, not halfway into it, leaving my classmates and I confused as to what was expected."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I thought the course would be very interesting regardless of what course of study the student was taking.  The course is not only relevant to studying abroad in Paris, but is also engaging in itself.  The course does not have too much work, but still requires effort and attention.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if the grading policy is clarified.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was most engaging to be able to see the sites we were studying instead of just photographs. The reading is enjoyable for the most part and straightforward. It would be a disservice to say that you should arrive expecting this course to be easy and just a fun time because it takes place in Paris. That being said, the workload is not overwhelming and our group of classmates was very enjoyable.",
    "Other students should be wary of this answer because in my particular 2018 course, Prof. Bloch was not able to be our professor for personal reasons, and Prof. Maile Hutterer was invited to be his substitute. When Bloch needed to cancel his participation in the course, it was too late to withdraw without losing money. In selecting this course, I read his excellent reviews: sophisticated readings and travel and high student satisfaction in both their experiences and their grades. The material and the excursions were interesting and valuable. As an intellectual gain, the design of this course by Prof. Bloch was incredible: spending a month in Paris, reading old literature, and learning about the development of Gothic architecture. But with a different professor, we naturally had different experiences. From a teaching perspective, Prof. Hutterer did a good job in highlighting the themes of our readings, providing background information, and lecturing on the development of Gothic Architecture. But despite my classs participation and dedication to the course, the scoring of this class made the course a stressful experience."
