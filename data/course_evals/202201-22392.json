My speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish improved a lot this semester, and this was a much more engaging class than high school Spanish. I learned a lot about Spanish and Latin American cultures, as well as about the phrases that are commonly used and proper grammar.",

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, but the organization of the course could certainly be improved.",
                "Its fun but it could be improved with better organization.",
                "Having the course four days per week is a strength as I felt my understanding and knowledge of the language improved from very frequent practice. Seminar-style is also a strength of the course. The course might be improved from clearer organization on Canvas of assignments, files, videos, readings, and tasks for the week.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. The content was very engaging, and I think I learned a lot. I would prefer to have an in-person class instead of asynchoronous Wednesday. The only weakness is that the pace is sometimes very quick and a lot of content is covered, but that is also a strength of this course.",
                "Better ability to see/understand how you are doing through the semester. Less overly complicated spanish stories",
                "This course incorporated a lot of fascinating readings and films into the syllabus, which made the class discussions very enjoyable. Also, the workload for this course was very manageable. However, it was often unclear what work was due, when it was due, and the exact instructions. This course needed a syllabus that was better organized and a standardized system of turning in and receiving back work. Additionally, I wish assignments had been posted earlier. We have Supersite practice daily at the beginning of the semester, and it wouldn't be posted until the afternoon and was due at 9 the following day. This made it easy to forget about, and I often checked early in the day, saw nothing, but then had to go back and do the assignments late at night."

                "Yes. Spanish L3 is extremely challenging in workload, frequency, and the quality of work demanded by the course. However, its high demand in time and energy yields results, and my Spanish skillsin comprehension, reading, writing, speaking, and analysishave markedly improved.",
                "Yes! This was such a fun class and I loved taking it! I definitely recommend professor Diaz! He is such an incredible and engaging lecturer! This class can feel like a lot of work at times, but you truly learn so much valuable content and it is fun!",
                "yes but often required",
                "This course was a good class to get through language requirements with. It wasn't particularly fascinating, but it improved my Spanish skills without too much additional stress."
