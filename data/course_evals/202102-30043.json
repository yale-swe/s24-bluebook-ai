In this summer school, I was more clear about my major direction and deepened my love for chemistry."

                "In the course of this course, the teacher showed me a lot of experiments, so that we could understand these knowledge more clearly. Putting knowledge into practice can not only deepen the impression but also make the class more interesting. In addition, when the teacher tells about Lewis Structure and some calculation problems, he will write the steps on the whiteboard, so that we can completely follow the teacher's thinking and deepen the impression. And in the process of continuous practice in the following completely master the steps and methods of these questions. In addition, when we have questions to ask the teacher, the teacher will give very clear feedback, and set aside time at the end of each class for you to answer questions, so that the class problems can be solved in time."

With the teacher's clear narration, this course deepened my understanding and love for chemistry. In addition, I feel very fulfilled in each course and can learn a lot of useful knowledge, which will bring good guidance for our future major choice."
