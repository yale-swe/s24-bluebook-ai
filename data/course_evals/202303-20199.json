                "I learned how to critically analyze the different systems that affect education policy and practices in the U.S. today. It was really interesting to piece together different themes, week after week, that affect student life in many of our nation's public schools. The particular focus on NYC was so helpful, because it allowed us to build knowledge in one place and look at real life examples.",
                "I learned about major policy debates in NYC public schools over the last few decades and how they provide insight into larger education policy issues in the United States.",
                "this is an amazing class!!! I learned so much about different issues in education right now!! as someone who hasn't taken an ed studies class this was a perfect introduction to educational issues",
                "Insights into the challenges and various potential solutions that face public education systems today, which are very applicable to schools across  the U.S. Gained great survey of knowledge about how each of these insights/challenges/solutions were manifested in the NYC system in particular.",
                "Various topics in American public school policy, as well as how we can reform public schools. We discussed big ideas in education reform like equity, financing, segregation, vouchers, charters, etc.",
                "This class gave me a thorough overview of pressing issues in American education policy, through the lens of New York City, as a case study. I learned a lot about recent developments related to school system governance, mayoral control, race and segregation, school size, school finance equity, charter schools versus district schools, school equity, and turnaround school models, as well as developing an understanding of various sides of these issues to be able to debate them. Further, I learned how to write a policy brief. The overall takeaway of the course is profound: public education/schools (and other systems) replicate the societies that create them, for better or for worse.",
                "I learned a lot about public school policy reform!",

                "Its a great overview of public education policy and of the educational landscape. Using NYC as a case study is particularly interesting. I left this course feeling very informed about American public educatoon."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is the professor: Nate Dudley. This was his first time teaching a college seminar, and I think it was really, really well done. He is a lifelong education professional as a teacher, administrator, principal and morethat expertise was crucial in teaching us many perspectives in the education system and framing the class through the lens of real-world impact. The class was also extremely well structured, and our lesson plans were defined each week and at the start of each class. This made it super easy to talk about a breadth of material while also knowing exactly what was coming next. Classes flew by and always felt too short!",
                "Strengths: The NYC case study format is really interesting and makes for a more 'applied' course than other education studies classes at Yale, which is nice. I definitely felt like I came away with a lot of practical knowledge about schools. We had a lot of interesting guest speakers. Nate is a kind professor and has an on-the-ground perspective as an educator that is valuable and unique to Yale Education Studies. I appreciate that he prioritizes building a class community.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were not super well curated. They were mostly just factual news articles, so I didnt always feel like I was getting exposed to a range of perspectives or analysis on the issues we were discussing. Assignments were not well-planned around breaks. It felt like we were implicitly expected to do work over break given that we sometimes had reading responses due a day after we returned. The professor sometimes struggled with the flexibility that is required for a successful seminar. It felt like he came into each class with a very strict vision of what the class should be. He would interrupt class discussions (even if students were really engaged) to keep us on track with his schedule and vision for what we should take away from that day. Sometimes I wanted to go with the flow more!",
                "this is a great course!!!!! Nate is a really kind instructor who cares so much about his students and is really knowledgeable. the field trip was amazing!!!! I also really loved the assignment format of the class and felt like it was really conducive to learning",
                "The amount of weekly reading was sometimes slightly overwhelming. \r\n\r\nProfessor Nate was very engaging and very passionate. I felt lucky to have taken a class from him and to learn from his uniquely in-depth perspective into this topic. I also believed that the guest speakers were a highlight of the course.",
                "Strengths: Nate!!! He is so passionate about public schools and put so much energy into this course. Each week had fantastic readings that felt so relevant. We also had a trip to the Bronx, where we were able to visit three public schools (one was the school that Nate started on Governor's Island!), which was a really cool opportunity to put the concepts and ideas we were learning about to real life experiences. Talking with students, principals, and teachers at each of the schools was an incredible experience for our class. I think each class as the semester went by got better and better as we got into a rhythm of how to best run discussions. Nate's personal enthusiasm for the class really made the class engaging to attend each week. Although we covered very broad topics each week, I thought the readings and our class did a great job at focusing the topic and being able to learn a lot each week.",
                "STRENGTHS: The class was incredibly well-organized. Nate does a great job of leading each class meeting with a time-stamped agenda, which gives structure to the seminar discussion. Further, by having every student co-lesson-plan a week, we experience what educators do rather than speaking about them from a distance. Class was also always rich with conversation because people meditated on what we were reading through asynchronous discussions and more developed reading responses.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: There aren't many, but I wonder if it would be more valuable to have fewer assignments but each is more substantial; for instance, a midterm policy brief/longer research writing project on one issue. I felt at times between class structure and writing assignment structure that we were only scratching the surface.",
                "Strengths: Loved learning about public education from a national and NYC perspective.",
                "Strengths: the professor very caring and passionate about the subject and his students; extremely well-organized seminar; great, interesting readings and class lessons; great feedback on assignments. no weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: highlighted important topics in public education; balanced current events with history well; class facilitation was a good way to get students to engage with the topics more closely\r\nWeaknesses: readings for a given week sometimes felt too repetitive; did not do enough work leading up to the final paper to prepare for its format",
                "Overall, great class and Nate is a thoughtful and engaging professor. 2 hour seminars can be draining but Nate kept each class active and stimulating.",
                "Strengths: Nate! He is such a caring professor and shows his care to everyone in the class. He is interested in learning about our backgrounds and where we went to high schools and our experiences. He has so much in-depth knowledge about the public school education system, given his background as a high school principal for many years and working for the NYC DOE. \r\n\r\nHe communicates expectations very well and in advance, so we always know what is ahead and what is expected of us. Every class is very organized: he shows an agenda at the beginning of each class and tries to follow that (although sometimes I wish we didn't follow the agenda as closely because sometimes interesting discussions get cut-off because we needed to move on).\r\n\r\nAnother strength is that this is a great intro level class to education studies. We cover so many different aspects and have a comprehensive understanding of the system. Probably not a good course if you're looking to dive deep into a niche topic. \r\n\r\nI love the field trip to NYC! We visited three high schools and talked to the students and principals/ teachers. It was such a great experience and a highlight of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wish we have a little lecturette before we dive into the discussions. I enjoyed the readings but sometimes I felt like doing the readings was my only way of gaining knowledge from the course. I appreciate learning about other students' perspectives but I would like more expert explanation on each topic. The discussions not always have a clear resolution or conclusion, so I got to learn about different people's opinion and different sides of the issue but no real takeaway. Nate asks each of us to pair up and facilitate a class discussion. I like how this design allows for more student participation, but I also think as someone who is not very knowledgeable on the same topic, I would learn more or feel more comfortable if the professor could do more of the facilitation and draw more conclusions and next steps.",
                "It was a really good deep dive into the New York school systems, and had a nice balance of different assignments throughout the semester. The professor was somewhat of a hard grader but it was a nice class overall",
                "Strengths - Professor Dudley clearly has a background in teaching and it shows based on how he runs the class. Emphasis on collaboration, inclusivity, and participation."

He's incredibly interesting and knows so much about educationnot just from an Ed Studies perspective, but from lived experience in the NYC school system. This class was a really broad introduction to so, so many issues facing public education today, and the ability to analyze and consider different perspectives is crucial across subjects. Wish I could take it again, because I know the discussions would be different and interesting each time!",

                "Yes!! I think this topic is very relevant to every participating citizen regardless if they went to public or private schools.",
                "YES!! Public school policy is something that is relevant to everybody--education is one of the most important pillars of our society, and the current public school system is not serving students as well as it can. This class was incredibly eye-opening and brought important topics to my attention that I had not considered before. Because of this class, I am now considering entering education policy as a career path. This class gave me such a wide perspective on education issues and the class was a great environment to do that in. Discussions were never intimidating; our class felt very welcoming and inviting. Please please take this class if you have the opportunity to!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Regardless of major, this class forced me to reckon with the way my academic background is informed by larger systems, and how that's shaped me and, by surveying all these issues given me the knowledge and tools to begin to address these really complex problems.",
                "Yes - the class meets you where you are at. The more diverse perspectives are included, the better the class becomes. Small and big schools, public/private/charter/home-school/harbor school, well-funded and underfunded. Born and raised in NYC or from rural Minnesota. Interests in politics, data, law, teaching, AI, and more.",
                "absolutely!",

                "YES! 100% Everyone should take this class.",
                "If you're new to education studies and would like to have an intro-level course, yes! Nate is such a caring professor and his classes are always fun. I would not recommend if you're looking to deep dive into one sub-topic though.",
                "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in the topic.",
                "100%. If you are pursuing a career in education or if you just want to know more about education.",
                "Yes - Nate is an incredible teacher, and you will leave having a vast knowledge of the public school system."
