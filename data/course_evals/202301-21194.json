                "Strengths: At your own pace. A very enjoyable course and one where you actually learn something useful. The professor was a huge plus to the course. He is funny and very easy to talk to. He made learning fun. He also really knows his stuff. This is a really great course, and you would be lucky to take it. A highlight of my Yale experience for sure!Weakness- None. Fair and fun course.",
                "No weaknesses at all!",
                "A major strength is that the class is incredibly fair. You know from day one what to expect, what will be asked of you, and what you need to learn for the semester and there is never an unexpected thing you'll miss or not know about and should never be caught off guard by the assessments as long as you prepare.",
                "This class was amazing. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "Strengths - great teaching, lab setup, such a cool topic, you get a plastic skeleton for the semester\r\nWeaknesses - none!",
                "strengths: self-directed, super interesting, chill",
                "Strengths: Prof. Sargis is a great instructor, Adrian (the TF) was SO sweet and helpful, and Gary the lab tech was also very kind and helpful. The collection of specimens is also extremely impressive and it was unique to learn using it. Its generally a really well-designed and organized course that maximises your learning while minimising the bureaucracies that many other courses have. Having the teeth/axial skeleton test first also really helped with the adjustment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the tests were actually really difficult and if you dont have a good memory/do not know how to learn by rote it can be rather difficult. It also favours people already the biological sciences which makes it more difficult for students from other backgrounds to meet the same standard.",
                "There a no weaknesses. Legitimately one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. The strength is definitely the fact that we can handle real specimens and learn all there is to know from them. Even more of a strength is the professor, who was always ready to answer our questions in insightful and funny ways. He provided such a welcoming atmosphere that sometimes I forgot I was in class and instead was just having fun with bones.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes!!! Take this class. You will learn so much and it is incredibly fun. The class is small and lab-based, so you spend every day walking about and touching real human bones. We even got to see a cadaver to learn about muscles. It is a very relaxed class environment and Professor Sargis is great and very understanding.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Sargis is amazing.",
                "yes definitely",
                "Yes! Take this class if you can get in! One of the coolest classes I've taken at Yale - very well taught and such an interesting topic",
                "Yes, such a great class for those interested in anatomy and learning to identify bones! It's a flipped-classroom, so Dr. Sargis lectures for ~1 class in the beginning of each unit and the rest of the classes are just identifying bones. I would definitely recommend taking this if you get in!",
                "Yes! Its very popular for good reason. If youre not pre-med beware, the learning curve is steep. Also watch out for the upper and lower limb quizzes those are also hard despite the skull quiz being over hyped.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. Top 3 courses Ive taken at Yale. Give yourself a fun and genuinely interesting semester by taking this class. No outside work besides studying for the exams/quizzes. If you can take this class with someone you know, the class becomes even funner as you learn with them but even if you dont, you can make great friends here.",
