    "The course material was engaging and  the course itself was well-organised and well-paced. Although exercises were time-consuming and felt overwhelming at times, they were useful for ensuring retention of the material and were often enjoyable. I'm amazed at how much material we were able to cover over the course of the semester.",
    "This was a really fantastic course. The problem sets were engaging and I learned a lot. It was hard to tell how I was doing though because grading was somewhat fluid and not very transparent, though I liked it a lot anyway.",
    "Very interesting and thorough. Good lectures. The workload and reading is very demanding"

    "Yes. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It can get a bit technical, but Prof. van Bladel is amazing and mind-blowingly knowledgeable. It'll be fun.",
    "If you are interested in historical linguistics and ancient Indo-European languages, take this course.",
    "This is a really fabulous class. If you have a chance to take it, DO IT. I loved every minute of it and Professor Van Bladel is engaging and fun to listen to. Its a lot to learn because youre basically taking a crash course in like 10 languages, but its worth it.",
    "Yes, but I think you should definitely have prior experience studying some ancient language"
