                "I believe everything is fairly well organized; I would get TFs who were more proficient in the material seeing as they often stumbled explaining concepts and left the students even more confused. I would also give more practice problems that were more similar to the exams so that students knew what to expect as they prepared for them.",
                "Strengths: Sections where we could do homework definitely helped (although often times the TAs were unprepared to address questions and the answer keys were plagued with mistakes), the ED discussion was a great platform to ask questions on\r\nWeaknesses: not nearly enough problem solving/applications in class (psets and exams were incredibly challenging and many times we felt unequipped to answering/going about questions), professor often didn't know how to answer questions in class or there were mistakes in the notes, oftentimes I left lecture feeling very confused and lost; lots of work as well (the design project, especially part 2 felt totally unnecessary and a waste of time)",
                "The ed discussion forum was super helpful! I also appreciated the practice problems in classwould like to have more of those.",
                "Pset solutions with no mistakes are needed",
                "weaknesses:\r\n- The problem sets were often worded very weirdly and expected us to know nominal values that weren't in the notes, or to have prior knowledge that wasn't taught in class. \r\n- weekly discussion sections were not helpful at helping us figure out the problem sets or reviewing material either. \r\n- It was hard to know what equations to keep track of throughout the semester, and having a living equation sheet that was expanded throughout the semester with important equations to know would've been very beneficial. It was hard to keep having to go back through the lecture to find the equations we needed to use for the problem sets. \r\n- Lecture notes with main ideas for each lecture would've also been very helpful.\r\n- Grading was very strict on problem sets and since instructions were already unclear on certain questions, points were often deducted for things you didn't realize were issues with your answers.\r\n- The final exam was hard and extremely long and seemed to test how good our calculus was more than our knowledge of the actual concepts.\r\n- The design project was a lot of menial work rather than something that was beneficial to our understanding of the concepts of the course.",
                "This course covers some extremely advanced material and is very math-heavy. I think that for a course with this much math there need to be more problem-solving examples in class or in section. Furthermore, the exams are unnecessarily difficult. As the material in this course is very difficult, to begin with and goes by so fast simply testing the students on an understanding of the concepts covered in lecture and homework should be sufficient. Creating broad never before seen extensions on exams is unfair and uneccesary.",
                "The course is well structured with topics that lead into one another. The last week of physiological applications was a great way to end the course. The psets were great for preparing for the exams.",
                "Overall, this course was well run. The TAs were knowledgeable and helpful in section, and Professor Miller-Jensen was always willing to answer questions in lecture. I think the course content was very reasonable and well explained. Problem sets also expanded on class content, but weren't unreasonably difficult. Overall, I would say this is the best organized and most effective of the 3 core BME classes",
                "Strengths: Connections to biomedical applications. Breadth of subjects covered. Second half focused on diffusion. Prof. KMJ and TFs were very accessible and helpful. Also, Prof. KMJ demonstrated her care for student well being throughout the semester and especially during finals. She moved the final exam online very early to accommodate students who may have had to travel early due to Omicron outbreak.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, particularly in first half, organization of course was difficult to follow. I wasn't sure how everything fit together at all times. Prof. KMJ could get a bit flustered sometimes during lectures when pressed on certain questions. This could lead to confusion. Also, PSets regularly required clarification on certain questions, but TFs and professors readily available to help in person and by email.",
                "Overall, this course is very well organized, engaging, and enjoyable! The content is challenging, but it is delivered well. Professor Miller-Jensen is an amazing professor. She is patient, explains material well, and genuinely wants every student to succeed and understand the content.",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller-Jensen is a great lecturer and explained many complicated topics in simple ways, problem sets and the midterm were pretty fair, TA's were helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there were many derivations that did not seem completely necessary to understand, problem set solutions were only released just before the final exam (would have been nice to have earlier in order to prepare)",
                "This course was very challenging and had a lot of information, but the way the class was split was helpful especially for grading.",
                "The strengths of this class is that the flow of material makes sense and is easy to follow.",
                "It was a very difficult and engaging class, but it was just as equally rewarding. The professor, KMJ is very down to earth and shows high interest in what she teaches. She is also very flexible to accommodate for all students' teaching preferences.",
                "Very organized lectures."

                "I do! This course is mostly for BME majors, but it's good! Prof. KMJ really cares about her students, and the second half of the course is well structured and cool to learn about diffusion. If you're interested in learning a broad range of topics to apply basic math towards various kinetic situations in biology, then this is a good course for you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even if you are not in the biomedical engineering major. If you have interest in the more mathematical aspects of biophysics or biochemistry, definitely take this course!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are a biomedical engineering major. You strengthen your knowledge of how to use differential equations to model certain biological scenarios. However, this course, especially the second half, is pretty math-based so I would suggest slightly sharpening your basic knowledge of solving ODE's.",
                "I would recommend if you are a BME major. It is not alot of work, but you need to attend discussion sections/office hours and class in order to succeed and understand the material for psets and especially exams.",
                "Yes it is an amazing course and I enjoyed it! It was super interesting.",
                "Yes! Learned very niche topics that are applicable to many other engineering and biology fields.",
                "Really enjoyed the course and the real world applications of the material. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I would if youre researching anything biological or interested in medicine/biology post-undergrad. The manner in which molecules interact was covered from a new angle that is not common from your standard introductory science courses."
