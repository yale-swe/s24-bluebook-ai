   "comments": [
    "I developed a lot in terms of my ability to make clear drawings and iterate on designs.",
    "site specificity, design process, rhino 3d modeling, and design revision.",
    "Senior fall studio was great - we were guided through both conceptual architecture and through the design of a real building.",
    "For the first time in the architecture sequence, we were able to see a medium scale project through from start to finish. With a specific site and program, the exercises were extremely helpful in allowing us to figure out what we were interested in, and explore it at multiple scales throughout the site.",
    "This studio has fewer projects which allows you to work really in depth on one thing for a month or so. I learned much more about what it's like to work with a real site and real clients and how I can incorporate my own design aesthetic with the needs of others."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the course was poorly organized which made it hard to understand what was expected at crits. I think this may be partially because of the sheer number of instructors\/TAs who co-managed the course.",
    "Incredibly good and engaged teaching staff, wonderful class community. This semester had longer length projects and so at times desk crits and work process felt fairly directionless, and it was easy to feel stressed and lost in the process. I wish that there had been more honest feedback and direction to our designs, or at least more communication about expectations. I liked our projects and loved that we were engaged with the New Haven community, but thought that the program could have been more specific.",
    "This course was particularly strong because the faculty were open to listening the voices of each individual students.",
    "This course is the best studio I have taken. My only note would be to mix more small-group discussions in with desk critiques during the final project. I would have loved to get more advice and know more about what my peers were working on!",
    "At times, the prompts seemed a little bit unclear, but usually this was cleared up quickly."

    "Required, but yes! Turner and Adam are INCREDIBLE mentors \/ instructors - take advantage!",
    "Definitely! Adam and Turner are so kind and are really invested in our growth as designers and individuals.",
    "Turner and Adam are wonderful and very different from previous studio professors. Even if you don't love the prompts, you will likely enjoy the class because of their approach to teaching."
