We covered a lot of indirect speech forms, which allowed us to make more complex sentences. Additionally, we learned forms for speaking with different levels of respect  i.e. casual speech, honorific speech, etc.",
                "Overall, learned more in-depth about the Korean language and culture with Professor Kim.",
                "I was able to learn a more intermediate sense of the language, in that more nuanced vocabulary and concepts were instilled.",
                "Gained a better understanding of the Korean language.",
                "I gained such a solid and strong knowledge of the basics in having great conversations in Korean. I feel confident to go to Korea after this course because it helped me to improve in daily life situations and introduced a lot of writing and speaking exercises while also truly solidifying the grammar we need to know to speak formally vs. informally. I also learned how to apply what I learned to my grandmothers and came to grow closer to my classmates through the interactive activities we had in class."

                "Full comprehensive study guides with examples would be great",
                "Strengths: Kim Sonsaengnim is a fantastic professor who brings enthusiasm and energy to class everyday. She made learning fun and class was enjoyable to attend. She also provided very helpful feedback on homework assignments and exams. Class was organized; tests were fair and helped learning; homework assignments were helpful; and TA sessions were also good for speaking practice. There was a good mix of review plus learning a lot of new material.\r\nThe only weakness was that in class, we did a lot of repeating after the professor and\/or reading out loud to the class, but not that much 1-on-1 speaking practice with a partner. I felt that in my previous Korean classes, we did this often and that it helped my learning a lot. I wish we had done this more often in K130.",
                "Strengths: Learned about a lot of different grammar points, conjugations, and vocabulary which was especially useful! Professor Kim's clarity in all of the assignments and understanding of nature to all of her students was also very helpful!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Kim mentioned it, but because our L3 class was quite large, it was sometimes hard to ask to slow down in class. The pacing of the class- at least in the beginning- was quite fast, learning material the day before it appears on a test was not ideal (but manageable)",
                "The strengths are that it is enjoyable and fair in grading. There are no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim is extremely patient and kind. Learning a language does not come easily to me, but she made the experience so much better. I also liked how things were graded (many frequent tests as opposed to a few big assignments). This helped my stress levels immensely.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "The strengths of this course was the relaxed and welcome environment. This class was completely judgement free and the professor always encouraged us everyday to try saying something out loud and gain practice."

                "I would definitely recommend K130, especially if you started Korean with K110 at Yale. I feel like I've learned a lot of Korean since I started. Also, class is not stressful, but fun to go to and you can create a cool community with your classmates. The Korean department is awesome and the professors are great. Kim Sonsaengnim is awesome!!! I would recommend taking K130 or any other level of Korean from her.",
                "Yes especially with Professor Kim who is so kind, understanding, and truly cares about her student's well-being and their success in her class! I will that the homework load is especially manageable and the final project is engaging, but the tradeoff is that every two weeks you have a lesson test regarding 3 lessons you have learned. At times, it could be difficult to do but I think it depends on what type of structure is best fit for a student!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a great way to continue on their journey in learning Korean.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in continuing their study of Korean, especially if the class is taught by Professor Kim.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone thinking of learning korean. It is truly such a wonderful introduction to the language and you go really in depth in the grammar without it being the most stressful class."
