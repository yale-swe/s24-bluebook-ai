The four oral presentations throughout the semester were also a nice opportunity to practice more formal academic speaking and presentations with my peers.",

As the course granted me insight into a period of history about which I previously knew little, Professor Harms also taught us how to search for and meaningfully analyze primary source documents for our final project.",

I was disappointed by the lack of student engagement, and I think that was partially because the professor did not push us to ask broader questions or go beyond facts and historical trends.",

                "Fewer readings",
                "The strengths of the course were its content and the final primary source activity. It was incredibly interesting to hear which primary sources my classmates were studying, and I enjoyed analyzing firsthand accounts for my final project. The weaknesses of the course were some of the course readings and the brevity of our discussions. I thought that the readings at the beginning of the semester were less engaging than the books Professor Harms assigned at the end of the term (they were more dynamic articles and books rather than textbook entries), and I often felt that we could have gone more in-depth with our seminar discussions. We often ended class early when I felt like we could have talked about the readings in much greater nuance.",
                "Strengths: really knowledgeable instructor; great readings; seminar structure was unique but facilitated learning really well; workload was just the right balance of readings and assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none."

Unless you really just want some factual knowledge of this subject, and don't care about thinking critically about any historical analysis, I would recommend taking a different pre-industrial course.",

Although the content is fantastic and incredibly important, the class itself could be a bit disorganized and less engaging than the material itself.",
