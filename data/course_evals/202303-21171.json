                "Ao Laoshi is the sweetest teacher ever; you can tell she really cares about her students and their improvement in the language. I think this was the main strength of the course. Ao Laoshi was always very attentive, making sure we were participating and learning from the course. The only weakness is that at times it felt a little disorganized. For example, the lesson number on the syllabus would not match the lesson number on the actual lesson page, causing some confusion and miscommunication among students at times. Otherwise, this was a great course!",
