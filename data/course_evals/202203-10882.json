                "There's a lot of content in class but it's kind of heavy and sometimes just purely mathematical. The coding parts of the PSETs are not well designed (starting from the second PSET) where it's very vague what we need to implement \/ and HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S RIGHT and sometimes the coding parts are not what we learned in class.",
                "I found that the exams did not allow enough time for thoughtful work on all the problems.  I would prefer to have more time to be able to work out a solution to each problem rather than having it be a speed test.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure and organization of this course. The lecture notes were always posted beforehand with accompanying reading (not necessary). Classes were also quite informative and easy to understand.",
                "Strengths: interesting material. Weaknesses: lots of self-studying needed (I feel that some of the lectures were too advanced for an intro course, many difficult concepts were not explained clearly), instructors not responsive on Ed",
                "Assignments definitely helped understand the material. The midterm exam was a bit too long for the time given.",
                "I thought lectures were great and problem sets really helped expand knowledge of the subject. I think the course could be improved slightly if we had a problem set that involved using the IBM Quantum Computer or something similar.",
                "Very interesting course overall. Prof Ding was great and gave great lectures. Lectures were interesting but often very fast and sometimes confusing. \r\nPsets were interesting, but often disorganized and sometimes asked questions about things that weren't in lecture. \r\nPsets were sometimes difficult. Exam review for the midterm was harder. Then, exams were hardest. Exams asked questions in different formats and sometimes about different things than were asked in psets. \r\nOffice hours were a necessary part of the course and were very useful. \r\nOne TA was more math focused, one TA was more CS focused. Psets were due Wednesday. It would have made more sense to have more office hours late in the week, instead of having all of them Mon-Wed. This made doing psets a last-minute rush. Also, the math-focused TA should hold office hours earlier in the week than the CS focused TA, as that was the order in the psets.",
                "It was hugely confusing for me - however this isn't really a shortcoming of the course so much as the subject matter itself, and you have ample opportunity to learn the material. Professor Ding is very friendly and helpful!"

                "Probably not. It's very theory\/math-based. Midterms and finals are very hard, but curve might be generous? PSETs are not well designed, and classes are pretty confusing.",
                "Yes, I think this course was excellent in teaching me how to think logically and mathematically; the course uses the very fabric of our reality to solve problems that classical computing could never solve as fast, which was very cool.",
                "Yes, I feel that I have a much better understanding of quantum computing after taking the course.  The assignments and lectures were interesting and educational.",
                "Yes! This has been one of my favorite CS classes here at Yale. Before taking the class, \"quantum computing\" was really just a buzzword that I just heard thrown around when talking about the frontier of innovation. Throughout the semester, I gained a better understanding of what quantum computing is, and the power it gives to solving challenging problems. It really is a new way of thinking, due to the ability of \"superposition\" that you will become quite familiar with dealing with. The homework assignments aren't actually that long due to so many optional problems (that I recommend you do, some of them aren't actually that hard). Furthermore, Prof. Yongshan Ding was so energetic in each class and you could tell that he is passionate about quantum computing and helping us understand what the field is about. (Fair warning though, it helps to have a little linear algebra experience, as there is a decent amount of math, but nothing you can't learn through the class)",
                "It's interesting material and one of the few CS science credits. Expect to do a lot and self-studying, however -- I don't feel that the course is super well-taught and many difficult concepts are hard to understand from the lectures alone",
                "Yes, just interesting to learn",
                "Yes absolutely. One of the most interesting CS electives, and a reasonable amount of work. The exams are tough, but Yongshan wants everyone to succeed.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would - I find the subject matter as interesting as it is confusing, and although it's a challenging course it is certainly a rewarding one."
