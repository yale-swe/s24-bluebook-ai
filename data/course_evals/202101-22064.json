                "I thought this course, with its sections and guest lecturers, was incredible! I had the opportunity to see multiple section leaders (different instructors) during this semester, and if I had to point out a weakness it would be that, the instructors all have very different teaching styles, some of which I think are more geared towards this kind of course and some of which aren't. For example, one of the instructors came in for a day and guided the course in a really fast-paced, almost rushed manner, giving us questions to talk about but not really enough time to talk about them. Another instructor we had for a day treated the seminar as if it were a lecture and talked the entire time. In my opinion, this course works best when it is an open-discussion with minimal guidance from the instructor, so I thought that was something that could be improved.",
