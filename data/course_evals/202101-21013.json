I think that this is the best course at Yale in terms of its organization and structure, which can be attributed to Dr. Hawkins. I love the use of Ed for questions and the lecture summaries are very helpful. I don't have any weaknesses.",
                "The lectures are interesting and engaging. 75 minutes is a bit too long to sit on Zoom, which they tried to deal with. The review sessions were insanely helpful and set me up very well for the exams. The problem sets were a bit too complicated for me, especially considering I did much better on the exams. Maybe that's by design, but I struggled with them.",
                "- Lectures are run by one professor but all the important stuff (psets, midterm, final) is run by hawkins. therefore material you need to know and material that is interesting is hard to tell apart, you have to sift through all of the nonessential stuff.\r\n\r\n - Midterms and finals are structured so that you can guess the answers correctly, but students who study hard are very likely to confuse themselves on the exam. Therefore all of the grades are clustered in the center, with the Econ curve and luck essentially determining your final grade.",
                "This course excels when it comes to ease of learning though the large class size made student engagement difficult.",
                "The problem set and exam questions are rather ambiguous and it seems by design. I would prefer to be tested on the application of what I know rather than my comprehension of intendedly ambiguous questions. If that means making the questions even harder that is fine.",
                "Strengths: the lectures incorporated funny asides and stories that made me want to go to them live. This was an incredibly organized course (go Dr. Hawkins) and I felt like the overall pacing of material was perfect. The one-page lecture summaries and Ed discussion threads on what to study for exams were definitely my favorite parts. I wish I had those in every class. The course emphasized applications of earlier concepts with more recent ones at times, and although it was hard for me to do that at first, I've definitely gotten a better understanding of the macroeconomy. Also, I really liked the PSet structure!  I liked the questions where we had to go to a site/article and then synthesize the lecture content with the new info. Another small plus was how I never had to assign questions to pages on Gradescope; I loved that. My discussion section TF was great and super patient. There were so many resources in this course that even when I was struggling, it was relieving to know that I could go to an office hours and have it figured out within a day or so. Even if I didn't go to an office hours, the TFs and Dr. Hawkins were extremely on top of the Ed discussion so I felt super supported 24/7.\r\nWeaknesses: It was really hard to keep up with notetaking during the lectures. I'm not sure if the slides were text-heavy, I was a slow writer, or if the speed was just a little too fast for me, but I often had to go back and fill in parts of the notes after lecture. Maybe this was a ploy to get me to review the content again though because it certainly reinforced my understanding.",
                "One of the strengths was the duo of Tsyvinski and Hawkins!! Hawkins made the admin side of the class very efficient, and Tsyvinski was a super engaging lecturer, plus the two of them would often go on tangents (often relating to Belarus vs. Australia) that kept the class entertaining even when the content wasn't as interesting. Another strength was that the slides were posted to canvas, and after each lecture there was a 'summary' pdf that basically condensed the content into what you needed to know for exams, which was very helpful. Ed was a good resource, and there was also a textbook that was written for the class that had information (but I didn't really use it that much). Peer tutor office hours were really helpful; TFs were sometimes less helpful in the OH. Lastly, I thought the course did a good job assuming minimal economic background (also it rarely referred to material in intro micro).",
                "The strength of this course is most definitely its teacher and course director. If you are able to take this course with professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins, please do. They were entertaining as well as incredibly insightful into the subject they were teaching. The course material and additional resources are very accessible and well organized.",
                "Strengths: The professors are great lecturers-- fnny and engaging. When they could, they put in interesting content that relates to our everyday life (ie. COVID-19, climate change, work gender barriers, trade networks, life hacks, etc.). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is an intro course so by nature it is a bit dull at times (second half of the semester). Also, because of COVID-19, the exams were excruciatingly and unnecessarily difficult. Regular years it is not that bad, but virtually, it is a stressful lecture to take.",
                "Aleh's great, and Hawkins is great. I wish, however, that lectures were a bit slower and more concise. It feels like often we see data that really isn't needed and then that time is spent, so a lot of the important concepts are just blown by rather quickly.",
                "STRENGTHS: Prof Tsyvinski and Hawkins are really invested in the material and excited to answer students' questions, TAs are very helpful, there are tons of office hours and peer tutor hours, the material is organized well, grading is fair, assignments are clear\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: n/a",
                "strengths: lots of resources (office hours, peer tutor hours, lecture slides and notes)\r\nweaknesses: sometimes lectures were a bit dry",
                "This course was fantastic and very well run. No improvements necessary.",
                "The whole Econ 116 team does a wonderful job helping students succeed in this course. There are so many systems to create opportunities for success.",
                "The course overall was very good. It was highly organized and effective in its teaching. One way it could be improved is to clean up some of the lecture slides to make some topics more clear.",
                "Strengths: Fun professors and friendly and helpful TA's , GREAT Ed Discussion utilisation (thought that was SUPER helpful), lecture summaries for every lecture were great to help us study. \r\nWeaknesses: Felt the lectures were too long to follow along and that what we learned wasn't necessarily was was being tested on or at least practiced on the problem sets.",
                "Dr. Hawkins is undoubtedly one of the finest instructors I have ever had. He gives incredibly precise, thorough, and useful explanations, and meticulously managed the virtual classroom. He is a fantastic instructor, and should, in my opinion, teach the course himself.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tsyvinski is also great, funny, and a good instructor. He is a good fit to teach this big course, but he could also do well teaching intermediate macroeconomics, perhaps, and have Dr. Hawkins teach this course (this is mostly a reflection of how highly I think of Dr. Hawkins).\r\n\r\nThere are many resources available to students to learn, and although the class is certainly foundational, you come away from it feeling like you understand the world better. It's a great class to take.\r\n\r\nThings to improve: Canvas quizzes are a bit clunky, and I didn't like breakout rooms for sections very much. Also, there were rumors of many students cheating on tests because of the unproctored, online exams. This was frustrating.",
                "The one frustrating weakness is the inconsistency in the true/false questions. Most of the time, some reasonable assumptions are required to interpret the question, but other times, the question assumes that you don't make additional assumptions (because the answer is supposed to be false because it is excessively general). This could be helped by being more clear about what sorts of assumptions are appropriate to make for these questions.",
                "Proffessor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins were a superstar duo that truly made learning economics fun.",
                "Professor Hawkins is the biggest strength of this class. He literally did so much for all of us and was so effective and willing to do whatever it took to make the class run smoother. I can't say enough how much of an absolute godsend he is for ECON 116. Weakness is probably just that it went a little fast.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the professors and course staff. Prof. Tsyvinski is an engaging and fun lecturer. There are endless resources for students to utilize if they need help understanding the course material. No real weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Aleh Tsvinsky\r\nWeaknesses: Exam preparation",
                "a great strength is the amount of tutoring available",
                "I think that having a combination of discussion sections and weekly live lectures was the way to go with this class. It gives us a chance to ask more questions and go over specific topics we may not have fully understood in lecture. One thing I wish could have been done is I wish the discussion sections should be mandatory. This is because sometimes, I wouldn't have the motivation to go (as bad as that sounds, I was burnt out sometimes). When I did go to discussion section, I always grasped concepts a lot better.",
                "Strengths: The course covered a broad range of important macroeconomic topics; it was very organized, and the quizzes and problem sets were good practice for exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the course was a little too fast during the second half of the semester in my opinion, and I think more time could have been spent reviewing the more complicated concepts.",
                "The engaging material and engaging lecture style was the most standout strength of the course. Additionally, Prof. Hawkins was very responsive and involved as the course director assisting students while upkeeping an extreme level of organization throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Organized, engaging, interesting, manageable workload, and easy to get help.\r\nWeaknesses: Not many weaknesses",
                "The strengths are the organization of the course in the access to resources and pacing of materials.",
                "Honestly, this is a great course with a great professor. I really liked how they intertwined economic principles and concepts. One of my favorite courses of the year! I wish the grading was more clear though, but that is an overall issue with the economics department.",
                "lectures material extremely well-organized, use of Ed was very helpful",
                "Great course, I honestly can't find weaknesses because Edstem really helped in clarifying questions. Prof. Tsyvinski and Hawkins are the best. It was very interesting to learn about the basics of macroeconomics through research and I appreciate Prof. Tsyvinski's perspectives on topics. Prof. Hawkins' support via Edstem and review sessions is unparalleled.",
                "The organization of this course - particularly the work done by Dr. Hawkins - sets students up for success. I really appreciated the lecture summaries and the module organization.",
                "Strengths: DR. HAWKINS. This was by far the most organized, structured course that I have ever taken at Yale, and it was such a tremendous help to our learning throughout the semester. Every single professor and course in the economics department has something to learn from the way ECON 116 is taught; it was a stark difference from taking ECON 115 in the fall. The content is also highly engaging, and Professor Tsyvinski makes an effort to balance fundamental concepts with interesting applications such as cryptocurrency, climate change, and the COVID-19 crisis through an economic lens. The inside jokes that are developed throughout the semester also made each lecture a thrill to watch. Dr. Hawkins and Professor Tsyvinski are the strangest Australian-Belarusian economists duo that you could possibly imagine, but it worked out effectively, amazingly, and hilariously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A couple, but not enough dog appearances. Asking questions on Ed was also a bit intimidating and discouraging due to the way Dr. Hawkins responds to students, but nonetheless helpful.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Tsyvinski is an awesome lecturer - very fun, smart, and engaging. Dr. Hawkins is awesome as well - very knowledgable and willing to help. Amazing course organization.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections - didn't feel very engaging or helpful",
                "The class gives you many tools to succeed. The quizzes are extremely helpful (you can do them as many times as you want) because they give you a low-stakes environment to practice the material. The review sessions for each exam were also extremely helpful. Aleh and William also had a great dynamic that made the lectures very interesting.",
                "Strengths: organization and energy of teachers were great\r\nWeaknesses: At first examples were low but this was fixed and improved.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it was very well-organized, the lecture slides were detailed, and it was engaging.",
                "Strengths: The course is extremely organized. Apart from lectures, there are weekly sections, regular office hours, Ed discussion page for questions, folders for lecture slides/summaries, PSETs, and quizzes. The support system is definitely there and the TFs/professors are willing to help if you need it. Weaknesses: The pace of the course is very fast and I often found that the midterms were significantly harder than the PSETs and weekly quizzes.",
                "Overall, ECON 116 was a well-designed course that gave students essential skills for understanding and analyzing the macroeconomy. However, one of the challenges of this course was that it was all very conceptual and felt a bit hand-wavy at times, and it was hard for me to feel sure about my own analysis. This course may seem easy at first, but I quickly came to realize that I had to have a very thorough understanding of a lot of minute details in order to do well on the exams/p-sets. I wouldn't say that was a weakness of the course, but just be prepared for more conceptually challenging material compared to ECON 115.",
                "I enjoyed the course, Prof. Tsyvinski did a great job during lectures and I enjoyed the extra stories about Russia/Belarus/Australia. It would've been really hard to keep students' focused during an online lecture but I think he did a great job. I also enjoyed seeing Archie.",
                "Only strengths especially for covid. Everything was recorded and posted making it great for kids in different time zones. Ed was probably the best thing ever and was great to ask questions when I was confused. Dr. Hawkins was extremely helpful, kind, and easy to reach. Both professors made the class as fun as possible during covid and I greatly appreciated that.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, manageable workload, logical progression of content\r\nWeaknesses: really not anything.",
                "I like the structure of homework assignments, with simultaneous PSETs and canvas quizzes due every week, but I think that it can be improved with more examples problems conducted in weekly lectures, because I occasionally felt unprepared for the type of problem that appeared on the PSETs.",
                "The course is organized logically and allows students to build from the previous unit in some ways. Sections are extremely helpful but sometimes they felt disconnected from the topics from lecture, so solidifying that connection might improve it. Quizzes were extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: excellent course organization, professors made it very clear what was crucial content and communicated those points well, touched on timely subjects; Weaknesses: although typical of such a large lecture, the course never really engaged students beyond sections which were not all that helpful, notes from just the lecture slides were often difficult to process without help from the lecture itself, making it occassionaly difficult to go back and review information without watching the recorded sessions",
                "The strengths of the course are that it is very well structured and organized. Prof. Tsyvinski made lectures very engaging (and oftentimes funny), and Prof. Hawkins was very responsive and organized in managing such a large lecture course. I personally found the Canvas quizzes to be tedious and not very helpful; I think incorporating some of the basic quiz questions into the problem sets may be a good way to streamline the weekly course work.",
                "Strengths: a lot of resources to help students succeed\r\nWeakness: sometimes the materials are heavy, so more practice problems/reviews will help.",
                "strength - well-organized course, lots of resources \r\nweakness - some of the lecture sessions were not very clear, had to spend extra time to make sure you understand",
                "The lectures were great and the lecture summaries were very helpful. There are so many resources to help you in the this class. I would have liked for there to have been more of an emphasis on problem solving in the course and how to approach exam questions.",
                "It is difficult to stay engaged in a 200 person class over zoom- I honestly think it was about as good as it could have been.",
                "The material was so interesting and Prof. Tsyvinski was incredible",
                "Strengths: Prof. Tsyvinski & Prof. Hawkins are the ultimate dynamic duo. I couldn't ask for a better pair of professors. Both solicited and addressed students' concerns throughout the course. Weaknesses: None.",
                "This course was engaging and structured well.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures, I thought they were very informative.",
                "Strengths: The professors are both great! Class was refreshing at funny. The course policies about homework were fair, the curving system is fair, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: No major complaints, really. If youre not interested in microeconomics you probably will not like the class, but thats a given.",
                "Professor Hawkins is the best, and it is very organized.",
                "It could be more interactive.",
                "Learned a lot.",
                "All around pretty good, format is great for learning",
                "Strengths: the regular quizzes and PSETs made sure I was understanding everything. I think the slides were also very clear so I could go through them after lecture. I also really liked the lecture summaries.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a lot of math for a credit that was not QR.",
                "Strengths: greats teachers, what is on lecture is relevant, homework and section helps for tests\r\nWeakness: ZOOM",
                "Strengths-\r\nProf. Tsyvinski is a fantastic and enjoyable lecturer\r\nDr. Hawkins organises the course very well\r\nLots of resources available to summarise content and practise with: lecture slides and helpful lecture summaries, plus section resources\r\nThe quizzes are a good way to recap content each week.",
                "There were so many resources for this class, which was helpful in preparing for exams. I was generally happy with the format of the course, but I wish that problem sets and quizzes held more weight in the grading system since they required the most labor for the class.",
                "Strengths - the content was very interesting\r\nWeaknesses - the exams were not tailored to test our comprehension of the course (since they were Canvas quizzes, there wasn't space to show our work or explain our answers, so our grades were purely based on getting the right answer rather than understanding the concept fully...)",
                "This class covered a wider range of topics than I had expected for an introductory macroeconomics class. Many of the statistics were taken from the most recent data available, and we even had a lecture on coronavirus economics. However, I think that the class was not very engaging, and many of the concepts which I had hoped to learn more about were briefly glossed over and deferred to intermediate economics.",
                "Sections were helpful, and I liked the weekly quizzes that allowed practice, as well. Lectures are so long though.",
                "Strengths  lecture summaries. Told you exactly what you needed to know \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  level of engagement.",
                "More examples",
                "Using \"ed\" was fantastic. 10000/10.",
                "Alex is great, course can be interesting",
                "It gives a good, comprehensive overview of microeconomics. Lectures are well made and course is generally pretty well run.",
                "Strengths: Material was interesting and fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes full of unnecessary material and were also hard to follow.",
                "The amount of content was quite high",
                "very good course, no improvement",
                "psets were not fun",
                "Learned a lot was a strength. Went very fast during lectures was a weakness.",
                "All the details of the class were very well communicated and we always had a channel to ask questions any time of the week. However, the lectures could have been more straightforward to what we would be tested on. I found the section slides a lot more straightforward.",
                "Really liked the professor.",
                "The class couldn't have been better",
                "The course was very entertaining and did a great job synthesizing mathematical material, broad-level concepts, and concrete examples.",
                "Strengths: The weekly quizzes were a great way to reinforce the topics and prepare for exams. I felt the quizzes were more representative than the hw assignments so I used those to prepare a lot. Sections were also very helpful and allowed me to work with other students to review concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: No significant weakness.",
                "The strengths were definitely the lectures. The professor made them very interesting and informative. The weakness had to be ED. There were just too many posts that it felt overwhelming at times.",
                "The class is extremely well organized--lectures are coherent, questions answered quickly, and quizzes and p-sets well organized. Weakness is that grading can be very picky sometimes, especially when regarding paragraph respones",
                "Strengths are organization, weakness is that I felt the material could've been more practiced.",
                "Strengths - material builds upon older material very neatly, very committed teaching staff. \r\nWeaknesses - exams place too much focus on very minor things briefly mentioned in class, curve is too tight.",
                "Strength is how well Dr. Hawkins is organized. Weakness is the wording of some slides since there is some language barrier (professor is from belarus). Cant really be improved.",
                "Strengths: great professor and TFs, great resources available outside of class\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to engage with in virtual format",
                "The course offers plenty of support to aid you in completing problem sets and studying for exams. The professor is also engaging. and strikes the right balance between lecturing and introducing entertaining commentary. Sometimes the problem set questions were a little bit tricky, so I'd recommend going to office hours if you have any doubt about how to solve them.",
                "Strengths-Instructors\r\nWeaknesses- adaptations for online environment. Was hard taking exams and quizzes because with no partial credit a small mistake could severely cost you.",
                "The problem sets and exams are difficult, but support is offered which is a strength.",
                "Strengths: The professors and TAs were definitely very help, \r\nWeakness: the subject itself is not very engaging",
                "professor rambles a bit, makes it tough to stay engaged",
                "Very strong intro course -- thank you!",
                "Strengths: the TAs and professors were great. Especially professor Hawkins and his organization. \r\nWeaknesses: the online lectures were not that engaging at times",
                "I thought one of the strengths was that the course was very well-organized, and it was fairly easy to see how topics connected with and built on each other.  It was also very clear what stuff was important to keep in mind and what stuff was just interesting to know.",
                "The instructors were so fun and engaging! I would continue to have the interactive parts of the class.",
                "Lectures were extremely strong, and problem sets did a good job to expand our knowledge of the concepts.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, relatively nice grading, great professor and course director\r\nWeaknesses: none really!",
                "I think one major strength is overall organization/structure. The clarity of resources on Canvas (like lecture summaries that specify what you need to know) are super helpful when studying and communication about how exams will be structured etc tends to be really good.",
                "Strength: This was one of the most organized Yale course I have taken thus far. The lectures, psets, and quizzes all lined up with the same information. The TA sessions were incredibly organized and helpful, as I am sure all of the TAs had the same clear session plans organized for them. The midterms were fair, as it tested information clearly taught in the course. Despite it being a huge lecture, grades were posted promptly after examination and questions were answered promptly through Ed Discussion post or through the TAs. Thanks to this course, I will continue to take more economics and consider majoring in it as well.",
                "Extremely organized with a lot of information available. A lot of optional attendance things, I wouldve preferred required discussions for motivation. I loved the organization and the use of Ed",
                "strengths: the professor and the assistant professor are so good!\r\nweaknesses: it would have been nicer to learn more about what is happening now in the news and apply it to macroeconomics",
                "I appreciated the uploading of lectures, slides, and one-page summaries, which were all helpful for review. It was sometimes difficult to tell from the slides alone exactly what information was most important to know, so the one-page summaries were very helpful in pointing in the right direction.",
                "kinda boring but seemed applicable to life",
                "The strengths of the course were the lecture slides - they were clear. Moreover, professor Tsyvinski was very animated and comical, keeping the class engaged. Professor Hawkins was also very helpful, clear, and generous with his time. The usage of Ed site is a big strength, as it allowed students to post questions and have them answered quite quickly. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were the Canvas exams. The main difficulty with them was the way the questions were graded - if one of your answer choices (out of 3, for instance) was wrong, while the other two were right, the whole question is marked as incorrect. It was also hard to fully understand the lectures at times, as the lecture slides and the lecture notes were not always in complete sync.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor and section leaders, well-organized course, reasonable workload. Weaknesses: not much! except the p-set rubrics were a bit elusive and we didn't know much about the criteria or level of detail for the answers they expected.",
                "Strengths are the teaching team, weaknesses are honestly hard to find. Occasionally some of the P-Sets and grading did feel a little arbitrary, and some of the material was taught with many considerations of different sides, but honestly that  in some ways  just made it more accurate and real world.",
                "This course was very informing and good at answering student's questions. It was very direct and to the point. The sections could have improved some.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the professors' emphasis not only on theoretical macroeconomic frameworks, but also on how these frameworks can be used to engage in thoughtful discussion about pressing and relevant macroeconomic debates. I also appreciate the broad range of topics that were covered in this course, from monetary policy to the economics of climate change and COVID-19. Another strength of the course was the use of discussion sections and the wealth of tutoring sessions (from both peer tutors and Teaching Fellows). \r\n\r\nDr. Hawkins was also one of the greatest strengths of this course. He answered students' questions thoroughly and efficiently, which I really appreciated. His responses to my questions not only helped me to understand the psets, but they also provided broader insight into macroeconomic phenomena.  \r\n\r\nI also greatly appreciated the \"quiz\" portion of the weekly homework assignments. Sometimes, while the virtual lectures were very motivating and interesting, it would take me some time to figure out how to apply the material from class to the pset problems. The quiz assignments were an excellent opportunity to build confidence in the material before approaching the graded problem sets. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, most of the weaknesses of this course stemmed from challenges that were inherent to Zoom/virtual learning. The incredibly large class size, for example, was not very conducive to virtual engagement.",
                "I found the lectures relatively engaging (at least, as much as a lecture over zoom can be), and I enjoyed much of the content and found it relevant in many situations.\r\nFor obvious reasons, the course likely would have been more engaging in-person.",
                "The course is well structured and I don't think it needs improvements.",
                "Lectures were informative and engaging, and there were a lot of resources to aid learning.",
                "Everything a strength.",

                "The recorded lectures were exceptionally successful  I actually prefer them to live lectures",
                "Trying to make 75 minutes more manageable was helpful, but the class is super long and hard to pay attention to an entire lecture, even recorded afterwards.",
                "Lectures could be very condensed. Felt slow, offtopic, and non-interesting for majority of lecture",
                "This course was well adapted to the COVID setting though the insanely large class size made it feel very inpersonal.",
                "Recording lectures and review sessions was great and very COVID-learning-style-efficient. Occasionally, we had polls in class which were interactive, but I'd say that the Zoom chat (which Dr. Hawkins monitored while Prof. Tsyvinski lectured) was super interactive and was a huge plus of this course. That and the Ed Discussion, which was also well kept and often checked.",
                "Ed was helpful. Better study group formation could improve and have been helpful.",
                "I have hard a really hard time paying attention to my lectures online. Even with no actual distractions my brain simply wanders and spaces out and I found it really difficult to be engaged with our lectures. I am not sure how this could have been improved because it is just the nature of the situation but I do think Prof. Tsyvinski did his best and we can all tell he is excited about what he is talking about and he always showed up to lectures prepared and ready!",
                "pretty much everything succeeded",
                "I think everything translated really well.",
                "The virtual format was successful. Powerpoint slides were shared during lectures, and the TAs during section usually had iPads they could draw on to make the practice questions more interactive.",
                "I think this class was the best that it could've been under COVID.",
                "The class was lively and had lots of inside jokes to make attending lecture worthwhile. Prof. Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins have a great sense of humor.\r\n\r\nThere were also many resources available to students who needed help, and I appreciated having lots and lots of example questions.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic will end soon, hopefully, so there should no longer be a need for online, proctored tests. But tests in the future should be proctored, always, to ensure fairness.",
                "Polls were fun, wish we had more.",
                "I think the recorded aspect was great, as I was able to pause and really understand what Professor was saying. I hope this continues in the future.",
                "Overall this was taught well given the circumstances. Lecturers could have been made more engaging by discussing how topics relate to current events more and/or engaging students more with polls.",
                "Lectures were good but review sessions were not.",
                "the course was great",
                "I think everything could have been done to learn successfully during COVID. The addition of Ed Discussion forum was probably the most helpful thing of all. I would ask questions day in and out about things learned in lectures, to specific questions on past exams. The professors and TAs would always respond promptly, pretty much always within an hour.",
                "The live virtual lectures along with the weekly discussion sections were very great, and the numerous office hours were also helpful for completing assignments.",
                "The course took advantage of the Covid situation the best it could--balancing engaging lectures, resources to students, and an extremely organized facilitation of the course it covered all the possible bases.",
                "Recorded lectures and exam format succeeded while not much needed improvement.",
                "The ED discussion forum is also very helpful.   It was also helpful that they recorded all the review sections. The weekly quizzes were a low-stress way to practice the material that I feel really helped my learning.  I could retry problems I did not fully understand without the fear of penalization.",
                "This was a class that excelled in virtual support. Edstem was really helpful.",
                "N/A",
                "I think the course was successfully geared towards the online format. There were recorded/virtual sections, virtual office hours, and an Ed discussion post page where students could ask and have their questions answered.",
                "I don't really know if there were practices in the course geared toward learning during COVID specifically because I'm not sure what the structure of this course was previously, but I think that the course format was pretty good, I'm not sure how it could be improved.",
                "Ed was fantastic, posting the lectures and section materials were also great. It was also nice to have the midterms and finals as quizzes instead of scanning pictures of paper. I know some kids didn't like that aspect but I hated scanning my work so I enjoyed the quiz.",
                "Everything was pretty much a smooth transition to virtual learning!",
                "I think this course was very successfully conducted as a whole for online learning. I consistently felt engaged with the material.",
                "Zoom lectures and sections were as good as they could be though the lack of participation hindered the learning experience.",
                "I appreciated that the course offered a number of different ways to engage with the material. In addition to recorded lectures, we had live sections, office hours, a textbook, Ed discussion forums, and other supplementary materials. Given the virtual format of the class, I found this structure to be helpful.",
                "Succeeded: the weekly discussion section that helps students make sense of the class materials. a lot of office hours so help is always there.",
                "The review session were very helpful and think having the lectures recorded were also great. I think all the organizational aspects of the course were very successful.",
                "Ed was a great way to be able to ask questions from different timezones and schedules.",
                "sections were great",
                "Recorded lectures were essential for my success because of the poor quality of my internet connection. Using Ed (not sure if this normal in a non-COVID year) was great too!",
                "The discussion sections were very helpful.",
                "The test format was very reasonable to students. I appreciated uploaded the live lectures as well. No real complaints.",

                "I thought the course worked extremely well in the virtual format, but I wish that discussion sections had been recorded.",
                "The way the exams were administered could be improved.",
                "The course was quite well-designed for learning during the pandemic. All the logistics were very well-handled by Dr. Hawkins, and the sections were helpful for learning in smaller group settings.",
                "The sections could have been more engaging",
                "Lectures were good but a bit dense",
                "Recording the lectures was very helpful. I also did not mind the infinite attempt quiz structure.",
                "The prerecorded lectures and posted lecture slides and summaries helped because you could just watch and pay attention then take notes later.",
                "Having access to recorded lectures was rly useful",
                "all succeeded",
                "Virtual lecturer were successful.",
                "I thought all the technology - Zoom polls, ED, gradescope, etc - worked quite well.",
                "Sections were not very useful.",
                "They did well. I don't think we are going to have any more virtual classes so I'm not sure if this question matters anymore. I don't think they could do much different.",
                "Success: The weekly quizzes worked really well virtually.\r\nImprovements: No significant improvements.",
                "Ed could be improved. I felt that there were just too many posts at times that made it feel very overwhelming.",
                "I mostly just watched recordings, but the class was as engaging as a lecture can be",
                "Ed discussion board, sections, office hours, online quizzes, problem sets. I felt very engaged in section with William Hawkins, particularly.",
                "The class was great overall",
                "Some polls",
                "I think this class would have been much better not over Zoom. As it was I found it hard to engage with the material. Peer tutors and TAs were hard to communicate with and I found it easy to skip lectures. A lot of efforts were obviously made to help us learn in a difficult environment, but I found it really difficult to do so.",
                "The virtual lecture format worked well for me. The professor still managed to make the course engaging, even though it was online. I also appreciated that lectures were recorded, so I could go back and rewatch segments which I had forgotten or did not fully understand.",
                "The testing could be improved to allow for partial credit.",
                "The office hours were helpful.",
                "I think the banter between professors worked well but its just so difficult to engage students over zoom so it could only go so far. Maybe more student participation would work",
                "I watched all lectures asynchronously, which I appreciated",
                "This course did pretty well in that it kept up to date with uploading all the recordings to canvas.",
                "It was interactive which was nice! Discussion sections were good, but I think a camera on requirement would have made more people engage.",
                "Class was organized well considering the circumstances.",
                "I appreciated the recorded lectures; if possible, having some sort of recordings available even during an in-person semester might be nice. It's really helpful to be able to go back and re-listen to parts of lectures.",
                "Having the course director manage the chat during lectures so the professor could focus on teaching was super helpful.",
                "What succeeded: The recorded Zoom lectures/review sessions were all uploaded promptly after the session so that students could quickly access the material. The TA sessions were engaging with relevant material, good questions, and break-out rooms.",
                "I liked how often office hours were held.",
                "/",
                "good use of Zoom but would've appreciated more active drawing etc.",
                "The Ed site succeeded, as it was very helpful in answering questions students had even when no office hours were running. \r\nPolls during lectures also succeeded, but weren't used as much. \r\n\r\nOffice hours could be improved. Many times when entering office hours, it is not possible to have all your questions answered, as there are a lot of people entering the Zoom call and the timing is limited to 1 hour. This is, of course, understandable, but was still frustrating at times. Moreover, it would be helpful if the office hours hosts used white boards when explaining concepts rather than simply speaking rapidly.",
                "I thought this course did great for a large lecture taking place online. Zoom features were fully utilized and the course was as engaging as an online format as really possible.",
                "I think the lectures went and the fact they were recorder helped a lot as I often missed some details in the live lecture.",
                "The recorded lectures were great, as were all of the review sessions. It could have had a bit more of community engagement, but honestly that is hard to do when everyone is online.",
                "The live virtual sessions were great and awesome.",
                "The use of powerpoint slides  with images and bullet points  during lecture was helpful in promoting student engagement, and also in allowing me to take more structured notes. However, I feel like the use of lecture slides may also have led the professor to move through material more quickly than I could often follow, which was not particularly conducive to virtual learning.",
                "I thought the having both Professor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins during lecture was very helpful for clarification and answering questions (usually via the zoom chat, but also sometimes by pausing the lecture and getting more thorough explanations).",
                "I liked the virtual review sessions before assessments and think a virtual option should remain next year even when we have more in-person lessons.",
                "Learning was not impacted by virtual nature of lectures and resources.",
                "nothing could be improved",
                "more interaction",
                "Success: recording the lecture, engaging students over zoom using humor \r\n\r\nImprovement: Maybe asking for student participation more during the lectures"

                "Yes  it provides a great basis for understanding the economic world around us. Macro economics are a fundamental part of policy making and our approach to solve issue like climate change. This course gives you numerous frameworks to apply to these real world problems.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! Everyone needs to take this course",
                "Yes, if you are interested in econ it is a staple. If you don't have much interest then it's not really worth taking given the difficulty.",
                "Well, you have to take itso yes.",
                "To all FIRST YEARS! - No. Look if you're a smart person, who studies hard, especially if you're a first year, just take intermediate. This is coming from someone who was in your shoes. There are better things to do with your time.",
                "Yes. This course is a core part of the economics curriculum and allows for an introduction into the world of macroeconomics in a relaxed setting.",
                "yup",
                "Yes! It's not as math-heavy as micro for anyone who's worried about that. The entire course staff is very receptive to feedback and eager to help. While the material can get overwhelming if you get a few lectures behind and have to play catch-up (I can attest to having done this once. It was rough.), it's generally very easy to stay on top of the work and concepts. There's a quiz and PSet due every week but the quiz has unlimited attempts so it's really just another attempt at making sure you know the material. The lectures often have funny asides incorporated, so I do recommend going live to those. You come away from the course feeling like you have such a robust understanding of the basic macroeconomy and I for one do not regret taking this course at all.",
                "This course is a pretty good introduction to macroeconomics and an interesting course (especially with Hawkins/Tsyvinski). It might not always be super interesting but it does help explain a lot of how the economy/financial systems around us work.",
                "If you have the opportunity to take this course with professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins, please do! They were able to make even the most boring topics in the class interesting. I would argue that intro macroecon is far more important for any student to have an understanding of than intro micro. This course really helped me to understand so much of what \"economics\" is within the practical application of government policy and intervention.",
                "Yes, if you have to do Intro Macro, Professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins make it the most enjoyable it could be. Just make sure you have a nice study group because they can help your understanding a lot.",
                "sure",
                "I would recommend the course to people who need to take it or if you find macro economics super interesting. If you are not in either of these groups then though you may be fine in the course, I don't think it will add too much fun to your course load. However, if you need to take it do not be afraid it is a really nice class and if you love macro then this is, of course, the class for you.",
                "I would if you like economics. I do not, but I still enjoyed it. There are definitely easier social science credits if not. But overall it is a great economics class and the instructors are amazing.",
                "yes, great if you're interested in political economy, especially welfare, economic development, and policy responses to economic crises",
                "Yes, absolutely. This is a great class and is super interesting especially if you are into economics or policy making (good course for political science majors). Professor Tsyvinski is amazing if you can take the class when he is teaching.",
                "yes, even if they're not interested in macroeconomics - just valuable information",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I think Professor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins do such a wonderful job teaching economics. I think the material is fundamental for all students as well.",
                "Yes! I recommend. Very useful life skills and knowledge are taught that everyone would benefit from.",
                "I would still recommend the course itself because the information we learn is really important and pretty crucial to understanding many issues and problems of the world today.",
                "Yes--this class is great, even for students who aren't economics majors. The class introduces concepts that are just good to know to be a citizen of this world, from GDP and output to inflation. Dr. Hawkins and Prof. Tsyvinski are also real assets to the course, and make it very enjoyable to learn.",
                "Of course, it is a well run class and the tools learned are incredibly important",
                "Yes, Aleh is the best.",
                "I wouldn't but it's a requirement and it's intro econ, so I think everyone should take this class.",
                "Yes. Macroeconomics is an important field to understand and Prof. Tsyvinski is a fantastic lecturer who makes class enjoyable.",
                "You probably have to take it.",
                "yes! great professor and course director",
                "Definitely recommended if you want to know more about how the economy works and what are the correct ways for policy to apply.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are considering skipping it because they took it in high school. Macroeconomics, like microeconomics, is very different from what we learned in high school. There was a lot of applications to the real world and current events, which always kept students engaged.",
                "Yes, even if you do not major in economics, this course is provides a great foundation for essential economic principles, and even touches on real-world issues such as equity and financial crises.",
                "100%. Professors Tsvyvinski and Hawkins maintained a great dynamic during lecture, provided engaging and interesting material, and made certain that students had resources to succeed/an organized course layout.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in macroeconomics or want to major in econ, the course is a must.",
                "Yes. I think it a good introduction to macroeconomics. The concepts were connected well and explain thoroughly.",
                "Absolutely would recommend! This is a course every Yale student should take if they are interested in the humanities, government, or finance! Honestly, this is a course anyone should take if they are remotely interested in society and life in general.",
                "if they need to for their major or are interested in macroeconomics",
                "Absolutely. I found intro macro to be much more interesting than intro micro, and this class definitely helped me in understanding today's economic news better. The instruction and support were fantastic, and I definitely gained a lot relative to the amount of time and work I spent on this class.",
                "Definitely! This is an extremely well-structured class paired with highly engaging content. This is a class everyone, including non-majors, should take to contextualize economic events occurring throughout the world and a mindset for macroeconomic analysis.",
                "Yes. It's an essential course for understanding the world. It doesn't require heavy math skills, but it gives you the tools to analyze real-world issues, ranging from public finance & taxes to trade.",
                "I would recommend the course if you are interested in economics - esp. if Aleh is teaching it. The class gives a great foundation in macro.",
                "Yes if you're interested in economics. Great concepts and great professor.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The information taught is very fundamental to understanding basic economic principles in society today.",
                "Yes - even if you are not an Economics major, I recommend that you take this course. Apart from the introduction to new macroeconomic concepts, you learn about them in context with current events and the real world. This helped me understand the effects of macroeconomic problems and policies that are very relevant today.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning more about the macroeconomy. I took this course as a requirement for the EP&E major and found it very useful in understanding the US economy today. The teaching team was organized, responsive, and always willing to help. I especially appreciated the immense time and effort that Dr. Hawkins and the TFs put into answering ALL of our questions on Ed, which was definitely one of the most important avenues of learning outside of lectures. However, this course was definitely not a gut -- you have to work hard to be able to understand and apply what you learned in class to exam problems.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely if it is with Professor Tsyvinsky and Dr. Hawkins. They make the intro course very engaging and were pretty understanding during covid.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely! Even if not a prereq, many essential skills that can be applied in a wide variety of fields.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if that student was considering the economics major.",
                "Yes, it teaches some very important topics that are also interesting.",
                "Yes - beyond being a necessary course for anyone wanting to study economics, this class was great at giving students big picture ideas about economic activity, while making sure they don't get too stuck in the mud on minute details. Having taken several economics courses at Yale, I feel like I will retain the information from this course the best out of any others. Many times, economics can get so bogged down with equations and relationships that it feels a lot like a test of how much you can memorize. Luckily, ECON 116 doesn't fall into this trap, and I feel like I'm walking away with a much clearer understanding of both micro and macro concepts.",
                "Yes, I would. If you need it for a major, there is no other option. The professors are great and you learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While the course material can be dry at times, ultimately the concepts that we learn are immensely important to so many other disciplines, including history, political science, global affairs, and even the natural sciences to extent; additionally, I think understanding macroeconomics in general helps you to understand major news and current events topics.",
                "Yes, learning macroeconomics help hones down what it means by an \"economist lens\". Honestly, taking this course makes me feel more of an adult that can actually digest the news.",
                "Yea.",
                "I would recommend this course even if it is not required for your major.",
                "Yes, mainly because it is applicable to pretty much every social science. Even if you dont want to be an economist, you will still learn something of interest to you.",
                "yes!! great intro class, feel able to understand news now about the economy and the world, good for economic literacy",
                "Absolutely! This course is super interesting and fun!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Economics major or not, everyone must take this course. Everyone needs to know how markets in the world function.",
                "I would recommend this to any student interested in economics.",
                "I would recommend this course, even if you aren't an Econ major.",
                "Yeah, take it if youre considering the Econ major (as its a requirement). Its not a course I would take just for fun, but its a great professor to take if youre planning on it.",
                "Yes. It would be great for anyone majoring in the social sciences.",
                "Id definitely recommend this course as one of the hallmark courses at Yale.",
                "Yes for anyone who needs it for their major.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes if you want to build an economic base.",
                "Yes! If you have to take it for a requirement or even if you want to broadly understand Econ I think this is a great course.",
                "Yes, gives you a great basic understanding of economics, great teachers as well.",
                "Absolutely. This is a course suited to both majors and non-majors. While the content is extremely interesting, and is linked effectively to real world problems, the course also helps to develop analytical skills that can be applied to other subjects and disciplines.",
                "Yes, Dr. Hawkins and Professor Tsyvinski are helpful instructors.",
                "Yes. Learned a lot about the economy.",
                "If they haven't taken economics before, then sure. If they have taken AP or IB economics for example, then I'd recommend skipping to intermediate unless they would really need a refresher. I feel like with certain topics, I learned more in my AP curriculum than in this class. In hindsight, I think it's ok to not feel 100% confident with everything before going into intermediate, because after this class I still do not feel 100% confident with many things (partly because those topics will be further discussed in intermediate).",
                "Yes, but I would specify that it was a difficult course",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to the economy as a whole, especially if you are interested in how policies at the national and state level could impact the economy.",
                "Yes, certainly.",
                "Yes, if interested in Econ",
                "Yes if they are interested in economics or need to progress in the core economics sequence. It serves its purpose well and is pretty well taught.",
                "Yes. Between Micro and Macro, I think this course will teach you a lot more things that are relevant to the current economy.",
                "yes this was very interesting course",
                "Yes, it is a great course to learn the basics of Macroeconomics.",
                "I would if someone needed to learn this material for future courses or their major.",
                "If they have to take econ.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This was a great class to take!",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Not only is the content instrumental for any informed citizen, but it is taught in a way so everyone is can find something of interest to them.",
                "Yes! You gain a good overview of some really important macroeconomics topics, and some of the ideas covered are pretty current (we talked about climate change, cryptocurrency, etc).",
                "I mean if you need to take a macroeconomics course for one of many majors it is required. Anyone else that is considering work in a public policy field should probably take this course to have a stronger macroeconomic perspective on the issues they care about. Otherwise?? There are better classes at Yale for thinking and developing an educated worldview.",
                "Yes! It is an extremely well organized course, the content is interesting and I always felt prepared.",
                "Yes! this course is fundamental and applicable to numerous fields.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, as I think it gives a really solid foundational understanding of economics. It's not a huge time commitment, as long as you put in a couple hours each week to learn the material and do the psets, and put in a couple hours before each exam.",
                "yes is useful",
                "Yes, it's a great introductory course for Macroeconomics.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to understand the basics of how the financial system works, what drives inflation and growth, how international trade functions, and the financial relationship between individuals and the government. This is a more technical and economics-focused class than ECON 115, so don't expect a similar class with a different focus.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes; Take it if you are curious about the economic issues of the world.",
                "Yes. Both professors were very enthusiastic and made class fun, entertaining and a great environment for learning.",
                "Yes. If you want to be an Econ major, you have to take this class. If that's not what you're interested, though, be aware that this class is very dry  it's exactly what it says in the description.",
                "Yes. The course covers most of the key introductory concepts in economics. It is well organized, and the professor works hard to emphasize connections between the material taught at various stages in the course. You will leave with a broad understanding of the macroeconomy, and will feel better prepared to understand ongoing economic happenings.",
                "If you want to study economics or need this course sign up for it. You know exactly what you are signing up for so don't be surprised.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Econ.",
                "I would if you needed to take it or are an econ major. It is a bit much if you just have a cursory interest in econ but its never a bad class.",
                "if u have t o fulfil requirements take it, if not run for the hills",
                "Yes",
                "Yes especially if it is required for your major. If not, I still think it provides useful background on why the world works the way it does.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think the well-organized nature of the course makes it very easy to learn from regardless of whether you think you know economics well or not. The course also teaches a lot of useful things that I think are good for simply better understanding how things work in the world, even if you aren't that interesting in economics specifically.",
                "Whether or not you are considering an Econ major, I recommend this course! It is very interesting and important to entering into conversations on the world economy.",
                "Would recommend if you have an interest in economics, even if it is not a requirement for your major.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. It's a really solid class. The content is interesting (and very applicable to the real world), and it's a lot less mathematical than Econ 115, which I appreciated. The grading is pretty nice: 40% get an A or A- (with slightly more people getting an A- than an A), 50% get a B+, B, or B-, and 10% get a C+ or below. This means it can be a bit hard to get an A, but an A- is very achievable, and it's very unlikely that you'll get below some sort of B. The workload was very manageable. There were some time crunches studying for midterms and finals, of course, but that is to be expected from pretty much any class that has exams. Lastly, the professor and course director were terrific. Prof Tsyvinski was an absolute stud, and he always found a way to make class interesting (such as his famous references to Milton M Magnus III). You can tell he really cared a lot, too. And the course director, Dr Hawkins, was very organized, and he explained concepts very well (get him for section if you can!) The dynamic between the two of them was hilarious, too. Overall, a great class, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're considering taking future econ classes or things related to economic policy like polisci or other social science classes it's a good background to have and it's a manageable amount of challenge even if you're not into econ and don't intend on being an econ major.",
                "Yes, I would, because the professors were fantastic.",
                "Yes, especially with Aleh Tsyvinski and William Hawkins. This course is extremely well organized. The material tested on the midterms are clearly taught in either the lecture, pset, quizzes, or TA sessions so the exams are fair. The material is good for anyone who wants to learn the basics of macroeconomics -- not too much math either just some simple formulas.",
                "Yes",
                "absolutely!",
                "meh. yes if you're econ or glbl (cause have to) and it is applicable to world but notreally interesting",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you want to learn about growth and decision making of the governments and the Fed.",
                "Of course! It's great as an intro course for the major and the course material is quite interesting even for those not in the major or related majors. Would recommend!",
                "Yes, absolutely",
                "I would indeed recommend this class. It is a pre-requisite for economics and a few other majors but regardless should at least get to this class of economics to have a better understanding of how the world works economically.",
                "Yes! Especially if taught by the same team, it is an amazing window into the world and absolutely worth taking.",
                "Yes! the instructor is very engaging, and I personally think the material is very timely and interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Good intro course in Econ.",
                "Absolutely, I would recommend it to any student regardless of their major because it teaches useful ways of thinking and is useful in any job industry.",
                "I would recommend this course to future students. It allows students to develop an understanding of fundamental macroeconomic topics that are useful not only for an economics degree, but for general financial and economic awareness. \r\nAlso, the instructors are careful to present a variety of viewpoints on each topic.",
                "YesI found the content from this course to be relevant and interesting, and liked the professors and the way the course was run.",
                "Yes; If you want to learn about macroeconomics in relation to the real world (more so practically), then take Professor Tsyvinski's course.",
                "Yes, great foundation for macroeconomics.",
                "Yes, swell class",
                "yes",
