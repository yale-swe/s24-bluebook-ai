The journal entries are good and I like that we're able to write about whatever we want to. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Organization. Would really like to see more organization and intention behind the plan for each class. Often felt like classes didn't have much direction. And it can be frustrating to stick so closely to a textbook. I feel like I could be doing most of this on my own if all we're going to do is exercises from a book. More verbal repetition (even if I get it right once doesn't mean I've actually internalized the lesson!) and games or engagement in class would be great. Maybe more consistency with homework, too. Would also maybe like more vocab tests and more simple grammar repetition on the quizzes. \r\n\r\nThe major way that this course could be improved is to hire more faculty for the Hindi language department. Two professors is not enough. Swapna ji and Savita ji are doing far more than their fair share of work."
