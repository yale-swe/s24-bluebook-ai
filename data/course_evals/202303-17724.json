                "Strengths: super fun, many games, professor is super knowledgeable, learned a lot of basic ASL commands\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to get in contact with professor, course expectations (service projects and such) were unclear, quizzes were a bit unexpected",
                "The strengths of this course are its commitment to Deaf space and the incredible work of the professors and broader Yale ASLay / Deaf community. This is a course that thrives because so many people completely buy into it. By remaining silent and engaged in class, by practicing, by attending events, the course grows and accessibility grows throughout campus.",
                "The way vocabulary was presented made it very hard to learn.  We would learn a set of vocab words for a few days and then never use them again.  The quizzes and exams did not reward actually learning vocabulary.  Vocab was often presented using ambiguous pictures instead of words, which made it very unclear what the sign was supposed to mean (for example, does this picture mean \"store\" or \"grocery store?\").  It was also impossible to tell what word we were on if you got lost words should be numbered so you can catch up if you get lost. \r\n\r\nThe material learned in class also did not align with the homework or the quizzes.  We'd be taught different signs in the homework, which made class very confusing.  The quizzes also had many vocab words we never learned in class, which was very frustrating.  The homework, lectures, and exams\\quizzes were all designed by separate entities with seemingly little regard for the material covered by the others.\r\n\r\nASL 1 classes should have an interpreter throughout the entire semester.  Asking questions in class was impossible because the only way to do so was to interrupt the entire class by writing out the question, and if you didn't understand the answer, the professor would have to write it out.  An interpreter needs to be there so students can ask questions.  I rarely knew what was going on in class  an interpreter would have been incredibly helpful for my understanding of the material.  Learning a language is impossible if you can't ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe grading was incredibly ambiguous.  There was often no description of what the assignments were supposed to be.  The attached rubrics were incredibly vague and identical for every assignment, so they were not helpful.  The community engagement requirements were also unclear  I was not aware that they were even required till halfway through the semester.  It was unclear what was required in the journal prompts (how much we needed to write, if we needed to discuss our community engagement for that week, etc).  I frequently had to reach out to clarify and rarely received useful answers.\r\n\r\nWhile it was fascinating learning about deaf culture, exploring this topic in such depth should be reserved for the upper levels of ASL.  I feel like I hardly learned the language; instead, I took a class on deaf culture.  I can't discuss issues relevant to deaf culture if I barely know how to sign.",
                "Near daily meetings helped keep material fresh in the mind, with the quick lessons we had to do keeping us consistently practicing the language.  Its not uncommon of language classes, but deep diving us into only speaking ASL helped really keep me on the ball about trying to understand the language.  The pace of the class was also never too fast; we constantly reviewed previous material, a necessity for a class where it was difficult to review the ASL we've been learning.  That was a drawback to the class; since signs can really only be conveyed via videos and its not really possible to take notes, it was often hard to review the material at home should we need more practice.  This often felt frustrating, especially when trying to prepare for exams or quizzes.  Likewise, a lot of the material for the class seemed to be adapted from another teacher, but it did not always translate well.  Different ASL signers have different accents, and sometimes signs we learned were done completely differently by another person in a quiz.  This made it difficult to always translate them accurately without grasping at straws.  Feedback was also not consistent; we got very few grades back in a reasonable timeframe.  I had no idea how good my signing was, since not of the videos we recorded for a grade were graded before the end of the term."

The assignments were always incredibly vague and she did not communicate the requirements clearly.  Reaching out to clarify was impossible because she doesn't respond to email.  While she is an engaging lecturer, her lack of communication ruined what would have otherwise been a fun class.",
                "I would! Its a good dive into ASL communications if you're interested in that or need to fulfill a foreign language requirement.  The workload is not overbearing for a 1.5 credit class either, so its definitely easy to recommend."
