   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about using Vue.js, Node.js, and other tools that were specific to the project I worked on.",
    "Web Dev",
    "This course was an introduction to the field of digital humanities, most of the skills learned were in web development (Javscript, Node, Vue).",
    "You will receive a crash course in javascript, Node.js, express, and basic web development through the problem sets in this course. That being said, be aware that any and all knowledge you gain from this course is *entirely self-taught.* While Professor Brown said that he would provide resources, the wiki he created was more an aggregation of other resources and extremely high-level overview than anything else. There is virtually no actual teaching that happens during this course; you learn by doing and asking Professor Brown and the TA's questions. YouTube walkthroughs are key for getting through the three problem sets in this class.\r\n\r\nThere was some tie-in to the humanities through this class; Yoni, a TA, led a few classes where we discussed readings about the humanities. However, this always felt very contrived to me and like it was wholly unrelated to the rest of the course.",
    "Learned how to work with Vue.js and Node.js.",
    "The ability to plan a large project and ask for help from the teaching staff during class, which was awesome.",
    "This course gave an introduction to web development with javascript and NodeJS. This is one of the few CS courses in my experience where actual class time is devoted to learning the ins and outs of the code you'll be using for the problem set. In that way it's very refreshing.",
    "Learnt more about Javascript and Web Development especially using the Vue framework. Exposed to some research in the digital humanities and some potential projects.",
    "I gained a general understanding of the process of Web development in terms of the structure of websites and the types of tools available for building them efficiently. I also learned about the emerging field of the Digital Humanities and the types of research questions it intends to address."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: get to work on a big project and focus on that for half the class, great experience and nice thing to put on your github\r\nWeaknesses: some classes were not very interesting when we were not working on the project.",
    "Strength: Lots of latitude to do a project of one's choosing\r\n\r\nWeakness: very little direct guidance or expertise in the teaching course's part (as expected in a project based course)",
    "The psets in the first half of the semester were all about learning web development skills which really helped for the group project in the second half of the semester. We also worked on assignments in class a lot which was great.",
    "This course was advertised as having a very manageable work load. Professor Brown specified multiple times during shopping period that we would have time in class to complete the problem sets and that we would mostly be able to finish the problem sets during class. This was NOT the case, and this class ended up taking WAY more time than expected, especially for someone who had never used Javascript or done web development before. The second half of this course was less work because we were doing a project instead. I really wish the information about the workload had been better advertised during shopping period. The project you work on is quite cool because you will have a real client (a professor or organization) for which you are doing the web development. That aspect alone makes you more invested in the project and you will probably build something cool.\r\n\r\nThis course is not great if all you want to do is learn web development. You basically have to teach yourself, with the help of the TAs during class. It will probably be very time consuming and Professor Brown did not teach so much as facilitate. There were a few instances when he drew examples on the board but that was really it. I would have liked to see more teaching and more structure as to how to complete the problem sets, versus throwing you into Node.js and server-side web development completely unprepared.",
    "Course is a bit disorganized and communication wasn't always clear, but the free form nature of the course wasn't too bad as I was aware of it going into it. Talking about digital humanities issues was really neat, but the other students were not generally willing to engage on the material.",
    "The class doesnt have a lot of technical content prepared to be taught, and the video lectures with Harvard were cool but often hindered by technological issues.",
    "This best part of this course was that there was actual in class time devoted to learning how to program in javascript. One thing that could be improved is the fact that this is taught alongside Harvard. I never found that this helped the course in any way, and it seemed particularly contrived at times. Watching a guest lecture over a webcam can be cool, but most of the time I'd rather have time in class to ask questions relevant to the problem sets and code.",
    "Strengths: Forces you to properly learn web development, if you are interested in this field. Weaknesses: Very self-driven class. Not a lot of introduction to the topics before psets are assigned, so you are often left waddling through the documentation and Stackoverflow to figure out solutions.",
    "The problem sets at the beginning of the semester were manageable, and the course staff gave us time in class to work on them. The final project, though unstructured and not particularly organized, was also of a moderate scale and well-supported with staff input. I would have liked to hear more lectures and do more reading on the Digital Humanities, though, because the class became much more about web development than about that."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would definitely recommend, it was great to work on the project and I especially enjoyed using Vue to do it since I had no experience with it before.",
    "If you have a project that you want to build\/create take it. Don't take it with the expectation that you'll learn Web Development",
    "I would recommend this course because you get to make a pretty cool product for the final project, especially if you have your own idea for it.",
    "I would recommend this course as an elective if you have a decent amount of time to invest. If you can invest more time, you will probably gain useful web development skills. The TA's were quite helpful during class. The project is also really cool, and especially if you already have a humanities-related idea in mind, this is a great place to work on that. That being said, don't expect to learn anything in this class you couldn't learn on your own with a few weeks of intense YouTubing. The problem sets are quite irritating and overall the course is very unstructured. Be prepared for a higher workload than Professor Brown advertises.",
    "This class was amazing. You essentially spend the first half of the semester learning Vue.js and Node.js and the second half working on a final project with a team of 3-5 people, so at the end you'll have something nice to put on your resume! You get what you put it though. Some groups got more out of the class than others. The class is really independent so it's a lot of learning on your own and working with your group on the project.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who was interested in learning more about web development and ok with a less structured class. We spent the majority of our class time working on our psets and projects which made the class not too work intensive but still interesting and I feel like I learned solid web development skills. The guest lectures and the talks about digital humanities were always interesting.",
    "This is a cool, self-driven class. With some structural modifications and better video streaming planning, it would be great.",
    "This is one of the few computer science courses at Yale where you learn the language you need for the problem sets in class. Tons of class time is devoted to just working on problem sets and asking questions. This course offers a good introduction to javascript and web development across three problem sets (intro web page, a simple server, and a nice-looking front-end) and a final group project. I had a little javascript experience coming in and never thought the assignments were too tough, but I'd heard from friends who had no experience with it that the first problem set was a tough learning curve. Once a week the class lasts 2 hours, but often that time was just to work on the problem sets so I thought it was fine. This course was not too much work and it definitely felt practical, a good CS elective.",
    "Yes if you are interested in Web Development and prepared to learn most of it on your own. Tutors and Professor Brown are definitely there to help when consulted but there's not much introduction to the topics and skills required beforehand.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in learning the basics of web development in a setting that won't dominate your semester in the ways that some CS courses will. However, if you're only interested in it because of the Digital Humanities, be wary that the course focuses very little on that side of things."
