                "I have a much greater understanding of 20th century history of both African American history and the history of fascist Europe and postwar Germany. I also have a deeper more contextualized understanding of differing theories and definitions of fascism. I definitely know more about the long and ongoing Civil Rights movement and its notable figures in the 20th century. I also unterstand more about far right-wing movements in pre and post WW2 years.",
                "Throughout this course, I feel that I strongly developed my primary source analysis skills, my historical writing skills, and my ability to interpret academic texts. Most valuable to me, however, was the insight I gained from the rich discussions and robust thought that Professor Duensing, my classmates, and our course material sparked within me. I gained a deeper desire to ask questions and to view history with a critical eye.",
                "I really developed the ability to think historically. By this, I mean to think of how a certain event is caused by another, how the dates in which something occurs reveals its significance, how a certain phenomenon informs contemporary society. This is an important skill in my opinion because it allows a person to understand the broader implications of history on how the world evolves and changes. This is a skill that Anna really worked in honing into us, trying to get us to understand why comprehending the historical narrative of certain systems and processes bolsters our understanding of them.",
                "I got to refine my historical analysis, close reading, and source finding skills. Also, I now have such a better understanding of historical continuity relative to black liberation and fascism, which is so relevant and important now.",
                "It gave me a lot of context into American history, helping me better understand the racial politics and themes that continue to govern modern day politics. A better understanding of America's race history and its lasting repercussions."

                "The Strengths are Anna, she is a great presenter and she designed the course really well. Another strength is is how Anna organized the Zoom course. Three hour sessions on Zoom could have been terrible, but she split the session up into three distinct sections, and utilized the long class periods to do some primary document viewing and analyzing every class. This way we actively practiced like \"historical skills\" when it comes to analyzing and thinking about primary documents.",
                "I loved everything about this course--the structure, the content, the delivery. I genuinely cannot think of any ways that this course could have been improved (other than by being in person, which was obviously not possible). At the forefront of my mind, one of the unique strengths of this course was the intimate and focused environment of having a discussion based class and being able to engage with other people's interpretations of the same text.",
                "This course is fantastic! It helps us engage with complex ideas and read incredible texts. I absolutely loved the format of some lectures, some discussions, and some historical skills.  If I could pinpoint one aspect the course can improve upon is maybe more instruction on primary sources prior to reading them. I felt like a lot of our readings were secondary sources that made a lot of sense but then we would have a primary source that while interesting and engaging, I didn't necessarily know how to engage with it. I didn't know how to understand the context or the angle I should look at it necessarily, so it would've been helpful if primary sources aren't treated the same as primary sources in terms of just part of a reading list but we got some instruction at the end of each class on how to engage with the primary source material assigned for the next time.",
                "It was a great and effective class within the constraints of the fast-paced summer session. I loved the hybrid lecture\/seminar set-up of the course. The lessons were well structured and guided by our work with sources.",
                "It was a lot of reading, but the readings are generally helpful. Otherwise, the workload is not too bad."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I will say, I was taking two classes this summer session, both of which had heavy reading loads, so the reading load for this class felt very large. Also the weekly reading reflections and the daily discussions encourage a pretty focused reading, so you (I at least) couldn't skim through the readings, so there is a required time commitment. It is a really great course to understand the history of Black activism in the 20th century, and of course all of the actual issues that they are concerned about. Also great for having a greater  understanding of fascism and the history of fascism in the world.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student! I truly wish every student could take this class. I think that no matter what your interests are, this course is thoroughly engaging, interesting, and an excellent opportunity to examine history through a less traditional lens. Even beyond content, the environment of the class feels very welcoming and fun to be in. This class was entirely wonderful and I don't think I can even express just how incredible of an experience it was.",
                "Yes I would! I think it's extremely important for other students to be exposed to the kinds of ideas and topics that this course deals with. The readings are engaging and the lectures are amazing. I think it would be worth anyone's time to take a course as intellectually stimulating as this one.",
                "I would definitely recommend to someone who is interested in communist thinking and the Jim Crow laws similarities to Fascism.",
                "Yes; such an important topic with an amazing teacher!",
                "Yes. I think it changed the way I think about politics and Anna is a great teacher who genuinely cares about helping her students. She is also very kind and knowledgable, always offering us additional readings if we are interested in the topic. Very great professor."
