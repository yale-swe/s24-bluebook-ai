                "I learned multiple empirically based psychotherapies ranging from a range of individuals therapies to couples therapy to group therapy. We also watch many record therapy sessions and they were very interesting and informative. The readings were so helpful and by completing the weekly reading responses I was able to compare and contrast different therapies.",

                "I learned a bit about a broad array of therapy techniques and got to see several prominent therapists in action. This course was incredibly helpful for me in deciding whether therapy was something I would be interested in going into as a profession, and if so, what type of therapy.",
                "This was a great overview of therapy styles. More importantly, it was a space for me to consider the complexities of psychotherapy and learn from my peers.",
                "I learnt about many different types of psychotherapy, and learnt how to evaluate each one for advantages and disadvantages. I learnt the core principles in each type of therapy, and how to apply these skills to case interviews presented in the videos. I also gained a new perspective on what psychotherapy can look like, and how creativity and innovation can be used to develop new forms of psychotherapy.",

We also discussed what evidence-based research is in psychotherapy and how people do and should go about determining treatment length. We also discussed multicultural awareness in psychotherapy, and how racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual identities play major roles in determining a treatment plan."

                "As far as I'm concerned, this class had no weaknesses. The class format was great in that we learned a lot in the lecture aspects of the class but were able to then process deeply when we were then asked to respond in homework assignments as well as lead discussions. Overall an amazing course.",
                "Professor O'Brien really figured out how to make the Zoom format engaging.",
                "Strengths: great class discussions, Prof provided valuable input \/ questions. Prof was so kind and thoughtful and the therapy videos we watched as homework were also very interesting --  it was really helpful to see therapy in action! I also found the assignments for this course to be reasonable and do-able. Prof provided very detailed feedback on our homework. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! Maybe would have liked to spend some more 1-1 time with classmates, since they were also so kind and thoughtful. I know in past years that students claimed this course was therapy, and this year it was not. Prof made it clear that it wasn't, and we were able to talk about the therapy patients we watched in video or read about and were in no way forced \/ compelled to share our own struggles \/ history. So it was great, you could say \"I thought the patient might feel....\" if you weren't comfortable sharing your own history in class.",
                "I don't think I can name a weakness! I loved this class and Professor O'brien was great at giving support while pushing me to work hard.",
                "strengths: touches on so many different approaches, the writing assignments give you a chance to apply what you've learned, class discussion is always interesting \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Professor O'brien is absolutely wonderful. She truly cares about her students, and does her best to help you in any way while making sure the material is engaging and that we take away a huge amount of information from the class. Definitely hard to teach a seminar online, but I think the formatting of her course (only weekly responses) was a wonderful idea for a virtual format.",
                "strengths: plenty of time for discussions, engaging mini-lectures, openness to suuggestions",
                "The strengths of this course were the reading materials and videos, which were all very engaging, interesting and allowed me to be exposed to many different perspectives in the field. I also loved the virtual seminar format, which allowed everyone to share their perspectives on the readings and created a safe space for people to share their opinions and listen to others. I also loved the pacing and structure of the course, since many of the ideas and principles that we learnt in the first few weeks helped me more deeply understand principles of other forms of psychotherapy we discussed.",
                "Strengths: This class is so manageable! The syllabus is clear, logical, and the reading responses are a great way to think critically about each form of therapy. Professor O'Brien is one of the most compassionate and caring professors I've ever had. Her appreciation for the course material is infectious!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like the seminar discussions didn't have clear road maps. It was often hard to know which readings or which aspects of the therapy in question we should focus on for a given week.",
                "strengths: the people in the class care about the material and the discussion is often quite interesting and personally rewarding; we cover numerous psychotherapy approaches (one approach last one week or two weeks generally) so we constantly get variety; the reading questions are very helpful in getting you to think about the material and form your own ideas and opinions; so much of this material is immediately relevant to your daily life\r\nweaknesses: none!"

Our Prof also arranged \"mandatory\" office hours, where we reserved a 30 min slot to introduce ourselves to the Prof. This was really a plus for this class, bc I felt like I got to know the Prof better -- this would normally happen informally as people arrived early \/ late to in-person class, but bc this course was on Zoom, the office hours were great to get to know her. \r\n\r\nCould be improved: none.",

                "Discussion was easy due to using the chat function as a queue. Screen sharing during lectures was useful as well.",
                "I loved how engaging the class was even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual seminar format was great for getting people to meet each other and  allowing people to share their perspectives. I also loved the use of break-out rooms, to allow for smaller groups and for deeper opinions to be shared. I also loved the readings and videos that were included, which helped me understand the lectures better and allowed for deep and interesting discussion during the seminars. Speaking up during a Zoom class is difficult, but this course created a safe space for us to feel comfortable sharing our opinions so I felt more comfortable speaking up during Zoom as the class progressed.",

We had the opportunity to practice being a therapist and patient in breakout rooms, and I found this to be a wonderful source of social interaction."

I never thought that I would be given the opportunity to take a psychotherapy class as an undergrad and I'm so grateful to Professor O'Brien for creating this class for us. I loved that all the work that there is (which includes significant weekly response papers) has a clear purpose and Prof O'Brien doesn't assign any busy work. The responses were almost fun because it gave me the space to think deeply about that week's material. Prof O'Brien is also an outstanding teacher and discussion leader while also just being a lovely woman. The discussions that we had were always extremely interesting and engaging partially because we had such rich material to talk about and because everyone genuinely seemed like they wanted to be there. Take this class if you can.",

                "Yes, this course was such a joy to take, probably one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale. The Prof was so kind and thoughtful, I loved our class and looked forward to it every week. The things we learned in class were practical and I found myself trying some things out in my own life after learning about it in class (especially the ACT techniques). The class environment was also so welcoming and I think it brought out the best in my peers. People were considerate to each other, and there wasn't \"that person\" in class that \"always had to share their opinion about X\". Like there wasn't that \"annoying section member\". And that's bc I think our prof set the tone for the discussions with her thoughtfulness and kindness. Like people weren't going to be rude or annoying when the Prof was so obviously caring and nice.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially since mental health is such an important issue during the pandemic and in our lives. This course allowed me to develop a new perspective on the field of psychotherapy and what it can offer, as well as the many different and interesting ways a therapist can tailor a treatment to a patient.",
                "Yes!!! Anyone interested in becoming a therapist, anyone interested in learning more about the practice of therapy, and anyone looking to practice some therapy techniques on yourself! Professor O'Brien makes the material so accessible and enjoyable.",
                "Yes! Any student interested in the field of psychotherapy will love this class. It is well suited for both future therapists and students who simply want to gain an understanding of the field.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.  Even if you aren't planning on working in psychotherapy or psychiatry or even mental health treatment in general, this course has been extremely eye-opening and helpful for my personal life. I have found myself applying some of the techniques we have learned to help myself and to help my friends."
