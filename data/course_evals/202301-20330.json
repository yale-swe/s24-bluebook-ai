                "This course was fun; I enjoyed the social, energetic style in which it was taught. However, the organization of the canvas page was somewhat confusing; the padlet system we used for homework last semester was much better.",
                "Strengths: can be fun, interesting supplementary material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough homework practice to ingrain material, online tests disincentivize actually learning the new vocabulary and concepts, overall could feel too laid back to help you make progress",
                "More work and more speaking",
                "The strength is that of most language classes: daily practice. Unfortunately, this course was very weak in a few important ways. First, its organization: assignments were splattered around many confusing canvas pages which often linked back to each other, and it was painfully easy to miss one by not knowing it existed. Second, enforcement of learning the material: because there was very little work and no in-person examination, most vocabulary just fell through the cracks of everyones mind.",
                "Strengths: similar structure to L1, Professor Orit is generally understanding and will be there to answer questions, amazing TA\r\nWeakness: difficult organization of the class, where it's hard to remember material, low engagement",
                "Overall, I think the class is very good and that we learn a lot over the course of the semester.",
                "The course is very interactive, which keeps students engaged and improves speaking abilities considerably. It could be helpful to better organize the homework to make deadlines more clear for students."
