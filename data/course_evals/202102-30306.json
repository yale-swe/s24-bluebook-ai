                "The course was too dense, and the syllabus was overzealous in attempting to get through all of the content in just 5 weeks. Additionally, the professor may need better Zoom training because the lack of technological fluency often hindered the class' learning. Finally, more participating and check-ins to ensure that the material was correctly being learned and comprehended would've been nice.",
                "I mostly enjoyed the essays we wrote and thought that having students present what they learned in class worked really well. However, I think either the essay prompts needed workshopping or we should have been allowed to choose our prompt (preferably the former so some students wouldn't get stuck with bad prompts). I say this because many of the prompts included phrases that aren't industry standard or are generally meaningless/read like platitudes. For examples: \" value creation of content\" and \"make an impact.\" I found it incredibly difficult to write an essay with these prompts as they guided the writer in a specific direction (other prompts asked the writer to explain what went wrong or why X had such and such impact on Y or why something was an anomaly). This same issue occurred with the debate as the sides didn't feel balanced. For the first debate, I think pro net neutrality is much easier to advocate for than anti-net neutrality. And for the second debate, I think continued role of advertised based programming was much easier to argue for. Also, for the second debate, I didn't really understand why the debate mattered. For the first debate, I can imagine legislators having that conversation and it's an issue of policy. For the second debate, I don't understand why someone would care if cable numbers go up or down compared to streaming's numbers.\r\nIn terms of course content, I thought the class would work better as a seminar. Reading the books and watching the pre-recorded lectures and attending the live (over Zoom) lectures led to many redundancies that could have easily been avoided.",
                "it was very boring. The class was a little misleading in that it had nothing to do with the creative aspect of television and purely a historical account of the development of television.",
                "Interesting material and the videos that were assigned before class were great summaries of the material. Readings were a bit to heavy in the beginning of the class, however.",
                "Need to allow for more student discussion and input. Whether that be during class or through assignments: reading responses, discussion. Anything to promote engagement outside of papers and the debate.",
                "I don't really think this course translates well to a summer semester, let alone online. The amount of content was a bit much, and it seemed like many of my peers didn't really do their due diligence in the assigned reading. The final debate was, in my opinion, not a good decision both because of the online format and also because it seemed to have brought out the worst in some people, since there was some competition for a better grade.",
                "One strength of the course is that the readings were interesting and really well chose. I also liked the recorded lectures as they were very clear. This course could be improved by having a discussion element. We did lots of reading and watched lots of lectures but never really had the opportunity to discuss the readings or share our thoughts.",
                "the course was somewhat slow and the lectures were somewhat long. I think the information was all interesting and useful just sometimes not as engaging."

                "Not really, unless your niche is television I didn't get what I thought I would get out of this course. The topic was very interesting, and there were definitely some highlights. But ultimately, the course structure prohibited me from actually learning anything.",
                "I think this class works best as a fun, lowest priority class for people with otherwise time-consuming and heavy workloads. A week into the class I decided I would devote my energy to the work I found interesting and otherwise spend very little time on the class. This worked really well for me, I wrote two essays I'm really proud of and I didn't spend a lot of time on the debate-a-thon or the out-of-class readings. But I think if you want a really participatory class where everyone shows up prepared and asks engaging questions then this isn't the class for you.",

If you have an interest in what it covers and aren't taking another summer course at the same time, absolutely take it. Otherwise, it would probably be for the best if you take it during the academic year on campus.",
                "Unless you have some type of background on the evolution of TV and enjoy learning about media studies, I would use caution in taking this course because there is a lot of information that you do have to remember.",
                "I would but only because the readings were good and Professor Johnson is really passionate about what he is teaching and really understanding. Otherwise, I would warn students that there isn't a huge element of participation involved and lectures can get a bit exhausting. However, I understand that since this is a summer class lots of info must be covered in a relatively very short amount. of time.",
