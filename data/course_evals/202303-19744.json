                "The extent to which we were given the freedom to explore various mediums was amazing. This class truly encouraged one to let creativity take the reins, and the insights developed were particularly interesting. Through these explorations, one could truly pose more profound questions about the origins of our preferences toward certain mediums. Beyond that, the course was interesting in that it extended my knowledge of myself and how I interact with the world around me.",
                "I learned SO much about how to think creatively and be brave with decisions, how to have fun, how to be a little stupid\/childish and love it, and how to take things less seriously.",
                "As a first semester STEM major it was nice to exercise my creativity through this class. I loved that the prompts were so general and I had the freedom to express myself through them. I enjoyed meeting new people and hearing about their art and learning from their viewpoints.",
                "I learned creativity under restrictions and several hand skills in creating what I made",
                "I learned how to work in group art projects and how to manage my individual art projects in time.",
                "This class felt a lot like a great elementary school art class. I didn't learn much but I was able to make some cool projects. The people I met were also great.",

                "Strengths: Incredible creative freedom, a supportive environment, opportunity for introspection, great professor",
                "Strengths: This is far and away the coolest course at Yale. It's so different, so accessible, and so needed at such a high pressure institution. I had some of the most fun in this class I had that semester. Incredible professor as well. He's a super accomplished artist, an amazing person, and really kind teacher. He leaves you just the right amount of confused after every prompt. And the collaborative projects or the crazy fieldwork and seeing your peers' work! Just such a strong, enjoyable course. Weaknesses: nome.",
                "I enjoyed the fact that this class was challenging a different part of my brain, building things and crafting stories. There was no syllabus, which I thought was alright because I never needed a syllabus. I appreciated the feedback from Professor Carter a lot because we all got to know each other over time and we encouraged each other to make things that are more personal to ourselves. The one weakness is that you never know what your grade is for the class because theres no Canvas page.",
                "the course could be improved with more space and resources for students to create with",
                "Strengths: Professor Carter was amazing. If you have the chance to take his class I highly recommend it because of how nonchalant, nonjudgmental, and interesting Professor Carter was. Even though I would feel as if my art project wasnt the best, his comments would reassure me that it was still art. \r\nBut the best thing was that there was no homework, as we would complete everything  in class, yet we were always welcomed to come back after class to finish a project early.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I cant think of and weaknesses except for maybe that it was a 9am class.",
                "This class had so much potential. The people were awesome, the concept was great, and Professor Carter is cool. But for a Yale course it was disappointing. The materials were so poor that you weren't able to make anything interesting, and the class felt very hastily put together. The presentations Professor Carter gave were really interesting though. I learned about kinds of art I didn't even know existed and I met cool people.",
                "strengths - Professor Carter is extremely nice and helpful; that was by far the best class I took at Yale",
                "Strengths: very open ended which spurred creativity. There was no cookie cutter mold of an perfect assignment, professor was truly amazing so passionate and caring about students health and what they create, professor cares about displaying artwork and appreciates it, very helpful and attentive in class \r\nWeaknesses: 9:00 am. I feel there could be more structure in the sense of having a canvas platform. If you missed a class you would have to wait until the next one to make it up ( if needed ). It would be helpful to have his email available on canvas and to know when there was due dates as well as criteria for assignments. But that may defeat the spur of the moment artwork creation processes\/point of the class.",
                "The course was so much fun!! It was very free-form, and it honestly felt like the sky was the limit when it came to building for assignments. As long as you tried your best and put in meaningful effort , you couldn't go wrong with the creative direction you chose. The course is a great change of pace from the many rigidly structured courses one may have on a day to day basis."

                "Yes, it's a great class to take in their first semester that is relaxing and creative.",
                "Absolutely. Yes. Take it. Starting from day one, the class was so engaging and unlike any other course I'd ever taken. The way Professor Carter encouraged everyone to take their own approach and simply create was so motivating. Not one person during the entirety of the course ever made the same thing as another, and seeing all the different ways everyone approached the task was incredible. I learned so much, not only about art and creativity but also about myself!\r\n\r\n I 100% recommend this course!",
                "ONE HUNDRED TIMES YES. This is the coolest course I think Yale offers. It's a permanent classroom the professor calls the \"clubhouse\" that you get to be endlessly creative in for a semester. And it is SO low stakes. I don't want to spoil projects, but we drew, made shadow puppet shows, built kites, and so many more amazing things. There is so much joy and freedom in this class, and it really impacted how I looked at my first semester. It reminds you not to take things too seriously. By the end, the hallway outside of our classroom looked like a kid's version of the Smithsonian. Stuff hanging from every wall, ceiling, floor, etc. A 6-foot wide cardboard plane that a kid through off the School of Art's roof was suspended from the ceiling. Once in a lifetime.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was so much fun and it was a great break from the usual classes. I got to work on my storytelling and presentation skills without being pressured to do well. Others progressively made their art more expressive. It was all very cool.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has not taken an art course but is even remotely interested in the subject.",
                "Take this class if you can! I loved how this class gave me peace of mind and allowed me to do something artistic. It was nice to not have to worry about a class on top of all of the other coursework you have.",
                "Yes, but know that this class is not as conceptual or interesting as it sounds in the description. Some days I walked away feeling inspired and excited about what I made, but a lot of days felt like a waste of time.",
                "YES, if you have a chance to enroll in this course, just do it! workload is really low and at the same time it is extremely fun class!",
                "100% favorite class taken. It was the only class I would walk to far to and be present for a 9:00 am. It is a great place to unwind and touch to your creative side.  Let your imagination run wild and to be proud of making something amazing with your hands and making a story out of it.",
                "I highly recommend this course! This was the most fun course I've ever taken at Yale. Regardless if you're studying art or not, you will enjoy your time taking this class. Especially as a first year, where you feel like you're always worried about doing everything right, this is one of the very few places where there is no one \"right answer\", and anyone who takes this course can take away something meaningful from it."
