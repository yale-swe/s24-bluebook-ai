                "This course improved my ability to analyze and write about poetry as well as the connections between poetry and other related art forms which may have influenced it. The coolest parts of this course were studying the specific songs and films which influenced particular poems of Ashbery, and drawing conclusions about the nature of poetic influence itself.",
                "I learned to love and appreciate John Ashbery. I learned to think of all arts as interconnected. I learned how to read modernist poetry. I learned how to read poetry. I learned how to appreciate poetry and how to interact with it individually, personally. I learned that creative interactions with texts or concepts are valid and important ways to explore their meanings and truthsthat art and creativity is a type of epistemological method.",
                "I learned how to read John Ashbery's poetry. I learned so much about his life -- what art he liked, what art inspired him, and what it looked like when he engaged with other art in his poetry. It was also such an excellent course in learning how to talk about poetry and how to trust one's own instincts. How to trust one's instincts both about poetry and what to say about it, but also more broadly. We did low-stakes creative projects, the essay assignments were open-ended, and the class discussion always traveled to places that seemed greater than the sum of its parts. Anything that we found fruitful was considered the right direction for our thought -- such a liberating and special thing to find in a course, especially a course filled with artistically inclined students."

                "The course was excellently designed and well  taught. I enjoyed every session a lot. Professor Roffman is a thoughtful teacher and a lovely person. I hope to take another class.",
                "My favorite parts of this course were when we were asked to submit creative assignments inspired by Ashbery or our discussions in some way. These allowed us to very practically examine the nature of artistic influence which we were also tracking within Ashbery's work. The other great strength of this course was that we frequently invited guest speakers; either other poets from the New York School who could talk about our themes, or scholars who could talk about particular films or genres which we were discussing as an influence on Ashbery. These outside perspectives often switched things up in a much needed way for a course focusing on a single poet.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roffman creates one of the most thoughtful and well-constructed syllabuses I've ever seen. The creative projects are fantastic. You have a lot of creative freedom with your essays and final projects, which means you can really have fun with them. Professor Roffman brings in amazing guest speakers and poets, as well. Professor Roffman gives you excellent feedback on your essays, as well. She wrote about 2 whole pages of careful, thoughtful response to my final project, and it was very informative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings are a bit long. Professor Roffman is so brilliant and knows so much about John Ashbery and his life; sometimes I wish she would speak a bit more in class. Though, I do understand that she wanted us to really engage with the readings, and I appreciate that, too.",
                "Strengths: the incredible poems, Professor Roffman's style of guiding class discussion and listening closely\/responding to every comment, the conferences with Prof. Roffman, and the essays and creative assignments! \r\nWeaknesses: we had a lot of guests, which was great, but I wish we'd gotten a little more warning\/scaffolding about who the guests were and why they were coming. I think before the visits started we should've discussed everyone who was coming in the next few weeks. Sometimes I felt a little confused!"

Some elements of the works we study in this course can veer into the 20th century avant-garde, so I would also only recommend this course to the student who feels they have the patience (or appreciation) for that and tracking how those works can help us better understand aesthetics in general.",
