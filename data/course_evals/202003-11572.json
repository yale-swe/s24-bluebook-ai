This allowed students the opportunity to talk about ideas for their papers, collaborate, and get to know each other on a more personal level.

                "I developed an understanding of various modes of writing, from argumentative to narrative to humorous. While this is an essay course, the pieces I wrote were very different stylistically than other essays I'd written in the past. The course gave me practice at reading with the goal of writing, meaning picking up strategies and structures in pieces by strong essayists and finding ways to incorporate those skills into my own writing.",

                "I developed my essay-writing abilities quite a bit throughout this course. As someone who isn't a very avid reader or writer, this class was a great way to be introduced to many great essayists and their works and learn how to use these works as examples for our own essays.",
                "The main skill I learned by taking this course is how to write and clearly communicate your personal experiences to a broader audience as well as analyze them. I think a lot of people would benefit greatly by taking this course. Coming in to it I knew I was a decent writer and I could write what I thought was a nice personal essay. However this course takes your personal writing and analysis skills to the next level. It will teach you not only how to write a clear and thoughtful personal essay, but how to make your writing speak to others. By analyzing your experiences, whether conflicted or straightforward, this course teaches you how to communicate the lessons and beliefs you have developed from your experiences to others. Honestly this may be the most important writing skill in the world. By understanding how to reflect on your own experience and communicate that to others you are setting yourself up for success in interview settings as well as any setting in which you need to convey and find meaning in your experiences. Furthermore, this class also teaches you how to write a variety of different essays including, humor, cultural criticism, and portraying a person and a place. Overall, if you want to learn how to be a great communicator and write a wonderful personal essay speaks to others, take this course. No other course will teach you practical writing skills as much as this one.",
                "In this course, we read many great essays and learned to analyze the tools the authors used to make them great. The skills I most remember are to start with a captivating lead that also asks or hints at the main point and to establish your authorial voice and gain the reader's trust early by showing you're an expert or otherwise have authority in the subject. Another skill I learned from this class was revision  something I didn't do much of before. We also learned about the different categories of modern essays. I didn't even know these categories existed before the class, much less how to write differently for each one.",
                "This class (or the section that I was in?) taught me how to write essays relating to personal experience, mapping a place, profiling a person, commenting on a culture \/ making an argument, and humor. My writing skills improved immensely thanks to the feedback of both my professor and my peers. An insight I developed was how valuable targeted \/ specific feedback can be."

                "Strengths: the essays we read\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Saraceni doesn't turn on gallery mode so she doesn't see you when you raise your hand a lot of the time",
                "I don't think there are any weaknesses. It was amazing. Sometimes the readings were long but thats not a weakness; I'm just lazy. There was such an incredible variety of readings, and prof saraceni absolutely obliterated my rough drafts to the point where I questioned whether or not I belonged in college. That being said, my second (final) drafts were infinitely better than the first ones because of her critiques.",
                "One thing I loved about the course is the syllabus -- the readings were incredibly interesting and engaging, and they all matched up really well to the assignments. I also loved the variety -- it's so fun to dive deep into one area of writing, but then switch gears and read an entirely different type of texts. One thing that I wished we had more of was the in-class workshop time. They were incredibly useful, and if they could've been a little longer I think we might've been able to dive a little deeper into everyone's essays, especially in the weeks where there were 4ish essays to be workshopped.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course are its seminar format and the multiple avenues of feedback available to students in order to improve their pieces. No weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Despite being a virtual seminar, the class was still pretty engaging and it felt comfortable to have discussions as a group. The workload was very manageable and most of the readings were interesting. The only weakness of the class was that some of the readings were too long for the amount of time we spent discussing them in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Saraceni!! She is outstanding, brillant, and charismatic. She came to every class very well prepared and fostered insightful conversation by offering guiding questions and ideas for our discussions. Furthermore, she gives tons of feedback to drafts and is very available to meet and help you succeed in the class. She wants to make you a better writer and if you are willing to put in the time to this course you will get more than you could have imagined out of it. If you are considering taking 120, definitely try and get Saraceni. The readings! The readings for this class serve as great examples to the types of essays you will be writing. Also they are generally short and interesting to read. Readings take about 1 hour between classes and are really enjoyable. They feel like a break from work more than anything.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the essay pacing can feel rushed or quick but as long as you stay ahead and dedicate yourself to revision you will be fine.",
                "The structure of the class was a major strength. We learned about five different categories of essays, spending 2-3 weeks reading and analyzing example essays before writing 1st and 2nd drafts of that essay type. This worked well because it showed us exactly what we needed to pay attention to for this type of essay and then gave us the freedom to play with it. We also each chose two essays to workshop. Getting comments from classmates about my first draft  and discussing them in class, as well as giving comments to others, was really helpful. Prof. Saraceni also gave very thoughtful and useful comments on all of our drafts and I really appreciated the time she put into that. A small area of improvement would be to make sure all the essays the syllabus says are on Canvas are on Canvas.",
                "Strengths: The essay selection is amazing, and the workshops are incredibly helpful in improving one's writing. I also enjoyed that we would split into breakout rooms to discuss essay ideas. The small size of the class was also extremely effective in helping us all get to know each other (and this was a virtual class! I can't imagine what it would've been like in person). You're also given about one-two weeks to write essays that are on average double-spaced, four pages, so the workload is low as well!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really can't think of any unless you're someone who doesn't enjoy writing. Eng 120 is an amazing course, and your skills in writing are guaranteed to improve."

                "The virtual seminar format still allowed for lively discussion. One way that Prof. Saraceni adapted to COVID was making some small asynchronous components to reduce zoom class fatigue. This usually mean meeting with a few students over zoom outside of class. Toward the beginning of the semester, this was really nice because it was also a way to meet everyone in the class and get to know them a little more closely. Toward the end, the out of class meet-ups sometimes felt a little less helpful.",

                "I really enjoyed our short Zoom calls with classmates at first before I knew anyone, but it eventually felt unproductive and unnecessary. I think this was just a byproduct of students feeling frustrated and exhausted by the end of the digital semester, though.",

                "I thought virtual seminars worked surprisingly well, all things considered. If you set your Zoom to gallery view, you could see everyone, and it just felt like we were in class in person. Prof. Saraceni also included time for breakout rooms most classes to discuss our essay ideas or our thoughts on the essays we read. There were also several out of class calls we held with a couple of our classmates to discuss of essay ideas. This plus the discussion based format of the seminars were practices that made this class was very engaging and should be continued in the future. Something that could be improved is that some of the essays we supposed to access from Canvas weren't on Canvas.",
                "Breakout rooms were effective in helping us share, develop, and improve essay ideas with peers. The small size of the seminar is probably what allowed for it to be so effective - we were all able to spend enough time on not only each other's essays but also getting to know each other."

I'd recommend it especially with Prof. Saraceni, who provides ample feedback on every assignment (for all the drafts we got a paragraph of general feedback, a rubric and lots of specific line edits). It's an opportunity to get close feedback on your writing in a small, intimate class setting, while also reading a handful of really great essays.",

                "I was unsure about taking this class because I'm a pretty STEM-forward student and I felt really insecure about my writing prior to taking this class. However, this class really helped me grow in my writing ability and also made me realize that writing can be an enjoyable process. I would highly recommend this as a way to get a writing credit done, as the teaching is great and the feedback you get on each essay helps alleviate a lot of anxiety about what you need to do to get a good grade on an assignment. There are also only 5 short essays throughout the entire semester, so the workload is really light for a WR class, and there are only a few readings per class. Definitely recommend.",

The readings for this course are short and very fun. Also the workload isn't bad and you will come out feeling like a better writer than you could imagine.  However I will say that this isn't a gut writing course. It definitely takes time and attention (the majority of my work every two weekends). But it isn't bad by any standard. This is a great writing course if you really want to improve your writing and don't want to do tons of reading outside of class.",
                "Yes. This is a very well structured class, so you will get something out of it even if you don't love the topics (which most people do end up loving), and no matter what you are majoring in (it's a great way to practice communicating both in writing and verbally). Additionally, we read a variety of essays, and they were all very interesting to read, especially since I believe many people enter the class having not read many essays before. Class discussions and workshops were also fun, especially during COVID when virtual lectures without participation are disengaging.",
