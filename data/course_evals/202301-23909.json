In addition to being able to practice my skills in reading and writing about theory, this class taught me histories of violent systems of power and resistances to such violences.

                "The structure of this class and the readings were fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the readings; we read a number of canonical works and I learned so much. Professor Pelia was very skilled at guiding the discussion and asked great questions. He was responsive to student needs and was very helpful in office hours. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Enjoyed this",
                "Strengths were that it was a very openly run class that went off of the students and how they engaged with the material, allowing for rich and more natural conversations. Weakness would be that some of the texts were a bit dry or repetitive, leaving very little to discuss in the larger context of exploitation and revolt.",
                "I liked how we switched groups for discussion responses. It helped make the workload more manageable especially because the readings were pretty long.",
                "I think that conversation in the seminar was very dynamic, and I appreciated the small setting. I think that having discussion questions or guiding prompts while reading would have allowed for more effective conversation though.",
                "The syllabus was incredibly thoughtfully crafted and assignments were designed to facilitate individual student exploration and deep engagement with course ideas.",
                "I appreciate the space to do close analysis of radical tradition and theory. Rather than having such theory summarized for me, I valued the ability to go right to the source and unpack the original writers' words with my classmates. I also appreciate the form of the final paper, which could have been either been a theoretical or historical/analytical paper. For the latter, we'd choose an archival or cultural object and for both options we had to use at least 3-5 texts from the course to ground our thinking throughout the paper. A strength of this class is that it does not understand its students as passive absorbers of history, but rather as thinkers alongside the radical theorists we were reading. I appreciated the space of the final paper to ground my own thoughts and experiences in what we'd read."

                "Yes, I think it is a great class that offers great insights into 19th-century history that is not completely centered around Europe and a great seminar-based class",
                "Yes! This is a great class for anyone looking to learn more about this topic and it's a very welcoming environment for those who may not be very familiar for these types of texts or political theory in general.",
                "Yes. Great course with a manageable workload. The readings are just pretty long and dense sometimes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student in the ERM department; however, it would not be a suitable course for general science majors hoping to take a Humanities credit.",
                "Absolutely!! I loved this class so much. The readings were manageable and so well selected. Discussions were lead incredibly well.",

For some classes, Damanpreet would include forms of information outside standard readings and theory (including videos and songs) which helped me better engage with the material. I partially took this class to practice analyzing theory, and Damanpreet always helped guide our readings with great care, patience, and expansive context/background. Damanpreet also definitely organized the class to be very discussion-based so that we were all learning from each other rather than promoting teacher-student hierarchies. Deeply appreciated his form of teaching! Office hours was also very helpful and I deeply appreciated the feedback I got throughout the writing process for my final paper. Huge thank you!"
