The projects were a lot of fun and I feel like I learned a lot through these projects while enjoy creating and presenting them. The course could be improved by having clearer uses of specific grammar structures and more in class practice of these specific structures.",

                "Strengths: We did not do so much memorization and repetition, but could apply our L1 and L2 knowledge to real world examples and stories by Spanish poets and authors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was hoping we could focus more on practical Spanish (directions, ordering food, navigating in an airport), but most of our classroom discussions were focused on texts & ideas, not situations.",
                "More diversity in exercises and grammar practice",
                "A few strengths were the smaller class setting which fostered more connections between classmates as well as the teacher.  I also enjoyed the casual and conversational aspect. I liked that the class had more creative projects as opposed to being heavily test based. I also enjoyed having one asynchronous class a week. The only weakness was that the projects were not well dispersed towards the end."

The workload is very manageable and for this reason, prioritizes class participation and conversation over memorization and examinations.",

The units and topics we learned were well-structured and the variety of assignments and projects allowed for us to be tested and challenged in different ways.  The close class setting combined with the excellent learning environment was an optimal course setting.",
