                "More diversity in exercises and grammar practice",
                "A few strengths were the smaller class setting which fostered more connections between classmates as well as the teacher.  I also enjoyed the casual and conversational aspect. I liked that the class had more creative projects as opposed to being heavily test based. I also enjoyed having one asynchronous class a week. The only weakness was that the projects were not well dispersed towards the end."

The workload is very manageable and for this reason, prioritizes class participation and conversation over memorization and examinations.",
