    "Learned the nuances of trade theory and addendums",
    "A well-crafted, introductory look at trade economics that spans a collection of important and interesting material not covered in microeconomics and macroeconomics intro\/intermediate courses at Yale.",
    "I've deepened my perception of international economics and international finance through this course. It's filled with knowledge, relative phenomenon and the viewpoints from different scholars. Really good course.",
    "International trade and many views of different scholars from different perspectives. The issue about brexit, financial crises, capital controls of China and other countries such as Chile. I learnt to think independently and read materials then make a presentation about it.",
    "In this course, I learned about global financial crises and international trade. I developed an understanding of several historical examples of such topics, and I improved my ability to apply economic theory to real-world economic policies.",
    "I think that the most important tool this course gave me, is developing a critical eye when reading papers. I learnt much about international economics. I will definitely use every skill I learnt."

   "comments": [
    "Passionate professor allowed for engaging lectures",
    "It's so informative and brings me back to the base of international economics as well ass the frontier of research. I like it so much.",
    "Strength is that professor Ramirez is brilliant and encourages us to engage and express our our opinions. The class is small so that we can engage a lot.",
    "Strengths of this course included diverse readings and classroom discussions. I believe it would have been beneficial for students to have had more time to meet during office hours in order to discuss homework assignments before due dates, although this lack of time is likely attributed to the accelerated pace of the summer session.",
    "I don't think this course had any weaknesses. The readings were just enough to manage with the time we were given. The papers had very clear instructions. Personally, this was my favorite course."

    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was interesting and intellectually engaging. Given the current political climate in the U.S., I felt that the topics covered in this course were particularly timely.",
