                "A tremendous strength of this course was the small classroom setting. My section only had about 4-5 students regularly show up, and I was only ever the only person at office hours. Without the ability to randomly ask questions (one could never in a large lecture) and get one-on-one help, I don't think I would have made it through. This could be a weakness, though, where the responsibility is on the students to self-direct their learning and know what questions to ask. Another weakness is that, compared to ENAS 151, MATH 120 is significantly more difficult, meaning that students who can take both often compare workload and exam styles, and every single MATH 120 student I've spoken to feels cheated out of an easier class experience had they took ENAS 151. Having to memorize all formulas, theorems, and trig identities for exams is an extremely different environment than having take-home or open-note exams. I feel like MATH 120 students should have more leniency in this regard; make learning math about the art and skill, rather than rote memorization/computation.",
                "I feel like the teaching quality could really range depending on what section leader you have; i feel like finding ways to equalize that would be crucial.",
                "I think this course failed to accurately and fairly assess us.  The problem set questions were very different than the questions we would see on tests, and tests felt like they were designed to trick us rather than seeing if we could properly use the theorems and techniques taught in class.",
                "The course resources are its strongest asset to learning. The online videos, review sessions, ximera page, practice exams, amongst other resources provided ample means of properly learning the content.",
                "I think that longer class periods and a non-flipped style of class would have improved the learning process."

                "I would not recommend this course unless (i) you have a background in and a strong interest/self-motivation to learn multivariable calc, or (ii) you have to take it as a major requirement (and even then, I'd recommend ENAS 151 unless the desire is really there to go through something so HARD, albeit valuable). I am glad I learned the visualization skills I did, but spending 10+ hours on the pset every week only to have them count for so little of the grade, spending hours watching the videos and taking notes before class, spending hours a week in class and office hours, and then the hours studying for exams is so exhausting, it makes math burdensome. Some serious personal fulfillment is really the only way to get through and enjoy it.",
                "Yes, it's really interesting.",
                "No, I really did not enjoy the way this class was taught.  I felt like I understood the material watching the preclass videos but then I would leave class feeling confused and uncertain about what I learned",
