                "This is an excellent class in which to learn the process of writing history. As Yale does not have a methods course for history, this class is most clear and concise insight I've received in 4 years on how a historian should work. You learn how to move from a general interest in a topic, to exploring the secondary literature, to diving into a historiography, to exploring primary sources and writing a full paper. \r\n\r\nI also learned a ton about the historiography of piracy and piracy suppression, which was fascinating.",

The material is also fascinating. Additionally, the students who want to take a pirates class are more fun than your average history seminar! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! Personal preference on my part is that I don't always love historiography work, and this is a lot of that, but the course did teach me to appreciate it more.",

If you like pirates, well then let me say no more. Even if you haven't walked further down the plank of fascination with piracy than Pirates of the Caribbean, this class is still amazing. The class teaches you so much about maritime history, legal history, and imperial history. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, this class is the best way to learn how to do the hard work of studying and writing history, particularly since Yale does not have a history methods class. Prof. Benton is a great teacher, and you could not do better than taking her class.",

                "Do not take this class if you are not interested in maritime law. That should seem obvious, but the disclaimer is nice. I loved the class, the professor was passionate and excited to teach, the piracy content was fascinating, but there required context that I was not particularly excited about. I think this was the root of my downfall in this class. Because of my disinterest in the context, I am literally dreading checking my grade."
