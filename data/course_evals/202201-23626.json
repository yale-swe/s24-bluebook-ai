This design is very innovative and somewhat resembles the workflow of a real research project.\r\nHowever, the labs could have been more efficient, since there was a large amount of waiting in each lab session. It was not infrequent that the lab ran over 4hrs.",
                "Very interactive course focused on a singular project throughout the course. It could be a little disorganized at times, but that's also the nature of lab work.",
                "Strengths: Professor Moreno is a great Professor and the TAs were also really good in helping students understand what to do for the lab.\r\nWeaknesses: We never had any formal syllabus with the assignments we needed to do. This would have helped me organize my time and create a timeline for the course but at the same time Professor Moreno was mindful with the deadlines so this was not a big problem!\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Professor Moreno would have taken more time to explain the science behind the protocols and reagents we were using because many times no one understood what we were using which made the class less enjoyable.",
                "This course was a great introduction to working in a molecular biology lab and I think techniques were taught well. I think it could be improved by spending more time to make sure we really understood the background of the project we were working on and how to improve our scientific writing."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to do research in biology and hasn't been in a lab before. Having recently started working in a lab, I've been using almost all of the same techniques I learned in this course which has made me much more comfortable. I somewhat lost interest in the specific research topic we were studying (blossom-end rot disease in tomatoes), which may be why I did not enjoy writing the research paper, but I think it did teach me some useful scientific writing skills."
