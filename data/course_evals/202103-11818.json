You will experience truly phenomenal improvement as a writer under Cazs tutelage no matter what your starting point is.",

Its also about learning how other writers think, reflecting on what I can learn from their writing, and getting to know them as talented, interested humans.\r\n\r\nPeople were very direct about giving critical feedback. It was somewhat stressful during the workshops, but ultimately it was very rewarding and helped me improve my stories.",
                "It's like many other creative writing workshops. Pieces are workshopped every week and edits are due two weeks after your workshop. Only real weakness I can think of is that the turnaround time for writing comments on pieces was quite short, only a day and a half, which made it hard to provide comprehensive feedback, especially if that day just happened to be busy. Might be better to have a longer period for that.",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes. Caz has given some of the most helpful feedback Ive ever received in a creative writing course at Yale, and combined with his British-isms like calling us you lot, my time in the course was delightful.",
                "Yes! 100 percent! Such a good class, it has always been highly recommended to me and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in writing fiction -- even if you don't have much experience doing so.",
                "Wholeheartedly. If you get into this class, or anything with Caz for that matter, you have to take it. He is one of a kind. This workshop is so rewarding - there is nothing more special than having your work dissected and improved by a table full of awesome Yale writers as well as one of the most accomplished moderators\/editors\/writers you will find in the department.",
                "Absolutely!!! Take it with Caz, he is so cool and builds lasting connections with each student in the class.",
