                "A plethora of fluid dynamic principles",
                "I learned many fundamental equations\/concepts of fluid dynamics including Navier Stokes, boundary layer flow, pipe flow, energy equations, momentum, basic compressible flow, and rocket nozzles. I have already been able to apply a lot of what I have learned in my clubs. I have been able to develop better intuition about fluid flow systems",

Although not always easy to understand during lecture, I was able to really improve my ability to break material down and work to understand it over a longer period of time to prepare as best as I could for the exam.",
                "The majority of the course was centered around the Navier-Stokes equations, which we used to analyze a number of problems, including flow in pipes, channels, and around objects. We learned how to analyze fluid mechanical systems using control-volume analysis, and we learned about compressible flow; for both, it helped to have already taken thermodynamics.\r\nWe also had a unit on dimensional analysis (the Buckingham Pi Theorem), where you can make inferences about equations just based on the units of the variables. That was my favorite part of the class, and totally unlike anything Id ever done before.",

            "comments": [
                "This course seems well organized and the amount of material covered was perfect for the semester.",
                "Strengths: TAs and TFs are really helpful with problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses: Derivations get really busy and can be really confusing. Practice exams tested material different from lecture which was different from the problem sets. Exam questions could be similar to any of the three or completely different.",
                "Professor Smooke is a good lecturer and his powerpoint slides are fairly easy to follow. I like the videos he shows in class. I would've liked having the lecture slides posted after each class, instead of right before the exams. The course could also be improved by having office hours for the pset even during exam weeks. During exam weeks, we still had psets, but because the TA\/ULAs had spent time proctoring the exam, they weren't able to hold office hours, which made it hard to do well on that pset and really learn the new material.",
                "more office hours",
                "Posting lecture videos and notes before exams was helpful for reviewing. The derivations were often complex and difficult to determine how they're used in the real world.",
                "I enjoy the way this class is lectured, and the frequency of the exams. It helps split the material onto manageable loads to study for the exams, and having the class end before reading period was helpful!",
                "Class was very hard. Teacher was very accommodating",
                "This course was well designed to facilitate student learning. Homework problems generally informed topics covered on exams, and lectures were clear. One weakness of the course was the lack of official class notes. Professor Smooke lectures quickly but did not make any official write up of notes available online in case we missed something in lecture or were out sick.",
                "Professor Smooke is entertaining and shares great stories during class time. Generally, he explains topics very well, but often just reads off his slides. In his defense, his slides are very informative and well-made. I didn't love having a spontaneous extra class on Friday from time to time. The homework assigned often did not align well with class and exam content. The exams were mostly very fair and aligned with class content and practice exams.",
                "The strengths of this course are the TAs, the professor, and your peers in the class. It could be improved with more example problems before the exams. Nonetheless, making students take notes instead of sending them out before class is a great idea.",
                "Course material was taught well and office hours were helpful. The homework schedule was too tight, though, and made it so that every break had a homework over it and every exam had a full homework due directly before and after it.",
                "Strengths: I thought that the grading and testing policies in the course were pretty good. The weekly problem sets usually roughly pertained to what we were covering in lecture and the grading was largely pretty lenient on these. We then had 4 non-cummulative midterm exams which successfully distributed the stress across the semester. Weaknesses = In general, I thought the course was well taught, but could have perhaps been more engaging at time. Prof. Smooke actually did a great job with this for much of the semester with videos and tangents throughout the presentations, but there were some drier spells that could use more real-world applications.",
                "The structure of the course with the 4 midterms, posted slides and recordings as well as the materials provided were helpful in promoting learning. The lectures themselves, however, were often quite confusing and unrelated to the content.",
                "The main weakness was that there were no breaks from psets on exam weeks. Beyond this, however, the course had many strengths: Prof. Smooke brings a relaxed and positive energy to the classroom, readily answers questions, and makes the material accessible for those who can't make it to class. I also really appreciated the exam schedule; our last exam was during the last week of classes, which relieved a lot of stress for me during reading period. Another strength is that Prof. Smooke incorporates plenty of real-world examples into his lectures as a constant reminder of the importance and relevance of the material which breaks up lectures and keeps things interesting.",
                "The workload is manageable, there are plenty of resources if you are stuck and the professor and TAs were approachable and helpful. The material was quite boring at times but theres nothing you can do about that.",
                "Strengths\r\n- I liked the side by side lecture slides and doing out the notes on the white board. I took a class with Professor Smooke in the past where it was online so he just read through the slides which I found difficult to learn from. Writing on the board forces us to slow down for questions and makes it easier both to write the notes and absorb the information. I was able to see his talent as a professor much better this semester than in the past \r\n- Real applications of what we're working on incorporated into the lectures. Professor Smooke often shows videos from films or tells stories about relevant stuff which helps to break up the hour and a half of long differential equation proofs\r\n- I liked how the course was broken into 4 smaller exams as opposed to a midterm and a final. It made sure I had to solidify my understanding of everything more often\r\n- Good resources in case you missed class or want to review: posted recorded lectures which are more difficult to follow but helpful to have to review\r\n- Professor Smooke is clear about the contents and nature of each exam (more proof based vs math based)\r\n- Professor Smooke changed his recorded lecture policy from last year such that he only posted the recorded lectures for the week at the end of the week. I think this accomplished its purpose of getting people to come to class\r\n- Fair grading\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Problem set questions could better reflect the exams\r\n- Class could include more example problems. A lot of the time it was Professor Smooke deriving some equation and then we just applied it in the homework. However, I think it would be beneficial to see him solve problems in real time, using the equations he derives",
                "The course was well run overall. I think more practice problems given before tests would be very helpful.",
                "This course is well structured in that the content is very easy to follow and moves at a pace where one does not get lost but also does not grow bored. In the future, a stronger correlation between pset problems and class lecture examples may be beneficial.",
                "Strengths: very straightforward format, nothing really hit you out of left field. Just be consistent with homework and studying, and you'll do great. Problem sets (mostly) reflected in-class material, though there are some that require you to look through the textbook for the right equation, but nothing too egregious, and tests follow pset and notes. Tying the material together with historical events and applications was a nice touch! \r\nWeaknesses: not the most engaging class when it comes to lecture notes, but with a topic as dense and heavy as fluid mechanics, it is what it is. Some pset questions also require a good amount of going through the textbook for the right equation that wasn't covered in class. Be sure to go over notes for the tests and not just the psets.",
                "I think it would be helpful to have the slides and a formula sheet for the exam about a week and half in advance. I enjoyed the lecture structure including the videos and slides showing how the stuff we were learning in class is actually applied. I think the lectures were organized. Some topics that showed up in the homework were not introduced in class though.",
                "Major strengths of this course include the fact that along with in-person lectures, Dr. Smooke always posted videos of the lectures online and throughout the course he tried to ground the material in fun and relevant stories\/history. I also really appreciated the non-cumulative nature of the exams as it allowed for a focus on the most recent material when studying. A weakness of the course was that I felt as if the material presented on the exams did not match up with the style or difficulty of examples done in class, on the homework, or on the practice exams, in this way I often felt unprepared for the exams even though I had done everything that I could to study. Along with this, the answer keys to the exams were never posted and it was often difficult to learn from past mistakes.",
                "It was helpful that lectures were organized and followed the book because it made it much easier for me to study on my own when I needed more time with the material than just lecture time. In other classes I often find it difficult to read the textbook and connect that to the information we learn in lectures. \r\n\r\nI think a weakness is that we were given formula sheets on the exam, but the equations were not the forms of equations we had in the book and I wasn't used to seeing them in that form. This was especially problematic on the first midterm, when we were given a practice exam and formula sheet the morning of the exam, so I didn't have enough time to understand the practice problems and the formula sheet and ask questions. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness is that I didn't think there were enough office hours because they were often scheduled at times when I could not make it. I sometimes emailed the TAs and asked if they could meet with me another time, but I didn't do this as many times as I'd like because the extra time and mental energy it took was somewhat of a barrier. Another issue is that even if I emailed the TAs, they didn't always reply if it was during a busy time, or replies felt a little slow.\r\n\r\nI also found the lecture format to be difficult to keep up with. Math-based lectures are terrifying because everything is cumulative, and if you don't grasp a concept fast enough you have to sit through 2 hours of not understanding anything. Although Professor Smooke would stop and ask us if we had questions, simply asking if students have questions doesn't ensure everyone is following. There were many times when I felt like I couldn't quite keep up with the lecture, but I couldn't ask a question because I didn't have anything clearer than \"This doesn't make sense and I can't keep up,\" and if I actually made the class stop every time I didn't understand something we would never cover all the material in the allotted lecture time. I think it might be better to have shorter but more frequent lectures. This way students that are struggling to keep up can spend a little extra time to understand the new material before building on it without slowing down the rest of the class. It also makes the mental effort of following a difficult lecture somewhat easier when you know the lecture won't be too long.",
                "Strengths: I thought Professor Smooke was a pretty good lecturer, and I really liked that he kept the class interesting with stories and videos. I thought the exams were very reasonableI particularly appreciated that he gave us a nice equation sheet on the exams, and that we knew the exams would only use equations that were on the sheet.\r\nWeaknesses: Especially towards the later part of the semester, some of the homework problems were relatively unconnected to the material wed learned in class, and they required us to hunt through the textbook to find the right equations to use. This was frustrating, and I think it could have been improved either by choosing questions more related to classwork, or even just by explicitly telling us that the homework was designed to expose us to new things and require us to learn new equations. I liked the format of four midterms and no final, but I wish the exams could have been during class, since the werent longer than a class period. I also wish that we hadnt had problem sets during weeks with exams, or at least that those problem sets could have been much shorter than normal.",
                "I think that the instructor is amazing and inspires students with the presented videos. Additionally, the slides are extremely well done and provide the student with a good understanding of the material."

                "Yes, it's a good course. There are a lot of psets though, as even during exam weeks there's a pset. Most of the psets aren't too bad time-wise, but a few have a really time-consuming problem or two.",
                "Only take this class if you have to",
                "I would recommend this course if you are required to take it or can take it as an elective! Smooke is awesome!",
                "If youre down for 4 exams that are very hard",
                "I would recommend this course. If you have to take fluid mechanics, this course will give you a good foundation and isnt just a dry theory course.  Exams are difficult but doable and the homework is not overly time consuming.",
                "If you are interested in physics and math, take fluid mechanics. But I know most people are taking it for the requirement. Regardless, if you're taking this class with Smooke, it'll be very manageable and you will learn a lot.",
                "If you are a mechanical engineering major, you must take it. If you're not and simply want to use fluid mechanics principles in your research, then I wholeheartedly recommend it. I took it as an elective, and I'm looking forward to its further applications.",
                "If you're taking this course, it's probably required.",
                "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course for any student since it could be overwhelming for non-STEM students and definitely requires a strong background in math, but in general, I would recommend this course. I do think that most people are taking it because it is a major requirement, but I don't think it is crazy to suggest this class to a student who is interested in the subject even if it isn't a major requirement.",

Prof. Smooke is definitely one of the best STEM professors I've encountered at Yale, and I learned a lot from this class. I appreciated its computationally-oriented nature, as opposed to other more theoretical classes I've taken for the major.",
                "If you need to or want to understand fluid dynamics then take the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend it if you're an engineer; the material is fascinating and fundamental. Furthermore, Professor Smooke is excellent. Otherwise, there isn't much point and it's not the kind of class to take for a QR credit. Could be good if you're interested in aeronautics or thermodynamics",
                "Yes, this class is quite challenging but can be very interesting to anyone going into engineering.",
                "For those who have to take it, I would not stress as it is not as bad as the concept of fluid mechanics generally is perceived. For those considering taking it out of their own will, I would say it is an alright entrance into the world of fluids, although it does seem to stay basic and not explore the various fields fluid mechanics branches out into. If this sounds like a good trial run, then I would definitely recommend trying it.",
                "If you're at all interested in fluid mechanics (whether for engineering or simulation or even for fun), it's a great class! Fluid mechanics is seen as a very difficult and notorious class\/subject for how crazy convoluted it gets, but this class is a nice introduction into the basics of fluids in a straightforward, digestible manner. The math and derivations might not be very exciting by itself, but professor Smooke is a good speaker and lecturer.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in the topic. The professor was good, but some of the content was difficult to grasp.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who has previous experience in similar topics as the content is difficult to pick-up and understand without having been previously exposed. Although there are components of the course that are grounded in real-life applications because it is mostly theoretical, I would say that students interested in the theory aspect are predominantly the ones who should take this course.",
                "It depends on what youre looking for, but in any case, Id say its not a bad class. Going in, I wasnt particularly excited about the subject material (I was taking this as a MechE requirement), and as a result I found the material a little drybut I dont blame Professor Smooke for that at all. I think its a result of the material requiring lots of derivation, and Professor Smooke helped keep things interesting with stories and connections to the real world. If youre interested in fluid mechanics, I think youll enjoy this class.",
                "I would definitely take this as an elective if you are BME. If you are ME then you need to take but it is a good course if taken with Smooke."
