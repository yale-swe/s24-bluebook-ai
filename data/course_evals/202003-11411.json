                "I gained knowledge about the ways in which various academic fields can converge around the topic of urban spaces. By reading academic essays from sociologists, urban scholars, historians, art historians, etc., we learned how different fields approached the academic essay differently, as well as how we could use the techniques that we observed in these essays to our own writing. \r\n\r\nOver the course of the semester, I developed the ability to analyze and critique my own objectively, and to edit with clarity and coherent structure in mind. \r\n\r\nPerhaps most importantly, though, the professor's extensive and constructive feedback gave me valuable insights into my own writing process and style. As the professor walked the students through the process of outlining, drafting, and revising the essay, I learned that my first drafts could often be quite chaotic, even if I had developed a full outline. I also learned that my first drafts tended to be less concrete than I would have liked them to be. The professor provided us with myriad techniques to resolve these problems, such as the \"reverse outline test.\"",
                "I greatly improved my writing skills, specifically in evidence-based argumentative writing. I also learned a lot about cities, city planning, and racial divides in cities.",

I wrote and received valuable feedback on multiple essays of different kinds - close reading, source comparison, independent research, and a personal essay. Every assignment is exhaustively reviewed by the professor and often by other students, providing me with detailed feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of my writing. I also learned how to access and utilize university writing resources (Poorvu Center, writing partners, personal librarians).\r\nBesides the writing component, I learned a lot about city life and the way academic and popular literature deal with cities and urbanism in different contexts.",

                "I liked how we had the opportunity to receive lots of feedback on our written work from different people and think that was a useful exercise. I also appreciate all of the class handouts we received with suggestions on formatting and ways to take our writing to the next level. I liked the Essay 3 that we did but wish it could have been a bit shorter of an assignment so we would have had time to explore other topics instead of focusing on that for almost two months.",
                "Overall, the course was strong. Professor Newton is engaging and the overall topic of the course was interesting. For our sub-units, I wish we had spent more time exploring the topics, but since the subtopics themselves could be entirely devoted to a whole semester course, it makes sense why we only covered the basics. On the writing front, Professor Newton makes it clear what she wants and what you need to improve on in her comments, but I wish we could have received comments more frequently from her while writing our papers (ex. during rough drafts).",
                "The major strength of the course is definitely the thorough feedback from the instructor in every assignment, helping you identify areas to work on. A weakness is the timing of the essays: we only had one week to work on essay 1, while we had over a month to work on essay 3. I think the syllabus should be modified to reflect the challenges in adapting to college-level essay writing.",
                "A strength for this course is the strive for perfection shown by everyone in the class.  Everyone legitimately cared about the improvement in their writing, and I was very impressed and happy to see this.  One weakness were some of the brief in-class free writes.  We usually only had about 5 minutes to write something, which I felt was inadequate to put together strong thoughts.",
                "A major strength of this course was the small number of students. Anyone who wanted to contribute to the discussion had the opportunity to. Another strength was the selection of interesting essays from a diverse array of fields. The professor also gave great feedback, and held regular office hours that I found very helpful. \r\n\r\nThere were very few course weaknesses, and the weaknesses that I did note seemed to be a result of the changes to the learning environment that COVID-19 has precipitated. In particular, because I learn better when I write things down, I feel like there could have been more written activities. The course packet consisted only of the readings, but I wish that the activities handouts (as well as some general reference handouts about essay structure, writing style, etc.) had also been included. \r\n\r\nI also wish that the creative writing unit, which existed in previous semesters but was cut this semester, had been retained. However, I recognize that time constraints prevented this.",
                "Provided very useful feedback on writing and showed tangible improvements in writing skills over the course of the semester. Because of the online format, discussions were sometimes awkward and dominated by a few voices.",
                "Strengths: good for writing improvement, highly structured assignments with feedback at multiple stages, small and focused discussions, interesting and diverse reading list. \r\nWeaknesses: discussions weren't very lively due to subject material, creative project towards the end felt rather disconnected.\r\nImprovements: more short exercises to practice specific writing skills, more guest speakers!",
                "Strengths:\r\n1) There is an excellent structure that guides students through the learning, with each stage and each assignment guiding the student along the process of how to write an academic essay. The deadlines for the course are also well spaced-out, with nothing feeling too rushed and the work evenly balanced. \r\n2) The earlier assignments have a far lower weight than the later ones, allowing students' grades to reflect the feedback they've incorporated and skills they've picked up as the course progressed.\r\n3) Professor Newton. The best thing about this class, she took no time at all to get to know the student and understand the specific guidance and input that each individual's writing required. Her feedback on essays is also particularly detailed and helpful. \r\n4) The class is divided into multiple units, each based on a different theme. This allows students to understand multiple features and aspects of cities. \r\n5) The size of the class was just right: we were able to interact with each individual at length on at least one occasion and get a sense of each other's strengths and weaknesses as writers. Through peer-reviewing others' papers and watching creative project presentations, we were given a brief but meaningful understanding of many urban issues we might not otherwise have heard about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1) Class discussions can occasionally become too centred around American cities, particularly New York. \r\n2) There could be a slightly wider range of ideologies and perspectives reflected in the assigned readings on cities. While I happened to agree with most of the authors that we were introduced to, it would have been interesting also to be exposed to opposite views."

I would recommend that these be used more frequently, as these are the closest available substitute for the casual discussions about the material that might have taken place before and after class.\r\n-Using Canvas' collaborations feature offered a decent substitute to a physical whiteboard on which class notes could be taken. The only suggestion I would offer would be to use two or three separate documents, as the single one became rather long and unwieldy. \r\n-The class handout documents (which would ordinarily have been physical sheets of paper) were well organised into different folders and easily accessible whenever they were needed\r\n-I appreciated that the class kept zoom chat open even between two students, allowing for some casual interactions to take place despite the physical restrictions. \r\n-The frequent use of breakout rooms was an excellent way both to get individualised attention on our work from peers and to build a rapport as a class."

If you are solely interested in the Modern Metropolis, I wouldn't take this course, as it has that topic focus but is more focused on writing-- other more in-depth courses are the way to go. If you are interested in both the Modern Metropolis and improving your writing, take this course.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would recommend it in particular to students who, like me, had minimal experience with writing essays in high school. This is a great foundational course in clear and effective writing, and it also gives students valuable insights into their own writing processes. Because there are only really three essays (under the COVID-19 adjusted curriculum), any student who hopes to improve their writing through this course should be willing to engage consistently and deeply with the assignments. Also, you by no means have to live in a city to get something out of this course, but it certainly helps if you find them fascinating.",

This course is also a good place to start if you've never taken a seminar before, as the reading isn't terribly intensive so you can really get a feel for what seminar discussions are like without having to go through extensive preparation for them. I came in to this course not expecting very much from it and it turned out to be one of the highlights of my first semester. The material was engaging and interesting, the professor was really committed, and I feel much more confident about my writing abilities as I move forward.",
