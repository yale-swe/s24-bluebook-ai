I also learned about how firms can exercise more market power with various pricing tools such as two-part tariffs.",

Learned about monopoly, price discrimination, durable goods, oligopoly, product differentiation, strategic investment, mergers, information, and auctions. Note, this is a class that is about using economic theory to model the behavior of firms and competition in markets."

                "Prof Haile does a decent job explaining things but sometimes goes too quickly. All the lectures are very fast paced.",
                "The material is quite difficult but Prof. Haile tries his best to explain things as clearly as possible. I think this class would benefit from a discussion section seeing as the problem sets can be quite involved and much more advanced than material discussed in lecture.",
                "Lectures were detailed. Professor Haile was fairly engaging. Material was very interesting given my interest in competition and anti trust policy.",
                "Interesting models. The pace of the class was quite variable (really sped up towards the end), and outside help was limited, but overall interesting content.",
                "Strengths: lectures notes are very clear and tailor-made for studying; this makes periods like reading week a lot less stressful. Material is challenging but fair; a lot of the PSETs stem from the lectures and the exams stem from the PSETs so there are no unpleasant surprises for the most part. Class is consistently engaging; Professor Haile is able to keep your attention and engagement despite it being a 9 AM.",
                "The course is extremely organized and well-run. The professor is always well-prepared, and the TF was well equipped to answer questions. I enjoyed the class and don't think there is much room for improvement. Maybe 2 instead of 1 midterms would have broken up the material a bit more?",
                "Logical linkage of course concepts and models.",
                "Very strong",
                "Very well paced course. Gets hard at times but nothing impossible.",

                "Honestly, no weaknesses. Strengths: Professor Haile is one of the best lecturers in the economics department. You'll see this in his reviews in previous years, and it is 100% accurate. He is incredibly clear in his explanations, and his exams/problems sets are very fair. He's not the type to teach you material and then test you on something completely different. Rather, he teaches the material and tests you on what he teaches. That being said, the class is not an easy class. While Professor Haile is amazing at lecturing and communicating the ideas very clearly, the concepts are difficult and will take a little time to master."

                "Only if you're really interested in industrial organisation.",
                "Absolutely. Any student interested in competition and anti trust policy should definitely take this course to gain a strong theoretical background in the field. As a side note, however, this is not an applied course-- we did not do work with data.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a senior seminar this is a great one to take. Challenging but not frustratingly so and it builds off of what you have learned throughout the rest of the Economics major - a good way to cap off what you initially learned.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in game theory/micro-related topics. It's a great and well-organized class. Prof. Haile is a pretty interesting lecturer as well, so it's a very well-rounded advanced seminar.",
                "Yes. Very insightful and rich knowledge in ECON market.",
                "Yes",
                "I would its a great senior seminar option.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best 400-level Econ classes that you can take. Not too high of workload while learning about really interesting microeconomic dynamics. Please take!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in economic theory, industrial organization (imperfect competition, etc.), then yes. It's a great class with a great professor (if Prof. Haile is teaching it). There's a lot of interesting topics, and if you enjoyed intermediate micro, then this would probably be a good class. It takes some of the assumptions we make (e.g. perfect competition) in intermediate micro and then relaxes those assumptions to see what happens in markets. It's pretty math-y and challenging. If you hated doing the algebra of the intermediate econ classes, you'll probably not like this class. \r\n\r\nIf you're not super interested in econ theory or if you want to go into investing/finance/consulting, etc. you might find that this isn't exactly what you're looking forit's about basic economic models to understand things like oligopoly or product differentiation, but if you come into this class thinking you'll leave with a ton that will help you in your M&A investment banking job at Goldman or in your consulting job at Bain, I don't think you'll be very happy. That being said, if you're interested in learning about economic models to understand anti-trust policy, pricing discrimination, and competition in markets, then it'd be a great class for you!\r\n\r\nUltimately, I'd say that you should read the syllabus and know what you're signing up for. If you're looking for a good econ theory class, this is by far one of the best undergrad classes at Yale. If you're looking for an easy, low work-load senior seminar for your senior spring, you should probably pick something else."
