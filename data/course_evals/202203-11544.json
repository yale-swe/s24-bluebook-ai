                "Strengths: individual writing and feedback is heavily present, very engaging, Maggie is the BEST professor. She is honestly just so intelligent and it is so evident when she discusses different readings with us in class. \r\nWeaknesses: Many of the readings were not what we were modeling in our own personal essays - for example, many readings would be long but our essays were only supposed to be a maximum of 1500 words so it would have been more helpful to read essays that had a similar format / structure to what our assignments were.",
                "I really liked the structure of the course. Writing two versions of each essay was so helpful. Also getting workshopped was a good experience. Weakness would be the amount of reading we were assigned for every class",
                "Was a very engaging course. My writing improved. Heavy workload. Sometimes grading felt subjective.",
                "Strengths: Our instructor created a lively and engaging discussion environment where we could all voice our ideas comfortably and actually discuss different opinions on the readings, but she also guided us extremely well through more complex texts and gave us her very insightful thoughts when needed. Her feedback on our assignments was always clear and detailed, and I felt like she genuinely cared about us and our writing! Weaknesses: Can't think of any.",
                "We got a lot of feedback from the professor on our own work which is good. When we read the published essays I wanted more guidance on what in particular I was supposed to focus on in my annotations.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was well organized, and I found all of the reading and writing assignments to be very engaging. The individualized feedback was also very helpful."
