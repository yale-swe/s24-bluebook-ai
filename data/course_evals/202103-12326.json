                "The greatest strength was the insistence on oral essays and presentations. These really helped me work in my Chinese fluency\r\n\r\nThe workload was occasionally overburdening, as we had to learn a large amount of vocabulary words almost nightly. If we had learned less words but reinforced the ones we knew, I might be more familiar with vocabulary. Many of the vocabulary learns were also repeats from 150 and 151.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the tests could have been more challenging, and we should have done debates more than once. The students were really tired during they first debate but I think that was mainly because it took place on a Monday. If we had been given more notice for other debates we would have been more energetic.",
                "The strengths are that you learn to write really well, but I think they should bring back weekly speaking exercises since speaking is such a vital part of language study.",
                "It is a really low pressure environment to learn Chinese. A lot of content is thrown at you and you are not necessarily expected to pick up everything. Opportunities to practice are great. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness I would say is that some of the homework assignments feel nit-picky; they are canvas quizzes that require you to answer exactly correctly."

                "I am not sure why levels 158 and 159 exist in the Chinese curriculum and students are kept from immediately staking more specialized Chinese courses. If a student can take 150 and 151 and then travel abroad, I think that is a more effective way to learn Chinese. However, I would recommend this courses to a student who wants to obtain the Chinese certificate but cannot study abroad, or who wants more general Chinese practice.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot.",
                "Yes. Definitely. This class is intellectually challenging and your Chinese will improve greatly; at the same time, it is quite low-pressure."
