We took a field trip to a construction site, had a guest architect come to lecture us, presented a building of our choice in class and even made pasta bridges.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness of the course, but once the TA forgot to show up to the review session!",

Professor Hatfield did a really good job of making the class engaging despite the information-heavy nature of the information.
