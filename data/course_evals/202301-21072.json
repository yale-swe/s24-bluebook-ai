Each lab is obviously different, but I think joining one is such an amazing opportunity and so would recommend to anyone. For Julia's lab, scale that up 1000x.\r\n\r\nThis was my third semester in Julia's lab, and it's hands down been the best academic experience I've had at Yale. The culture and environment in the lab is fantastic, Julia was incredibly generous with her time and energy and I don't think there's anything I would change about how this semester went, or even my last 3 semester in this lab.",
                "I learned how to do coding, understand data and collaborate effectively with others. I often had to meet deadlines.",

Thanks for their incredible mentorship, i now know how to do literature review, code and design studies and analyze & interpret data, as well as propose my own research studies.",

The help I got from everyone in the lab was incredible and my thesis genuinely wouldn't have happened without at least 6 of the current lab members. Julia especially was a fantastic advisor and I'm sad to be graduating and unable to continue in this team.",

                "Yes! It was my thesis class, so if you're a Psych/CogSci major and you want to get the BS, you might have to join a lab and do 'directed research'. But if you're still deciding whether to do BA or BS, DO THE BS!! So much more interesting and rewarding than writing without data, and if there's the opportunity to run your own study in some way, or adapt other research, take it and run. It's such a unique chance to behave like a grad student for a semester, and being part of a lab like this teaches you tons.",
