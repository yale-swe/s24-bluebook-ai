                "Very good and well paced classes with helpful hand outs which walk you through the topics nicely",
                "I personally did not find the Exploration Tasks to be helpful, but rather a bit time-consuming and challenging. I believe replacing these would be beneficial. One useful component of this class was the availability of peer tutoring hours, which fell on most days of the week.",
                "This course is very well organized, and the instructors have created an engaging curriculum and positive class environment. The psets are manageable. It is difficult to force myself to stay invested, however, as the class does not check-in often with its students or demand too much attention."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! It is better than Math 112 in my opinion and has more interesting types of problems and it is easier to see the real world applications of many of these topics. I loved taking it with Rachel  while challenging, it is incredibly well-taught, well-resourced, and well-organized. You will develop sharper critical and creative thinking skills after having taken the course and there is a robust support system available for you in case you are struggling, which you will experience at some point. Just make sure to review often and do a bunch of practice to do well!",
