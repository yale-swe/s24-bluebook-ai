                "Very good and well paced classes with helpful hand outs which walk you through the topics nicely",

                "This course is very well organized, and the instructors have created an engaging curriculum and positive class environment. The psets are manageable. It is difficult to force myself to stay invested, however, as the class does not check-in often with its students or demand too much attention."

It is better than Math 112 in my opinion and has more interesting types of problems and it is easier to see the real world applications of many of these topics. I loved taking it with Rachel  while challenging, it is incredibly well-taught, well-resourced, and well-organized. You will develop sharper critical and creative thinking skills after having taken the course and there is a robust support system available for you in case you are struggling, which you will experience at some point. Just make sure to review often and do a bunch of practice to do well!",
