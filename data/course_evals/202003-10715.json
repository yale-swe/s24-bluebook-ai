Even as someone who has taken more advanced math courses, I couldn't understand the huge logical jumps with little explanation when proving results or motivating certain concepts. Even if it would mean slowing down the pace of lectures a bit, I wish the math had been more digestible.",

He asked us how we felt about the class (strengths\/weaknesses basically) and genuinely took in that feedback and adjusted accordingly -- not many professors do this, so I really appreciate this aspect!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading is very slow, class is a bit disorganized, felt like lecture content wasn't helpful for psets (one of the psets was really difficult, and lectures did not help at all). My main complaint is that the lectures went too fast (felt like content was being crammed and not explained well), so I ended up not understanding many of the more complex topics.",

                "This course was very challenging. The material was not taught in a way that was understandable to many people and the problem sets were excessively long. The syllabus did not make clear when assignments would be due and quizzes were often announced on short notice,",
                "The course was listed on Yale Course Search as Applied Data Mining and Machine Learning, however this was not an applied class at all. Barely any lectures focused on implementation, but rather dwelled on mathematical derivations or intuitive concepts. Also although the syllabus said that no prior knowledge of Python was required, Sahand failed to listen to student requests and never taught any Python, but magically expected that we were able to code complex functions for the homework. The course also assumes knowledge of matrix calculus, although that isn't clearly stated anywhere.",
                "the logistics\/grading seemed a bit disorganized and vague",
                "Sahand tried very hard but he did not seem invested in making the lectures more clear or connecting the topics. There was a lot of math that flew over my head. The problem sets and quizzes could have been connected better to the course material and given more guidance. The problem sets could also have been longer, as I did not actually understand most of the course material as I was not able to practice implementing it.",
                "Very unorganized and a lot of mistakes on lectures and homeworks.",
                "This class has so much potential it just didn't live up to. The weaknesses of this course is how much math is done instead of coding. The professor himself said that doing all this math was not necessary for real world applications and it's just a was to differentiate the course from 355. Talk about a waste. If you want to learn how to use python to do machine learning, take a different course. The lectures were quite fast in the beginning, but were adjusted towards the middle of the course to be slower paced which was very helpful. There are definitely not enough office hours for the course and it seemed as though some of the TAs\/ULAs were overworked and overwhelmed.",
                "Strengths: Learned about a wide range of topics. Focus of the course was on the math and statistics side of ML, not so much the coding (as the syllabus suggests; if you want to learn more about the coding side, take 355). Problem sets were challenging and pretty interesting. Instructor was very responsive on Piazza. Instructor definitely seems to know a lot about the subject. Quizzes were chill, forced me to make sure I understood what was going on in the course. Not an assessment heavy course  there's no final, and the midterm was a pretty small part of our grade. Weaknesses: Logistically, the course was a little unorganized. We had fewer assignments and quizzes than the syllabus indicated at the beginning of the semester. Grading was a little unclear. But I don't think these were major weaknesses. I still learned a ton.",
                "The course covered good material, but overall the course had more weaknesses than strengths. The instructor (Sahand) was about as disorganized as could be, and the pset difficulty varied WILDLY. His lectures were always confusing as well",
                "The course was incredibly difficult to folllow, as lectures randomly changed from live to recorded, and there were typed slides about half of the time. Our homework was often unrelated to what was proved or shown in lecture, and we didnt have a good source of information like a clear textbook to inform our work. The homework assignments frankly were too difficult to help me learn the material any better, and I often just blindly tried to find help online and use that to put down any answer I could get. The same went for the coding assignments  we were asked one week to code a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch, then our csv outputs were graded. The average in the class was a 5 out of 10. We never received any feedback on why our grades came out so low, or what we did wrong. Further, it took until AFTER the credit\/d deadline to get any meaningful grades back, including for several quizzes. The class also did not follow most of what was described on the syllabus. We were told wed have 5 quizzes, but we had three. There were weeks when we wouldnt receive new assignments, or we would receive only a math assignment and wait for a coding portion only to be told right before the due date that there was none. It was difficult to get ahold of the professor and TFs for this kind of information, and I know many students were frustrated. Office hours were often moved or canceled, and weirdly we were made to sign up for 1-on-1 office hours. This was intimidating and confusing, and I stopped going.",
                "The course was centered around the mathematics of machine learning, rather than the coding aspect like I expected. I wish there was more guidance with Python - as a beginner who had never coded in Python prior to the class, I spent a lot of time on the first few coding assignments stuck on syntax problems. I enjoyed the mathematical derivations and gained a better intuition for how gradient descent \/ random forests \/ gradient boosting etc. works, but it would have been more effectively reinforced with corresponding coding tasks.",
                "ABSOLUTELY NO STRENGTHS. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CLASS.  I have waited very long to write this review. This is a long read, but if you are seriously considering taking this class, read this fully. I do not want anyone else to suffer like I and many others did. And this is coming from someone who has done well and is quite confident of getting an A in the class. I regretted taking this class so much. Learnt absolutely nothing, though I got almost perfect scores on the assignments. The assignments were terribly designed, extremely confusing, didn't test your grasp of the material but rather your diligence in pestering the TAs and trying to figure out what exactly the question wants. 80% of the time was spent trying to figure out what the question wants. That's how I did well. TERRIBLE ASSIGNMENTS! They teach you nothing! LECTURES WERE IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING! Trust me, I have friends in the class, and EVERYONE (I mean, every single one) I know does not understand 90% of what Sahand is saying. He just talks to himself, reads equations off the slides, does absolutely no explaining, and skips to the next slide. Lectures were soooo frustrating to attend or listen to. At one point, I had a phobia of even attending Sahand's lectures, because I just knew I'd be confused and misled the entire time. You may ask, how about ask questions on Piazza? Haha, yes, indeed, guess what: He gives you one-word replies, or says he does not understand the question, and then links you to Stanford's ML course and notes. I then proceed to watch a Stanford lecture for 3 hours, trying to figure out their notation. It's much better delivered, but the notation Stanford's Andrew Ng uses is completely different from Sahand. So it's a terrible mess. And excuse me, you're supposed to be teaching the course, not just redirect your students to another course video. We're paying tuition to Yale, not Stanford. Also, Sahand simply ignores some Piazza questions! Essentially, TERRIBLE PIAZZA RESPONSES AND EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE PROFESSOR. The midterm was horribly designed, barely tested what we learnt, instead focusing on calculus. Quizzes were a joke, they were so trivial and just involved copying the slides. Psets were confusing and time-consuming and taught you nothing. REALLY TERRIBLE ASSESSMENT. Office hours were a JOKE - I did not find a single good office hours throughout the semester. ULAs could not help at all. Sahand cancels and reschedules office hours as and when he wishes, giving zero consideration to his students' schedules. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Finally, this is the class with the WORST logistics and organization EVER. In case you think I'm just ranting, let me present some evidence. The following are quotes from the syllabus, followed by what was actually implemented:\r\n1. \"Assignments will be posted roughly every week and a half\". This corresponds to about 9 assignments. Guess how many we got? 5! Some took 20 hours, some took 3 hours. There's so much inconsistency. No idea when the next assignment is going to be, everyone's just guessing, Sahand doesn't say a single word, everyday's like playing Russian Roulette.\r\n2. \"Mid-semester exam, which will just basically be a homework assignment that you not work on with anybody else.\": It was not a homework assignment. It became a timed assessment. Also, it was given right before thanksgiving break. That's not even midterm.\r\n3. \"The exam will also include a portion where you will discuss a random solution with the teaching staff.\": No such thing was given.\r\n4. 5 quizzes were promised. Only 2 were given, and only 1 was graded.\r\nPiazza responses were misleading and outright contradictory: He says quizzes are 10% in the syllabus, and then later says that they \"don't matter\". He contradicts himself on so many things about grading policy. Promises to give grade estimates by midterm, and then goes offline and uncontactable for a week. Promises 1 more quiz and 2 more psets, but none were given. What a joke.",
                "I think Sahand is a brilliant professor and the class gave him too much of a hard time. I thought the lectures were clear and there was a lot of support.",
                "Strength: Sahand generally is able to explain things clearly during the lecture\r\nWeakness: I feel that even after the lectures, I don't have a clear sense of how to approach the homework. A lot of time is spent going to office hours.",
                "This course had a lot of weaknesses and very few strengths.  At a bare, bare minimum, I expected to deepen my coding skills in Python.  Even that didnt happen.  There were only five homework assignments, just three of which required any substantive coding.  \r\n\r\nMost lectures were spent executing endless derivations whose goal or ultimate purpose I usually failed to see, since Sahand mostly did a poor job explaining how the nuances of all the math fit together to coalesce into broader ideas about machine learning.  I couldnt wait to be done listening to the lectures each week, and I couldnt even bring myself to watch the ones from after the midterm exam.\r\n\r\nIt was far more difficult to get help than it should have been.  I attended Parkers office hours a few times, and he was a solid explainer of ideas, but I sent him emails on three separate occasions and never received a response.  I also emailed Sahand four or five different, detailed questions about various homework assignments when I was lost and frustrated.  Every single time, he sent back a one-line response, usually telling me to go look on Piazza.  Once, he merely said, I have to log off now, and didnt bother addressing any part of my original ten-line email. \r\n\r\nThe frustrating lack of help from Sahand or Parker left the burden to fall to the ULAs, who were wonderful.  I could not have completed all the homework assignments without playing some serious email tag with Isabel and Luke, who seemed completely overburdened and swamped by student questions.  There were times when they took awhile to get back to me, but they pretty much always did get back to me, providing the kind of guidance that Sahand and Parker should have been better at dishing out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the homework assignments were simply torturous.  We barely developed any new coding skills, and I feel fortunate that I had some background in Python going in.  My friends who had not previously coded in Python struggled mightily to simultaneously learn a new language and try to implement it to solve difficult homework problems, since Sahand provided just a cursory explanation of Jupyter Notebooks and the basic syntax of Python. \r\n\r\nPerhaps my expectations for this class were misguided, but I anticipated learning about the general parameters of various machine learning algorithms and techniques, then practicing applying those techniques to different sets of data in order to build models or answer specific research questions.  The homeworks, as it turned out, were nothing like I expected.  They usually contained a substantial component that was pure math; ostensibly meant to mirror the material we had covered in lecture, these math problems were extremely frustrating, using notation and techniques for which Sahand had not bothered to provide a baseline explanation.  \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments, in general, were far too advanced and nuanced for a class that was supposed to introduce us to many of these machine learning concepts for the first time.  I understood going in that there would be a math component, but I didnt expect this course to be a poorly-taught math class, which is essentially what it turned into.   The only strength of this course was its grade breakdown: homework was worth a substantial portion of the grade and there was no final exam, meaning that if you did well on the homework (as I did, thanks to lots of guidance from the ULAs) and moderately well on the midterm, youd earn a fine grade for the class.  Every other aspect, however, was a weakness: from the instructor, to the pace at which topics were covered, to the lousy waysomehow both too deep and too surface-levelthat the topics were taught, to the availability of help from the instructor (or lack thereof), to the difficulty of the homework assignments.",
                "Very poorly organized. Course kept toggling back and forth all over the place with little sense of direction. It improved a little towards the end but by then it was too little too late.",
                "I really can't think of a single strength of the course. The lectures were terrible--I had an easier time reading the slides myself than listening to Sahand just read them off. Sometimes Sahand didn't use slides, but instead used an interactive notebook, and those are just illegible--I did not learn anything from those lectures. And his response time to student questions on Piazza was just grossly inconsiderate. Sometimes he would just disappear from the platform for days while important questions sat there without answers. At other points, he would blatantly ignore the more important questions and leave the unanswered, but would answer less important questions.",
                "Ultimately, although I found the course often disorganized, it does force you to grapple with the math and the code behind many foundational methods in ML. Its greatest weakness is that it seems like a course still figuring out exactly what it is supposed to be. It was not the most \"applied\" course, and it involved very little (if any) data mining methods. The material-trajectory of the course was not always clear, and lectures often felt tangential or fell behind schedule. Sometimes Professor Neghaban explains things lucidly, especially when the slides or notes seem well-organized in advance (and on Piazza), but oftentimes the lectures were just confusingly-explained. If one of the course objectives really is to equip students with some applied ML capabilities, I think that one possible improvement of the course could be the addition of a final project at the end of term. Personally I got a lot out of the harder math and proofs in the course, but wish that there had been much more guidance on matrix calculus. Other strengths include Python notebooks which demonstrates the course concepts (although they could use more organization and comments), and the psets' inclusion of hints to help us along the larger problems. I did really appreciate Professor Neghaban's efforts to gather and respond to student feedback throughout the course.",
                "This was the most disorganized class that I've taken at Yale. I realize that teaching during a pandemic is very difficult, but the professor failed at just communicating with us about logistics and grading, which made this virtual class even harder. In the days leading up to the midterm drop deadline, so many students were posting on piazza begging for homework grades to be released. We had finished 5 assignments so far, but only the first homework from a month and a half ago was graded. A few hours before the drop deadline of 5pm, the professor released the grade distribution of the class without actually telling us our individual grades, and we STILL only had 1 assignment graded at this point, so we didn't even know where we fell on the distribution. The student piazza posts about this were left answered. The syllabus said that we would have 5 quizzes in total over the course of the semester. By Thanksgiving break, with 1 week left of class, we had only taken 2 quizzes. The professor did not tell us the plan for finishing the other quizzes or update the syllabus. Only AFTER we asked on piazza did he tell us that there would be no more quizzes this semester. I'm not complaining about how the number of quizzes was reduced. The issue is that the professor almost never told us what was going on when it came to logistics or grading  (how many assignments should we expect in the next few weeks, why was grading taking so long)--literally ANY explanation would have been helpful. The students had to constantly ask. Also, it seemed that the TAs were just as confused as the students. Homeworks were assigned at random intervals, and it was unclear how many homeworks we would have in total (once again, no updates about this until students asked). This made it very difficult for students to plan for the semester. The lecture material and homework assignments were already extremely challenging, so having a disorganized class with the students feeling confused about the schedule and structure only made everything worse. This class also had way too much emphasis on math and not enough on coding. All I remember is doing a bunch of matrix multiplication, calculus, and mathematical proofs for the homeworks and maybe occasionally using a Python ML package. However, Professor Negahban did say that he would try to balance the math and coding in future iterations of the course. Professor Negahban was pretty responsive on piazza, which was helpful when working on the psets, but grading\/logistic questions were often left unanswered. He also really valued student feedback and sent out a few surveys over the course of the semester, which I appreciated. I think that this could have been a good class, because the topics are interesting and the professor is very knowledgeable, but I did not enjoy it at all.",
                "Strengths: surveys good range of topics, interesting math and techniques Weaknesses: This course was extremely disorganized and we never knew what to expect. homework lengths would range drastically sometimes two parts sometimes one part with no prior announcement and varying lengths of time to complete them, we were told we would have frequent quizzes then had 2, did not get grades back for months which left us very in the dark about how we were doing and what we should improve on, office hours were often not effective because ULAs weren't given guidance on how to complete the assignments beforehand, live lecture just stopped happening halfway through which was disappointing and made it even harder to stay engaged during a hard semester, certain piazza questions asking about grades before dropping deadlines or other important inquiries were often ignored, expectations of students was extremely unclear and the lack of consistency and structure in this course made an already difficult course even more difficult",
                "The class did not seem to have much of a backbone. It moved very quickly initially, and then slowed down when students voiced their stress to the professor. We didn't spend as much time using actual coding\/Python packages as I would have liked. However, I think the professor knew this semester would be difficult and was very receptive to students' feedback. This helped the course a lot.",
                "Strengths: the course content is very compelling, and I enjoyed having a math and a coding component to each problem set. Sahand is clearly very knowledgeable about the course information so it was enjoyable hearing him discuss it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, many. First, there was too much math and not enough coding in the problem sets so while we learned good theory, we didn't get any real practice applying it. Secondly and most importantly, the course is heavily unorganized. Sahand basically disappeared for a few weeks in the middle of the course. Something like 3 weeks went by without a problem set being released, and not even the TAs knew what was going on. Grading was an absolute mess and results were almost never released, so much so that we didn't even have a good sense of our grades before the drop and Credit\/D deadlines. The midterm in the course took place 3 weeks after the midway point in the semester, the drop deadline. It was abysmal, honestly.",
                "Course was billed as no python experience required and that it would provide introduction to Python but the course did not and next to no class time was spent covering python basics. I did learn basic principles of machine learning however, which is a great and interesting topic!",
                "This course covered a good variety of topics in a logical order. I liked the mathematical focus, since I'm more comfortable learning the available implementations on my own, but other students may have preferred to learn more immediately-applicable coding skills. The lectures moved fast at times because the slides were quite dense with notes and equations, even though the concepts weren't too hard to understand. More frequent check-ins with students about course pace would have helped, especially in the online format. The assignments were challenging enough to produce good learning without being unmanageable, and office hours were quite helpful.",
                "Strength: the math proofs were interesting. Weakness: I didn't learn much beyond writing down math equations and proofs.",
                "Strengths: The coding and math parts of each problem set formed a great pairing. Lectures were well crafted and enjoyable, and Piazza was very helpful.\r\nIt would be awesome to add a part two to this course to cover more advanced concepts in a similar fashion.\r\nI would have also enjoyed using more machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch.",
                "Math heavy, which could be good or bad, and also Professor was not very good with feedback.",
                "Strength: Professor Negahban is clearly very passionate about ML, and he gave some great, relevant examples of the concepts we were learning during lectures.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Material-wise, this course focused way too heavily on the math part of ML, in my opinion. Given the varied background of the students taking the course, it wouldve been nice to have a more even balance between theory and application instead of 80% theory, 20% application.\r\n\r\nOrganization-wise, this course was not organized well. Psets were sporadically distributed and varied wildly in difficulty. The lectures were a random mix of live and recorded, which isnt really an issue given covid, but it wouldve been nice if the recorded lectures were more standardized so we could schedule around them. There were also a couple of deadlines during the semester (drop, credit\/d\/fail, etc.) that we were promised to get grades by but ultimately did not get, so it wouldve been nice to get those when we were told wed get them by. I think ultimately, this course mightve needed more TFs or ULAs to support a class of this size, especially during covid times.",
                "The course had few strengths. Among the weaknesses were the speed and poor quality of the lectures, the unhelpful and extremely long math homework assignments and the lack of coding and practical application of the material.",
                "This course might have had all the right components, but they organized through a more comprehensive framework. It would have been much more interesting to understand the different topics as a general progression of some sort, which was at times completely absent such that a new topic seemed like a complete surprise. Where the class could be improved the most for students without an advanced background in the subject is in the manner in which new topics are taught: rather than jumping right into a slide full of math, a motivation, followed by an intuition, then an example, and finally the math would have been much better for my style of learning. Otherwise, it often felt like a disjointed journey through different math proofs where my fragmented understanding of their relevance and what they were for followed later.",
                "definitely have more office hours, and some of them were a little disorganized. it would be nice to go over the problems step by step, including coding problems",
                "Strength: I liked how we went over a variety of machine learning topics starting from linear regression and going all the way to neural networks. There is a lot of linear algebra and ML theory in this course, if you enjoy that. Assignment grading was also pretty lenient. There were many times where I did an assignment and thought I would get a certain grade only to be shocked when my grade was higher than I expected. However, there are also many weaknesses to this course, starting with the organization of this course. This was a very disorganized course where live lectures were often cancelled for no reason and where the structure of the syllabus was weakly followed. For example, we were expected to have 5 quizzes for this course. Instead, we only had 2, which made them extremely important. Assignments sometimes took 2 to 3 weeks to be graded (not exaggerating here), which made it difficult for us to determine our grade in the course."

                "Organization, clarity, and feedback  this class lacked all three, and these are essential to learning remotely. Frankly, it would be more effective to take a machine learning course on Coursera or some other online platform. Dont waste your Yale tuition\/credits on this. I had several other classes with professors who also had to compromise and adjust due to the pandemic, and every other course was far better than this.\r\n\r\nWe used Piazza, which is always good for courses online OR in-person that use code as part of assignments. It felt like, in this class, that instructors didnt want to give away answers and so often answered questions with vague clues that did little to help me. I stopped asking questions by the middle of the semester. The professor did not allow us to ask questions anonymously (only anonymous to other students) which, as someone who is not comfortable asking stupid questions, made it harder to ask basic questions without feeling embarrassed. This may just be a problem of mine, and amy not be relevant to other students experiences.",

Students are paying $30,000 for your classes, and this is ridiculous. Please have some thoughts and consideration for your students. You are making it so agonizing for your students. The amount of anxiety, torture and frustration you impose on students is ridiculous. Lectures are cancelled whenever he wishes, and he gives 10 minutes notice ahead of a 9am class. He promises \"Python notebooks\" and then delivers nothing. Logistics of the class are so poorly organized. Students are left confused about assignment requirements, grading policies. Sahand promises a lot and then delivers nothing. Very very very disappointing. This should not be a Yale class. Wait, it should not be a class anywhere. There is no place for such a poorly-organized, ridiculously-badly-taught class.",
                "I thought more live lectures would be great",
                "I understand that this course (like others) had to be conducted virtually due to circumstances beyond anyones control, but its virtual form was severely lacking.  For starters, I feel that Sahand would have been a far better instructorone clearer in his explanations and more receptive to students questionshad he not been forced to lecture virtually.  The lectures were so dull, consisting of endless derivations and math on his iPad, and they sped along quickly, skipping over the time that typically would have been devoted to clarifying students confusion.  When Sahand did answer questions, it was quite disruptive to the flow of the lecture.  He would, for example, answer questions that had been asked ten or twenty minutes prior, suddenly jumping back to a topic from much earlier in the lecture.  Often, he interrupted his thoughts with the answer to a question, leaving me frustrated that he couldnt finish his point before bouncing to a completely different topic.  Upon addressing a question or a series of questions, he frequently strayed on wild tangents, only a portion of which actually related to the lecture topic at hand.  These diversions frequently included deep dives into the nuances of a particular topic, and the discussion would be concluded with, Oh, you dont need to know this for this course, apparently indicating that we had just spent ten minutes trying to follow the twists and turns of a discussion that we didnt really need to be paying attention to.  All these fits and starts made an already long lecture feel even more tedious, completely disrupting the logical flow of one idea to another and how they all fit together.  \r\n\r\nThis type of disruption and poor lesson execution really wasnt the fault of the virtual format.  Its something that Sahand could easily fix with an increased focus on being more coherent and straightforward, understanding that the material is complex and that such jumping around between topics and long-winded answers only muddles students assimilation of the relevant knowledge.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, something must be done about office hours if this course is held virtually again.  All the homework assignments were confusingly written, filled with errors, or generally difficult to complete, requiring students to query TAs, ULAs and Sahand himself for guidance.  The problem was that, in a class of over 200 students, eight hours of virtual office hours per week did not suffice.  Due to rules about not sharing code with other students, those students seeking help could only ask vague, non-specific questions in office hours, rather than the types of pointed questions that would actually help them fix whatever problem they had.  In order to ask specific, useful questions, students had to schedule 15-minute office hour sessions with ULAs or play email tag.  Neither of these approaches was sufficient for homework assignments that often took upwards of a week to fully complete due to their length and difficulty.  I hypothesize that the process of receiving help from ULAs would not have been nearly as frustrating if office hours were held in person, or if vastly more virtual office hours were held during a given week.  I understand the logistical and scheduling constraints that might make this difficult in the future, but something has to be done if this class is to continue virtually.",

                "For live lectures: Prof. Neghaban would often give us a short break halfway through the lecture, which was helpful to stay concentrated on Zoom. Live Q&A in lecture was nice, but also having Piazza for asynchronous and more in-depth Q&A was really helpful. I'm glad that lectures were recorded, and that we had access to the annotated lecture slides as well. Partway through the semester, most of the lectures started to be prerecorded (and not Zoomed). I'm not sure if this was more or less helpful for methey were perhaps a bit better-organized. But I think that the most helpful virtual model I've experienced for math\/stats lectures is a prerecorded lecture which the prof. then screen-shares during lecture time while also being open to take student questions in real time (such as via chat); this might be a lot to ask, but I think that model would be most helpful for learning and keeping up the material. OtherwiseI wish that office hours with Prof. Neghaban were better-communicated and planned, as they were often canceled or moved around last-minute.",
                "Because of technical difficulties, Professor Negahban stopped doing live virtual lectures and only made pre-recorded lectures for us to watch on our own time. I don't blame him for this, but I do think that when it comes to virtual learning, live lectures are infinitely better than pre-recorded ones. It's nice to be able to ask questions in real time, as soon as the question pops into your head. Live virtual lectures are also recorded anyways, so students who cannot make it to the live lectures can still watch them. Also, Professor Negahban would upload the pre-recorded lectures at random times, so I was unable to set aside a specific time each Tuesday and Thursday to watch the lectures. With live virtual lectures, you know that the recorded lecture will be uploaded to Canvas only a few hours later, at roughly the same time each Tuesday and Thursday. Ultimately, live virtual lectures are better than recorded lectures for virtual engagement.",

That's how I did well. TERRIBLE ASSIGNMENTS! They teach you nothing! LECTURES WERE IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING! Trust me, I have friends in the class, and EVERYONE (I mean, every single one) I know does not understand 90% of what Sahand is saying. He just talks to himself, reads equations off the slides, does absolutely no explaining, and skips to the next slide. Lectures were soooo frustrating to attend or listen to. At one point, I had a phobia of even attending Sahand's lectures, because I just knew I'd be confused and misled the entire time. You may ask, how about ask questions on Piazza? Haha, yes, indeed, guess what: He gives you one-word replies, or says he does not understand the question, and then links you to Stanford's ML course and notes. I then proceed to watch a Stanford lecture for 3 hours, trying to figure out their notation. It's much better delivered, but the notation Stanford's Andrew Ng uses is completely different from Sahand. So it's a terrible mess. And excuse me, you're supposed to be teaching the course, not just redirect your students to another course video. We're paying tuition to Yale, not Stanford. Also, Sahand simply ignores some Piazza questions! Essentially, TERRIBLE PIAZZA RESPONSES AND EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE PROFESSOR. The midterm was horribly designed, barely tested what we learnt, instead focusing on calculus. Quizzes were a joke, they were so trivial and just involved copying the slides. Psets were confusing and time-consuming and taught you nothing. REALLY TERRIBLE ASSESSMENT. Office hours were a JOKE - I did not find a single good office hours throughout the semester. ULAs could not help at all. Sahand cancels and reschedules office hours as and when he wishes, giving zero consideration to his students' schedules. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Finally, this is the class with the WORST logistics and organization EVER. In case you think I'm just ranting, let me present some evidence. The following are quotes from the syllabus, followed by what was actually implemented:\r\n1. \"Assignments will be posted roughly every week and a half\". This corresponds to about 9 assignments. Guess how many we got? 5! Some took 20 hours, some took 3 hours. There's so much inconsistency. No idea when the next assignment is going to be, everyone's just guessing, Sahand doesn't say a single word, everyday's like playing Russian Roulette.\r\n2. \"Mid-semester exam, which will just basically be a homework assignment that you not work on with anybody else.\": It was not a homework assignment. It became a timed assessment. Also, it was given right before thanksgiving break. That's not even midterm.\r\n3. \"The exam will also include a portion where you will discuss a random solution with the teaching staff.\": No such thing was given.\r\n4. 5 quizzes were promised. Only 2 were given, and only 1 was graded.\r\nQuizzes are 10% in the syllabus, and then Sahand later says that they \"don't matter\". Promises to give grade estimates by midterm, and then goes offline and uncontactable for a week. Promises to upload Python notebooks, and then uploads nothing. Promises 1 more quiz and 2 more psets after thanksgiving, but none were given. What a joke.",
                "Yes. Necessary course to take.",
                "Yes. Machine Learning is so important for a CS major. This is a challenging course, but you will learn a ton",
                "Not at all.  Please avoid this course if you can. This course is probably my biggest regret in four years at Yale.  \r\n\r\nI came into this course excited to further develop my Python and machine learning skills.  I had taken online classes last summer that solidified my ability to code in Python and taught me to use a variety of common machine learning packages and techniques at an introductory level.  I thought I was well-prepared and well-positioned to take this class and dive deeper into this foundational knowledge.  \r\n\r\nAfter an entire semester of this course, however, I am no better at understanding how and when to implement specific machine learning techniques in the most optimal situation, or how to best apply any machine learning package to data in order to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nIf youre looking to develop those types of skillsif youre looking to become more adept and fluent in building and implementing machine learning models, then this course is not for you because it does not teach those skills.  Instead, it swamps you in mathematical derivations taught by an arrogant, unhelpful instructor.   I literally cannot name a single skill or specific insight learned in this course that I think will be useful in graduate school or in my career.  Instead of helpful Python hints, a general familiarity with various machine learning packages and models, or a framework for thinking about data and model-building going forward, this course consists of confusing mathematical notation, homework assignments that ask you to do things youve never seen before, and an instructor that cannot lead a coherent lecture to save his life.  Somehow, the topics are covered in a way that is simultaneously too deep and too broad.  What I mean to say is that Sahand will seize upon some niche aspect of the math and spend entire lectures deriving various layers of the parameters of a particular model, leading the class down a confusing mathematical rabbit hole before suddenly moving on to the next topic without ever actually explaining the broader ideas or implications of the previous one.  We jumped between models and concepts, and I never felt like I understood why any of them were important, or how I could actually go about using any of the techniques whose ridiculous derivations I had halfheartedly been able to follow. \r\n\r\nAmid all the math, when we actually had to write code, we were assigned what felt like busy work.  For example, we learned about the KNN algorithm in class, and then we were assigned to build our own KNN algorithm on the next homework, even though there are half a dozen Python packages with built-in KNN functions and various capabilities.  The philosophy, I suppose, was that by building our own KNN algorithm wed develop a solid understanding of its nuts and bolts.  But this only serves as an exercise in frustration when dozens of students barely know how to use Python, much less build a pretty damn complex algorithm from scratch based on shoddy, mistake-filled and vague instructions.  \r\n\r\nThe problem with this course was that we focused too heavily on the nuances and nitty-gritty mathematical details, rather than broader understanding of how to actually get excited about and leverage machine learning using the multitude of tools that already exist.  Until this very premise of the course is fundamentally reimagined, I would advise any student to avoid it.",
                "Not in its current form.",
                "No I would not recommend this class to another student. It was difficult to grasp applied data mining and machine learning concepts and the class was a lot more math-based. I was unable to apply most of what I had learned into coding.",
                "Take it only if you want it to for your major.",
                "If Sahand is teaching, don't take this course under any circumstances. It's just not worth it. Take something related through the CS department instead and flesh it out by taking the relevant S&DS courses like Linear Models that will give you the statistical grounding.",
                "Yes, but with a sizable grain of salt. Is the course in its current iteration clear about how much work will be math vs coding, proofs vs application? Are you familiar with Python or eager to learn? If you want a deep but wide survey in ML, shop this course and see how it fits for you.",
                "I DO NOT RECOMMEND. I'm a CS major, and I thought that this class was even worse than CS 323. This was the most disorganized class that I've taken at Yale. By the midterm drop deadline, we had finished 5 assignments but had only received 1 grade, and the piazza questions about grading were left unanswered. No schedule was given for the homeworks and quizzes, so they were just assigned at random times throughout the semester, and you could never anticipate your workload for the upcoming week. I never had any idea of how many more homeworks and quizzes were left in the semester, and the professor gave no indication of this, until the last week of classes when the number of assignments we had already completed just ended up being the total number for the semester. Lectures were okay, but the homeworks involved a lot of new material that you had to figure out on your own. I had to read ML lecture notes from several other schools to understand what was going on, and office hours weren't very helpful. The material was extremely difficult, but I would not have minded it so much if the class was actually organized--if I knew when and how many assignments were coming so that I could allocate the time for completing them. I'm not a S&DS major, so I expected the difficulty but not the disorganization. Also, I was initially excited about the combination of math and coding presented in the syllabus. I thought that I would learn the math behind a variety of ML concepts\/tools and then implement them in the homeworks. Turns out, this was basically just a math class. The homeworks involved a ton of linear algebra, calculus, and proofs, with coding as a small addition. I didn't really gain any Python ML knowledge. I remember writing a function that just replicates an existing package for 1 coding homework and filling out a few lines in a Jupyter notebook for another. At the end of the semester, Professor Negahban did say that he would focus more on Python ML package usage in future iterations of the course. All I can say is, if you're a CS major, don't take this class. It will involve a lot of stress, the psets will take a lot of time, and learning how to take log derivatives of matrix equations or define the inner-product for a Hilbert space is not super useful in my opinion. If you're not a CS major, definitely make sure that you're comfortable with calculus and linear algebra. This class requires a strong math background.",
                "topic-wise yes, instructor-wise no",
                "Yes I would. ML is an increasingly valuable skill.",
                "The material in this course is captivating and very interesting to learn, but I wish Sahand didn't teach it or taught it better. If he teaches it again, the good news is he is very receptive of and always looking for feedback, so hopefully he improves. When he taught it this semester, the class was incredibly disorganized -- Sahand basically disappeared for a few weeks in the middle of the course, something like 3 weeks went by without a problem set being released, and not even the TAs knew what was going on. Grading was an absolute mess and results were almost never released, so much so that we didn't even have a good sense of our grades before the drop and Credit\/D deadlines. The midterm in the course took place 3 weeks after the midway point in the semester, the drop deadline. It was abysmal, honestly. Otherwise, problem sets weren't too much work, and I enjoyed having a math and a coding component to each of them, but wish there were more coding. This turned out to be a very linear algebra-heavy course.",
                "Yes if interested in learning foundation of machine learning. I'd highly suggest knowing python going in (until fall '20 class was taught in R)",
                "Yes, for anyone interested in a largely mathematical approach to machine learning. The course covered a wide variety of machine learning methods, demystifying many of the field's buzzwords and providing a good basis for learning more specific techniques. The balance of mathematical and coding assignments skewed heavily toward the math, which I liked because the coding and libraries are easier to learn independently, but other students may have different goals. The assignments were challenging, more in their linear algebra content than in statistics, but they were all manageable.",
                "Yes absolutely! \r\n\r\nThis course is very accessible to non-S&DS majors and provides a gentle but comprehensive introduction to fundamental machine learning models. Sahand was a great instructor and the psets he wrote were fun and complete with both a math portion and python coding portion.  Overall, I would highly recommend this relatively low-workload but very interesting and useful intro to machine learning course!",
                "If you like math, maybe.",
                "Unless this is required for your major or youre super passionate about ML, I would probably not take it.",
                "yes, i do recommend it. ML is so fascinating and important if you want to go into DS \/ AI",
                "No. Not with this professor. And I say this not because this course was difficult (it was). Let's be real here, machine learning is a tough subject and I knew that coming into this course. On top of learning a difficult subject, the disorganization of this course made this course super challenging for reasons that could've been avoided. Most of our live lectures were cancelled this semester for no reason. It took many weeks for our assignments to be returned with a grade, which made it challenging to determine our standing throughout the semester. In one instance, before the course drop deadline, a grading scale was provided to us when we didn't even have our grades back for several assignments. Overall, this course was just very disorganized and messy. The professor is a nice person and I think he had good intentions for us. But come on, this course needs an overhaul and it should be planned out much better in the future, especially since we're learning a difficult subject. If you're gonna take this course, be prepared to handle insanely tough assignments without a lot of hand holding. And also make sure your linear algebra skills are good."
