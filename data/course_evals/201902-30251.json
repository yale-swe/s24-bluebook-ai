    "I learned a lot about Ecuadorian history and culture, and continued to develop my Spanish language skills as well. It was interesting to begin to have a basic understanding of a culture very different from my own.",
    "This course gave me a basic insight into Ecuadorian culture and history. It allowed me to use my Spanish language skills with actual, applicable content.",
    "I learned about the history and culture of Ecuador through readings and excursions.",
    "This course was my first experience studying outside of my first language (with the exception of language learning courses). I gained skills in active reading and listening working to understand the language while simultaneously retaining information.",
    "I got a better idea of Pre Columbian culture in the region of Ecuador, enhancing how I view the region today."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths were the professors, including their knowledge and their commitment to helping us learn. One weakness is that I think we focused a lot on art, architecture, etc., and little on current events or any sort of politics. We spent hours and hour discussing and viewing art from 3,000 years ago, but only had a single 45 minute lecture on Ecuadorian politics.",
    "This course covered a plethora of topics, but I wish it included more lectures about the current political state in Ecuador and the past century of history. The information the course lacked was crucial to the travel abroad experience.",
    "A strength was that the excursions gave me the opportunity to engage with the Ecuadorian culture and experience it first hand. The readings during the section at Yale were also interesting and helpful although at first they were challenging because I wasn't used to doing long readings in Spanish.",
    "This course provided strong hands on activities in Ecuador, but I felt that the New Haven portion should have focused more on pre-Colombian history and placed less emphasis on the colonization story.",
    "I thought the readings and the activities associated with them made the materials much more fun to learn."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great way to start to learn about Ecuador and to learn Spanish while doing so. I especially appreciated all the trips we took, they added flavor to our class and the learning.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the opportunity to study abroad is incredible and the culture class enriched my experience since it gave me a better understanding of Ecuador as a whole.",
    "Yes. This course provided excellent opportunities to engage with another culture while honing Spanish language skills.",
    "I think its a cool introduction to the region if that is what you are interested in."
