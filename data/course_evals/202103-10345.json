                "This course provided really interesting material to work through. While it was occasionally difficult to focus on writing in the morning, Prof Tu showcased a wide variety of media in class that enabled critical thinking in a very approachable way.",
                "The topics of discussion were really engaging! The research paper, yet challenging, was extremely rewarding.\r\nSome readings could be dropped for lack of relevance.",
                "Strengths include great feedback and engagement throughout the course. No weaknesses.",
                "very nice and clear",
                "Strengths: The professor is flexible with office hours and very eager to individually help each student. The readings are varied and not overwhelming.\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings are difficult to follow. They're only understood once discussed in class. We didn't tend to have peer-peer discussions, instead it's usually between a student and the professor.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tu genuinely cares about her students. The feedback on each paper definitely helped a lot and I appreciated her willingness to assist during office hours a LOT. This was the perfect first semester course to develop my writing skills, and her insights into the seminar helped us move the conversation forward. She incorporated a lot of media into the lectures which changed up any monotony. Also, Professor Tu is very understanding. She prioritizes mental and physical health before academic success, and that makes for a very comfortable and growth-minded learning environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the seminar conversations were not fluid and it felt as though we were responding more to Professor Tu than to each other by raising our hands and such. Perhaps some seminar conversation guidelines and some direct conversation could make the conversation feel more natural.\r\n\r\nMaybe, with the readings, adding more content that allows for debate or more-passionate discussion could actually facilitate more conversation too. I liked the readings, but maybe charging some content could facilitate more early-morning engagement. Maybe comparing different voices and opinions, how people voice those opinions, etcetera, could add some more nuance to the course. Finally, playing some music in the beginning of class could make the environment feel a bit more natural and even contribute to perceiving voice!"

I was a little worried about what Yale would require from academic writing, but this course gave me confidence that I was ready to write at the college-level. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would not recommend this particular course (Voices, Silence, and Self). The subject was a little disorganized, and this disconnect reflected in some of the readings we had.",
                "Yes, this course gives you a lot of creative freedom and allows you to develop as a writer. While some of the topics might seem really open-ended at first, Prof Tu provides a lot of insight and individual help to develop well-written papers.",

                "I would recommend this course to another studentI would take this class, or any class, with Professor Tu. She provides insightful and helpful feedback, making this the perfect course to improve your writing skills. She is also understanding, lenient, and really meets a student where they are at. Also, the last assignment of the course is a creative assignment, and Professor Tu encouraged use of many types of media. I found that to be fulfilling as the instructor embraced many different people's talents and creative instincts. Professor Tu was very insightful, helpful, and listened to my stress and concerns relating to papers. I felt as though I could describe how I really felt with the progress of my paper, and she would meet me wherever I needed assistance. I did not have to go to her with a finished product, but rather we could work on the process together. She prioritizes mental and physical wellness before academic grades, and that is, to me, a sure-fire reason to take a course and learn from an instructor."
