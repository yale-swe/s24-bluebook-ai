                "First and foremost, I found out how much I love to paint! Our prof and TA were also so attentive and helpful",
                "This course pushed me to take my painting in new directions that I had not considered before. The prompts for each project were broad enough to allow for personal expression and specific enough to force me to experiment with new techniques. I had very little experience with oil paint before taking this course, and the professor's guidance about techniques, mediums, and the behavior of the paint was extremely helpful in allowing me to control the paint.",
                "An introduction to painting!",
                "I painted before, yet I did not have any experience with oil paint before. This class was a very good introduction to oil painting, different techniques, and applications in different styles/forms (portrait, landscape, trompe l'oeil, etc.).",
                "A greater understanding of colour theory in painting. I learnt a lot about looking over this semester. Depicting light and dark through unlikely colours was fascinating. I had never used oil paint before and have left the course with a much better ability in that area.",
                "I learned how to use oil paints, as well as various painting techniques: how to see light, color, and space; how to use brush strokes; how to implement creativity.",
                "Learned fundamentals of painting from materials and their usage, composition, color theory, technique, and how to create a personal art style within my work in the class.",
                "From this course I was able to polish up any prior knowledge I had on painting. Through various assignment prompts, my original process began little by little to be noticeably impractical. Instead, I was able to revisit theories and points on color theory and redevelop the skills of analyzing color in objects. Maria very thoroughly pushed me out of my comfort zone to ensure I break away from that original process to see what other methods could work for me. In the outcome, I learned so much about shape, contour, and line, as well as composition and organization. Most importantly, I struggled a lot with time and the efforts of my brushstrokes, of which this course taught me to relax in a way about art and to simply follow my intentions as an artist, which meant looser more expressionists strokes in the end."

                "Strenghts: the Professor (Maria De Los Angeles) and TA (Adam Amram) were phenomenal and extremely supportive",
                "None!",
                "This course is fantastic!",
                "Painting is a demanding and (often frustrating) task. This course took a lot of my time, but although it was stressful at times, I enjoyed the fact that my task was to paint, which is so therapeutic. Furthermore, although I stressed about whether I'd be able to complete assignments on time or how my paintings were going, Maria is a great instructor, and she always reassured me that it was a process.",
                "Maria adapted the syllabus to suit where the class was in terms of timelines of work which was very helpful. We gained a lot of positive and useful feedback on our work. For each assignment we were shown examplar work of the project which was useful.",
                "The strengths of the course are that Maria is such an amazing instructor. She made me feel very comfortable and excited to paint as a beginner. She also adapted the curriculum to the class' pace and experience with painting, which told me she really cared about us as her students and what we could take out of the class. One weakness is that we learn everything through the projects we paint throughout the course, and I would have appreciated some more beginner guidelines on just understanding color and light, etc. before jumping into the projects.",
                "Strengths of this course include the access to materials, open ended assignments, and welcoming/supportive work and critique environment. Weaknesses include the cost of buying materials (I think some things could be provided or the required materials list could be shortened, as there were many things I used sparingly or not at all). Another would be that for people with no painting experience at all it was difficult to understand how to use materials in the beginning; this class would benefit from a \"crash-course\" session for people who need an intro to things like how to use medium, best brush practices, mixing colors, etc.",
                "I think that a strength of the course was that it encouraged exploration and non-traditional approaches to painting. As a course for students without much experience painting, it was not overly critical or restrictive and allowed for everyone to experiment with personal and unique styles. I think a weakness could potentially be that there was sometimes limited time left for crits, so it was difficult to receive more in-depth feedback during class crits.",
                "The strengths in this course would be towards the professor and her engagement in the classroom. I feel as though she got to really understand not necessarily every student as a person, but as an artist. She payed attention to the little details in our art styles and processes we didn't even notice and in doing so she was able to guide us through the different prompts in a way that genuinely benefited our interests and needed and didn't feel pressuring in any way. The assignments themselves were also very experimental and allowed a lot of breathing room to engage in different styles, methods, and painting mediums. A weakness in the course was perhaps the timeline. Although very generously, our assignments were due based on adjusted due dates that benefited our completion time, in the end this proved to hinder our ability to throughly finish our final projects. I feel as though now with a better understanding of the average time it takes to finish the pieces, the timeline could be better organized to work up towards the final project and critique in a way that can satisfy majority of the class."

                "Yes100%. This is one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
                "I absolutely loved this course! It was so fun to infuse creativity into my academic schedule, and Prof. De Los Angeles and Adam were wonderful instructors. Something to keep in mind is that if youre not a seasoned painter, assignments take a lot longer than you might expect. The work is fun, but you do have to put a lot of effort in.",
                "Absolutely  loved my experience!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to almost any other student. It was a wonderful course, both enjoyable and rigorous, and was well suited for people at many levels of painting ability. There were students who had never touched a brush before this course, and students who had years of experience, and the class allowed for both types to learn and grow. Everyone I talked to in the course seemed to love it, whether they were an art major or just taking it to get a new experience.",
                "Absolutely! It's perfect for a new painter.",
                "If you enjoy painting and can allocate the time needed, I highly recommend taking this course, especially with Maria! She is incredibly supportive and understanding.",
                "Yes. This course was really useful for my perception of light and colour and practical painting skills. I felt inspired by those around me, faculty and students, and enjoyed the talks from visiting artists, having access to the print workshop and visiting MFA studios. Your ability will improve so much over the semester and you can really lean into the creative process.",
                "Yes, Maria is an amazing instructor, especially if you may be unsure since you've never painted before! I am surprisingly very proud of all the works I made in her course. I am so happy I took this class with Maria.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially non-art majors. I had never painted in my life, but left the class with lots of skills and some pretty cool paintings. Be warned that a lot of the painting work itself happens outside of class depending on your style/dedication, so if you plan to dive into this course maybe save it for a quiet semester/senior year where you can dedicate hours/weekends to painting.",
                "Yes I would! I think for anyone interested in getting into painting or with an already thorough painting background, this course still manages to teach you something new and challenge any precedents on painting you probably have. The course itself is very much geared towards letting one experiment and be challenged through the visual arts and allows for one to never feel stuck with just one idea of what painting can be."
