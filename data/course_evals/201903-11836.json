   "comments": [
    "Reading so much of Relato de un Naufrago in such a short time.",
    "It was a LOT of work but was very helpful in developing my skills.",
    "The course is a good overview of the necessary knowledge for conversational speech.",
    "Having all students participate every class through discussions and activities we very useful. The online textbook activities were not the most helpful and I felt like other homework activities were better.",
    "Strengths: A lot of talking, feel like I learned the rest of Spanish grammar that I was missing in my other classes, I can now have a full conversation in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  We had to read a short novel (by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so it was pretty good) in a week.",
    "Strengths - in class activities and engagement by the professor. \r\nWeaknesses - the homework and especially the website",
    "This class does a good job of encouraging constant and engaged verbal use of Spanish. \r\n\r\nIf this evaluation had been written three weeks before the end of the term, it would be drastically different. The novela \"Relato de un nufrago\" that we were required to read toward the end of the term was too long and too difficult, especially for the time in the term during which it is assigned. To start, it was originally written for native Spanish speakers, so it was far too difficult and vocab-heavy for our abilities. I do not know anyone else in my class who actually read it completely in Spanish, with most choosing to google translate the entire thing or simply buying the English version. It consumed 4-5 hours a night for each reading assignment for me if I chose to look up each unknown word. This for an entire week is simply too much work\/reading for an assignment that was not worth a significant portion of our grade. This assignment alone caused me to rate the class worse than I otherwise would have.",
    "Strengths is the level of grammar and vocab we go through and a lot of the lessons are really informative. Weakness is that we spend a lot of time doing the same activities (mock \"debates\" or \"improvs\") that get repetitive and boring.",
    "Strengths: professor\r\nWeaknesses: the book read in class, some of the assignments felt like busywork\r\n\r\nOften felt like we were tested on exceptions to rules in a manner that was not reflective of our actual knowledge",
    "Strengths: really enforced the vocabulary and I improved my grammar more this year than any other\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The stories could be confusing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are trying to learn Spanish, the grammar is very helpful in this course.",

    "Only with Terry Seymour",
    "I definitely would the material taught in this class was extremely useful and the professor was amazing.",
    "Definitely!  Prof. Seymour is great and knowledgeable about Spanish and Spanish culture!  It also helps so much to speak Spanish everyday!",
    "I would recommend my teacher to others.",
    "It is difficult to recommend this class to anyone who is not required to take it. I took L1 and L2 at Yale. Despite doing well grade-wise in each of those, I found myself severely behind the rest of the class in spoken Spanish because all of the other students who tested in were significantly better and seemed misplaced in the class. In fact, one student had already completed L3 and L4 abroad but still somehow took L3 again. This resulted in a classroom where many of the students were conversation while I (and the other students who took L1 and L2 at Yale) were very behind, especially verbally.",
    "No",
    "Yes, it is a solid language course."
