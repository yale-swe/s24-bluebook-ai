I feel like I am leaving this class with a greater knowledge of poetic tradition and a love for the craft as well that I will carry with me in my future classes and reading. I feel so much more comfortable interacting with poetry in my academic and daily lives.",

                "enjoy the seminar format and the analysis of poetry in class",
                "Professor Levine did a great job of facilitating lively discussions in class. The poets we studied were well-selected. However, I would have liked to spend more time with some of the more influential poets. We spent only a single class, for example, discussing T.S. Eliot. Additionally, some of the earlier poets were a bit archaic and difficult to decipher, so I would have appreciate assistance with simply reading and understanding the earlier content.",
                "Professor Levine is a great professor and really good at leading discussion. I enjoyed all the poems we read for the most part, but I do wish that some poets weren't left out (i.e Elizabeth Bishop, Elizabeth Barret Browning). These are poets that were often referred to in some way, and because we didn't read them I couldn't quite understand the references.",
                "One great strength of this course was the focused readings. We focused our readings on specific poets and learned about them in class which allowed us to really understand the methodology behind each poem better. This class also had really engaging discussions during section, which made me want to read the poem's to the best of my ability in my own time instead of simply skimming. It has a great curriculum that allowed us to explore a number of different poets from a number of different backgrounds while still allowing us to see a connections through their works.",
                "I wish we had more time to cover gothic and postmodern poets! Also would have wanted the discussions to be more in-depth instead of a gloss of the century and time periods.",
                "I loved this course!! The layout was extremely organized, and I appreciated the balance between discussion and lecture.",
                "The poetry is great and the teacher is great.  I'm not sure how this could be improved."

                "very nice intro poetry class",
                "This course can be very rewarding if you enjoy poetry. The workload is manageable and you'll read some important and famous texts.",
                "Yes! If you can, take 126 with Professor Levine.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially an English major if they have not had much exposure to poetry yet. This class introduced me to poetry after being relatively unfamiliar with the field and made me feel much more comfortable with the genre, which I think will be extremely important going forward within the English major.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Levine is a wonderful teacher, particularly in the classroom. I learned so much about the poets and the poetry that we studied and became a more confident participant in class thanks to her. Professor Levine's goal is to make sure you leave class feeling comfortable with poetry (if you're not already) and I think everyone definitely handled the medium with ease by the end of the semester.",
                "I would recommend it to students who are looking for a chill course to explore different types of poetry! But definitely not a thorough examination of poems.",
                "Yes! This is a wonderful survey of English poetry that can inform future studies.",
                "Yes.  I would recommened this to any student interested in poetry.  The class provides you with a basic understanding of important English poets and gives  you tools to read into the poet's language to determine their intent.  The readings are moving and the analysis is very helpful.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend taking this course with Naomi."
