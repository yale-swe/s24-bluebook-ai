    "Intro to Japanese, duh!\r\nBasic conversation skills, grammar and some ways to say necessary things to get around.",
    "basic, cowonvewsatiowonaw japanese",
    "Elementary level Japanese speaking and writing skills. I learned basic conversational Japanese as well as all the hirigana and katakana along with 70 or so kanji characters.",
    "Intro Japanese, so introductions, basic verb structures, vocab, all of hiragana and katakana and about 70 kanji.",
    "Prior to taking this course I did not know that sushi was a Japanese word. I did not even know that anime came from Japan. Now I know hiragana, katakana, about 70 kanji, differences between Japanese schools and American schools, differences in gift-giving culture, how to ask about recent travels, routine activities, family structure, and more. Early in the course, we discussed what the practice of \"omiyage\" meant in Japanese culture. Later in the course, our class exchanged omiyage and we had a chance to feel what it felt like to be a part of we had discussed a few months earlier.",
    "Great L1 class, manageable work load",
    "JAPN 110 was a great introduction to Japanese! We had a good balance of speaking, reading, writing, and listening practice through practicing dialogues, writing paragraphs of our own experiences, recording our writing and speaking in class, etc."

    "Great course.",
    "gweat immewsive enviwonment to weawn the wanguage, cuwwicuwum made sense chwonowogicawwy and buiwt in a wogicaw mannew\r\n\r\ncouwse shouwd not focus so much on handwwiting, students shouwd not be wosing substantiaw points because they have poow penmanship if the chawactews they'we wwiting awe cweaw",
    "This course covers a ton of material but in a very effective way. As long as one keeps up with their work and shows effort in class, they'll do fine.",
    "There were many strengths of this course. We received regular emails detailing opportunities to supplement and enhance our classroom experience with events centered around various elements of Japanese culture. The regular homework exercises and encouragement to review corrections, that we could learn from our mistakes. The peer reviews and reading selections were also valuable exercises. The language clinics were also a tremendous help with oral exercises.",
    "Really immersive environment, you will learnfast",
    "Strengths: I believe JAPN 110 is one of the few curriculums within EALL that are standardized throughout sections. It was good to know that we were learning the same material as everyone else taking 110, and moving at the same pace\r\nWeakness: Not much emphasis was placed on memorizing dictionary forms of words (we learned the conjugated present-tense form to facilitate speaking), but then later in the course, it was needed for using -te form. I think the old JAPN 110 curriculum was more grammar-heavy, and I would personally prefer a more grammar-based approach early on"

    "Yes, it's lovely!",
    "yes, if they want towo weawn japanese",
    "If a student wants to learn Japanese, this is the class for them. As someone whose only other language experience was Romance languages, this class was somewhat challenging but definitely doable.",
    "Yes!! Anyone interested in Japanese culture or language should take this course.",
    "Yes, but ONLY if willing to put in extra hours for the frequent quizzes and tests. I'd say on average, we had 2 small quizzes per week and usually a large unit\/kanji test. Daily studying is essential for learning conversations and vocab to be able to keep up in class.",
    "Absolutely. The course will challenge you and provide the resources and exercises you need to rise to the challenge. You will be surprised at how far you progress in a few months.",
    "Yes! The japanese dept is so kind, class is well taught",
    "Would definitely recommend if you want to learn Japanese during your time here I think 110 gives a solid foundation!"
