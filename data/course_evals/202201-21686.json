                "The problem sets were shockingly interesting, especially the first five or so. Also, Professor Reiche -- although fairly speedy in class -- was an EXCELLENT lecturer. She worked to learn our names, and she also brought energy and joy to every class. She is a brilliant economic mind of our time, and it was a privilege to be in her seminar.",
                "Strengths: Small class size, able to ask more questions in class, peer tutors helpful on PSETS. Workload on the lower side, but means you have to put in more work studying for the exams. When the time came, it was really time consuming\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures weren't recorded. The seminar also has a much harsher curve than you'd face in the bigger lecture bc the lecture has 400-500 with more leeway, rather than curved against a smaller section. Also lack of discussion sections, so you have to do a lot of content consolidation on your own.",
                "Strengths - well organized and clear\r\nWeaknesses - psets required a significant amount of self studying and were not intuitively understandable based on the lectures.",
                "This course's seminar style is great for keeping the class engaged. Throughout each class, we worked through example problems together which resembled our homework problems and we could ask questions at any time throughout the lecture. Professor Reiche is also amazing! When comparing my experience with that of my friends who took ECON 115, ECON 110 sounds far better and more effective at teaching.",
                "Strengths: problem sets were not unreasonably difficult and didnt take too much time\r\nWeaknesses: Curriculum was all over the place",
                "Love the small format",
                "There is not much that can be changed with an intro economics course at Yale. The entire course is extremely well organized, the problem sets help you understand the concepts and develop deeper intuition (and are directly related to the lectures), and the exams are fair."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this class, especially if a prerequisite. A function of being an introductory class, the true application of the material sometimes felt distant. By this, I mean that the concepts learned were helpful, but the math itself sometimes felt so introductory (and filled with assumption) that it did not feel fulfilling. This is a result of the subject material, and not the Professor.",
                "Yes, only if you are willing to put a lot of work in, though. The curve for the seminar is pretty harsh, so you have to study hard for the exams and stay on top of your work. However, the lecture style does keep you accountable for learning so I ended up learning so much from this course! I would also recommend looking over the content / maybe old PSETS throughout the semester so you aren't scrambling to study everything for the midterm or final. We only have once-a-week PSETS, so some might want some extra practice before exams!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if you want to try economics. My experience with the class and professor was phenomenal. I really recommend trying to get the class with Professor Reiche.",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes. This is a great introduction to microeconomics."
