            "comments": [
                "Strengths: assessment organization...it made the class much less stressful to have non-cumulative bi-weekly quizzes and I really appreciated that. I think it enhanced my learning to focus intently on one module at a time rather than trying to remember everything for a midterm or final. Professor Gendron is hilarious and I really appreciated his teaching style. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Dellaporta's slides were often a little disorganized and we would jump right into a topic without understanding where it fits into the genetics landscape and then several slides later would finally arrive at an \"intro\" slide. He also has a tendency to talk through slides by just narrating a figure with lots of genes labeled A B C D, etc. and it's basically like he's thinking out loud but not really teaching the class and it's very hard to follow. I would recommend more real-life connections to help anchor the concepts.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were fascinating and engaging and Achieve was a great platform for understanding and engaging with the material. Weaknesses: while I preferred taking several quizzes over an exam, I felt like the quizzes could have been more straightforward especially since they make up such a large part of the grade. This could have been improved by allowing multiple attempts on the quizzes and altering the Achieve quizzes to be more similar to the Special Thursday quizzes",
                "This course is great, the quizzes are soooo hard though! Review sessions are essential\r\nStrength: both professors!!!!! They're amazing in their own ways.",
                "The quizzes are packed with too much content, additionally, all assignments fall on the same day which makes it difficult to complete them all.",
                "The course covers a wide range of topics in genetics and goes into sufficient depth to understand them. It was also very helpful to livestream and record each lecture (especially in COVID, since the class was quite large) because that made reviewing before each quiz very easy. I found the assessments to be very fair, since they were a reasonable blend of memorization and problem-solving. The lectures could have been a bit better organized.",
                "Strengths: Definitely one of the better MCDB cores. The course is designed well and the quiz system is better than a midterm/final system. Weaknesses: I wish there was less content overlap with the intro bio sequence. The price of the textbook was unfortunately high, although Dellaporta was very nice about this and got us a slight discount.",
                "I do not like how there is not a final exam. I feel like my grade could have been improved if I had an opportunity to show everything I learned at the end of the term. With only quizzes, my engagement was very low because I didn't care too much about learning the material, just about passing the quizzes. \r\n\r\nAlso, they really need to revise their missed sections policy. Halfway through the semester they said if you miss a section but have a dean's excuse you can do a makeup assignment to receive section participation credit. I missed the second section due to an anxiety attack. However, I did not request a dean's excuse because I know it is Yale College rules that a dean's excuse can not be issued for missed sections or classes. I brought this up to my teacher and he disagreed with this saying that other students got excuses for missing section. Section includes a quiz which can be covered by a dean's excuse so I think the professor just used that to excuse the participation as well. I eventually just had to let it go but it really bothered me that he was excusing participation in section with dean's excuses while I followed the rules because this is not allowed. Also, like I said, this was announced halfway through the semester after the section I missed. Nowhere on the syllabus is this policy mentioned nor was it mentioned in lecture until halfway through. It's not fair to offer this policy to students without explicitly telling them. I also think the professor was annoyed at me for arguing this but I read through Yale college policies and consulted with my dean; I was just advocating for myself but eventually let it go.",
                "I think the format this year was very nice and the quizzes were mostly straightforward although some of the questions really depended on how you interpreted the question.",
                "I liked having quizzes every 2 weeks. It made me keep up with the material. I also liked having no final.",
                "Sometimes the material was overwhelming in the sense that so much was covered, but then quiz questions would only cover a few really specific topics/points covered in the lecture slides. A weakness of the course is that you never receive any feedback on your progress in the course. I didn't understand the purpose of taking a quiz and never receiving the graded version so you'd have no idea of what you got wrong.",
                "Topics were never revisited after they were taught once so it was hard to remember things long term. However, it was a very organized course with a lot of resources.",
                "The lectures were good but sometimes the number of slides and content is just super discouraging to learning the material. I appreciated breaks during lectures for Gendron's portion of the course.",
                "This course was well organized, and the professors were engaging. The sections were pretty boring the discussions didnt really get into depth of the paper and were mostly superficial. In addition the class was a but repetitive. This issues were fairly minor though.",
                "Did not impose a high workload while still providing plenty of opportunities and incentive to solidify understanding of the material.",
                "Great lecture slides and interesting material",
                "The content for the quizzes on this course was not always very clear or communicated to us. The sheer amount of volume from the lectures for a 10 question quiz made it difficult to understand how to best study for the course. The quizzes were also never returned to us. Even though quizzes are not cumulative and nor did we have cumulative exams, I did wish that I could see my old quizzes to understand what I did wrong.",
                "the quizzes were unnecesarily hard and the professors were not very clear about grading cutoffs etc",
                "strengths: lectures move fast but are clear. In dellaporta's section, everything you need to know are in the slides. In Gendron's section, you will also need to read the chapters. \r\nWeaknesses: quizzes do not actually capture what students know. Curving the course based on one or two questions wrong is not fair",
                "The course had a variety of material from the online book to the lecture slides to the achieve assignments that students could pull information and learn from. I liked this because it allowed reinforcement of the material from seeing it multiple times, and if something didn't make sense from the book, the lecture slides likely cleared up any confusions I had. The weekly quizzes make sure that we stay on track with the reading material. Overall, I think the class is well organized and structured.",
                "Strengths: TAs, professors receptive to questions, peers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could often be boring (especially during the second half of the course), making it hard to stay engaged",
                "This class was remarkably manageable for a Yale STEM class and the content expectations were very clear and manageable. Overall, it was a nice overview of genetics and sets up students well for future classes. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it felt a little basic at times. There were examples identical to those used in BIOL 103, so I wonder if some of that could be reduced to focus on more complicated and interesting content. \r\n\r\nAlso, the quizzes, while a nice break from midterms, were sometimes annoying. Especially the early Dellaporta quizzes felt like they were out to trick us as opposed to test our knowledge. The Gendron quizzes, while requiring more memorization, felt a bit fairer. Overall, however, the quizzes were appropriate to the lecture content and getting to drop one makes it quite fair. \r\n\r\nI also think the online textbook is unnecessary. It required students to pay over $70 when they could have just had access to the online pdfs. If the professors want some accountability, maybe there could be some completion credit reading quizzes on canvas? \r\n\r\nAlso, there was some grade transparency in the syllabus, but most students went into winter break not really knowing what their grades would be. It would helpful to have maybe a midterm assessment of section participation and reading credit so students could make any improvements if needed.",
                "Strengths: Achieve textbook platform allows students to learn content for class in a risk-free way. Lectures were recorded.\r\nWeaknesses: The first half of this course lacks organization, and more practice content should be offered because the tested content significantly differs from what the textbook focuses on. The lectures in the first half of this course were not created in a way that was digestible for students, and it felt like students had to figure out the content by themselves through guessing what the lecturer meant while he lectured.",
                "This class was structured well. No midterm exams, which helped me focus on learning the content and taking biweekly quizzes to demonstrate my knowledge.",
                "The professors were amazing stem professors and obviously very passionate about their work. The quizzes were not the best way to test knowledge at least not to me. I felt like I got the hang of how to take the quiz but I dont think my understanding of genetics related at all too how I did on the quizzes, I simply got better at understanding the types of questions being asked.",
                "Both professors Dellaporta and Gendron are great to talk to during office hours since they have lots of field experience they are willing to share with students and it compliments the class material very well. The lectures are fast and a bit hard to note down but if you take the time to read the textbook, do the practice problems and go over the lecture notes again, you'll learn a lot.",
                "I really enjoyed the biweekly discussion sections",
                "Strengths: THE FORMAT! I think the 6 quizzes format and a paper ~every 2 weeks was great! Also, having section be in class every two weeks was really nice as it allowed a longer section without cutting into class time. Also, Dr. Gendron is maybe the sweetest prof I have ever interacted with. Both profs were pretty good lecturers as well. \r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness is the $75 online textbook that I didn't need to read to do okay in the class. Also, some of the papers were REALLY dense, and it would have been helpful to have more instructor help before we were expected to tackle them independently. In addition, Dr. Dellaporta's slides were sometimes confusing.",
                "Gendron is awesome and really engages the class. Dellaporta is okay but doesnt explain things in them most accessible way. The course was also very unaccommodating to some special circumstances I had which I did not appreciate at all.",
                "Good lecturer; more practice resources would be nice",
                "Strengths: organized\r\nWeaknesses: could be more interesting, engaging, a lot of the material seemed to be redundant with intro sequenc",
                "The use of Achieve was really helpful for feedback and supplemental videos.",
                "The lectures were engaging but the stopped posting quiz keys halfway and they don't pass the quizzes back, so feedback is not great.",
                "Overall, a good course. The quiz every unit with no exams format allows you to focus on mastering each unit. Dellaporta's lectures are very straightforward and easy to study off of. Having practice quizzes was very helpful when studying. Only weakness was having to adjust to a different lecture/quiz style when professors changed.",
                "The quizzes were very case based and quite difficult, but the comprehensive review of the material helped give basis for answering them.",
                "I thought the lectures were usually pretty engaging and interesting, and, while it wasn't fun in the moment, it was definitely a strength to have the weekly quizzes as opposed to two or three exams. One weakness was that we are unable to receive our graded quizzes so that we can use them as study materials.",
                "The strengths are that the lectures and reading are extremely helpful in understanding the material. A weakness was that the quizzes did not have much practice problems associated with them.",
                "Very very relevant material, taught very well \r\n\r\nCould possibly be more focus on clinical applications like end of year sections on precision medicine in oncology or something like that, bit more translational curriculum would be nice, but overall course is great.",
                "J",
                "The course was very well-formatted. The lectures were always intriguing.",
                "I think this course covers a good range of topics related to genetics. I think both teachers were very engaging and great lecturers. However, I think the quizzes were too difficult for what was covered in the course. The wording of the quiz questions was also very confusing and should be rewritten. Also, the review sessions on Wednesday never seemed to be very helpful. It just seemed as though the TAs were a bit lost and didn't really understand the material well enough to answer questions.",
                "I liked that this course focused mostly on understanding, with mostly reading assignments and a few problems, spread out over two weeks. However, I felt that the quizzes every two weeks felt very rushed, as often we had just discussed a topic just two days before the quiz that would include it. I also thought that the time limit for the quizzes tended to be too short.",
                "Strengths - well laid out, system of biweekly quizzes makes you keep up with the course material while still being mangeable. The online coursework also is helpful for reference and studying.\r\nWeaknesses - some of the quizzes have confusing questions that aren't completely based on lectures. Once a question on a practice quiz showed up on the actual quiz, but the correct answer from the practice was not an option on the real quiz. Also the online textbook was about $75 which can be a severe financial burden to students.",
                "Most of the content was very boring and felt unnecessary to my life.\r\nThere wasn't much work, so as long as you do the bare minimum it was okay. The teachers are very passionate.",
                "Overall, I loved this class. The modules and quizzes were the biggest strength, as opposed to exams. They could be difficult, but the practice quizzes helped know what to expect. The one/main improvement I would suggest would be to always post the quiz answer keys. I know this is not always possible because students take make-ups, but I appreciated having them available on Canvas, and was sad when they stopped getting posted because it felt simpler to check my answers that way than to ask my TF to see my quiz. This is especially I did not always remember a few days later what I had gotten wrong, and I could check again for myself when the answer keys were publicly available."

                "It's more skewed towards population genetics than I was anticipating, especially the first part of the course with Professor Dellaporta. If you're looking for a course more specific to human biology, I think molecular bio might be a better option. That being said, the course was overall pretty interesting. There are no psets for the course which is amazing...you just have to read the textbook chapters and complete short reading quizzes (graded on completion) which are not busy work but actually help you understand the material. There are 6 quizzes and you're graded on your top 5. Each quiz is worth 11 points but it's graded best of 10. The best part: the quizzes are NOT cumulative. I'm not trying to say that this was an easy course because the material was intellectually challenging but I did REALLY appreciate the fact that we did not have a midterm or final and that I could focus completely on the material for each module and not stress about having to remember everything in the course - that's what your notes are for!",

                "I would only recommend it if the person was very interested in genetics. Otherwise, the course is made to be more difficult than it should be for a 200 level class. The two lecturers are great, however, the content is less molecular and much more related to population genetics.",
                "The first half of the course is not that well organized. Since the assessment style is very unforgiving (multiple choice quizzes), the difficulty of the course is very dependent on the student. If you understand genetics well, it is extremely low workload; I spent very little time reviewing before each quiz. However, if the subject is difficult for you, the teaching style for the most part is not helpful, and so it may be a lot of work.",
                "Yes, if you need a good MCDB core course.",
                "I would because it is a really interesting topic but I would say that it's hard to really engage",
                "Yeah. Relatively chill course with multiple choice biweekly quizzes. You learn a good bit and the professors are quite solid",
                "Yes, it was fairly interesting, not too hard with not much workload. Good class vibes and a lot of help if asked for.",
                "Yes, warning you get hype that there are no midterms only quizzes but then you come to the realization that a couple of multiple choice quiz questions don't let you prove your understanding of the content just how good of a tester you are. The low number of points also make it so you get it or you don't.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in genetics. Its well organized, fairly simple, and not overwhelming.  Id anything, its slightly on the boring side the concepts seemed a little repetitive to me, but if you liked bio 103 youll like this course!",
                "Would highly recommend it. The professors are both excellent at teaching and explaining the material, and they expect a refreshingly reasonable amount of work. The topics selected for the course are highly relevant and cover a broad range of the field. The discussion sections are also enjoyable because we get to go in-depth on interesting papers and are encouraged to participate and ask questions.",
                "Yes! Great course. Difficult material but if you read the textbook it helps a lot.",
                "no, find another MCDB elective. this is not a gut",
                "If you are trying to fulfill the MCDB requirement, take another course like Microbio. If you are interested in genetics and want ot learn more, take this course",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking for an interesting science credit, although it isn't a gut. It isn't too hard and most of the information covered overlaps with what we learned from BIO 103. If you keep up with the readings every week, you will do well on the quizzes.",
                "Yes. This is a really good MCDB core class to take. The grading format is amazing: only quizzes and discussion section participation with no midterms/finals. The professors are also super receptive to questions during office hours. The only drawback is that the course can be redundant (compared to BIO 103 and other introductory biology courses), which make it seem boring at times. It is not challenging and a low workload.",
                "I think this is one of the better MCDB courses. The professors are really interested in their content and are excited to engage with students. It can be a bit dry and some of the quizzes are tricky, but since you get so many tries, it is better than tricky midterms and finals.",
                "Only to students need this course for their major or medical school requirements. This course in the first half (where most of your grade comes from) was a guessing game. Students came out of lecture confused and trying to piece together what we needed to know for the quiz, and if we understood those concepts. It was unnecessarily stressful. The latter half of the course was the opposite. It was extremely well organized, and complex concepts were taught in a way that made sense to everyone and there was a clear way idea of what concepts were important.",
                "Yes, pretty good and not too difficult but still learned a lot - professors are nice too and organization of the class is good",
                "Yes, this class is structured to help students succeed",
                "Yes! The profs and TFs are great.",
                "Yes, I think the content is important!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was a highly enjoyable experience and I learned a lot. It was definitely good preparation for the MCAT and a good fundamental course in my biology education.",
                "yes! I think it is important to understand genetics for many different disciplines",
                "Yes! This class was ultimately very good, especially coming off of the bio sequence.",
                "Its just fine. Nothing to write home about. The content rehashes a lot of concepts from Bio 103 without much of a fun or exciting spark. The midterm tests encourage wrote learning and cramming, not knowledge of foundational ideas and concepts.",
                "This is a great course about genetics if you are interested!",
                "Yes for basic knowledge of genetics",
                "Pretty good core core class. Wished there had been more feedback for the quizzes",
                "Yes. If you need an MCDB elective, or if you are just interested in genetics (as I was), take this course. It is very straightforward and covers interesting topics. The quizzes vs exams makes the class lower stress while still encouraging you to master the material. If you go to class and study the lectures/practice quizzes before each quiz, you'll be fine. Both lecturers are obviously passionate about their subject.",
                "Yes I would recommend it, specifically if they add a little bit more new content so that there isn't too much overlap with intro bio sequence.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The work is manageable, and it is useful knowledge for any STEM degree.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone in a science major as it just contains a lot of interesting information that I am glad to have learned even if I dont pursue genetics afterwards.",
                "Yes, extremely relevant information for anyone going into science, in both academic and industry settings. Def a key core course you should do for MCDB major with biochem.",
                "H",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student as it provides fundamental knowledge about genetics that is crucial for the medical profession and research.",
                "I would recommend this course because of the great teachers, but it was difficult. Honestly, the quizzes are difficult even if you study a lot and they are only 10 questions so it is easy to mess up on a few.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to get a more in depth view of genetics.",
                "Yes! It's a very manageable course, just biweekly multiple choice quizzes and online coursework. Overall very beneficial, I think I still learned a lot.",
                "I found this course pretty boring, but not that much work. There are biweekly quizzes that make up most of your grade so you do have to study quite a bit, but it was pretty simple besides that.",
                "Take everything I say with a grain of salt because I generally enjoy genetics, so I was pretty confident I would enjoy this class, but that being said, I absolutely LOVED this course. I thought Professors Dellaporta and Gendron did a phenomenal job of presenting the information in an understandable and digestible way, and they both did a great job at keeping me engaged. The homework was easily manageable, and I loved the course so much I often did it way in advance (sometimes even before that the first lecture of that module). I loved how the semester was broken down into modules and testing was per module, rather than a midterm and final. Dellaporta's quizzes were tricky, meaning that you could potentially work your way through it to get to the correct answer, whereas Gendron's were hard, meaning that you more so had to just know the correct answer. I know many people struggled with the quizzes, but I personally didn't find them to be too difficult and preferred this kind of testing to the standard midterm and final. I greatly appreciated getting the practice quizzes to get an idea of what the real quizzes would be like, though I do wish Gendron had provided practice quizzes before the quizzes, like Dellaporta, rather than imbedded the slides. I didn't feel like I was testing myself when I saw them the first time, as it was right after learning the material, but then I felt I couldn't actually use them as quiz review when the time came because I already knew the answers. Sometimes, the paper's could be hard to work through, but for the most part, nothing was too bad, and discussing in groups (and my TF) helped. I 10/10 recommend this class!"
