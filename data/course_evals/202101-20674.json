I often used the asynchronous days to spend a long time looking up vocabulary and consolidating my understanding of new grammar topics. I think in future, it might be helpful to have vocabulary lists sent out for each unit, to make it easier to study for tests and also to make sure we have all of the necessary vocabulary before moving forwards.",

I think short pop quizzes or in-class exercises where one could get instant feedback would be helpful."
