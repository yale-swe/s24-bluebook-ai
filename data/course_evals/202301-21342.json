Rebecca brought in many guest lecturers that helped highlight the versatility of economics and how it can be used to better our society. I learned how to use R in this class! I really appreciated our unit on the impact of education on social mobility, and how economists are improving the health care system.",
                "I learned how to analyze economic data and apply it to social issues. I learned how to write a literature review in economics.",

                "The strengths were the guest lectures and readings, they were very informative and nuanced which is very important when you deal with social issues. A weakness is that sometimes I felt the presentations could have been more engaging rather than lecture focused since its a seminar",
                "The lectures could have been a little more engaging. Overall, it was very strong.",
                "A huge strength is having Rebecca as a prof. She is incredibly accessible and makes a strong effort to connect with each student. She is an invaluable resource, as she is very current on many issues in the field. I also really enjoyed how units were split up by issue area (eg education, criminal justice).\r\nOne weakness is I wish more class time had been allocated for whole group discussion.",
                "Strengths: very interesting topics are discussed, the class is able to dive into deep discussions, Rebecca teaches in a very active, hands-on way that encourages you to not just do assignments but actually put your all in them\r\nWeakness: I think we could have had more discussion time and I wish we had a draft submission for our final paper or had a class time to peer review each other"
