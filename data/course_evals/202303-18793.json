I've notice that my brain handles smaller mathematical calculations more easily, and I'm not as afraid to tackle difficult mathematical concepts as I was at the beginning of the semester.",

                "I learned the biological applications of calculus 2 topics.",
                "I developed skills in reading and understanding mathematical research papers, especially for disease modeling. I became confident in drawing phase planes (for 1D and 2D systems), manipulating/understanding series and sequences, finding bifurcations, and greatly improved my foundational differentiation and integration skills.",
                "I learned the typical Calc 115 content, except there was a much greater focus on differential equations. By the second half of the class, we had clearly moved beyond Calc 115 and more into the realm of linear algebra and phase planes. We also had some focus on mathematical modeling of biological systems, mostly through readings that we were assigned.",
                "Quantitative reasoning, how to read math-related bio research papers, general calc II skills.",
                "I developed the insight of application of Calculus 2 level mathematics to real-life, biologically relevant situations. This course, having been a significant challenge for me, helped me achieve a consistent studying schedule and learn how to reach out to others for help.",
                "I learned a lot of new calculus techniques that built upon concepts Id learned in AP Calc AB, plus the ties between the mathematical concepts and the science of the papers we were reading were super interesting.",
                "I learned how to evaluate systems of differential equations, utilize a variety of techniques to find their solutions, and apply them to model real-world situations. I also learned about how to represent those differential equations as series, which led us to explore the concepts of infinite series and behavior in the long term with bounds, divergence, and convergence. This was my first introduction to digging into more abstract and theoretical foundations in math, which was difficult, but the overall course was grounded in the ways that these concepts could be used in a variety of disciplines to explain more concrete phenomena. I was also exposed to higher-level mathematical research papers for the first time, which introduced me to thinking about math as a tool for research and explanation."

                "John Hall cares about his students success, and he is the ultimate pedagogue. He outlines the class every day, and is very consistent with his teaching. His approach embodies the phrase \"no question is a stupid question\", even in a difficult math class. He is endlessly patient, and generous with his time. Regarding improvements, I would suggest is finding TA's who had a more solid grasp on the material, and who could explain it in clear and direct ways. Only one of the TA's met those requirements (in my opinion) which severely reduced my opportunities to go to office hours. Both the TA office hours and exams were held very late at night, 8-10 pm and 7-9 pm respectively. My brain has a difficult time functioning at these times of night and gave me a disadvantage.",
                "I think this class is very interesting! I'm not majoring in anything that I really needed to take this but i'm really glad I did. The research papers we read were all cool and I think it was a learning experience to engage with articles like that when I would usually skip over the math in complicated settings like that. I also think the class is easy to follow and do well in if you put in the work, although very easy to fall behind. I feel like missing even one class is enough to miss a devastating amount of content.",
                "The problem sets often felt more difficult than the examples we did in class and required thinking that we would not know how to do on our own. The office hours were very helpful but sometimes it felt like I got the answer on problem sets but never would have been able to recreate the work myself. The fact that the lectures were recorded was very helpful because if you miss a day in this class you fall behind very quickly.",
                "This course is overall very supportive, very thorough and enriching, and is palatable in terms of the grading. A weakness, however, is how long I would spend on Problem Sets every week. If those can be condensed while maintaining teaching efficacy, this class would be perfect.",
                "Strength of the course was the professor. He really broke down the material in class and never made you feel like you were asking a dumb question. He also was a really nice grader. The problem sets were sometimes too long and difficult and compared to what we did in class. Also the peer tutors were not very helpful.",
                "Strengths - engaging and understandable lectures, lots of opportunities for help, initially confusing mathematical concepts taught clearly and effectively, great organization with lectures available online, helpful and knowledgable TFs, overall learned a ton.\r\nWeaknesses - at times overwhelming psets and workload, some assigned papers are very difficult to understand before they are discussed in class and its unclear what parts are important to understand.",
                "This course was taught exceptionally well. There were frequent opportunities to complete example problems to test our knowledge in class, as well as times when we were supposed to collaborate with the people sitting near us. The classroom environment set judgement-free and the content, even when challenging, was engaging to me.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Hall is amazing and makes the class really engaging. ULAs were super helpful as well. Concepts were interesting and well-taught. The application of biology in math was very cool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: P-sets were quite hard sometimes, but manageable with help from office hours.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it introduces math concepts in a new and interesting way, and I feel that it answers the question of \"why does this concept matter in real life?\" very consistently. I couldn't identify a particular weakness of the course itself, but I feel like one strength was that it forced me to face my own weaknesses as a student, which resulted in my personal growth.",
                "The heart of this course is John Hall and everything he gives to continuously improve the content and his teaching. He absolutely made this course and created an environment where I was motivated to succeed. I also appreciated his availability, as well as the frequent peer tutor office hours. I thought the course was divided up well into different topics so that nothing blended together, which helped with studying for the midterms. Because we went so in-depth into each topic, it was also nice that there was no cumulative final. I also really enjoyed the papers that we read, and even though some of them we only covered briefly in class, the amount of extra online resources John Hall provided meant I could always eventually understand them. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets were extremely difficult and well beyond what we covered in class. I doubt I could have completed some of them without multiple hours of attendance at office hours each week. This was definitely my most intensive class when it came to workload. I understand the benefit of harder problems, but a few times, even once I had the solution, I still was left with frustration and confusion. Perhaps they could be more incorporated into the lectures, but we also moved at a fast pace so I doubt there would be room."

                "I totally would! I would even take the math 120 version of this class if it were being offered next semester (sadly it is not:( ). It was an interesting class and not ever super difficult. If you do the work and take the help when offered you can probably do really well (going in to the final I think if I study in any meaningful way I will probably do extremely well). That being said if you aren't actively trying to do well, the class can very quickly become very difficult and very sad.",
                "Yes, but I would not suggest taking this course just because you are interested in biology. Biology only shows up in the readings and it is barely present. However in terms of the professor and the class, yes I would recommend this class to anyone with a background in calculus and a love of math.",
                "I would recommend this class to the computationally and biologically inclined student. This math fulfills an Integral Calculus credit, but does go much deeper and complex into math than what I think a standard class would. The reward, however, is a more profound and well-rounded understanding of the life sciences",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the professor really takes the time to help students understand the material.",
                "Yes! I thought the biological aspect of this course made it a lot more interesting than Math 115, I would definitely recommend this class to any biology student or to anyone who enjoys math. It was really cool to learn things that helped us understand previously indecipherable scientific papers. Its not easy, and for the first month especially I felt overwhelmed and unsure if I could succeed, but it got a lot better throughout, especially due to utilizing office hours. If you are interested in biology/math and have the capacity to put in a lot of time into completing the (often very difficult) psets, I would definitely recommend this course!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot beyond the typical calculus curriculum and felt a good balance between being challenged and still understanding what was happening in class.",
                "Definitely. It may be a tiny bit more challenging than MATH 115 due to the combination of bio and math, but that is made up for by the quality of the instructors and other students in the class. I would absolutely recommend.",
                "I would generally recommend this course to a student that wants to step outside of their comfort zone and be intellectually challenged. However, I would not recommend this course to a student who is interested in simply learning the pure math of Calc 2, or to students with a weak foundation in Calc 2.",
                "I would recommend this course, but it would probably be helpful to have taken AP Calc BC in high school. I took AP Calc AB and still did well, but I found a lot of the content (particularly past the first third of the class) to be quite challenging. That being said, Professor Hall is patient and engaging and answers questions very clearly, and the biosciences aspect of the class (in the form of reading scientific papers) is quite interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Since I could not take this class my first semester, I had to make a decision of whether to wait an entire year to take a math course or go with 115, and I believe I made the right decision to take 116. Not only was the structure and teaching far beyond most classes I have taken, thanks to John Hall, but I learned more than any other class because of my growth as a student. For someone like myself who finds pure math uninteresting, the connection to real-world situations was absolutely critical to my engagement in this course, which in turn facilitated my learning. I had only taken Calc AB, but I still felt like I did not come in less prepared than most of my peers. It might have helped me with series and similar topics that were entirely new to me, but I ultimately found that if I dedicated more time, the support from John Hall and the peer tutors made it more than attainable to do well. I also saw a lot of collaboration between students in the class, especially at the peer tutor office hours (which are extremely helpful!!)."
