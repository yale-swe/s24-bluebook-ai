We then applied this ourselves in our semester long projects (more so the starting part than the taking to completion given the timeline)",
                "I developed greater project managing skills and wider knowledge of many different companies trying to further the sustainable development goals.",
                "I develop project management skills and learned about a lot of different interesting speakers and their projects",

                "Through this course, I learned a lot about the different approaches that can be taken to help sustainability and the environment. I got to speak with both undergraduates and graduate students in the course and hear their opinions about how to improve sustainability and I found this really interesting. The skills one gains in this course really depends on what they choose to do for their semester project. In my case, I learned how to build a website. I learned an abundance about mental health systems and resources at Yale. I met many kind people through my personal research for my semester project and this was invaluable. I gained insight that policy may just be the best way to make an impact in the realm of sustainability.",
                "I learned a lot of information from amazing speakers! Some where more interesting than others, but I was able to really engage with people who were experts and\/or leaders in their field. I didnt know much about the SDGs going into the class and I feel like I know just how deep (and ambitious) they are.",
                "This course was really interesting because it covers so many different topics. I didn't know anything about the Sustainable Development Goals before taking this course and over the semester I learned about their strengths and weaknesses and how many different people take different approaches to the goals. The structure of the course is to teach you to take active approaches to issues outside of just research, which was a valuable approach different from how most courses operate at Yale.",
                "I was exposed to a wide range of perspectives and ways of approaching the sustainable development goals put in place by the United Nations. I gained a broad and multifaceted understanding of different career trajectories that are related to sustainability and generally the task of tackling the climate crisis. Learned about a number of different fascinating occupations and a lot of interesting work that is being done all around the world to advance meaningful causes. Heard from leaders in the field from a wide range of backgrounds.",

                "Such a good class!! I learned so much and the project is really rewarding to take on",
                "The speakers for this class are tremendous. \r\n\r\nThe feedback on written assignments can sometimes be unclear.",
                "Super flexible to whatever skills a student has. Could be slightly improved by having in person speakers - it felt redundant convening in a classroom just to join a zoom",
                "Could be more structure, but loved the curriculum and projects!",
                "Kinda said this in the other section, but while the lectures were really interesting, I think the projects were left as a sidenote to the rest of the class and didn't receive much guidance or focus during the class as I would have liked. \r\nThe guest lectures could be hit or miss, but were generally a strength and added great variety to hear about different groups every class.",
                "strengths: amazing guest speakers and a super dedicated professor who always made himself available to students outside of class. weaknesses: wish there were more opportunities to get to know our peers, as the class didn't feature a discussion section.",
                "Strengths: Very well-organized and structured, assignments were reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The peer networking aspect kind of fell off towards the end of the course",
                "Sometimes the class felt a bit long, the room was hard to hear the professor in.",
                "Amazing to hear from professionals and an incredible opportunity to network. BUT feel like I didnt really learn, only gained an appreciation of the work being done. I would have appreciated more formal instruction on the actual SDGs themselves, maybe with only one day of guest lectures per week. Am so grateful to be exposed to these people but again, not much learning or academic rigor",
                "I loved the format of this course. I wish more of the lectures were in person rather on Zoom.",
                "The course was super cool! I really liked the flexibility students were given.",
                "Strengths: support from professor and TA's, the speakers were great, and having to write discussion posts in advance really meant we came into class ready to engage with the speaker. Also the feedback on every assignment was super thorough!\r\n\r\nWeakness: minor detail but the deadline to submit discussion posts by noon the day before was sometimes difficult as the materials for the speakers were not always posted too far in advance. Even just moving the deadline to the evening (or posting speaker materials earlier) would be easier to meet\/would accommodate for different schedules.",
                "It could be good to start this course with a more general overview of the sustainable development goals and also make sure each speaker is more focussed on connecting back to the SDGs.",
                "They expect you to implement a sustainability project but it feels like they taught us nothing about project implementation. Also way too little attention focusing on the ethics of white people going into Global South countries to build sustainability projects",
                "Very interesting speakers\r\nShould make it more structured like a discussion section for each speakers to discuss main takeaways because sometimes it felt like it was just a series of random speakers",
                "strengths: hands on, lots of help from professor, creative freedom, real world application \r\n\r\nweakness: professor didnt teach at all",
                "This class covers some really important topics however I thought the classes could have been run better. I think a mixture of lectures and speakers would have made the classes more engaging. Also, i think having some in-person speakers would be fun !!",
                "I appreciated the idea of bringing in lots of guest speakers from cool fields to talk to us, but it felt really hard to engage with the guest speakers as a large class gathered in person interacting with a visitor on zoom. I think it would have been a lot more interactive if it was a smaller class or if the guest speakers came in person. \r\n\r\nSome of the guest speakers, like representatives of the Yale police, felt kind of irrelevant to the SDGs. I think for the cities speaker it would have been a lot more interesting to learn something about transportation or other urban challenges other than safety. \r\n\r\nAlso, there were SO many technical difficulties all the time with the guest speakers on zoom speaking to a class in person, so that made it even harder to engage.",
                "The strengths of this course are by far the professor, Gordon Geballe, and the teaching fellows. Gordon speaks and brainstorms personally with each of his students. I found this personal environment to be motivating as well as extremely fun and helpful while planning and executing my project. Perhaps one weakness of this course is that the speakers are online, however, the choice of speakers was amazing so I really have no complaints.",
                "The Professor works very hard to bring in the best guests possible and clearly cares about all of the class involvement. He puts a lot of enthusiasm into developing our ideas into both feasible and interesting semester topics. In my opinion, the freedom of the project was what made the class great. Some of the speakers were not as interesting as I hoped, though that is likely in part to the fact that the class was over zoom.",
                "This course is unique because each class has a different speaker discussing their work. This is great because you learn about many different issues and some really cool projects. You are introduced to fascinating people and you have the opportunity to ask them questions and keep in touch after the class. This also means that the course is somewhat unpredictable. There may be one speaker whose work you are very interested in and the next is more difficult to connect with. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it's just something to be aware of when considering taking the course. Professor Geballe and the TFs were extremely helpful and responsive to any questions throughout the semester.\r\nAlso, because the course is entirely project-driven on your own initiative, you get out of the class exactly what you put into it. It can be really valuable, but if you put in minimal effort you won't get much out of the class.",
                "Strengths: The wide range of guest lecturers. There were many speakers, ranging from government officials to non profit founders, from architects to green bankers. Every class period, there was a different guest lecturer and it seemed like there was a speaker for everyone, regardless of your major or specialization. Other Strength: the semester-long final project was a great way to do a deep dive on something that you're interested in, whatever that may be. The creative flexibility we had in choosing our projects combined with the helpful support of Gordon and the TAs made for some really fascinating final projects.\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly readings and reading responses were often a drag for me but were sometimes actually very fascinating, depending on what the specific topics were. The wide range of topics that we covered allowed for a bit of variability in how interesting or engaging the readings were.",
                "This course is great to build and implement a project, but the only way that you will fully take advantage of this is if you are willing to put in a considerable amount of work outside of class to actually implement the project. This is not to say that the class is a lot of work, it is a pretty low workload class when all is said and done and your grade doesn't depend on whether or not you implement the project, but if you don't have any intentions of actually making your project a reality it isn't going to be a very valuable class for you.",
                "Strengths: Fun, low-stress class led by a professor and TFs who want students and their projects to succeed. We talked to a new, insightful guest speaker each class, and the teaching team was happy to try to connect students with the speakers they wanted to speak with further\/network with. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel that there was sometimes an assumption by part of the teaching team that students who did not verbally participate often by asking speakers questions were slacking off or not engaged. This is not an issue unique to this class, so I generally think that professors need to be more aware of characteristics such as anxiety and neurodiversity that may influence a students participation and therefore unfairly disadvantage them when graded for participation. All students had already fulfilled our requirement to compose and post questions for the guest speakers to Canvas, but it was not simple for everyone to say them out loud, especially when speaking to some of the more imposing speakers."

                "Yeah, it's a super chill course and it's interesting just to hear all of the really cool guest lecturers come in. I think I was looking for the course to be more focused on designing and supporting the SDG projects which I feel like could have been interesting to get into more, but they felt kind of like a sidenote to just hearing about all the work that the lecturers are doing related to SDGs.",
                "A must-take course. I think it is only being taught once more, but please do take this course. The guest lecture format was amazing, I feel I gained so much useful knowledge about the real world and career paths and ways I can work to help solve the world's problems. The TA's were fantastic and really made the course and I think Gordon did a great job picking them (and likely always does). Semester-long project was pretty chill and fairly interesting, but again the structure of the course and lectures were truely just fantastic.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any student interested in getting into impact-focused work and even students who are not  it might alter your perspective. It is organised incredibly well and there is just so much exposure and support afforded throughout!",

This whole course is based around developing this project and would be very helpful to students who have a great idea that they want to spend a lot of time on.",
                "No. They expect you to implement a sustainability project but it feels like they taught us nothing about project implementation. Also way too little attention focusing on the ethics of white people going into Global South countries to build sustainability projects",
                "Yes very interesting",
                "ABSOLUTELY! One of the only classes with direct real world application. Everything we learned is very interesting and useful. The workload is also super manageable and developing a project was really fun and helped build my confidence as a student.",
                "Yes it is a really interesting class and the project is not as scary as you think !!",
                "honestly idk. if it continues to stay a large lecture-sized class, with most of the guest speakers being on zoom,",
                "YES!!!! This course seems to be the only course that Yale offers that has such a flexible semester project. You can truly take it any direction so the experience with the course is what you make of it. I think this course would be an extremely beneficial experience for everyone. Plus it really isn't too hard at all, but you still learn A LOT.",
                "Yes",
                "If you like independent projects and learning about sustainability, yes! The speakers can sometimes feel irrelevant, but that is the nature of a class with very different topics each week.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. If you are excited about the course material and working on a personal project, this course is amazing. You get lots of freedom with your project and lots of support. You are empowered to make connections with people leading work on your topics of interest and also to learn from your peers and the speakers in the class. However, there is very little structure to the course so if you struggle with entirely self-driven projects, this may be more difficult for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot about the sustainable development goals, the complexities (and, often, impossibilities) involved in achieving them, and the wide range of occupations that advance causes related to them. Overall great course, highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take action on one of the sustainable development goals and has a clear idea of how to do so. If you are more interested in something academic, this class probably isn't for you because it is very oriented around getting things done rather than learning about the best ways to do so. The class wasn't capped, but I think it probably should have been. If it is capped in the future, I expect that it would become much more valuable.",
                "Yes, especially as 2022-2023 will be the last year Professor Geballe teaches this course! This is a low stress yet rigorous class where you get to work on a project of your own creation with 100% support from Professor Geballe and the TFs. This years TFs, Ananya and Ali, were fantastic!
