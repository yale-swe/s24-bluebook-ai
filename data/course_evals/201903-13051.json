    "Knowledge of the Middle Ages and the variety of elements that comprise the period; an appreciation for the earlier works that I had never read or heard of before",
    "We learned a broad overview about authors in the medieval period.",
    "I learned a ton about medieval literature in many forms, from travel literature to poetry to autobiography. I appreciated the \"multicultural\" lens of the class because it felt less Eurocentric than, say, English Poetry I. We also were encouraged to think about art and music as Prof Butterfield brought in musical guests and brought us to the YUAG. I definitely see influences of medieval lit in other classes I've taken, which feels very rewarding!",
    "A blanket history of the Middle Ages with a focus on travel, Medieval women, and religion.",
    "Background knowledge of several key moments and trends in medieval history; practice in assessing primary and secondary sources to formulate complex arguments.",
    "This course helped me think more expansively about the Middle Ages, especially with respect to expectations about gender and sexuality.",
    "I learned much more about the Middle Ages and the complexities and nuances of this period than I expected to.",
    "I learned about medieval culture, literature, and religion. I learned a bit about reading manuscripts and Middle English.",
    "Definitely acquired knowledge\/information to drop around, not so much developed writing skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were hard to follow\r\nReadings were great and fascinating",
    "The course made an attempt to branch out to other institutions on campus like the Beinecke and VR program. Great idea, and it was nice to get away from the classroom for a bit! The guest lectures were also very interesting. There was even a musical performance at one point!",
    "I think a strength of this course was the low workload and options that Professor Butterfield gave for our final project (could be a research paper, a close-reading paper, or a creative project). However, there were some serious flaws in the syllabus and Professor Butterfield's approach to the term \"multicultural.\" We stayed in England for the majority of the course, and largely studied texts either written by white males or translated by white males. We were also told during shopping period that we would talk about how the word \"medieval\" has been appropriated by white supremacist  groups, but we never got to this modern-day application.",
    "Strengths -- intriguing premise (Professor Butterfield is so knowledgeable), fairly engaging readings, the extra activities like the art gallery visit were cool. Weaknesses -- lecture felt super disjointed, to the point where almost nobody showed up for it anymore. Sitting there felt mildly interesting but also ultimately pointless, which is a shame. I felt like I could have researched the two papers totally on my own and essentially produced the same work for the class without engaging in it. The final creative assignment option was an interesting idea but also way too open-ended....it might benefit from a rubric or clearer guidelines that bring it to the level of a final paper. I felt like the amount of work that some people produced for a 10-12 page research paper was not equivalent to the work that people did for their creative projects.",
    "The readings are interesting, and the course covers a wide range of Medieval topics. Prof. Butterfield also incorporated a variety of media -- e.g. poetry, music, and art -- and \"visits\" into the semester, such as classes in the YUAG, the VR lab, and the Beinecke. The workload is also fairly light. \r\n\r\nThat being said, lectures were often disorganized and not particularly engaging. Most featured a summary of the readings, which took up most of the period, and there was rarely any insightful commentary or explication. Furthermore, the material is hardly \"multicultural;\" the emphasis of the course is clearly on Medieval Europe. Perhaps in an attempt to explore \"other\" cultures, there were a few lectures on anti-Semitism, but they bordered on insensitive and hardly recognized the repercussions (past or present) of the Medieval persecution of Jews.",
    "Strengths: We looked at an awesome range of texts, from Dante's Inferno to Troubadour poetry to the Joan of Arc trials. It felt very multidisciplinary and also approachable, for most students in the class were not medieval scholars. The class was very relaxing at 9:25 AM, and the teaching fellows were SO wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main weakness of the course, to me, was that most students didn't show up to lecture. It would have been SO much more lively and collaborative if attendance was better. This isn't a reflection of the course itself, but I think people would definitely have got more out of the course if they came to class. I know 9:25 is early, but it's a relaxing class so it's not a chore to attend. I also wish we focused a bit more on texts than on historical context, but I totally understand that knowing the historical context helps us understand the texts more.",
    "I found the material really interesting but struggled reading the Middle English--more direct textual engagement may be helpful, especially at the start of the course when beginning to read the materials.",
    "Weaknesses: Such a large span of time! Hard to feel like an expert when there's so much to learn... Certainly more background knowledge on my part would make this class more enjoyable. This was my first experience with Medieval coursework. Also, I found it difficult to read the Middle English. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Fun to tie the themes together across the works we read! Even though the content felt initially spread out and not necessarily cohesive, I understood eventually that it was!",
    "This course could work very well as a seminar! It is perfectly designed to probe at questions that really need student input (what is multicultural, what role do POC and women play in (re)telling of medieval history, etc.). I left the class thirsty for more, which is how I think it should be!",
    "It felt like it could have been a better seminar course. The material was interesting but better suited for discussion rather than lecture",
    "I loved many of the readings for this course  as someone who doesnt typically read Medieval literature, that was a huge strength for me. I especially loved reading about the anchoresses and delving into Wycliffe and Tyndales Biblical translations. Section was also wonderful! I also really appreciated that Professor Butterfield made an effort to use technology and multimedia tools. Some were a bit more fruitful than others (Im a bit uncertain about the purpose of the virtual reality lab, but the art gallery was really informative!)\r\nFor future iterations of the course, I think lectures could be a bit more focused on analysis. Often, Professor Butterfield devoted much time to summarizing the readings and showing us slides of related artifacts or images, but I think the course raised many tough questions we never really delved into, and we could have spent far more time directly discussing those issues. There were also a few moments in the class that came off as a little insensitive (such as a couple of comments during the anti-semitism lectures on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, very close to the anniversary of the Tree of Life shootings). We spent the last class problematizing the word multicultural, which was an interesting conversation but I think Professor Butterfield could have considered that conversation at the outset of the class, and perhaps changed the language and structure of the course around a more useful concept than multiculturalism. Finally, we hardly read any texts that were outside of a Western European context, which seems like the greatest flaw for a class called the Multicultural Middle Ages. For some of the other cultures we explored (such as Judaism), we read about them from a Christian perspective (even though there are plenty of Jewish Medieval texts that are super interesting.) I hope next years class includes more diverse readings.",
    "Strengths: engaging material, passionate professor and TAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a bit disorganized, sometimes seems to lack a cohesive thesis or goal.",
    "Weaknesses: lecture is boring and mostly inconsequential, therefore a lot of students skip. Section is so brief that there's very little in-depth discussion of the readings. Introductory medieval classes are tough because the really interesting questions of medieval literature tend to come from issues of language, materiality, and historicity, and those are just really inaccessible to students without a background in medieval studies. So the whole thing ends up feeling superficial and pointless. I think this would work better as a seminar.\r\nStrengths: interesting breadth of material, a fair amount of creative freedom in assignments.",
    "I found it difficult to connect our units the various weeks. The Middle Ages is a huge time period and I dont think we covered it chronologically. The timeline was generally unclear and the lectures didnt really help orient me. I do think the goal of this course is a good one though! I thought it was to show facets of the Middle Ages that have been ignored or misrepresented and investigate their relevance to our own time.",
    "Strengths: Friendly and low-workload, weaknesses: seemed lackluster"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes but the student must be ready for a challenge. The texts are old and dealt with themes that are challenging, while the language was also a challenge to understand and work with just by nature of how old the texts are. The writing assignments were also challenging for the professor holds her students to a very high standard, and the writing prompts allowed for a lot of freedom.",
    "No. I loved Seamus as a TA, but Professor Butterfield seriously overlooked what the term \"multicultural\" means, which was very disappointing.",
    "As it stands, no. I think the course could improve a lot if the lectures' trajectories were tightened up and students clearly understood what they were supposed to gain from each one. I felt a bit like I was attending interesting ted talks on Mondays and Wednesdays, but I didn't retain or use much of the knowledge.",
    "Great way to fulfill the medieval requirement.",
    "Not unless you need to fulfill the Medieval Literature requirement for the English Major.",
    "I would recommend this course as a medieval credit for the English major because it feels far more interdisciplinary than other English courses, as we discussed art and history rather than solely texts. I loved the opportunity to do a creative project for the final! It was a shame that not many students came to lectures, because it would have felt much more productive if we were able to have more collaborative discussions like Professor Butterfield intended. It is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it-- and I, personally, loved being able to go to the VR lab, the Beinecke, and the YUAG. The content is very interesting, especially (in my opinion) our discussions of astonishing holy women and troubadour poetry. I would definitely recommend this class and I would recommend that people SHOW UP to this class to get more out of it.",
    "The professor and the TAs are wonderful and kind and so enthusiastic, and the material is really interesting. I think it's honestly on me for not engaging more with the course, not with any fault in its design. I felt a little bad, cause a lot of students just needed the credit and were not as engaged as the professor wanted us to be.",
    "Definitely, I was not particularly interested in the Middle Ages before I took this course, but had a fantastic time. Professor Butterfield really looks for ways to make that period tangible and relatable, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about it!",
    "Yes! A nice taste of Medieval works for someone who hasn't been exposed to any yet.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who is genuinely curious to learn more about medieval history from a literary perspective.",
    "In all honesty, I would not recommend this course to another student as it is. I do think it can be revamped into a powerful course by incorporating more texts that are truly multicultural, centering lectures on analysis, and possibly incorporating literary theory that accounts for the complexities of religion and race.",
    "Yes, Id recommend it. Its a very engaging course, a bit all over the place but youll learn a lot and youll come to a greater understanding of the complexities and nuances of the Middle Ages.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you really need to just grit your teeth and get the medieval requirement over with. The level of intellectual inquiry is not particularly high, although papers are graded somewhat harshly compared to other 100-level English classes. The class does some interesting things (VR! YUAG!) and the readings span a broad range of genres, but the quality of the lectures just isn't great. On the other hand, lectures are often more chill than seminars in terms of reading load and discussions. Take it if you have to--if you love medieval lit, take a seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course if an English major wants to fulfill the Medieval Requirement or is super, super into the period. I found the information presented interesting, especially the historical context which you dont often get in an English class. But the lectures didnt really enhance my understanding of the material. I found it hard to connect between them.",
    "For any English student trying to get their requirement, this is a good one to fill it out"
