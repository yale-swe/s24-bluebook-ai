    "A better understanding of later philosophers! With a classics background, I was able to think more about the ways in which modern philosophers interacted with the texts I typically spend more time with.",
    "I gained a lot from reading the authors we did. I learned a lot about the evolution of the spirit behind how we formulate our laws, the importance of structuring them in such a way that they meet specific cultural and social specifications, and how liberal ideology has fluctuated over the past three hundred years."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely wish we had discussion questions that were provided for each week so that we could prepare for what we would hit in class. I feel like we often had an open floor, but the amount of reading made it difficult to really focus on specific sections of the texts fruitfully. It would be helpful to have 3 discussion questions or so that everybody could prepare for altogether such that everyone could interact with the comments of others.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I thought that the course had very interesting texts and very brilliant people. I enjoyed the discussion presentations that would occur in class, and I also enjoyed Professor Oskian's overviews that would start the class as a mini-lecture.",
    "Great reading selections! Balance of those who are very familiar with the material with those who had a great opportunity to engage with it for the first time."

   "comments": [
    "This is a quintessential seminar! Professor Oskian opens the floor to discussion, and the class is carried off of student comments and Professor Oskian's responses. She's truly brilliant and a very generous listener. That being said, you obviously need to spend a lot of time on the readings  particularly if you haven't engaged with the authors as much before. The success of the class is dependent on the engagement of the students in it.",
    "I would. I would recommend to any person of any major who wants to learn about early-modern to modern philosophical topics.",
    "This is a wonderful course, and a must-take for all students of political theory. Professor Oskian does a superb job at guiding the class through high-level texts from Hegel, Montesquieu, and Tocqueville. You'll learn about the ways these thinkers interact with one and other, and how they have shaped the course of political and sociological thought over the last three hundred years."
