                "Strengths were the Colloquium's being very interesting, and prep of asking questions. Some weaknesses were that we didn't get to review research methods making the reflections a little hard to connect to research methods at times. Overall I really liked the course.",
                "I was really disappointed by this course. I was expecting to engage more with methods and methodology, but we never actually met as a course to talk other than at the very beginning. The structure of the course was entirely based around our attendance at the WGSS  colloquium, where we listened to graduate students speak. I learned a decent amount from the graduate students and from their research methods, but I wasn't guided much in my learning at all. Often readings were posted late, and we weren't really instructed at all. I like the idea of learning from other people's projects, but I wish we had any sort of way to learn from Dara or from each other along the way. I don't know what the old structure of this class was, but I'm almost certain it was better!!",
                "The course offered us the chance to see how WGSS scholars and students go about doing their research -- the Working Group sessions were often insightful and I found it interesting to see how graduate students were blending WGSS methods with other fields (like English, Anthropology, Science, etc.). It was definitely a cool opportunity to see the inner workings of the WGSS discipline. However, we only met as an undergraduate class once during syllabus week, and it certainly would have been beneficial to meet more. The class requires students to individually engage with the Working Group, but there was no time devoted to class-wide discussion, reflection, or argument. Because these Working Groups were mostly filled with PhD students and professors, it was sometimes difficult to feel grounded as an undergraduate. While it was nice to learn from others, I didn't feel guided through all the content, and it would have been meaningful to have more class time or direct support for developing our own research/methods interests."
