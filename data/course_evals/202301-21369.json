                "The course material is fascinating but the structure itself needs more organization. Much of the course felt like it was building up to one large conclusion when the reality was once a section was taught and done, it had almost nothing to do with the next section.",
                "Strength: it was an interesting class with interesting content. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the assignments. Some of them seem trivial and did not contribute to the understandings of the class. Also the last exercise in CytoScape was interesting, but I would have gotten more out of it if it was focused on a tool that more economists used, like R or Stata.",
                "Not great teaching fellow who wasnt very helpful and always held remote office hours with 2 different classes and would just put people in breakout rooms. Amazing Professor amazing lectures and good explanations",
                "The strengths of the class came from Professor Igami's insights into his own research on innovation but some of the weaknesses came from the fact that the lectures were sometimes not engaging for me.",

                "YES! This is the best upper level Econ electives that I've taken at Yale. Prof Igami is super passionate and knowledgeable in this area, he is super nice/understanding, and although some papers/lectures can get technical professor doesn't expect us to know all the complex math. my only complain is that the TA wasn't very supportive/helpful. He often had no answers to our questions and instead of trying to get back to us with answers he kept saying 'i don't know. I know just as much as you guys.\" The course content itself was super interesting, inspiring, and fun to read about in your free time too. I appreciated some ad hoc articles that Prof Igami assigned about new tech (chat bot especially) because they were super relevant and fitting to our class theme.",
                "I think the course may be most valuable to anyone looking to enter business and the corporate world, whether theyre an economics major or not. The economic teachings in the course are all already taught in Intermediate Micro, so its less about the economics and more about real world impact.",
                "I am neutral about this. I did enjoy learning the content, but pretty much all other aspects of the course were mediocre.",
                "Yes very interesting perspective in economics",
                "If the student is looking for an easy economics senior seminar this is one of them.",
