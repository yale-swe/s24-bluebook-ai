   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of content in East Asian studies, but I was also exposed to a lot of anthropological theory, both older  and contemporary that was very interesting and new to me.",
    "EAST 337 engages in a series of explorations into East Asian rituals, which might be described as the performed and lived aspects of East Asian religions and spiritual ceremonies. The course provides valuable insight into East Asian traditions of Shamanism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity, interweaving historical texts with modern interpretations and applications.",
    "I learned a lot more about sociological and ethnographic studies of ritual, which I feel is often a satellite study to religion or sociology. It offered a unique, sideways view onto immensely important aspects of culture, and the course also helped contextualize the way ritual practices were argued over and transmogrified in their transmission across East Asia."

   "comments": [
    "The course had good individual discussions and lectures in class. Its main weakness was the lack of flow between classes, especially when classes were canceled.",
    "As just one note: the course's strength involves focusing on specific case studies and modern interpretative articles, which add relevancy, reliability, and a point of contact to a deep and evolving tradition. That said, shoring up knowledge of the tradition's earlier roots with more readings beyond just the in-class lecture would likely improve a minor deficiency.",
    "I liked that the class was a broad survey of several different East Asian religions\/schools of thought and their rituals, and it opened up the class to a wide variety of students from different disciplines, which I thought made for really interesting and engaging class discussions.  I thought the workload\/amount of readings of readings was really reasonable, but sometimes this plus the broadness of the course approach made me wish we could dig a little deeper into some of the topics.",
    "This course, by virtue of its expansiveness and flexibility, worked pretty well despite the extreme differences in the backgrounds of all of the students. It also meant that we had to start on the ground level of every concept we discussed, and for the weeks we didnt (diving straight into ethnography on an unfamiliar religious practice) I got confused."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because the classes were alway engaging.",
    "Yes! This is a helpful course as a way of introduction to East Asian rituals. Be advised, however, that in comparison to other courses the amount of material remains light (especially for scholars already in the field) and the amount of work is maybe even remarkably too little.",
    "Yes-- I enjoyed the subject matter, and I thought Prof. Chang did a good job framing\/approaching each of the religions with relevant readings.",
    "It was an interesting class to take, and for students who are particularly intrigued by the way religion manifests itself physically in ritual, or the purpose of ritual not only in religious environments but also social, political, and daily contexts, this class deals a lot with questioning why things are the way they are in ritual practice. It also wasn't a particularly stressful class in terms of discussion or reading load, which made it a breath of fresh air during the week."
