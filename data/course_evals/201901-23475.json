    "Strengths: Material itself is very interesting, projects were very effective at stimulating growth.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Lectures were frequently difficult to follow.  In general, I think the class would benefit from clearer learning objectives (although I think the problem is in large part due to the discrepancies in prior knowledge that different students come to the class with).",
    "Scott is such a character. You love him or you cant stand him. I loved",
    "Strengths definitely lie in the tinkering coding projects. Lectures can be a bit dry and could be improved with some more general cohesiveness."

    "I like making music.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're at all musical. For the non-music CS majors, it can be a bit tricky to pickup all of the technical lingo."
