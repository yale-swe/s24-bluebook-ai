I never took microeconomics, and while it would have been very helpful it wasn't absolutely necessary. the biggest takeaway is to consider all impacts of a policy, such as when people say it would be best to have zero pollution, that's actually not the case because of the many costs related to that which aren't environmental.",

                "Strengths: the material is not complex to understand and the psets are relatively short. The content covered in the lectures is the same as the slides. If you have a good TA, the discussion section can be interesting at times.  Weaknesses: The lectures and psets are entirely different, and so are the exams. The material is sometimes contradictory and confusing and seems outdated.",
                "Strengthes: interesting and important topics. Weaknesses: lecture was not very engaging, psets were all math but lecture was nothing like them at all. Only way to do the pset Wass from TAs helping explain them. Midterm was also so much harder than anything we had learned.",
                "The course is well structured thematically and the problem sets help to understand the concepts. However, the psets often required information that was not given during the lecture or on the main slides, but only in the TF sessions. This made independent preparation more difficult. The goal of covering all a wide range of ideas and concepts also meant that the content was very superficial and economics-centric. As an environmental science student, it was often very frustrating to have very little space for discussion.",
                "Strengths are that it's an interesting course, teaching students real life examples and encourages action.",
                "Need more instruction and relation between the psets and the material learned in class, they did not correlate that well.",
                "Strength - very prevalent to correct society\r\nWeakness - found it difficult to do the problem set sometimes because if felt separate from the lectures that were being taught in class.",
                "The course was interesting but I found that most of what is discussed in lectures are not transferable to the problem set assignments. Because of this, there was a disconnect in a lot of the topics discussed in the lectures",
                "strengths: lectures were very to the point. not much grey area on slides.\r\nweaknesses: class was sometimes wasteful as the presentation was over and the professor kept rambling on about irrelevant information just to fill time. midterm was very random and had intentionally difficult wording to confuse students as opposed to testing knowledge",
                "One strength is definitely the professor and how he puts the material across. I feel that the course is designed well and the material is not too overwhelming. However, exams could be designed a bit better given that they cover really specific types of problems and don't really test a general understanding of a course.",
                "Weaknesses: content in class did not always match the exams, especially the math was extremely hard to connect the concept from class and psets to the tests. The math portion of both exams seemed completely different and I never knew how to approach them despite actually studying really hard. Waste of my time studying for it .",
                "The course was split up well with a good amount of time given to each of the three main topics. An issue was that we did not go over lots of math in the course, but the problem sets were exclusively math, which made it a bit difficult to get a grasp on what we should know for tests.",
                "Strengths: The TF team\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class content was way too easy which resulted in the exams (specifically the math) being focused on tricky problems that were more focused on novel solutions rather than being actually diagnostic of our grasp of the course content. The math simply needs to be made harder, not more tricky. This method of examination undermined the learning of the rest of the course, students could completely check out and then were only focused on the review sessions at the end of the course where they attempted to get everything they could out of the TFs. Required sections were not useful and only were when Ken ad-libbed and taught us extra interesting topics.",
                "I was incredibly disappointed with this course. The lectures often obscured the important information to the point that the material we covered in section almost always felt entirely new. The graphs, opinions, and figures given in class were hardly - if ever - backed up by real world data (especially compared to other Econ classes I have taken at Yale which have relied on FRED, the BLS, and more). Any time a question was raised, the professor simply deferred back to what he had stated on his lecture slides. The professor had us turn in our problem sets on paper during class and often started class while people were still turning in their assignments, meaning no one could hear him over the ruffling of papers. Class often started late and almost always ran over time.",
                "the topics were interesting but it could have been taught a lot better. lectures were dry and unengaging. psets felt like they came out of nowhere compared to what we did in class and were SUPER unorganized. some of the information on the lecture slides were outdated by many years. having two exams be the majority of the grade was not an effective way to evaluate learning in the course. it was also strange that the midterm was so early in the semester. I would have more midterm, or biweekly quizzes, or something that counts participation because there were many people that never showed up anyways, and you didn't even have to because the professor just read off of the slides basically. no one did the readings even though they were interesting, they were just way too long and only provided useful context, you definitely didn't need them to do well in the class. there weren't that many great resources to prepare for the exams. practice questions would have been super useful. also, recording the lectures so that we'd be able to go back over them.",

                "The strengths of this course was that the sections clarified information from lecture, but also taught new information that is helpful for both content and for solving problem sets. The TA's were also very helpful for the problem sets. Also, the content of the lectures was, generally, relevant to present day. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that there were times that the slides were hard to understand, or hard to determine the main takeaways. Perhaps a clearer explanation of those slides or written bullet points on those slides that clarify the takeaways would help.",

                "The problem sets were super easy and did not take much time to complete. The lectures were all pretty interesting but sources were rarely provided for the charts and graphs which usually looked like they were made by the professor. The professor tended to mix facts and his own opinions in the lecture so it was important to remain skeptical",
                "strength: the curse topics are interesting and the TAs are knowledgeable and invested \r\n\r\nweakness: the course is very disorganized, the Professor makes little to no time to help students understand the material outside of lecture, the psets are not similar to what we learn in lecture, the professor is not careful enough to take the time to write a new exam and basically copied the same questions from the previous year (some students had access to it somehow and had an advantage over everyone else)",
                "More relevant curriculum",
                "The course work and problem sets were unorganized and riddled with typos. The concepts were not difficult but often it was incredibly unclear what instructions were asking. The course moved slowly which was nice at times.",
                "Strengths: content\r\nWeaknesses: course organisation + exams (no access to past papers, answers to midterm released too late)",
                "Its a good class.",
                "While course content was incredibly relevant to today's world, attending lectures does not translate directly to our abilities to solve the PSETs. Without the right TA it's really difficult to get through a lot of these PSETs because not all the equations are very clearly provided in class. The PSETs sometimes were unclear, especially the Excel PSETs, which the TAs had to clarify during their sections. As a whole, attend the sections. Sections are more important than lectures. Also, I wish the PSET solutions were posted because it was hard to understand where I went wrong sometimes. Would also make studying feel more legitimate.",
                "i wish there was more access to practice questions before exams \r\n\r\nthe problem sets were not indicative of the problem set questions on the exam \r\n\r\nMathematical teaching burden fell onto the teaching assistants \r\n\r\nthe professor never looked at students in the back of the room and he rarely looked at students beyond the first 5 rows of seating. it prevented my engagement and deterred many students from attending lecture. He hardly acknowledged anyone but those seated right in front of him. It was a poor method for fostering a learning environment.",
                "strength: I enjoyed the lecture style \r\n\r\nweakness: unorganized, assessments did not do a good job of evaluating course knowledge/engagement"
