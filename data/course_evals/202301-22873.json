However, I would strongly advise students to take it with Professor Baynes-Ross. The topic called Home was really reflective for me as it made me question my positionality as well as what helps make a place a home (is it the people? the place itself? the memories attached to it? etc.) It was extremely interesting to engage with thinkers across different disciplines and conjunctures as they raise the questions of what is home.",
