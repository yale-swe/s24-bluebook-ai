                "How to read literature through a feminist a queer lens",
                "The course takes a somewhat-deep dive into Professor Homans' interests in feminist and queer theory, specifically focusing on what it means to be a reader, the different methods and epistemologies of reading/interpreting, and how those relate to our own lives (we all exist as subjects! We all interpret, cope with the past, and project a future in every moment of our lives). My writing definitely improved a lot. Professor Homans' comments are always very deep and truly engaged in the arguments that her students make in essays. I would often learn new things or realize possible holes in my theories by reading the marginal comments she left as notes. Even though she's a very thorough grader, she's not a difficult one - please take this course if you're interested in queer/feminist theory and thinking personally about what those terms might mean for you as a student/writer of literature!",
                "I felt like I gained a solid foundational knowledge of feminist and queer literary criticism and how to apply it to various texts.",
                "I learned so much from Professor Homans! What a wonderful class - this was my first methods course, and I was exposed to so much theory and literary criticism. This class broadened my reading and writing skills, as well as my approach to understanding history/positionality/identity in the world."

                "Professor Homans is wonderful!",
                "The course was really fantastic. The only criticism I have is that sometimes our discussions would get quiet or grow a little bit vague because Professor Homans would lead us into some very big-question thinking rather than the specifics of the texts/theories we were meant to focus on for that seminar. But that might be a plus for some students - it definitely led to some awkward moments for us this semester, but it also helped me expand my way of thinking through the topics presented by the authors read in the course.",
                "The syllabus was structured in a way that helped put the texts in conversation, so all of the ideas we talked about stayed relevant throughout the course. That said, I think having some more primary texts scattered throughout would have helped some of the stretches of theory feel a little less abstract.",
                "Professor Homans is a BIG STRENGTH of the class. She is brilliant, approachable, very supportive, and so generous with her feedback. For my final paper, she literally sent me a page of comments !! Another strength is the rigorous, diverse, and rich syllabus of reading. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses besides virtual seminar format due to pandemic."
