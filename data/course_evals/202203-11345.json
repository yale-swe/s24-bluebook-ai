I learned to balance my other course while enjoying learning new language.",

I feel like I could survive a conversation in Korea and maybe even figure my way out from one side of the country to the other, which I think is pretty great. Also, coming from a linguistics background it was cool having close contact with a language very different from English and actually experiencing speaking it and feeling out the morphology and syntax of what I was saying. Finally, I was forced to discover Anki which is soo good for anything in life, it really solidified my Korean knowledge and gave me the confidence to pursue learning other languages in the future!",

The class was also paced well: it moved quickly, but we had enough review to not forgot things. Moreover, Professor Im fostered a collaborative environment in our class, encouraging us to get to know one another, practice Korean together, and seek help from one another.",
                "Strengths: \r\nProfessor engagement with students  incredibly understanding, willing to provide help, provides critiques on reading/writing/understanding that actually help with understanding for the exams",

                "Super great professor and lots of good practice for conversation done in class to review the new vocabulary and sentence structures being learned",
                "Professor Lim is the most patient teacher Ive had the fortune of taking a class with at Yale. Definitely a class to look forward to. In terms of improvement, the workbook homework assigned each week does take longer than expected, so Id find myself wanting to do my own review first than attempt the exercises.",
                "The course was taught as a much slower pace than expected, but allowed for the students to practice the language.",
                "The course covered many of the essential basics of the language.",
                "The strength of this class is that  Professor Lim did his best to keep his students engaged. I can honestly say that I enjoyed coming to Professor Lim class. He gives us feedback and I am able to learn from my mistake. There was no weakness in this class",
                "Strengths: a very well thought out curriculum - Hyunsung Lim's primary focus is actually research on how to improve teaching in classroom environments!! Also, he is very caring and overall just a great professor! Weaknesses: none that I can think of!",
                "This course is well-structured and very engaging. \r\nOne possible improvement might be to have weekly worksheets that summarize what we learn every week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lim has amazing slides and great opportunities for practice and discussion among classmates, meaning that if you participate and try to memorize the vocabulary and grammar structures during class through taking advantage of the activities, you don't have to do much studying outside of class. Lots of preparation and activities with targetted worksheets and review before the exam, meaning that I felt very prepared and supported to study rather than waste time creating my own study guides. Very accommodating to sicknesses or general absences as well as test corrections to gain some points back! An extremely fun and rewarding course:)",

I don't have Korean heritage, I'm not into K-Pop or K-Dramas, I just sort of vibed with the ratings of this course and the things people said about it - and I was so glad I did! Even if you're not that interested in doing anything remotely related to Korean in the future, the experience I had was very fulfilling, I was always excited to go to class and the close exposure to a language and culture that is very different from the West was very interesting!",
