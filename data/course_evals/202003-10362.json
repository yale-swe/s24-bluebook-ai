Or think something akin to APUSH - the history most of us know in a traditional sense. One theme that Gaddis is trying to instill in the class is that history is so much more beyond historical facts about politics and war, and indeed we spent many discussions on topics ranging from seismology and epidemiology (what a fitting time to do so), to mathematics and economics. Besides, my writing and reading improved a lot throughout the course.",

Without my really noticing, honestly, the materials we read and the ideas we discussed have percolated into my worldview. It's hard to describe what, exactly, I've learned beyond those vague descriptors without spoiling the course, but I'll just say that this course has gifted me new modes of thought and new modes of expression.",

                "Strengths: you are taking a class with John Gaddis and you get to know him quite intimately (wait for the last class...), and you get to reflect upon something new after every discussion. \r\nWeaknesses: the scope of the class might be too broad for some since we don't spend more than a week on a specific historical period, and the reading can be quite hefty.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaddis is fantastic. He lets students direct discussion but also offers his own insights and experiences (though I would have liked to hear a little more about his own experiences). The reading assignments were usually interesting though only vaguely related to each other. Writing assignments were fun and unusual. Weaknesses: None apart from the rather large amount of reading.",
                "Strengths - the fascinating readings, legendary professors, writing tasks and learning experiences\r\nWeaknesses - Nothing",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaddis is a fountain of knowledge, and you can learn so much just by engaging with him in discussion. The reading list was extremely interesting.",
                "Strengths: The course description self-selects for masochists, so you'll end up with a group of very smart, often very insightful students from all over the world whose experiences will inform discussions and turn even well-trodden paths into unfamiliar trails. The copious readings are by and large fascinatingI read mine happily, and think frequently about themespecially the professor's own work. Being able to say, casually, \"Yeah, I'm reading War and Peace,\" is, of course, an obvious plus (at least, that's one way of looking at it). And Gaddis is a clearly brilliant, engaging professor who will talk more than the course descriptor suggestsbut it's entirely worth it to have the chance to hear what he has to say, especially when he shares personal anecdotes from his career.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One feels that there's a certain je ne sais quoi missing from virtual seminar, but there's nothing to do about that. Also: Gaddis may miss raised hands on Zoom, so don't be afraid to raise your voice (politely) instead. I would add that sometimes students' analyses of readings can be a little iterative, but that's only an occasional thing.",
                "A truly amazing, inspiring class! Very structured and well organized. The only thing to improve is that the reading workload can be spaced out better.",
                "Strengths: the strength of this class is its professor and content. Professor Gaddis was very engaging to listen to and would help to foster discussion. He was incredibly helpful and interested in the progress of all students. The books that we read all had a valuable contribution to the class. The writing assignments were also thought-provoking and flexible so that students could be creative with them.\r\nWeaknesses: the value of the classes often depended on student discussion. If students had interesting comments and a conversation could form, the class was more insightful. Occasionally the discussion could become overly theoretical and students would share their thoughts without interacting with what someone else had said. The Zoom format did not help this.",
                "The discussions were very intellectual and engaging, and all the readings were diverse and stimulating. The only weakness was the online format, which nothing could have changed."

                "I think that my engagement with the class was decreased with its virtual format. Seminars are difficult over Zoom because it is hard for a discussion to develop naturally when the class isn't in front of each other. However, there isn't much way around this in the pandemic. Perhaps a clearer understanding of the 'hand-raising' protocol would help, as students in the beginning would speak over each other.",

                "Yes! This course was deeply fascinating. Even if you have only a passing interest in history, you will leave this class with a greater appreciation for the historical forces at work in day to day life. The readings were an interesting collection of classics, essays, fiction, and non-fiction. The reading of War and Peace occurs throughout the whole semester, so every part of the class could be related back to the novel. The class has challenged me to think critically about history and articulate these thoughts in a discussion setting. Overall, as a first-year an exceptional class with a great professor!",
