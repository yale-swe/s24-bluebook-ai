Beyond that, though, I found it quite disappointing. I came in extremely interested in the societal impacts of big data and artificial intelligence, yet looking back I can't recall what I actually learned. We covered a number of fascinating topics like automation, surveillance, and definitions of fairness; however, these complicated issues were always stripped of nuance and presented in a one-sided manner, with the good side being the leftist perspective. I'm by no means conservative, or even centrist, but as someone who's not a fan of Critical Race Theory and Intersectional Feminism this class did give me pause. A few things students or the professor mentioned: We should defund, not reform, the police; religion isn't a determinant of privilege; black people should only trust ~algorithms~ made by black people. All in all, while Professor Celis and Vijay are wonderful people, this course was neither as engaging nor as insightful as I had hoped.",
