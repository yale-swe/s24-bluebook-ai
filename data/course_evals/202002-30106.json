    "- How to develop a moral argument and respond to possible objections\r\n- What moral decision are and makes them important",
    "I learned a lot about the moral and ethical implications of technology while also learning many basic philosophical concepts that govern the way that we live and interact.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about how to think about moral dilemmas, and how to construct and support arguments surrounding these issues. We also dipped our toes into a broad range of topics surrounding the ethics of technology, and it was my first time considering many of these issues.",
    "During this course, I examined more in depth my relationship with technology and the multitude of ways it interacts with and affects my life and society more broadly.",
    "- Introduction to Philosophy\r\n- Principles of arguments (sound vs validity)\r\n- Ways to develop an argument (by analogy, consistency)\r\n- What makes a good objection, how to address it\r\n- Concepts of morality, theories of wellbeing, friendships\r\n- In-depth discussions regarding genetic enhancements, self-driving cars, algorithms",
    "A broad introduction to three significant moral frameworks: consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. I have learned the steps necessary to crafting a sound and valid argument, as well as how to address objections.",
    "A general foundation of ethics and moral philosophy, and an in-depth analysis of these principles applied to technology. Also what goes into a good philosophy paper.",
    "A lot of insights on the role of technology in my personal life but also how it shapes society's most basic and fundamental interactions. Do we have an individual choice when a technology becomes mass available and mass used? How can we be ore mindful of the larger impact of our individual actions, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about fundamental topics and skills in philosophy through the interesting and accessible lens of technology. Specifically, I learned how to participate in meaningful discussions about ethics and philosophy, I learned a lot about how to write philosophy papers and craft philosophical arguments, and I learned a lot about the philosophy of technology of course.",
    "I learned a lot about the different ways we use technology, as well as how to write an argument more clearly.",
    "Writing philosophy paper, thinking critically about the ethics of technology and the decisions we ought or ought not to make",
    "The most important skill I used was to recognize that my initial moral instinct is not always logically correct. I also learned how to build an argument, using premises with warrants leading to a claim. My philosophical writing also improved quite a bit.",
    "NONE! This class was a complete waste of time. Some of the readings are cool, but I feel like we did not go in depth is absolutely anything.",
    "I learned a lot about my own personal writing and I also learned about how to argument better. I have noticed I can compose my arguments and I know if I can't then I really shoulnd't be arguing for it. I learned more about the world we live in and I was able to change some of my opinions on ethical debates because of the discusssion with students.",
    "I learned how to look at both sides of every argument.",
    "I learned to be more open to opinions that differed from mine. Arguments I would not have considered in the past made sense to me in this class; a lot of times I also changed my stance on things. I learned interesting concepts that made issues in my own life clearer.",
    "The most striking experience that I had was applying moral theory to actual issues we face or are going to face. I have read a few introductory books on ethics, but was finding a place to output and develop my thought. The course has definitely been a great opportunity to do that! The whole course was well -structured, each week having a consistent theme, and covered many different though important issues. Thus, I became able to know what it is like to apply moral theory to a issue in real world. I think discussion-based class style contributed to maximizing this value, in that we were required to think actively.\r\nIt has been a great opportunity to develop my writing skill. Joanna gave a clear instruction in the class and on canvas, so I could manage to write the paper without extreme difficulty or mess-up, though it was the first time writing a philosophy paper. The feedback was also clear and specific, and I could learn the importance of narrowing down of the focus of my thesis and being conscious of  what point is relevant and what not.",
    "how to write a philosophy paper, how to analyze a philosophical argument",
    "I learned about the ethical and philosophical problems involved in the introduction of radical new technologies to society; for example, if a self-driving car were to get in an accident, who would the responsibility for the accident fall on? The car manufacturer? The driver? The programmer who wrote the instructions for the car's navigation systems? These and other questions are very important when on the brink of complete technological takeover, as we are.",
    "I learned how to critically think about moral issues as well as how to respond to objections to views I hold.",
    "I learned about the application of traditional ethics and philosophy to modern day technology. Given that this was an online class, I also improved my discussion skills online, as well as interacting with others in an online format. I critically assessed the role that technology plays in my everyday life and analyzed the ethicality of certain technologies.",
    "I developed the ability to critically assess an argument and to use that analysis to craft my own arguments in a logically sound and deeply insightful way! I learned the importance of communicating ideas in the clearest and least complicated way in order to reduce misunderstanding and misinterpretation. I also learned how to think about ethical issues from many different perspectives and moral theories, and to ask more questions that I may answer.",
    "This class really helped me to develop my critical and insightful thinking abilities, and helped me work on articulating my thoughts concisely.",
    "I have become better at philosophical argumentation, and gained a deeper understanding of the philosophical problems that are relevant today.",
    "I developed an understanding of the good and moral responsibility. This understanding was developed by applying these concepts to real life situations, and what the moral implications were. I also developed my critical analysis skills. This course was really helpful in honing my ability to discern the argumentative elements (premises, propositions, etc.) to decide if an idea is convincing or not.",
    "Gained massive perspective.",
    "I learned about decision making, analysis, and the ways in which technology influences my life on a daily basis. This course helped me develop a deeper understanding of the role technology plays in my life, and how I should navigate the dilemmas that arise as a result of this.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of philosophy; how to think and articulate correctly. I definitely had to think critically about some of my own beliefs which was very interesting. I think the discussion based nature of the class also helped me learn how to have a polite academic debate and respond to peers who I disagree with. I also learned a lot about technology even because you have to understand how it works before you can talk about the ethics of it.",
    "Learned to critically evaluate philosophical arguments from both sides, analyze supporting evidence from counter side",
    "I improved my writing, learned to interpret other people's insights charitably, learned to argue in terms of ethics and morals, as opposed to the standard logic I am used to.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, especially because I developed richer skills in philosophical reasoning, logic, argument, and philosophical writing. The course is structured so that we have lots of opportunity not just to read philosophy, but to practice it ourselves.",
    "I learned a lot! It made me deeply consider so much that I had never thought about before which was super cool.",
    "I developed an understanding of the philosophical ramifications and implications of the inclusion of certain types of technology into our lives, both on a micro- and macro-scale. I also learned how to write a clearly structured philosophy paper and analyze arguments from philosophy passages.",
    "The meaning of philosophy through the lens of technology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Demaree-Cotton and all of the TAs\r\n- Level of engagement with the material\r\n- Readings\r\n- The polls!",
    "Joanna really knew how to run an online course well! Everything was structured in a very purposeful way, and it made it very clear what we were supposed to learn from each segment of class. That being said, she also allowed a lot of time for us to discuss and learn from each other, really taking advantage of zoom and break out rooms so that we had different size group discussions throughout one class. \r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this course may have been grading, but only minimally. For essays, it was hard to pinpoint exactly what caused a lower mark because there were no rubrics and just feedback on individual things within the paper.",
    "The format of the course was obviously carefully thought through with regard to how to adapt the course for an online learning environment. Use of polls and breakout rooms were especially helpful to engage students in discussion and thought on the material covered. I think one topic I wished we would have covered toward the beginning of the term was the difficulty surrounding how to define and conceive of technology. For me, I found myself really intrigued by the thought of what does and does not constitute technology (like are clothes technology? fire? anything made by people? what about the way animals use basic tools?), and I would have liked to develop those thoughts more with others in the course.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Lots of discussion, even online\r\n- Lots of ways to engage, via polls, raising hands, etc.\r\n- TAs and Instructor were very available\r\n- Slides were very detailed and a good source of review\r\n- Good feedback on papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Writing resources earlier in the class",
    "Of course, since this was a summer course, the turnaround for papers was quick. I wish I had had the chance to spend more time considering the prompts and revisiting my ideas. This isn't necessarily a flaw of the course, but rather a significant detail about the reality of a 5-week summer writing credit that one shouldn't overlook. As a writing credit, I think I would have benefited from the opportunity for rewrites, even if it wasn't to significantly change my grade. This would have allowed me to better my writing, which is the ultimate goal.",
    "Uniquely with zoom; polls, chat features, and breakoutrooms all felt like they improved the the course expiernece.",
    "Great organization, structure, timing. Course was divided into interesting and engaging sections. The mix between discussion and lecture was helpful and interactive. The material was thought-provoking  and important for any student and global citizen",
    "The strengths are definitely the interactivity and the participation, as well as the reading selections and the structure of each lecture (breaking down reading, defining important terms, discussion). I do think that some of the readings were on the long and dense side. This can be useful, but it's also important to note that only two readings were assigned per class as a result, and thus we maybe only had access to one or two perspectives on the issues at hand going into class. Obviously, I'm not asking for more work (I think the amount of work in 2 readings per class was perfect), but perhaps shorter less substantive selections might be something to consider for certain issues?",
    "The strengths were the discussions we had in groups. One weakness was rarely having enough time to get to everyone's points.",
    "Instructor is great! Interesting material and readings. Good amount of assignments though.",
    "Strengths: Good group discussion, and easy-to-follow presentations and activities. The readings were also interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: the large size over zoom is not great, but that isn't something that can really be improved unless this class was turned into a seminar.",
    "The grading is absolutely stupid. This is an intro class but they treat us like hardcore philosophy majors. They say they use the yale grading scale, which says that C should be the grade a good paper should get . Really harsh for no reason.",
    "I think the only weakness with online summer classes is that they are so fast paced, but there is also a quick turn around of grades and assignments. I think a strength of this class is that the time we spent learning was very engaging. We used breakout groups and polls to really understand and stay focused on the material. I know I talked to some students and they were concerned about only one TA grading their papers (they brought up fairness concerns), but I didn't specifically see a lot of the issue.",
    "I think it was all good",
    "I think a strength was that we had a lot of discussions which simulated thought and encouraged positive disagreement. This is not necessarily a weakness, but participating in larger breakout rooms was out of my comfort zone. However, the smaller breakout rooms made up for missed conversation.",
    "The strengths of this course is the wideness of issues we tackle, well-structuredness, and the clear guide of the discussion. Maybe the course could be improved if it provided more opportunities to review what we did in the preceding class, because I heard my fellow students in the breakout room finding difficult to recollect what they did in the past class.",
    "The strengths are great TAs (they are very fair and seem unbiased to different opinions in discussion)\r\nGood participation between myself and classmates, and the prof and TAs would clarify that they understood the point you were trying to make\r\n\r\nI don't see any weaknesses in the course.",
    "Love the amount of participation by students through different forums such as breakout rooms, calling on people etc.",
    "A major strength was the way that the class was organized. The expectations and assignments were clear, and I feel like the organization of the course really helped with my learning. A weakness was that sometimes, the smaller breakout discussions were pretty awkward because no one would want to initiate conversation. I think that in the future, having at least 5 or so people per room would be optimal.",
    "Overall, the course was run neatly, and the progression through different topics was well organized. For the most part, the readings presented ideas in an unbiased way. In my opinion, the main weakness was that there was little feedback to our writing assignments. Tips and strategies for writing philosophy papers were given in class, but not much on an individual basis.",
    "Strengths: the readings and workload was very manageable, which promoted deep engagement and focus on singular concepts and ethical concerns, all while making philosophical writing very digestible. The mini discussions we had in breakout rooms were very helpful in giving us time to think about the points that classmates and author were putting forth, and gave time to respond to them to help us develop more informed and nuanced perspectives. The personal reflection project were super great and gave us opportunities to directly connect these sometime abstract concepts to our own real worlds. \r\n\r\nI honestly have nothing that I would change. I almost wish it was longer so we could go even deeper into the topics we discussed to give them the time and focus they deserved.",
    "I'm hesitant to comment on the weaknesses of the course, because I think a lot of it stems from the class being online which I think makes a philosophy class in which you would like to be able to freely engage slightly more challenging. I thought Joanna did a great job giving everyone different times and spaces to comment to help with some of that feeling.",
    "strength: Literally love this course so much. Joanna is extremely friendly, and more than willing to help you if needed. Many times through the course, I met with her for 15 minutes during office hours, which turned into an hour simply because she cares about her students. Then, hours later, I would even get an email recapping the call, or any lingering thoughts. So incredible, so dedicated, so kind. Joanna makes this class great.\r\n-joanna recaps readings throughout the class so even if you miss a reading\/don't understand one, it's very easy to participate in class. love this and wish more professors did this.\r\nweakness: kinda work-heavy. the work isn't necessarily hard, there's just quite a bunch of it. but if you have the time to dedicate to the class, it's definitely doable. writing credits tend to take up a lot of time, so this is expected.",
    "I think the course is well-structured overall, but it did seem that the classes were largely unrelated one-to-the-next, and it was sometimes difficult to locate materials on the Canvas page.",
    "Strengths: I think the TAs did a wonderful job of moderating discussions in breakouts. I felt after each discussion, even when I was initially unsure of my own opinion, I left feeling more convinced thanks to the prompts the TAs provided and the pertinent questions they raised. \r\nweaknesses: the reading required for each class was quite a lot, but still manageable. \r\n- I think it would also have been helpful to receive more feedback on written work (not every piece, but the more important ones) to see specific instances of effective and ineffective writing on which I can improve .",
    "I don't think it could be improved. It was great, every class was engaging and awesome and all the TAs were so nice and helpful at any moment during this course.",
    "I thought the course was taught very well, given the online circumstances, and I really enjoyed the material. I thought every reading was fantastic, which is rare for a class, and I enjoyed our class discussions. However, I wish there was more emphasis on how to write a philosophy paper. I had taken an English class last semester and used my knowledge from that class to write the first paper for this class. I did not know that prior writing skills are not easily translated to this philosophy papers. I wish we had been given more instruction on the stylistic and contextual components of philosophy papers, as it would have helped me sharpen certain skills. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the course and learned a ton about a very interesting and relevant topic.",
    "The strengths are the discussions and the way that we get to engage with the material. It is not like a lecture at all and kept me very engaged for 3 hours early in the morning. Also the size and number of TAs allowed people to actually get questions answered in detail. The only weakness was maybe in the beginning the reading assignments seemed quite long but I felt like it got better. I do wish the reading assignments were due at midnight the night before rather than 9 because I personally was very busy during the day.",
    "Strengths include lots of student discussion paired with a good amount of powerpoint instruction from the professor\r\nWeakness includes too many reading responses",
    "The course's material was incredible. Really enjoyed the readings. I feel we could have benefitted from deeper conversation on a lot of issues. It seemed like wee spent a lot of time talking on the surface, doing polls, waiting to get to the meaty stuff but then never actually getting there. The readings clarified a lot of the context for us, so I would have liked the course more if we had spent more time actually getting into the issues we were discussing. Power point is inherently pretty boring, as it remains on the surface. That said, I recognize it is a huge challenge teaching a course on zoom, and also that this is an intro level class with students of different levels of comfort with the nature of the course, and I'm sure many of the issues I've pointed out would be solved had I simply taken an in-person philosophy class at school.",
    "I found the course very strong, without any apparent weaknesses.",
    "I think that this course was amazing in that the workload was not overwhelming and was really respectful of the fact that we are dealing with a pandemic and that summer school was not the only thing in our lives. I also believe that the class made the most of Zoom and handled a rough situation to have class very well! \r\nI think a bit more facilitation during discussion could have been helpful sometimes because in the small breakout rooms I was frequently with people who refused to speak or participate and it was painful to get through.",
    "This course has an amazing curriculum, teaching staff and method of teaching. One of its biggest strengths is how much discussion is included into the class time, and the guided yet still very free nature of these discussions. One weakness is that it plunges into writing too fast without much guidance, which I think is difficult for people who have never taken\/only taken a few philosophy classes. There is also not too much detailed feedback given on essays, so it is a little difficult to improve on your writing greatly. I think that, instead of loosely structured, often unengaging workshops, more time should be given for TAs to give detailed feedback and meet with students either during class or after to make sure that the writing process goes smoothly as possible.",
    "Strengths: Done well online; Interesting material; Papers weren't bad. Weaknesses: Chat wasn't enabled between students; Lectures were very long."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! The course material was very interesting and applicable to our lives beyond the classroom.",
    "Yes, good introduction to philosophy with interesting practical applications",
    "Absolutely! But I would see who is teaching it and how they have organized it; my love of the class may have been due to how well Joanna ran it and how invested she seemed to be in our discussions.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! It's a very, very interesting course where you discuss a lot of interesting topics that make you think about your own life and will definitely make you think more when making decisions in the future. Additionally, it gives you the opportunity to write a philosophy paper and teaches you how to do so.",
    "I would. This class was a phenomenal introduction to philosophy, and it addressed pertinent and interesting topics in the discipline. I would caution that the writing is critiqued very harshly. Expect for your TF to find flaws in your argument even if you spent ample time considering it and discussing it with them. I think this is difficult to overcome, and can definitely be frustrating at times.",
    "Yes I would especially for people interseted in learning philosophy for the first time. I think the topics are particularly important for people who may have future careers in tech, but just as important for everyone else still due to the high integration of technology in our lives.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The material and readings are essential to anyone using technology in their daily life -- which is all of us. The instructor Joanna is dedicated, engaging, and truly interested to hear student opinions. I enjoyed the course immensely, would take it again",
    "Yes. It's a really well-structured class, and the professor\/TAs are all very knowledgeable. Getting into philosophy through the lens of technology is easy, intuitive, and interesting as well, and it's a good opportunity to learn about writing and arguing ethics and philosophy.",
    "Yes. It is a wonderfully interactive course that is not overly challenging in terms of the content or the workload. A lot of the topics also pertain to our lives, which helps foster more learning and motivates you to listen.",
    "I would! Well structured course and my writing improved. Joanna is great!",
    "NO! if you are interested in majoring in philosophy then maybe yes, but if you just want the writing credit, do not do it. There are other cool classes out there, this sounds cool but the grading is incredibly harsh, and you do not really learn a lot. To add to how horrible this class was the prompt for the essays are so dumb. Also in the beginning of the course the prof will telly you that all that matters for these papers are the arguments you make, NOT TRUE. I have gotten a lot of points of because of style and what not, also the prof will tell you they are using the yale rubric very late, so you will think you are doing well until like the last 2-3 weeks where you get all your grades back.",
    "Definitely- I think its a character and writer develpoment course. I learned a lot about myself as a person and a student and would recommend any student that needs or wants a writing to take this class.",
    "Yes of course",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it was very engaging and helpful to discuss differentiating opinions. This course made me realize that people do have valid thoughts for things that I do not necessarily agree with.",
    "I would. The course don't suppose any previous philosophy study but can potentially make students grasp what philosophy in pragmatic sense can be like. Even if the student is not going to dig deeper into the ideas in the class, the experience of thinking tangible problems thought a philosophical framework should be a fruitful one.",
    "yes if you are interested in the topics of philosophy and technology",
    "Definitely, the class was very engaging, and the friendly discussions and debates around moral dilemmas involving technology were both interesting and encouraging, I could see this fostering a spark for philosophical debate in anybody who takes the course.",
    "Yes, I would let them know to plan a lot for the papers",
    "Absolutely! It is really important to engage with these topics, especially in a time where technology has infiltrated seemingly every crevice of our lives. The material is super interesting, and it will most likely change your view on a thing or two. I know that I was able to tackle topics I never would have without this class.",
    "I think the course is a great introduction to philosophy, so I would recommend it to someone who wants to learn more about the subject.",
    "I'll refer back the skills I learned, as they are all reasons I would recommend this to someone else: I developed the ability to critically assess an argument without necessarily judging its perspective in uncharitable ways, and to use that analysis to craft my own arguments in a logically sound and deeply insightful way! I learned the importance of communicating ideas in the clearest and least complicated way in order to reduce misunderstanding and misinterpretation. I also learned how to think about ethical issues from many different perspectives and moral theories, and to ask more questions that I may answer.\r\n\r\n I'll also add that the course really deepened my desire to take stock of the technology-mediated world we live in. It was altogether one of the most insightful classes I've taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I thought the teacher and TAs were great, and the topic is extremely relevant to everyone today, regardless of major\/interests. Technology is everywhere, and I think we need to think more about how we approach it as individuals and a society. I think Joanna did a great job incorporating different types of technology so that there was definitely at least a part of the course that focused on a type of technology that was individually interesting to everyone.",
    "Yes, if taught by Joanna, definitely take, don't think twice. She's incredibly kind, and makes this class so much fun. It is quite a bit of work, but you get out of it the effort that you put in. If you're dedicated to putting in the time to improve and learn, you will do well. Joanna is extremely open to giving advice and feedback, which is such an amazing quality. Love her so much. favorite professor at yale so far.",
    "Yes! This is an interesting course about relevant topics, and it covers many ideas which are important to think about.",
    "Yes. Because it takes abstract concepts and grounds them in a very topical\/relevant way, I think students from different fields can appreciate these philosophical questions.",
    "Yes i loved thus class, it was so interesting and engaging and the topics were just flat out cool.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the state of modern society. This class transcends both philosophy and technology; it delves into how we function as a society today. For this reason, I would encourage students to take it.",
    "Absolutely! Interesting and useful!",
    "Yes - this is a great introductory philosophy class for someone interested in testing the waters in this subject. The writing portion is intensive because it is a summer course, but it is still feasible.",
    "I would, especially for anyone looking for a very approachable introduction to academic philosophy.",
    "Yes! It is a fantastic writing credit and super interesting for non-philosophy majors. I really loved it.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are interesting in the content! If you want to learn more about how ethics can be applied to issues of technology, this class is extremely interesting. One caveat is that, if you are taking this solely for the WR credit, you might want to look at other classes, because I think that this course is one of the more difficult ones to do well without being engaged in the class for the content itself.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the course, even online."
