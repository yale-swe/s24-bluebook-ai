            "comments": [
                "The material covered in class wasn't very advanced and the homework assignments were representative of the classwork. Exams were annoying due to a large percent of the grade being true\/false questions that were very specific and tricky and not much partial credit being given on questions. Also if an error occurred to get a wrong number in part A, and part B used the result of the error in A points could be deducted for a wrong error in B even if the process and other numbers were right. The lectures made sense and covered topics reasonably.",
                "Strengths: Interesting course, good pedagogy, interesting exam questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often times the problem sets felt quite easy compared to the exam questions. This caused me to possibly be underprepared for the exams because I assumed that they would be easier than the problem sets as is the case in most courses.",
                "The exams were significantly harder than the homework and practice materials made available to us. Students were thus unsure of what to expect going into exams. Furthermore, the true\/false questions on exam and practice exam answer keys did not have explanations, despite often being the more conceptually tricky questions. Harder practice questions and providing answer explanations for those questions would be appreciated.",
                "Lecture is clear",
                "Professor Zhu is a great lecturer; his lectures were always concise, clear, and very helpful. The problem sets were manageable and clear feedback was provided quickly. The exams were quite difficult, but that is expected.",
                "Lectures, while clear, were nearly always verbatim from the class text; 95% of the content could have been learned by simply reading the text and not showing up to class (which many people did). Would have liked more insight\/applications, and perhaps more interactive lectures.",
                "Strengths - overall very solid course. Great professor with clear and engaging lecture style. His lecture notes are also a god-send. Very reasonable expectations on psets and exams. \r\nWeaknesses - section was not very engaging and not so helpful for learning.",
                "Lectures were well taught, sections were a bit less organized.",
                "Strengths: The expectations of the course were very clear; the PSETs were very straightforward; the exams had good practice materials available; and the lectures were recorded with notes posted by the professor in a VERY concise and helpful manner in the course files. Tianyu was great at explaining some of the more complex topics, though this course was not too challenging to understand conceptually.\r\nWeaknesses: One of the main weaknesses of this course was its offering 3x a week; it would be much better if it were 2x a week for slightly more time. I also think that the discussion sections were almost entirely pointless, and my attendance at them had no impact on my understanding of the course material, for better or for worse.",
                "Tianyu was great at explaining every single necessary detail which really facilitated my learning.",
                "The workload was very appropriate for the amount of material that was covered in the course and facilitated mastery of the material through solving relevant problems. Tianyu is a fantastic professor. Not only was his teaching very good, but he also made time for his students, to hear them out about their concerns and questions. The grading can be a little bit harsh though.",
                "Strengths: the course was well taught by Prof. Zhu, it was well-organized, and there was a good structure of support around learning and completing the PSets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the PSets were significantly less difficult than the exams, so we were not the best prepared for the exam difficulty.",
                "Great course overall, one comment I have is that the lectures, towards the end of the semester, moved quite slow and not a lot of content was covered on chemical kinetics and equilibrium which i would have enjoyed a lot.",
                "The three-time-a-week class format is absolutely awful. And completely unnecessary. Moving to two times a week would be sufficient.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zhu makes the material easy to understand and his lecture notes are extremely helpful.",
                "This course's strength was in its pacing - I feel like we had enough time to review each of the seven focuses in enough detail for an introductory course without sacrificing breadth. \r\n\r\nHowever, it felt to me like the relative difficulty of problem sets, practice exams, and exams was very unbalanced. It's my opinion that problem sets should build upon the connections built in class and push students to understand the content in more profound ways, and so I usually expect them to be more difficult than the exams - the problem sets this semester did a good job of helping us repeat relevant calculations and encouraging careful bookkeeping, but they didn't necessarily offer us new insights. The practice exams were mostly repetitions of problem set questions, which meant they offered very little in the way of additional preparation. In retrospect, the exams themselves were probably of an appropriate difficulty, but the problem sets and practice exams did not give us a clear picture of expectations beforehand, nor did they really prepare us sufficiently.",
                "Classroom needs to be changed. The environment was just not bright enough.",
                "Strengths: The instructor (Prof Zhu) is really good. Although all the content can be found similarly presented in the textbook, the professor does an amazing job of breaking down the concepts and conveying them to the class.",
                "Supplemental lecture notes help learning tremendously. Professor is also very knowledgeable and supportive. Grading is fair",
                "Extremely organized, extremely clearly taught. Could do with some more engaging examples, perhaps in class.",
                "This course is difficult to do without existing background in physics, so if you have not taken physics I would say immediately seek some extra help and support from the instructors\/teaching staff\/peer tutors. The lectures are helpful for knowing what content to focus on, but honestly the book is a better place to go for an explanation.",
                "Strengths: very structured and study materials are plentiful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture recordings were very low quality",
                "Strengths are primarily the lecture notes and the course structure. Psets are quite reasonable and lectures are strong. In general I think it is a really solid course and you'll learn the content in a really enjoyable manner.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the passion of the TAs and how the content is delivered. Maybe it is because I am an engineer but I felt the content was too far from any applications and sometimes way too theoretical in a non-enjoyable manner. I wished someone could help me understand more why it mattered as I am personally not that drawn to Physical Chemistry. And the TAs didn't really know the content that well (but I do appreciate they were doing their best).\r\n\r\nBe careful with the true and false in the exams. They will most likely cost you a grade letter. That is honestly the only and most infuriating thing about this course. The True and False questions in the midterms and finals will take you by surprise (or trick you) and it's very frustrating when you can loose 20 pts on that.",
                "Strengths: The delivery of the lectures was very clear and well laid-out, where the topics were really explained from the very basics. Professor Zhu's lecture notes were excellent and summarized the lectures very cohesively. There are plenty of opportunities to get help from peer tutors, TAs and the professor. \r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets were always not up to par with the difficulty of the exams. More opportunities to test theoretical understanding in the problem sets would be useful for the exams.",
                "Strengths: I thought the lectures were interesting and the exams were fair. I appreciated the equation sheet since I could focus on learning the concepts and how to apply equations rather than struggling with memorizing them.\r\nWeakness: I wish there could be more interesting problems in the psets, like some of the challenging discussion section problems.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zhu is a very clear lecturer and provides exceptionally clear notes, and the peer tutors are phenomenal. The exams are also very reasonable and short (1.5 hours) compared to other classes. Psets are also relatively short and I feel are the perfect length and type of problem that facilitate learning of the material.\r\nNo real weaknesses in my opinion."

                "Yes if it's required for their major or like thermodynamics",
                "good intro physical chemistry course",

                "Yes, take it with Tianyu. If you're ChemE it's basically a repeat of Thermodynamics with a little bit of kinetics tagged on the end. Not too hard, but the topics are genuinely very interesting and applicable to real-world phenomena.",
                "Yes, great chemistry class overall.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that there is a lot of stigma with physical chemistry at Yale, but it has been reformed for the better in the past couple of years. If anything, if you took general chemistry at Yale (especially 163\/167), a lot of the topics discussed during this course will be familiar to you. I would recommend the peer tutor office hours over going to discussion sections. Exams and PSETs were very fair, too. Despite the ease of not going to lecture and watching the recordings, you really do benefit more from going to class.",
                "If Tianyu is teaching, absolutely!",
                "Yes, if they have an interest in thermodynamics or physical chemistry, I think it is a very good course. Otherwise, I am not sure if it would be very interesting.",
                "Yes! Likely, it is a requirement but PCHEM 1 with Tianyu shouldn't be scary! It is a great class, and he provides great lecture notes for all the students. At times, the lectures did feel a bit slow, but they were always informative.",
                "Not unless you have to take it for your major.",
                "Yes!",
                "Perhaps, because this course did offer a lot of insight into the physical processes underpinning much of our world. I think I'd be able to recommend it more strongly if the thermodynamics portion offered a more compelling, unified narrative and provided more motivations for the perspective it takes, although I might have to wait until statistical mechanics to be satisfied.",
                "I would; it provides a thorough and clear introduction to thermo in chemistry.",
                "If it is not a requirement for you, I would only take the course if you have the time to teach yourself content. PSETs in this course are short and fair. Most of your time will be spent during the exam weeks.",
                "Yes, definitely. It's very challenging but fulfilling and teaches applicable concepts.",
                "I would avoid it if you can but if you have to take it you'll be alright.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who want to gain a solid foundation in physical chemistry. The lecture delivery was very clear, and there were many opportunities to receive help. This course also teaches you a more quantitative approach to chemistry, where you are using mathematics, manipulating equations to analyze systems and extract physical insights. The exams tests your knowledge very comprehensively with a solid mix of theoretical and calculation-based problems, where you are really encouraged to understand when to apply specific formulae to specific scenarios.",
                "Yes, it shows you where a lot of what you learned in gen chem came from without being forced to memorize all the nitty-gritty details. The workload is also pretty manageable, even more non-chem majors.",
                "Yes! This is a great class if you liked many of the topics covered in gen chem and want to learn about them in a much deeper way."
