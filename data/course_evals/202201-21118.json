Nevertheless, I think everyone walked away with a better understanding of how to write and organize a large scientific paper. I learned a lot from the other students through peer-review and suggestions made in class."

                "I think the small-group structure of the course was generally really helpful and built a sense of community within the evst major, though certain assignments felt like busywork \r\n\r\nThis may have had something to do with covid, but I think there really needs to be more preparation for the thesis process during junior year. I went into senior year feeling really panicked about my thesis because I hadn't identified a project or an advisor. I think there should be thesis info sessions much earlier in the year for juniors.",
                "I honestly do not really know how it could be improved.  The format makes sense, the deadlines and assignments are conducive to thinking and exploring.  Perhaps built in work sessions - required - could be helpful.  I know they would have really helped me.  A time and place and instructor to work for an hour or two every week.\r\n\r\nGiving presentations in Burke is absolutely horrific.  I have never experienced a more hostile room in which I've given a talk.  I could not see because of the spotlight lighting, and the microphones never worked properly and gave horrible feedback.  From the audience, the podium seems like no big deal, but when you're up there it's not good.",
                "This course was helpful - it was nice first semester to have more frequent check ins and also nice to have less frequent check ins during the second semester but know there is still a group rooting for you! I wish that more sections of the thesis had been due earlier, however, because I know a lot of us ended up writing in the last few weeks.",
                "I think there is certainly a value in sharing and discussing your thesis with peers, but I think that a lot of time was not very useful. A lot of this was, I think, due to differences in subject areas (e.g. humanities and science theses together), which meant that I often didn't get much out of group discussions. I know that part of the reason is that EVST is supposed to be more interdisciplinary, but I think the nature of a thesis means that a thesis usually has a pretty specific methodology and style. This might've been more of an issue in the first semester. However, I think that meetings with an advisor or discussion with peers in a similar style (e.g. natural science) were useful.",
                "Strengths of the course were that it met every week which made you feel accountable all year to work on your thesis. Weakness were that some of the assignments were not helpful. I wish that during first semester, more of the assignments were to write certain sections. For example, I did not find that it was helpful to create the annotated bibliography, I would have much preferred to actually write the literature review section of my paper in which I could out each source in conversation with each other."

                "This course was incredibly helpful to have while writing my thesis. It served me in the following ways: 1) providing an empathetic and supportive space where my peers could help me think through problems and 2) keeping me trucking along, hitting key deadlines as I went. I'm not sure whether the thesis itself would have been any different had I not been in this course, but it definitely was helpful to the extent that it made the writing process less stressful.",
                "This is a mandatory class for EVST seniors. But its definitely one to look forward to as a place to workshop your thesis ideas all year long and become closer with your cohort of graduating seniors through jointly struggling together."
