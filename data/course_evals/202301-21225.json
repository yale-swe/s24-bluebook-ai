Vietnamese cinema (e.g., Children Of The Mist, The Scent of Green Papaya). Vietnamese culture and practices (Tet\/Lunar New Year, folk tales).",
                "I learned about Vietnam from an entirely different lens compared to other classes. I learned about the different complexities of Vietnamese society, cultural values, and ways literature has developed in relationship with subjects like colonization, war, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about Vietnamese culture and different philosophical traditions. I learned how these manifest themselves through different pieces of Vietnamese literature. It was great!",
                "Youll read Vietnamese poetry, watch Vietnamese films, and read Vietnamese books. Youll learn about various cultural celebrations as well as myths and a basic history of the nation.",
                "I was able to connect to my heritage through taking this class and I am incredibly grateful. The class provided me insight and open mindedness on subjects not discussed enough such as immigration and poverty.",

                "The course was great",
                "I think the relative informality of the reflection papers is a big strength of the course that I hope doesn't change too much. I was initially worried about how \"formal\" the reflection papers would be -- but since the grading isn't very harsh, you can really interact with the works that you go over in the course in a genuine, straightforward way, even if you aren't a humanities major. One weakness of the course was the frequency of technical difficulties - particularly when trying to watch videos and movies. It would be nice if those kinds of things went more smoothly in the future.",
                "The movies can be quite graphic and triggering, and I wish Thay Quang would have given us warnings before the day of screening.",
                "Strengths of this course include strong engagement with material proposed in the syllabus, great lectures by Professor Quang, and a class community environment with shared food, tradition, etc. \r\n\r\nFor me there were two distinct weaknesses. First, it seemed the class was intended to be a seminar because there was no discussion section. But because it was so over-enrolled, Prof. Quang made it a lecture and built in a discussion section period with two TFs during class. I think this complicated things because it made class discussions (which seemed to be traditional to Prof Quang's teaching style and the syllabus) impossible and made the discussion section (which was in class) seem hasty. Secondly, a major concern of this class is the focus on media depicting sexual violence against women and Vietnamese female subjectivity. As a Vietnamese American woman, this class was exhausting at times for my consistent exposure to depictions of Vietnamese women only through struggle. I was frustrated to see that Prof Quang chose to highlight this narrative, though a real part of Vietnamese history and the brutal installation of colonial governments and civil war, again and again, and again. Vietnam is more than war, Vietnamese women are more than trauma. I hope that this course in the future can address this complaint and think more critically about the harm of reproducing representations of Vietnam and its people through this constant pain.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content! I enjoyed that the class was not simply learning about Vietnamese culture through only lectures but also through diverse cinema and literature. It is also clear that Professor Van is very thoughtful and passionate about the material that he covers in class. The homework and readings were manageable. I appreciated that the number of required reflection papers was less than the total number of opportunities to write reflection papers. It allowed us to write about the material that interested us the most. I also enjoyed the flexibility of the final project as I was able to do something creative and personal to me. Weakness: The only weakness is there is very little participation in class, so students should be encouraged or incentivized to participate in class discussions.",
                "The readings in this class were phenomenal! They provided a variety of Vietnamese perspectives and literature forms that allowed us to understand the complexities of Vietnamese culture and society. I also loved the reading reflection format. It allowed us to deeply interact with the readings without the stress that typically accompany other classes. It also allowed us to explore certain subjects from class more deeply. Lastly (but definitely not least), Professor Van is the biggest highlight of the course.",
                "Strengths of this course were Thay Quang!! He is an amazing professor. He made lectures so interesting and fun and he chose a great syllabus full of amazing works. One weakness might be that the final project did not really have much structure and I would've loved more hands-on instruction with building the project since it's such a large part of the final grade.",
                "The course assignments are easy to understand (8 reading reflections) and pretty open ended, so you have a lot of freedom in what you want to write about. The Canvas page isnt organized too well, and it can be confusing at times. Readings sometimes wouldnt get posted until 2 days before class.",
                "The class was a little messy and slightly lacking in communication on canvas but was otherwise extremely pleasant and engaging.",
                "Strengths: the opportunity to learn from various forms of literature and media (poems, fiction stories, documentaries, movies, etc)\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were repetitive sometimes"
