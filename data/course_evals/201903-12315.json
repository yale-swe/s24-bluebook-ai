    "As the name suggests, you learn a lot about the state of the world in the year 1000. You start by talking about interactions between cultures, then you discuss the impacts that these interactions have. The overall question is basically to what extent did globalization occur in the year 1000.",
    "In this class I learned about a variety of places in the world around the year 1000. I also gained a lot of insight into what historians actually do, as we were faced with the task of evaluating evidence from the time in order to judge validity.",
    "What the world was like circa 1000, and how it was connected. A little bit of general analytical skills in history as well.",
    "A lot about the right way to think about history and which sources are credible.",

    "Grading is weird but easy. Make sure you go to office hours or ask TAs what they are looking for.",
    "The professors both clearly cared a lot about the course, and the lectures were pretty engaging for a history course. I think that the structure of the class and expectations for the students need to be improved upon. First, having extra credit assignments due approximately four hours after we discussed them in section wasn't really conducive to the best submissions, and it made students with other schedules (I.e. practice after section, meetings, etc.) less able to take advantage of it. Additionally, the deadlines seemed very inflexible. When the first paper was due, it was clear in section that students had completely missed the mark with our outlines because of a lack of communication about what the paper was supposed to entail, and even though EVERYONE was in the same boat, there was no discussion of pushing the deadline. I think that listening to the students in that regard also would have been helpful. Additionally, it felt at times that the grading wasn't about the quality (of writing, presentation, etc.), but rather about checking off boxes on a rubric that we didn't see before turning it in. The inclusion of a \"hot-take\" thesis was all we talked about in section, but students got points off on the essay for not having a road map in the thesis, which we thought was optional. Better communication of expectations (I.e. having rubrics) would make the class much better.",
    "The class is interesting and fun. I liked the structure and content and thought both professors were engaging.",
    "Strengths: Learned a lot about what the world circa 1000 was and how it was connected.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The nature of the course, though giving a good macro-overview, means that we didn't learn in-depth about any place in the world. The final project idea about a world leader conference (in the context of 1000 AD) was bizarre.",
    "It is a very good intro to history courses. I also really enjoyed have two professors that switched off",
    "Interesting course, but wasnt organized extremely well, felt like we jumped around a lot.",
    "Grading was not transparent, along with expectations for assignments. I've never taken such a poorly-organized course."

    "Easy 5th or 6th class or WR credit. Extra credit can bump you up a max of 7% on your final grade.",
    "If you need a writing credit and don't want to write a lot, definitely. You literally have two, 1000 word papers, which is super manageable. There is also a factsheet (bullet points about a region in the year 1000), a midterm (based on four lectures of material), a presentation (which is just basically presenting the final paper for 5 minutes), and a final quiz (similar to the midterm). If you take the humanities credit but not writing, you don't have the final paper and you swap out the first final paper for another midterm based on the information students found in the factsheets. There is a section, which you have to at least skim the readings for, but the readings are actually pretty short. If not, ask the TA what the key sections to focus on are and read those. Overall, the course can be frustrating in terms of expectations and the grading can sometimes seem super random, but you'll end up doing fine in the course because of the extra credit. The class is graded out of 100 points, so you could get a 70 on the paper, but it's only a 7\/10. There are up to 8 points of extra credit, so you can pretty much come back from a bad grade on one or two assignments.",
    "Yes-- it was a great class to take to learn about many different places in a time that is rarely spoken about.",
    "I would recommend to students with a casual interest in medieval history. For serious history or humanities majors, I would avoid, as there are much more detailed courses to take.",
    "Good introductory history course.",
    "Yes",
    "Great 5th course.",
    "No- take another course to fill your writing credit."
