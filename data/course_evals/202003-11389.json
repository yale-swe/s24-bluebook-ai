                "The class really gives you a necessary scope for each type of revolution\/political movement explored in the course. And, every assignment was clearly explained. No weaknesses whatsoever; I enjoyed every class I went to.",

                "Strengths: \r\n-Professor Abraham-Fiallos is an excellent teacher and discussion leader. His enthusiasm for the various revolutionary movements permeated and galvanized each class period. He was always open to discussing assignments, such as brainstorming or providing critical feedback. \r\n-Diversity of material: Without this course, I would have never engaged with a significant majority of the material. The diversity of material discussed provided a very international perspective, not just American or Euro-centric outlook like many HS courses,  on the 20th century and its revolutions. \r\n-Developing writing skills: For the first time, I was expected to regularly write lengthy papers (5 pages, then 10 pages by the final research paper). Initially, I was terrified of such an endeavor, but the progression of this course smoothed the transition from HS to Yale-level writing, in length and prose style. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-n\/a"

                "Certainly! I would highly recommend this course to any student with a love of history and\/or politics interested in bolstering their writing & analysis skills. You'll get to explore a diverse range of works, authors, and movements; at least for me, this course removed the cultural stigma surrounding such revolutionary rhetoric, in favor of sharply and mindfully reading pieces critically. Each paper was fascinating to construct, as was the culminating manifesto project. Hopefully, Professor Abraham-Fiallos teaches this course once more, as his leadership provided an excellent learning and growing experience."
