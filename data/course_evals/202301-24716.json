I now feel so much more comfortable with analyzing an argument by considering a series of objections and replies, a skill I believe will be useful for the future.",
                "Amazing course that delves into the intersections of law and moral psychology. Learned how to analyze philosophy and law arguments about morality and legal doctrine, and how to write essays about the dialectic of these arguments.",
                "I learned how to approach the philosophy of law; how law deals with states of mens rea; how to write a philosophy paper; how to read philosophy papers and analyze them for the salient points. Excellent class!",
                "I learned many news ways to think critically",
                "I learned a new grasp on ethics specifically focused on the legal implications. I actually learned to enjoy the conversation around ethics as I got to apply them to an area of interest to me. The class was instrumental in my learning how to handle and engage in legal philosophy."

                "Strengths: expectations were very clear, and the content is very interesting. Class discussions were also very intriguing. \r\nThe only recommendation that I would give is to spend an extra 5 minutes on top of the already allocated ~10 minutes to fully reviewing the prior class.",
                "I really appreciated the weekly hand outs; they made the readings but less intimidating and more digestible. I do not think there were any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: The instructor was great-- consistently provided great feedback on reading responses and assignments, and facilitated great conversations in the course. Reading responses every week helped to engage with the readings, and assignments were constructive and thought-provoking. Instructor provides handouts that summarize the conversations extremely well too \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only real weakness is that we spent so long talking about certain topics that we did not get to cover the entire breadth of the syllabus. We kind of traded breadth for depth, and many of our class conversations left without a resolution.",
                "Strengths: organization of the course into three units, each with a paper--the units built off of each other extremely well; readings fit the material very well; Professor Antill led the class via excellent questions and distilled complex reading material--he also provided summaries of readings at the beginning of each class to aid our understanding; very helpful office hours to think through paper topics and dialectics; good feedback on essays.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A.",
                "It was great!",
                "Professor Antill had a strong grasp of what subjects to cover, what pace to cover those subjects at, and how to create a dynamic discuss. This made the class a wonderful experience. The paper assignments were very clear and he provided lots of feedback to help you improve your writing. Overall wonderful class."

                "Yes! Take this course if you're interested in the philosophy of law, and really interesting questions about how our judicial system works and should work. Unlike may classes on similar subjects, this one was incredibly accessible and non-intimidating. Highly recommend.",
                "Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in law, philosophy, and psychology. Especially recommend for anyone interested in the theory around mens rea and the insanity defense.",

The topics we uncovered about mens rea and culpability were incredibly interesting which made the papers exciting to write. I found all of the readings to be extremely useful and the class provided me with more perspective on criminal punishment."
