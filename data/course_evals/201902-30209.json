    "I learned about different aspects of French culture and society. I improved my speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in French.",

I learned about modern French politics, culture, society, and many aspects of what it means to be French, not just in Paris but across the French-speaking world.  While I certainly learned a lot in class, the true value of the experience was outside of class, living in Paris and taking trips across the country.",
    "Intense working knowledge of French language, French culture, and politics",
    "A greater breadth of French vocabulary relevant to the modern French zeitgeist."

    "It is great to learn French in France, as I was fully immersed in the environment.",
    "It is an excellent course.  Its greatest strength is the professor, who created an incredible itinerary for us both for the course material and for day trips.  If it has a weakness, it would be the fact that there is no truly effective mechanism to ensure everyone speaks in French all the time.  Unfortunately, that burden falls on the students.  I think if there was some sort of system that connected the students with other French students that were around the same age, ones that students would have a much easier time connecting with and hanging out with (going to restaurants, visiting monuments, etc) outside of the Yale program, the language issue would be less of a problem."

    "Yes. The course is well-organized, and Madame Schneider is awesome!",
    "If they were genuinely interested in France and learning French, I could not recommend a better course, except perhaps the semester-long study abroad.  It does take a lot of the summer and is rather expensive, so those restraints would have to be taken into account before any recommendation were made.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes. Learning French in an immersive environment was immensely helpful in my improving my French fluency."
