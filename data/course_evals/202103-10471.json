                "Great introduction to the history of museums and the practice of collecting in the early modern period. Insightful readings, engaging class discussions, and fun\/intellectually stimulating assignments.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of museums and collections, what type of people collected and why they collected. Themes of political networking, social status, wonder, and categorization came up throughout the course. We also talked about how museums have changed and discussed how to manage sensitive or controversial exhibitions in modern museums. The course allowed for lots of discussion and asked a lot of interesting questions that will stick with me. We also got to look at works in the beinecke and historical medical library, so this course uses Yale's resources well.",
                "Deeper understanding of collecting and museum cultures in the early modern period. I am a more conscientious museum visitor because of this class. Class discussions were always incredible and I left class feeling intellectually fulfilled.",

            "comments": [
                "The course is extremely focused on early modern Europe. It would be great to read more about other time periods and places. I also thought that the course was at its strongest, and class discussions were most engaging, when we discussed the management and development of current museums, but unfortunately we spent very little time on those topics.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bertucci is an extremely good facilitator for class discussion. She never fails to drive home points that she wanted us to get from the readings and will point out when we get off track. I liked the library visits and the discussions weve had.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class overall should parse out the ethics of museum curation and collecting itself. I think there were times in the class when I ended up coming out of class with more questions than I had coming in.",
                "strength - each week's theme was carefully chosen and relevant to the times. also, the visits to the medical library + beineke were amazing, and it was a once in a lifetime experience to see the texts we were reading about in person \/ actually touch them. \r\nweakness - sometimes the discussions felt circular, e.g. we were repeating the same things over and over again. perhaps it would have been helpful to have a list of questions beforehand to \"structure\" the discussion better. it seemed that people also had a hard time participating always given the fast-paced nature of the class \/ the fact that people were constantly trying to talk. would have liked to hear everyone's unique ideas!\r\n- also, while the creative projects were refreshing, it was oftentimes hard to gauge what the prof wanted without a rubric \/ example from previous years. this often led to miscommunication \/ lower results than students were expecting given the work put in.",
                "I appreciated that the class was so discussion-based! However, I would have preferred a more even balance of lecture content and class discussions.",
                "Strengths: field trips to look at primary sources, opportunities for students to bring in their own stories, experiences, and passions, layout of the course (talking about the visitor experience, the kinds of people who collect, reasons for collecting, and eventually transitioning into considerations for more modern museums).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing really comes to mind...\r\n\r\nI enjoyed when we formed small groups to talk about the readings and it would be nice to do a little more of that to help get to know our peers more and also to have a less intimidating way to fill in gaps from the readings and make sure we are prepared to contribute to class discussions.",
                "Strength: The workload is not crazy. You do not need to do all the reading to still be able to engage in conversations. We did plenty of group work which was helpful in understanding sometimes old and dense texts. Weakness: The class is just very meh. The time period is not very exciting, and the best parts were visiting the Beinecke and the Cushing Center, but we looked at old texts and at Yale's archives but for what I'm still not sure. It was cool but the class I think suffers from being about a time period that is just not very attractive. A class about museums and natural history set a few hundred years later just might make for a more interesting course.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and thought provoking topics, interacting with primary source materials at the Beinecke and medical history library, great discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Excess of readings that often dont get discussed",
                "Visits to the Beinecke and Medical Library were definitely the highlight! I think the class might be improved from holding even more discussions in campus settings with hands-on object study (or for students to have the opportunity to check out more objects on their own, outside of class time). To put the concepts from class into practice, perhaps it would also be fruitful to have an assignment where students evaluate a display in the YUAG, YCBA, or Peabody. I also appreciate how the class engaged with contemporary themes such as the \"Decolonize the Museum\" movement. I believe the class could benefit from even more engagement with the colonial legacies of harm associated with the history of museums, as well as more efforts to draw contemporary parallels to historical course material."

                "yes! it is a great way to learn about how knowledge is built by one of the biggest cultural institutions of our times.",

                "Absolutely. I'm not really a \"museum person\" (i used to think a lot of museums were boring and my major has nothing to do with art or history, in fact, I thought I hated history for a long time)...Still, I found this course to be a fascinating way to get out of my intellectual comfort zone and learn about something that I will probably never have another opportunity to learn about like this. It's a great use of Yale's resources- going to the beniecke and medical library to see primary sources. There's something for anyone interested in art, history, medicine, science, or just interested in collections of any kind.",
                "I took this class for a preindustrial credit for the history major. For anyone like me who prefers more modern history and filtered for preindustrial credits, do not take this class. If you like early modern European history, then yeah sure it's fine. The class is very fine and you will have a fine time.",
                "Really dense course on museum theory. The museum visits are cool, but the Professor Bertucci barely gives any feedback on assignments and the creative nature makes it unclear what she's looking for.",
                "Absolutely, this is my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Bertucci is fantastic and the class was always engaging (and different from week to week)!",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested in curatorship and early modern history. Professor Bertucci is very knowledgeable."
