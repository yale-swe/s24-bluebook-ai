I learned what it means to think about a text at a deeper level in the philosophy sense instead of just the close-reading sense. I also learned a lot about what a democracy really is beyond a system of govenment.",

                "Strength: a very intriguing set of texts. I appreciated both the breadth and depth of theory to which the texts introduced us. Class presentations were also an effective and fun way to take ownership of a text and theme.",
                "Strengths: We looked at a ton of different sources, but they were tied together well in most cases. Different viewpoints were compared and contrasted. We gave presentations on a source of our choice, and that was a really good way to dive deeper into a text. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like I would have benefitted from direct instruction (either in class or through examples/how-to articles/other resouces) about how to write a philosophy paper. That was the first time I've ever had to write papers like that, and I don't think I really grasped how to do it. Other than that, I think the instructor could have encouraged discourse more. A lot of discussions had us all agreeing with each other. Maybe some mini-debates would have helped us thinnk through the positives of other opinions.",
                "Strengths: Flexibility, kind environment\r\nWeaknesses: Not stimulating,",
                "The class covers a broad range of texts that were interesting to engage with, though were sometimes quite difficult to fully understand. I thought sometimes the seminar structure made it difficult to focus on what aspects were important and relevant.",
                "The course was well organized and pushed us towards a more philosophy-oriented mindset about the use/purpose of education. The course could have been more engaging in discussions."

                "Yes, I would actually recommend this course to anyone, not just those who are in the humanities and education studies programs. Although the course centered around in-depth discussion and challenging texts, it was easily engaged with even for those who have not had experience in it.",
                "I would recommend it to someone who is familiar with some thoughts about democracy and/or education throughout history, but not someone who has studied it intensely before. I was not familiar with theories about democracy, but I knew some about education through the Foundations in Education Studies course that is required to complete a certificate in Education Studies. If you have already studied these types of theories, I don't know if this is the course for you because we didn't really go super deep into them, just what could be covered in one discussion.",
                "I cautiously would. I think Professor is great, but the course was overall a bit boring and drab.",
