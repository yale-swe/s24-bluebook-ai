I came out of this semester with a new perspective on what makes up American Literature and a greater appreciation for writing.",
                "Strengths: peer review and breakout rooms\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussions were a bit slow (probably a consequence of the virtual format), there could have been more writing guidance in the beginning, and some feedback was a bit harsh. Though helpful, some of the feedback did not account for the fact that people have different educational backgrounds and this semester was challenging for everyone.",
                "Strengths: reading list, which varies by prof; course open to non-majors so somewhat accessible",
                "In general, I really liked the way this course was set up. I think the main way it could be improved is if class discussions were more guided by the students' interest, rather than the professor bringing specific topics that she wanted us to discuss. We read very rich texts this semester, and I felt like we didn't get to fully explore some of them.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, good spacing of papers, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unreasonable reading load, not enough discussion time on each reading",
                "I think the content is amazing, however, it was often too much to read and focus on in class. I think we could have delved much deeper into specific pieces rather than having a brief understanding of a large array of pieces."

                "Absolutely, but you must take it with Professor Homans. She brings such an incredible perspective and life to the class, and its so clear that she loves what she does and cares about her students personal success. The books we read were surprisingly representational of American Literature and I got to explore a lot of pieces that I hadnt heard of before.",

                "Yes! A great opportunity to not only read American lit, but also to consider the significance of America and how this is conveyed by the voices in the texts you read",
                "I would recommend it if you are a quick reader and very interested in American literature and its politics\/history. If you need to fulfill the English major requirement, it's a relatively interesting and straightforward class to take. I would warn that the reading load is heavy, and you will likely not be able to finish all of the reading every night."
