                "Learned how art reflects history, and how we need history to truly understand art. It was awesome to learn about medieval art, since it differs so much from the art that I think of when I think about historical pieces of art (ie. Renaissance art).",
                "I learned about the different styles that dominated medieval art as it evolved from antiquity to the late 15th century.",
                "Professor Jung did a great job of organizing this class. We learned about a broad range of art and architecture throughout Europe, but she was able to really key in on fun, interesting details and by focusing on a specific person or piece each lecture. Great class!",
                "I Important medieval European works of art and individuals.",
                "I learned how to analyze images, memorization skills, and connect themes.",

                "Strength: clear topic in every lecture, well prepared materials\r\n\r\nWeakness: more background introduction will be beneficial to students without basic knowledge",
                "The material is great and Prof. Jung is an excellent lecturer. My only comment is that I think that more clarity surrounding the grading of the final project would have been helpful.",
                "I think the balance between the people and their art is kind of off some lectures. For example, we had an entire Philip the Bold lecture, but we learned very little about Philip the Bold and a lot about the monastery he funded. I also wish there was some more intro to art history type material, like I want to know how some of the works of art are made and some other intro type material.",
                "This course was wonderful! The only issue that I found with it was that most of its work was confined to the midterm and final, leading to a big push at both of these times and very little other work throughout the semester. This made the other times more difficult.",
                "There was practically no work until the final project and final exam. I spent over 48 hours straight working on those two at the end of finals week. Would not recommend unless you dont have any other finals in your other classes. I wish that the final exam and final project were spaced out more instead of due at within 12 hours of each other.",
                "The course themes were very interesting, but at times I found the lecture material to be only very loosely tied together, and sometimes hard to follow as a result. Perhaps this was partially a product of my lack of experience with art history. It was rarely clear exactly what was worth taking notes about, and what was just additional info. \r\nIf I recall, the course was advertised as having around 15 minutes at the end of the lecture for brief discussion, but I dont believe that ever happened. \r\nLastly, I was a little stressed at the end of the semester, as we had received no feedback on participation (and had yet to submit our final paper, final project, or final exam). Essentially, 80% of our grades were unclear even by the point of reading week.",
                "Lectures were very engaging and structured, with a good range of artworks as well as strong historical background. Course was flexible and I liked that all lectures were recorded to accommodate the COVID-19 situation.",
                "A discussion section would have been very beneficial for midterm and final perpetrations.",
                "The big strength is the Professor, Jaqueline Jung, because of how passionate she is. Shes a great storyteller, and I felt like going to lecture was more like listening to a story about someones life. I also liked how all the lectures were recorded, because I could go back and watch things that I missed. \r\nThe only weakness I can think of is not having in-class discussions, but thats inevitable with a lecture course.",
                "I do wish we had sections.",
                "Strengths: interesting, well organized, fun lecturer, interesting projects\r\n\r\nWeakness: maybe a stronger overall review of the themes of the era? overall few weaknesses",
                "I think Professor Jung's presentations were wonderful and engaging but I the course could have been improved by a discussion section.",
                "This course would be better with smaller discussion sections. The lectures are awesome.",
                "Very good",
                "This course is taught through the visual legacies of significant medieval people which makes for a compelling, historically-inclined survey of art from the Middle Ages. Professor Jung is a terrific orator who makes the content engaging and brings course images to life.",
                "I think that the final and the testing could be framed very differently. There was only one exam, the midterm, and then 65% of my grade was pushed into the cumulative material. I think testing could have been more frequent. Additionally, I think this class would do very well with a discussion section."

The course gave me a new appreciation of medieval art and the visit to the Beinecke gave me an opportunity to interact with pieces we looked at in lecture.",

                "If you're interested in medieval people and art, for sure! I never felt stressed out by this class and deeply enjoyed getting to dabble in a subject that I didn't know much about going in. Plus, Professor Jung is an absolute DELIGHT and has so much passion for her subject. I loved listening to her during every lecture."
