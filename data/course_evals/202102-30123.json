I think we covered a good breadth of philosophers, but wish we could have covered more things related to practical applications (ie., some of what we covered at the end with the quartet) as opposed to purely theoretical ideas.",

I enjoyed the way Prof Franks clearly explained big takeaways from each of our readings every week, which is great to facilitate learning. However, if you are looking for philosophy with a more practical application, take a course that is more specific to a certain discipline of philosophy.",

Even more importantly, the class taught me how to think about those readings, how to consider their limitations and their assumptions. I learned to extend this way of thinking to my own arguments and my own writing.",
