Virtual presentations were much smoother than they would have been in class, and it was easier to complete assignments in this virtual format. Finally, the mix of synchronous/asynchronous days was extremely valuable and helped make this course feel less overwhelming."

                "Yes, loved Carolina. She actually did not make me feel bad for my broken Spanish and she encouraged me to do more outside of class. I am doing L4 and am so unhappy that Carolina is not going to be teaching L4. She was able to explain topics very well and always helped us when we needed it. Excellent class with Carolina.",
                "Honestly, yes! I generally hate language learning, and like me you might be taking this course as a requirement. Compared to L2 this course was MUCH better, and even though I wouldn't have taken it without the requirement I would generally recommend it. The workload is steep, especially around testing and at the end of the course, but compared to L2 it was much more reasonable. The grading in this course is pretty fair, and if you do the work you should do well. By far the best part of this class was Profesora Baffi!! If you have to take this course, take it with her!! She is so kind and helpful, and I was never afraid to participate in class because she never forced us to speak if we weren't comfortable, and she wasn't constantly correcting us in demeaning ways as I've had other teachers do before in Spanish. She always spoke in Spanish but in a language level that we could understand, so by the end of the course I had learned A TON of conversational Spanish simply because she made an effort to be immersive but cognizant of our varied learning levels. Overall this course is a lot of work and will not always be fun, but if you take it with Profesora Baffi you will learn lots of Spanish, and the class will generally be neutral if not enjoyable.",
