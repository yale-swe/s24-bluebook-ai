   "comments": [
    "Before I took this course, I did not have a holistic view of how technology enters, modifies, and ingrains itself into societies. The course has expanded how I analyze technology to take a more critical approach, particularly in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of new technology. I appreciated the wide breadth of topics we covered because I perceived similar processes of change in technocultural processes over different eras and countries.",
    "This course explored the social and historical dimensions of technology.",
    "I learned about the development and impact of various technologies both on modern society and on our daily lives.",
    "Fantastic overview of the story of technology, how tech intertwined with issues of race, class, and gender, and future innovations to come."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting topics and readings, committed professor, solid feedback on essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps one essay could be replaced with a presentation.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ragas is very engaging and knowledgeable in the material, and truly cares about you learning and enjoying the class. Weaknesses: Class is a little disorganized and I think could focus more on technologies like software, considering its relevance.",
    "This course could have benefitted by working with more historical papers and articles. All of our readings were published in the last three years (though they covered a large historical swath). However reading older technology theorists would have benefitted students interested in the development of the discipline. The syllabus we ended up reading was focused a lot on global technology and race but the class should have covered other historical factors in its syllabus.",
    "Prof. Ragas balanced well a mixture of student discussions and his own knowledge! Overall, this course is incredibly interesting and the readings were always fun."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course covered historical topics I did not encounter in any other seminar. Too often, technology is viewed as deterministic or in the absence of history, but the readings in the course ensured we gained the concomitant social, cultural, and political perspectives needed to understand technological history. Anyone who wants to have a better grasp on why technologies are created, accepted or rejected by societies should take this course.",
    "Yes! Not too difficult a class with some really interesting material.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's fun and interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! The material is very interesting and the readings (even though some may be long) are fascinating.",
    "Absolutely!! This course is very different from any other history class here."
