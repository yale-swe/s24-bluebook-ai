Professor Kapustin makes clear the real impacts of different thinkers' philosophies, which makes their abstract thinking much more concrete. This class made ethics feel relevant!",
                "I learned about how history's most prominent political philosophers have viewed morality and politics. I'm honestly still unclear about what the course has to do with moral CHOICES in politics, but I can say that Professor Kapustin is one of the best professors I've ever had and taught me to think about revolutionary movements throughout history in new ways. I learned about different ways of thinking about revolutions that promote violence or nonviolence, and I learned about the role that utopias play in these movements.",

I developed an understanding of many thinkers that I had previously never studied before. It was clear that many of the students had studied the material before so it was definitely a little bit intimidating.",
                "We read a lot of political philosophy in this course and discussed the role of morality in politics. It's a great course for someone interested in learning both how philosophers theorize about politics and how political theory is applied in the real world."

            "comments": [
                "I think this course is generally very strong and that no major improvements are necessary. I would slightly lessen the amount of reading assigned each week (there were some things that simply were not essential to our discussion) but beyond that I have no further suggestions.",
                "More student engagement in discussions could be facilitated",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kapustin is absolutely wonderful. Definitely my favorite professor. And, this course puts excellent readings and great discussion behind already exemplary teaching. Great class!\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the work for the course is concentrated in a single term paper, which can be a lot amidst the rest of your finals. Other than that though, the course really is flawless",
                "This seminar functions more like a lecture. BK has a set of pre-planned questions which he uses to signpost between mini-lectures, and the questions are often leading questions with specific target answers. Not all students in the class found it easy to participate, and some found the questions inaccessible. That said, I would not change a single element of the course. BK is a powerful thinker with a deep understanding of every author we read. He often constrains the text to his own interpretation, but his interps are so insightful that I would prefer listening to him talk the entire class than anything else. There is some room to ask questions and express your own ideas, but the reason you want to take the course is to hear what BK has to say.",
                "This class syllabus was well organized and the seminar was incredibly engaging. My only comment was that somewhere in the semester, our discussions ended up getting off track such that the first half of class was dedicated to finishing the discussion from the previous week. This meant that we would be discussing a reading from a week ago, making it difficult to have as rigorous as discussions as we would have had the information been more fresh in our minds. Regardless, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale and was very well facilitated for student learning.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin's lecturing style is incredible engaging. Every class was a mad dash to write down everything that he saidas soon as he started talking, the room would be full of the sounds of furious scribbling. He is also a very kind professor who personally thanks everyone for their contributions, even if he disagrees with them. He clearly values students' opinions and thinks highly of us, which incentivized me to contribute more. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Kapustin should consider more intentionally phrasing his discussion prompts to the class. Sometimes he would ask us something and we'd sit there silently, trying to figure out what he meant. I also wasn't always sure what I was supposed to be finding in the readingsI would finish a reading and find something really interesting about it, and then class would center entirely on a different topic that I didn't catch while reading it the first time. Also, the course packet is tough to navigate, so I'd suggest putting the table of contents up front and taking out a lot of the supplementary materials, which could be made available on the Canvas. Most importantly, Professor Kapustin's stream-of-consciousness lecturing style sometimes made it challenging to figure out what the key takeaways of each reading were.",
                "Weaknesses- not getting to share enough of our own thoughts about the intersection of the thinkers, strengths- professor Kapustin",
                "I think the course was perfectly organised. I wouldn't change a single thing.",
                "I think Professor Kapustin is intelligent and really cares about the quality of the conversation for his students, however, there was little opportunity to ask questions about the material if we were confused or wanted to probe deeper on a specific question. I think had there been this opportunity the course would only improve. THe other students were extremely knowledgeable about the material which pushed me to speak when I truly understand the material and my questions before I spoke in the seminar. I also think that the works studied were predominantly written by men, I think all but one were written by men which is really disappointing.",
                "Strengths: professor Kapustin was absolutely fantastic. His teaching style was extremely engaging and each seminar went by very fast. All my classmates were smart and insightful and I learned so much from all of them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any."

The readings are immensely interesting; the lectures are thought-provoking and enjoyable; the class discussion are helpful. This class does require quite a bit of reading, but the majority of the assigned texts are quite interesting so it does not feel like a chore.",
                "Yes. Professor Kapustin is a very good professor and is super engaged with the material. The readings are really interesting and not too much or too long. I enjoyed taking the class and would definitely take another class with professor Kapustin.",
                "Professor Kapustin is one of the best professors Ive had at Yale. He is what every professor at this school should be. Hes always passionate about the material, always passionate and genuinely curious about what students have to say about the material, and incredibly kind. Take this class to experience what every Yale seminar should be.",
                "Yes! Absolutely. Especially if you have taken prior political philosophy courses or any courses with Prof. Kapustin",
                "Definitely. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. BK is an outstanding thinker and teacher, and he gives you ways of accessing the text that you likely have no access to on your own. He nuances everything but shows you why each author on the syllabus is interesting and insightful. Be prepared to spend at least an hour each class scrambling to write down every single word that comes out of BK's mouth so that you can pore over his references and philosophical takes on your own time.",
                "Yes. This class is very exciting for people interested in politics and philosophy. The discussions were engaging and Professor Kapustins style of teaching was both firmpushing us to do our best in the classand very kind. It allowed me to think critically about subjects I had prior interest in but somewhat limited knowledge coming in.",
                "This is a great class to take if you are an EP&E student looking for an ethics core course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I had never taken a philosophy course before this class, but Professor Kapustin's engaging lecturing style and warm classroom presence made every class interesting, even if some of it went over my head. Students should be prepared to read dense readings and have heady, intellectually challenging discussions during class.",
                "Yes, learned a lot",
                "Yes! Professor Kapustin makes the daunting and often intimidating study of philosophy not only engaging but also digestible. The course is beautifully structured and definitely worth the time.",
                "Yes. I think this course is a great opportunity to explore political philosophy in a setting that is not too intimidating. But, don't take this course unless you are inteereested in this material and this kind of seminar.",
                "Absolutely!! Take this class if you can, especially if you're interested in political philosophy."
