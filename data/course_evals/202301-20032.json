            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The material is interesting in itself so it's easy to pay attention to the concepts and care about what you're learning (though this may not be true for people who just simply aren't interested). Professor Zinn cares a lot about the topics and wants students to walk away with at least a basic understanding of astronomy (and hopefully a passion for it, too). The assessments (3 quizzes) were fair and the psets (10 psets) were manageable (though I would go to office hours to get help and check your pset! Tiger is the best!). \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures are a bit dry and the slides are not organized in a way that made it easy to take notes.",
                "Strengths: Psets are quite doable, and align very well with what's taught in lecture. There are several office hours each week where you can get help if you need it.",
                "Canvas site organization could be much improved. Everything else was good",
                "The lectures are pretty boring, the professor just reads off the lecture slides. Over a point didnt even feel the need to go to the lectures anymore",
                "strengths: really interesting course\r\nweaknesses: not recorded, the class quizzes were kind of stressful and the class didn't have any accommodations for students with disabilities",
                "Strengths: exciting content, homeworks are manageable and interesting. Weaknesses: Lectures WILL put you to sleep (Watson right after lunch with the lights off and a slow-paced lecturer is a combination for disaster). Also, the slides are really light on actual details and the textbook mostly cares about equations, not content, so it is very hard to review for the (sometimes brutal) exams.",
                "I think it's very good as the first class taken by astronomy majors--it lets you know what the major is about and prepares you for what's to come.",
                "Strengths: Pacing of the course was good until the end, and psets served as a good review for the material. Weaknesses: Lectures were quite boring and often ran over the designated end time (reliably by 5-10 minutes), and a lot of important material that was covered in lecture did not end up in the slides, so studying could be difficult for people who had to miss a few lectures (playing catch-up post-covid was difficult)",
                "We covered a wide variety of topics in astronomy and touched on many interesting areas of study beyond \"stars and their evolution.\" That was great in that we were exposed to many topics, but I wish that the course had gone more in-depth into much of what we learned, particularly the stellar evolution component of the class. Professor Zinn was clear in delivering the lecture, but I think he occasionally spent too much time on topics that he could have covered in more depth. The homework was relatively easy and simple to complete, particularly for those who have already taken physics, astronomy, or math courses in college. I also liked the structure of the course with three smaller quizzes rather than one midterm.",
                "It seems as though this class can't decide if it's meant to be a science gut for non-STEM majors or the introductory course of astrophysics majors. As an astrophysics major, in most aspects, this class felt incredibly easy and very slow, almost a waste of time for me to learn about so many things that I already knew, but still had to take the class for the major. On the other hand, it seemed to be taught at a good pace for those who know nothing about astronomy. It seems as though this class either shouldn't be required for the major, or there should be a more engaging and advanced version of it for the major; it makes no sense to group the people who already have a strong physics and astronomy foundation with those who haven't taken a single physics class at Yale.",
                "Professor Zinn is very knowledgeable about the course material and will almost always have an answer to any question you ask. However, he is also not very engaging and lectures can get boring, even if the material is interesting. Another weakness is the organization of the course. Professor Zinn would often post the homework a few days late, and the canvas page is a mess as it's very difficult to find the class slides or homework solutions.",
                "strengths: very clear psets w/lots of help available from teaching staff, professor zinn is clearly very passionate about the subject material and kind to students (he organizes an optional observatory trip too), there isn't too much math/science background needed (basic chem & physics is helpful, a strong command of algebra is probably the only thing required), the content covered is interesting weaknesses: some of the quiz/exam questions require memorization of very minor details and are a bit tricky, slide information could be more organized",
                "The subject material of this course was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the lectures, and the TAs were very helpful in discussion section. The problems sets were good and representative of the quiz material. I'm really glad I took this course!",
                "The psets provide interesting concepts to explore and calculate like calculating the resolution of the event horizon telescope. I also greatly enjoyed the class visit to the yale lightner observatory at the end of the semester. It was incredibly interesting to see objects we had talked about so much in class. I do sometimes wish to go a bit more in-depth into the calculations behind certain concepts but I understand that's more of a later astronomy classes kind of thing.",
                "the lectures felt a bit slow and that class was a bit too easy. but the content was cool and fun to learn."

                "I would recommend this class to another student, as long as they are prepared to put in the work to understand concepts that may be unfamiliar to them and to study for the 3 quizzes and final. I am an EP&E major and thought it was a great science credit to take, even though I knew I was studying more than the other ASTR majors in the class. But because I was interested in the topics, I remained engaged and tried to not get discouraged when other students seemed to have already learned the material before it was presented. The TF's (especially Tiger) are SO helpful for the HW's. Professor Zinn is also super prepared to help students if you speak up. On the first day of class, don't get intimidated by the material. I got super scared hearing about parallaxes but didn't have to worry after going to OHs and doing the first HW. Put in the work, maybe befriend another Physics or ASTR major to check HWs with, go to OHs, and you'll be able to do well.",
                "If you're not an astro major but want a slightly-not-gutty-but-still-interesting-and-fun science credit, then go for this! If you just want a total gut, this probably isn't the class for you. If you already know a lot of astro, then you'll be really bored in this class. But chances are in that case you're an astro major, in which the class is required anyway.",
                "If you're an astro major and have to take it, it's the easiest credit in the major by a lot. If you have any kind of astronomy exposure, you're going to do well! If you're not an astro major and just are interested in stars, it definitely does cover many of the important basics of astrophysics / stars and you will learn something from it. However, if you're just looking for a science credit, I would probably take a more engaging lecture than this one. The lectures are often rote recitations of the slides that Zinn uses, which can get old quickly. But it's a fairly easy STEM credit, just a little bit of review and memorization for the quizzes and final, and the psets were simple!",
                "I would! It's a nice introduction to some basic astrophysics, with a very manageable workload, especially if you have some physics background. As a non-astro major, it was easy to follow.",
                "If you have to take it for the major then take it, if youre really passionate about learning this material then take it. However, if neither of those are true then you will lose all motivation to study and do well in this course",
                "yes, i took this not as an astro major so following along and getting introduced to the new astrophysics concept was a bit overwhelming but going to lectures is rlly the best way to do well in the class. not a gut class",
                "Yes. If you are interested in astronomy, or think you might be--this is the way to find out more/find out if you're actually interested.",
                "If you are considering the astro major (either ba or bs), definitely take the course. Otherwise, if you genuinely want an intro astronomy class that delves into stars, go ahead. I got a lot out of the course and it gave me a solid background to move forward with future astro classes. If you are looking for a science/qr gut, though, there are lower-level classes that might meet that criteria.",
                "I would recommend the course to a student interested in astronomy who has not had much exposure to the topic beforehand. It's a great introduction to the field and some of its main areas of study. However, I think that the course is too superficial for someone with more physics and astronomy experience, although it is required for the Astro major.",
                "I think it is a pretty good course if you want a general overview of some different astronomy concepts and such.",
                "This is a good class if you know nothing about astronomy and want to learn! There isn't that much material, and it's covered very slowly. If you already have a foundation in astronomy, this class could be good to formally learn everything, but you probably will already know most things that are covered in this class.",
                "I really enjoyed the material learned in this class and I learned a lot. However, if you get bored easily and don't like lecture style courses, this class may not be for you.",
                "yes, it's not too much week-to-week work (the psets are not too bad) and professor zinn is clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about astronomy. the only challenging thing is the quizzes -- you have to make sure you're super comfortable w/the math on the psets because some of the multiple choice/short answer questions are on very niche details and require lots of memorization to get right. it's not too hard to ace the psets and get decent grades on the quizzes, but to get an A on the quizzes requires a lot more studying very minor details",
                "If you are interested in astronomy and stars, yes! I'm glad I took this course. It's changed the way I think about the universe.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to dip their toes into the field of astronomy and learn the many concepts, history, and basic calculations behind it.",
                "yes! i know this is a step up from level 100 astro, but you get out of it what you put into it. you learn lots of cool stuff in this class.",
                "Absolutely, it was very easy to understand what was expected and the material greatly relates to the field of work"
