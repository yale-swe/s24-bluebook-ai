I wish there was more discussion",
                "More speaking practice with the new grammar and vocabulary outside of the class would be nice.",
                "I believe the heritage track was very well taught. Very well catered to students with some natural fluency from a young age, and fun projects focusing on Chinese American identity. I think it could have been a bit more fast paced given everyone was Chinese, and the grading could be a bit modified so that written and oral responses were not solely graded on accuracy.",
                "Strengths: the people in the class, the engaging class schedules and also the fun activities in class, like watching a movie.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "I wished there were more chances to personally meet one-on-one with the teacher to discuss what could be improved. It felt like there wasn't too much room for student input, but rather everything was on a very strict schedule.",
                "Amazing class, you have a good amount of work but I think it's definitely not too bad. The whole class flows pretty smoothly and I feel like I learned a lot"

                "Yes, if you are a Chinese American or have spoken Chinese from a young age, I would highly recommend it. Even if you dont know if you would enjoy learning Chinese or you are not as connected to your heritage, this course will definitely open up your mind to Chinese culture and identity. Learned a ton of Chinese as well, grading isnt too bad!",
                "YES YES, learning Chinese, especially as a heritage speaker, is so rewarding and fun. The experience was so much fun and I honestly enjoyed every class and all my classmates."
