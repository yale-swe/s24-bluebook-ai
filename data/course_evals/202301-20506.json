I wish there was more discussion",

I think it could have been a bit more fast paced given everyone was Chinese, and the grading could be a bit modified so that written and oral responses were not solely graded on accuracy.",

                "I wished there were more chances to personally meet one-on-one with the teacher to discuss what could be improved. It felt like there wasn't too much room for student input, but rather everything was on a very strict schedule.",
                "Amazing class, you have a good amount of work but I think it's definitely not too bad. The whole class flows pretty smoothly and I feel like I learned a lot"

Even if you dont know if you would enjoy learning Chinese or you are not as connected to your heritage, this course will definitely open up your mind to Chinese culture and identity. Learned a ton of Chinese as well, grading isnt too bad!",
                "YES YES, learning Chinese, especially as a heritage speaker, is so rewarding and fun. The experience was so much fun and I honestly enjoyed every class and all my classmates."
