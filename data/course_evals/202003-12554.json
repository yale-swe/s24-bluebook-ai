                "I learned how to evaluate and make sense of philosophical arguments and how to measure them against one another and against what I already think. The class also helped me improve my reasoning, verbal arguing, and writing skills, helping refine what was in my head and then more effectively moving it from brain to mouth to paper. It also, of course, taught me to appreciate and perhaps begin to understand the insights of some of the great ancient and medieval philosophers.",

The first is trying to understand the arguments made in the texts (where we argue about how it ought to be interpreted) and the second is considering the validity of the arguments (usually more back and forth discussion). As result, it's not just pure knowledge that's accumulated - there's a lot in terms of discussion skills that can be learned. Also, philosophy papers are incredibly technical (nothing like Literature or HPT) and they take a while to master.",
                "As a student completely new to philosophy, I learned a great deal about Aristotle and Plato the major schools of thought following them, as well as how to write a philosophical analysis.",
                "Knowledge about classical philosophical tradition:\r\n- Socratic Method \r\n- Core tenants of Platonic\/Aristotlean viewpoints\r\n- Philosophical Ethics (e.g. Epicureanism\/Stoicism)\r\n- Theological Philosophy",
                "I learned so much in Professor Mordechai Levy-Eichel's philosophy class. I hadn't had much exposure to philosophy before and I learned about Aristotelianism, Platonism, Epicureanism, and many other philosophical texts and ideas. I also learned how to evaluate a philosophical text and break down complex ideas into a series of steps and premises. Professor Mordechai also challenged the class to become comfortable with developing our own takes on the ideas presented which not only helped cement my knowledge of certain ideas and texts, but pushed me to critically examine my initial understanding of the readings and most importantly to question the ideas. This most importantly led me to become a more critical thinker and it influenced the way I read philosophical texts because it prompted me to not only read to understand the text, but also to grapple with the thoughts presented.",
                "Having never really studied philosophy before this year, I think that this course advanced my skill and knowledge more than the other DS branches. I came in knowing very little about the structure of philosophy and came away with a much deeper understanding of what philosophy really is--how it works and how it is studied. Additionally, I find that this course coincided with my own personal development, as I began--quite naturally, probably just by virtue of my age and the whole current situation--to ask myself questions similar to the ones being answered in the texts that we read; this was an experience I found invaluable.",

                "None.",
                "There is a lot of reading. So much reading that I don't think many people finished entirely. Good thing Mordechai's sections are sometimes quite removed from the reading... a lot of it rests on the implications of the reading, not reading comprehension itself. This is interesting unless you really didn't understand the reading, so you're afraid to participate.",
                "More basic explanation; there seemed to be an assumption that you already knew philosophy and that students who were able to reference out-of-class philosophical texts were given preferential treatment",
                "This course was structured as an argumentative arena, and that helped stretch my abilities to think about philosophical ideas and express my thoughts better. The price of this approach was that we did not always discuss everything that we wanted to in a given text, but the lectures and the readings themselves easily made up for this.",
                "The philosophy texts were probably the best cultivated out of all of DS. Hayy Ibn Yaqzn did not feel like it was inserted for \"Redirected Studies\" purposes, it truly fit. The choice of Seneca as the second Stoic we read was likely controversial, but I really enjoyed him. He is sometimes overshadowed by Aurelius. I feel like I left Philosophy with a thorough understanding of pre-modern philosophy. Aristotle is the one exception to this. The reading of the Categories and the time spent on the Physics were a bit overkill.\r\n\r\nMy only other complaint is the final. It was a tonnnn of work, especially relative to the other classes. It was so hard to fit within the word limit.",
                "This class provided a great introduction to a wide variety of philosophy genres and beliefs and was really good at exposing and introducing philosophy to someone who had never studied it before in an interesting and digestible way. A weakness would just be the sheer amount of reading that made it difficult to dive into some interesting aspects of the reading.",
                "Strengths: the level of discussion in seminars, the lecture handouts, the readings, the professors\r\nWeaknesses: we read far too much Aristotle, half that time could be used to read maybe 1-2 additional philosophers (Presocratics, Marcus Aurelius, Hypatia, etc)",
                "I appreciated the broad range of authors we read, but it did feel as though all the authors past Aristotle and Plato were crammed together such that we couldn't really get a deep understanding of their individual works and did a lot of reading that didn't end up getting discussed. I would personally benefit a lot more from two class seminars spent on one or two authors than two seminars split between 5 different texts spanning two different schools (I'm thinking of the week that we covered Epicureanism and Stoicism).",
                "Very fun collaborative experience, where we all interacted well and formed great bonds. The dialogue within the class was very special and something I really enjoyed. The dialogue aspect really helped me understand philosophy, since I had to make and defend assertions I had.",
                "The strengths of DS philosophy are the insightful seminar discussions and rich array of texts to read. As I was studying for finals in a group zoom it was really exciting to consider how different philosophers would respond to questions (like how the soul relates to the body or what the focus should be on in life and if the mean is really best). At times there is an overlap between DS philosophy and DS historical and political thought and while this does provide a bit of a break from the heavy reading load it also gives some texts a lot more time than others. In philosophy especially there is quite an array in experience, background, and comfort with different philosophers which is not a fault with the course by any means, but it can be a bit confusing if, in a seminar, names and ideas you have never heard of are being referenced. In my DS section Professor Levy-Eichel allowed discussions to grow and develop but he also would offer clarification when necessary which helped.",
                "Obviously, part of the point of DS is the pace; however, it was sometimes disappointing when we weren't able to truly delve more deeply into some of the fascinating texts that we read--we glossed over a couple of them completely in seminar. I know that some of my classmates suggested spending a little less time on Aristotle and spending a little more on some of the other philosophers that we read; I would echo that sentiment. I don't feel particularly qualified to recommend other philosophers that should be added to the syllabus; I enjoyed most of the authors that we read, and I appreciated the way that later texts would respond to earlier ones that we had read. If anything, I wish we had spent more time trying to really concretely emphasize those connections.",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussions and the dynamic between students and professor. Perhaps there could be more frequent small writing assessments over the course of the semester in order to ensure that we are really grasping the arguments presented in the works we are discussing. Sometimes I felt that after a class discussion I retained what we had discussed, but not very much from the rest of the text, because it was either very difficult or I hadn't had the willpower to read it closely enough."

                "The recorded lectures were really informational and good, while it would have been nice to have them in person, they were a fine alternative. The virtual seminar format made it less engaging, but Professor Mordechai did a really good job of trying to keep the entire class involved and thinking.",
                "The move completely online was fairly successful",
                "I gained a lot from the pre-recorded lectures - it was great to be able to watch them at my own pace and pause and rewind when necessary. I enjoyed our class discussions and I think they allowed for really fruitful conversations about the text, but found that in a larger class (17 is I think on the upper end for DS) it was easy for people to fade into the backround of the Zoom and not really participate.",
                "This was my best run online course. It was the only one where I felt I really got to know all the students and understand the class dynamics, mirroring how I thought it would be in person. Specifically, I think the instructor did a very good job at the very start getting all members of the class involved and invested in it. At the very start, he picked a random person and asked them to talk for a bit, so we slowly got to know the personality of all the class members. This made it mechanically easier to get involved and find the class enjoyable.",
                "The virtual seminars paired with pre-recorded lectures worked well for virtual learning. Professor Levy-Eichel also kept the chat feature open for students to use and often people would send in links to insightful and credible articles on different matters. Professor Levy-Eichel also sent follow up emails to supplement certain topics if something ran out of time which was really helpful.",
                "I can't think of anything to be improved. The course worked well given the situation--much thanks to, I suppose, the level of enthusiasm and engagement from both Mordechai and the class itself. In terms of lectures, I did appreciate those that came with the transcripts running along the side of the video. Though I do realize that those probably required a great deal of extra work."

Although outside authors were sometimes tied in to our class discussions, I found that it was easy to understand the texts without much outside knowledge about philosophy.",
                "I would recommend it if they like either (a. philosophy, b. ethics, c. debating\/arguing assertions). I think that if you like any of these points, this is a good class for you, since its a very collaborative, expressive environment in order to delve more deeply into these subjects.",
                "I would recommend DS philosophy for a student interested in the Directed Studies track. I entered this course without having read much philosophy in high school and while I had a lot to learn and digest it was very rewarding to be able to put the texts in conversation with one another in preparation for the final. The reading load is heavy and the ideas presented are challenging, but the lectures definitely help in breaking down the ideas. There will be people who have read more philosophy, but the course is definitely able to be taken by someone who doesn't come with knowledge about philosophy and by the end you will be able to discuss different philosophers and ideas.",
                "I would recommend it to a student who thinks they're up for the task. It's rewarding, and I found it quite enlightening. That being said, I don't think it's right for everyone; in fact, there were many times when I wasn't sure it was right for me. If I was talking  to someone who finds the subject matter intriguing and is really willing to do all that reading, then yes, I would recommend it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who has even a passing interest in philosophy or leading a meaningful life. While the survey nature of the course makes it so that we learn fewer technical aspects of philosophical inquiry, I still felt like I retained the basic principles of a really broad array of thinkers."
