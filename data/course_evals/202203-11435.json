                "Well researched and structured, could benefit from discussing the concept of money (as studied in some of the readings) in class -for example the role of the ledger. Give more time to private monies and digital currencies.",
                "I thought the content was very interesting and Professor Ogle clearly cared about the class. I think I would have liked more readings that were secondary source based and presenting arguments from various scholars. For example, my favorite reading was The Currency of Politics and would have loved reading more similar works.",
                "Strengths: The way the professor presented the narrative behind all the different arguments. She helped extract the social changes that influenced the physical and effective changes in money.",
                "awesome course, no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: The course subject matter is very interesting and offers a historical dimension to monetary questions typically confined to economics. Moreover, Professor Ogle is a good lecturer with an extensive knowledge of the subject matter. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Given the length of time this course covers, it can often feel like you are jumping from moment to moment without gaining a solid background in any specific period or historical process. The end of the course is especially compressed, with the entirety Gold Standard and Bretton Woods systems covered in only two lectures. Additionally, primary sources are concentrated in the Financial Revolution modules, and you don't really encounter them elsewhere. Writing assignments are also few and far between, which is helpful for managing workloads but hurts you if you're looking to improve your historical writing.",
                "Posting lecture slides before class would help since I like to write notes on the slides",
                "You learn a lot of very interesting material! However, it was sometimes slightly disorganized and difficult to know exactly when things were due and what we had to write - Professor Ogle is very accommodating though, and does a fantastic job of clarifying if you ask.",
                "Strengths: super light workload, easy grading and the material was ~pretty interesting~. Weakness: the class was super unorganized.",
                "Strength: Very structured approach to the history of money and very easy to understand\r\nWeaknesses: Would be nicer to receive more feedback on the midterm and sections to be more engaging."

                "Easy history credit, would probably recommend but didn't get a ton out of the class.",
                "Yes, I initially took this class to fulfill my humanities requirement but was surprised at how interesting and fun this class was. I am an economics major and was fascinated to find parallels between historical and contemporary events. I would highly recommend this class.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course other students because it was very informative and interesting. It really helped me understand how we transitioned from different money systems and the current paper money we use today."
