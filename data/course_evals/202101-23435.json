                "The lectures were definitely the highlight of the class. Each lecture provided an in-depth overview of various medical conditions and the relevant terminology. I think the main area for improvement is creating more spaces for peer interactions. The class centered heavily around listening to presentations and watching relevant videos, and it would be great if there were more opportunities for students to work together and practice speaking Spanish with each other.",
                "One of the strengths was that Professor Carreras made sure to keep the class engaging. I just wish there had been more set time during class for discussion, as opposed to just commenting on the material being presented.",

In terms of weaknesses, it was a bit difficult to gauge my status in the class since we did not receive many grades during the semester, therefore, it was a bit difficult to see where I could improve my spanish at times.",
                "Strengths: The professor is a gem!! She is really enthusiastic about the class and tried to make it as fun as possible on Zoom. The class size was also very nice and allowed for better engagement. Weaknesses: The class was a little disorganized and the syllabus was confusing. Also there was little feedback given on our work so it was hard to gauge how we were doing in the class. For the future, I would recommend making the syllabus more clear and consistent with Canvas as well as giving feedback on our writing and having office hours for more personal help.",

                "I think the lecture format worked out very well; students were able to engage with the class and discuss various concepts with the professor throughout the course. \r\nIn terms of areas that could be improved, I have two suggestions. Firstly, I think it would be helpful if the homework assignments were timed such that the material covered on the homework is covered at approximately the same time in class; this would allow for a bit more consistency in class. We also did an exercise with breakout rooms once during the semester, and it was a great opportunity to get to know other classmates and have peer conversations in Spanish outside of our class discussions. I would suggest doing more breakout rooms if the class continues in a virtual format, or else allowing for a bit more peer interactions in a live format so that classmates can build a rapport amongst themselves. \r\nIt would also be very helpful if feedback on homework assignments was provided at more regular intervals throughout the semester so that students can constantly gauge their success in the class and make adjustments where necessary.",

                "Yes absolutely!",
                "Yes its great for language.",
                "Yes, definitely! If you're looking for a chill L5 in Spanish, look no further, this is it. I got the sense that there were a lot of pre-med/more medically knowledged people in the class, but that didn't take anything away from my experience. Honestly above all else just take this class for Mercedes cause she is really awesome, it was a joy to go to class :). But if you're looking for a place to rigorously improve your Spanish, there are definitely better options out there - we never really had to talk (although most people did), a fair amount of the podcasts/videos were in English, and we got no feedback whatsoever on our written responses (except for one which was graded much more harshly than the others ultimately were) until reading period. The work is very chill, and I do think I improved my speaking and writing quite a bit, but that might just mean I was really rusty going into it. There isn't really a way to do the work faster or slower - it just is what it is, not bad at all but takes up a small chunk of time even when you don't have a small chunk of time to spare. But I found it overall to be a really fun and enjoyable class and would certainly recommend shopping it to everyone in the hope that you get into the 18 student enrollment cap (so if you want the L5 you do need to have a backup plan).",
