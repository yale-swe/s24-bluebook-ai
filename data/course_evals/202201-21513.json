The class felt very diverse, which was a strong point. The focus of the class, however, was a bit narrower. Office hours will be tough. Work together with the other students in class and you'll see improvement.",
                "The workshop format was really great - it's wonderful to share your poems in this way - and the class is really built around this. I liked how with this as the main focus, the assignments and conversations were directed to this and not stressful in any way. I think one way it could be improved (which we discussed in class) is the option to give written feedback on the printed sheets of poems."

                "Yes, without a doubt, I would recommend this course to another student! You will learn so much from Zarin, but you will also get what you put into the course. The workload is not very high (writing 1 poem a week and selecting a published poem to bring in), so it can be tempting to put this class on the backburner. However, if you put the time and energy in, your work will grow tremendously because of the workshop setting and because of Zarin who is infinitely helpful and insightful in class and in office hours. Zarin begins each class by having us read poems that we brought in, and she sometimes selects a theme or poetic device to focus on. Just being present in that time, you will learn so much. And you will also learn a lot when other students are up for workshop.",
                "Yes absolutely - it's a great way to improve your poetry and also meet other writers + read new poems!"
