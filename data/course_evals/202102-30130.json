                "I developed an understanding of how the brain perceives and behaves in various conditions. The 'battle against common sense' was an appreciable approach to the topic, allowing for readily apparent understanding of most concepts. I also developed some persuasion skills at the end.",
                "I was introduced to a broad but in-depth range of subjects and conversations in the contemporary conversation of psychology. I was able to express my ideas in our assignments much more comfortably and efficiently that I had originally expected, and I was much more engaged than on first thought.",
                "This course was a great overview of many topics in psychology. Professor Lazzaro also delves into reading journal articles, so this is a great introductory course into reading scientific articles, as well."

                "Strengths: well organized, great instructor, interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: the NOBA readings were not engaging and didnt contribute much to my understanding of the material.",
                "Lecture was very engaging and assignments were straightforward. We also had some guest lectures that were super interesting. Although the length of the course was something that I was worried about, especially with it being over Zoom, Professor Lazzaro always gave us time midway through to take a break and sort of recharge before we jumped back in to new material. I really enjoyed the format and structure of the course.",
                "Prof Lazzaro is a definite strength! She is incredibly kind and knowledgeable, explains concepts well, and fosters an inclusive learning environment. It can be hard to make things engaging on Zoom, but she did a great job of incorporating things like Menti so that we could interact with the material in real time. No weaknesses--this is an intro class and no prior knowledge of psychology is assumed. As for workload, the short response assignments are definitely manageable and the midterm/final are open note.",
                "Strengths include simplicity, high engagement during class, low workload, and excellent professorship. I can't think of any glaring weaknesses, though the style of teaching may not be everyone's cup of tea.",
                "I loved the Menti polls and all the studies that Professor Lazzaro incorporated into her lectures! It really engaged the audience.",
                "Professor Lazzaro was incredibly engaging and brought great energy to the class. She was able to touch on lots of different topics and reinforced them with real life stories. I wish we could have read more journal articles that related to the course content."

                "Yes. If you enjoy psychology you will definitely enjoy learning about a lot of the basics and Professor Lazzaro is great. All of the assignments were really straightforward and she gave feedback on all of them which was a really great way outside of lecture to interact in these crazy zoom times.",
                "Yes, definitely! Even if you aren't interested in psychology or don't need the prereq, this is a really fun and accessible class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, whether the student is majoring in psychology or taking it to fulfill medical school requirements. The class is engaging, with a personable component unlikely to be found in many other lecture courses. The workload allows the student to enjoy learning the material with minimal pressure regarding grades.",
