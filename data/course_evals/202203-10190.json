                "The way the course is currently organized is rather strong in my opinion. No weaknesses. I believe that the small class size and how responsive the professor is are the greatest strengths.",
                "There is no revision (except for the one workshopped piece) until the final unit submission. Since the class emphasizes the importance of revision, it would make sense to have more opportunities to revise certain assignments and get feedback multiple times, not just once.",
