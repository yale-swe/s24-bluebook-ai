I think I would have loved some more consistent reading, just because it's helpful to be reading a lot of plays while you're trying to write your own. We all write feedback for our classmates, but I think it might have also been useful to received written feedback from Prof. Jacobs-Jenkins.",

My only change would be more discussion of the elements of a play and the technical aspects of playwriting towards the beginning of the semester, as I found the lectures on that super helpful and would've loved to go more in depth with it!"

                "If you're seriously interested in writing, absolutely. I think any writer could benefit from taking this course, since a class truly dedicated to being a writers' workshop can be rare at Yale, but I would definitely recommend taking another playwriting course first. Professor is fantastic and you'll come out of the course with a plethora of practical knowledge and skills."
