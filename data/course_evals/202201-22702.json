                "Strengths - weekly plan published sunday, making getting ahead easy. Professor Randa is very flexible and a terrific teacher. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - feedback at times unclear, conversation partners had frequent scheduling issues, and grading was unclear.",
                "The strength of this course was Ustadha Randa. A really great professor who is fun and very kind. Arabic is a difficult language, but now I can carry a conversation (with my fellow beginner peers) in Arabic without much challenge. There is a lot of material to learn though and I feel like we didn't go as in-depth as we could have on some of the subjects.",
                "Very little interaction in Arabic. Very preachy",
                "strengths: engaging material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too much at once; a lot of content that was expected to be memorized\/understood with minimal practice",
                "Strengths: a lot of opportunities to speak the language, fun friday assignments that I can complete anywhere, good mixture between types of teaching in class (presentation slides, chalk board, talking)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Have more instruction with literary sources, have opportunities for extra credit, decrease difficulty of tests or maybe better prepare us for them by giving us practice ones. I felt that Arabic 110 didn't properly prepare me for this class because the former was easy and the latter was very challenging. This class was a big drain on my mental health because the homework took so much time and it felt like no matter how much effort i put into the class it wouldn't change my academic standing.",
                "The strengths of this course was the emphasis on collaboration and the native language partners that we had. The weakness of this course was the heavy reliance on the Al Kitaab Arabic book that dictated how we learned and the content we learned.",
                "Course is seriously disorganised. Attempts to address this are short lived. \r\nThis outsourcing of speaking practice is problematic too. \r\nThe italki experiment came at the expense of our learning experience.",
                "Strengths in this class include being super engaging. However, a weakness is that it goes very fast which makes learning grammar a little difficult. As long as you constantly ask questions and be engaged, then confusion be prevented.",
                "Strengths- instructional time devoted mainly to speaking in Arabic, instructional time sometimes involved reviewing missed homework questions, and tests\/quizzes were usually brief and not the brunt of our grade.\r\nWeaknesses- there could be more room for practicing casual conversational skills during instructional time.",
                "I liked that students were given a weekly schedule prior to the week starting. This helped me plan my week and know how much time I would have to commit to the class that week. The class could be improved if there was a greater focus on spoken Arabic and forming sentences."

The workload is definitely pretty intense and time-consuming (most of my friends in this course spent about 2 hours a day doing the homework), but if you have a real passion\/interest\/commitment to Arabic you'll find the course to be rewarding."
