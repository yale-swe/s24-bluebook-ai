                "I learned about the ideas of important figures like Hume, Smith, Ricard, Mill, Marx, etc. but also about economists I had never heard of before who were behind very important theories that affected the development of economics.",
                "I learned much about what is economics from the thoughts of great economists. I also got to know that there is a subject call history of economic thoughts, which is surprisingly fascinating.",
                "I gained a thorough overview of how economic analysis has developed over time, starting with ancient Greece and ending with contemporary economists.",
                "In this class you will engage with primary writings of many of the most important economists in history. I really got a much better understanding and appreciation for how the economics profession came about and the theory behind it.",
                "Amazing course. The history of economic thought should be taught more here. I think this course really helped me develop a deeper appreciation for the discipline.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of the history of western economic thought. From understanding complex texts and translating words into the formulas and diagrams we see today, this class helped me grasp how economics has evolved over the past few centuries.",
                "This course explores some of the landmark economic ideas as they developed through history and looks at some greatest economists from the time of Aristotle to the modern day. It provided an excellent chronology of how some of the most important ideas and theories came to be. In many ways, this course differs structurally from other ECON courses Ive seen at Yale as it does not focus heavily on mathematical equations themselves and instead focuses on understanding the broader ideas behind those equations. I found it incredibly insightful to be able to understand those theories from a higher level as it allows for a unique perspective that does not come from taking a typical economics course.",
                "How economic theory has changed over time.",
                "I learned a lot about the different characters behind the econ we learn in other classes. Professor Dimand was lovely in his teaching, but the overall topic was super interesting. Hearing about the intellectual origins of economic theories was enlightening and something I wish I had learned earlier in my economics career.",
                "Long ignored perspectives on the development of economic thought, not just their peculiarities at any given time like other courses on adjacent topics. Historical contextualization skills in writing about economic thought.",
                "I think this kind of more qualitative look at economic models - understanding the context in which these models were created and thinking about them outside the realm of calculus that's used in micro\/macroeconomic classes - gave me a much better understanding of how these models work, what they mean, and why they are important.",
                "This was the first time a A History of Economic Thought class has been taught at Yale since the late 1900s, and suffice to say, I think it is a course necessary for all economists or those interested in economics, to understand that economics isn't just creating models\/graphs\/data analyses, but is rooted in a strong philosophical and social tradition. It's especially good for those who enjoy philosophy, politics, global affairs, or literally any social science field, because it's basically a readings-based class but with an economics focus, so it's a new lens to look at the world. \r\n\r\nA better understanding of economics as a field from inception to modern day, most works of major names in the field, and a better understanding of how economics\/economic theory came to be! One particularly interesting insight was that economics as it is today (heavy quant\/data analysis) wasn't a thing until the past few decades, and as a field was more social (emphasis on the social) science, similar to philosophy.",
                "In this course I developed insight into how economic thought has developed over time, from the founders of the discipline to their critics and beyond. I learned about major events in the development of economics and how many of the theories we now take as given came about.",
                "Learned the history of how economics as a discipline developed through time. Read a rich variety of different approaches to economics, from classical to Marxian, from neoclassical to new institutional economics. Perhaps the biggest insight was a better understanding of why we study what we do in modern micro and macro econ courses.",
                "This was a great survey course of the history of economics, as a discipline and as an evolution of theories and methods.",
                "I developed a wide-ranging and extensive knowledge of the history of economic thought, stretching from Aristotle to the latest Nobel Prize winners. Moreover, having done the final research project allowed me to delve deep into an area of particular interest to me.",
                "a comprehensive perspective on the development of economic theories since its beginning; situate the mainstream neoclassical economics courses taught here and elsewhere in the tradition of economic thought, and how we got here."

                "Strengths: Professor Dimand is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and it was very fascinating to learn where all the intro\/intermediate micro\/macro concepts came from. I also appreciated that Professor Dimand was very neutral when discussing ideas that have become politically charged (i.e. Marx, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is just the nature of economic thought, but some of the readings were more engaging than others. For example, Smith was awesome and easy to read, but later economists were often more dense\/theory based.",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Diamonds lectures and I thought the reading list was awesome.",
                "Great course!",
                "I think this course could emphasize conversation more than lecture, which would enable the students to think critically about the works rather than simply remembering what was said by each author.",
                "A major strength is that Professor Dimand is an awesome and engaging lecturer. I think that history-based lecture courses often are difficult to pace well and keep engaging. I did not find that to be a problem in ECON 265 as Professor Dimands pacing was great and his subtle wit kept the lectures interesting. Another strength was the structure of the term paper. While a 12-20 page paper is certainly daunting in any class, Mr. Dimand is great at helping students plan accordingly and offer good sources. In the end, I actually found that the paper was one of the most fun assignments to research and complete during my time at Yale. One thing I would change about the course is the structure of the grades. The research paper only counted for 35% of the final course grade, equivalent to the final exam, even though it took a significant amount of time and effort.",
                "The biggest strength is definitely Professor Dimand's passion for the subject itself. You could tell that he could talk in-depth about any section of the course for hours without wavering. That being said, the course was not very interactive. The course material came to life whenever students interacted with the professor during the lecture.",
                "Strengths - interesting topic\r\nWeaknesses - not very interactive, very few opportunities for grades",
                "It was a solid course. I enjoyed it as it was. I just wish there were more history of economic thought classes. Why is it so taboo?",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Easy access to slides\r\n- Agreeable readings of not-terrible lengths\r\n- Welcome atmosphere\r\n- Agreeable workload\r\n- Presence of enriching optional readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lack of a discussion section: having a weekly discussion section to discuss readings would have been to the benefit of many and encourage participation and reading of material",
                "It's a great course if you enjoy readings! Because that is all there is no psets here. It's essentially just lectures in class, and supplementary readings. I also enjoyed doing research and writing a term paper on a topic of my choice it was a great way to explore a fascinating connection within economic history that you didn't know about before (e.g. China's influence in European Enlightenment, French economists, and Adam Smith). \r\n\r\nHowever, if you do not enjoy readings, this is not the class for you.",
                "A strength of this course was the organization. There were very clear sections and themes the professor covered in the development of economics. Overall I think these gave me a good understanding of the major developments and we had space to expore other areas that we might find interesting in our term paper. One weakness is the last couple of topics felt a bit rushed.",
                "Strengths: covers important information (not covered in other econ courses), kind professor, fair workload and grading\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Lectures rich in content.\r\n-Research project is very open and allows for great personal development.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Not as many opportunities for interpersonal discussion of the content.",
                "Strength: very well-organized; great lecture; the opportunity to read works of past economists, especially the classical ones\r\nWeakness: None"

                "Definitely take this course if you're interested at all in the history behind economics. You will learn about important historical figures, their contributions, and how modern economics has developed from them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. If you want to know a lot more about economics away from your micro textbook while not being troubled by tons of homework, do join this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning how economic analysis developed over time. The workload is reasonable (midterm, final, and one research paper with weekly readings that are helpful), and the material is very interesting.",
                "Absolutely. A lot of Econ classes here simply have you apply economic models without really getting into how the assumptions underpinning modern economics were formulated and debated over the past 300+ years. This course is a really valuable addition to the curriculum.",
                "Absolutely, great to put all the other econ classes into perspective.",
                "Absolutely. This course taught me things that no other course at Yale provides. Not only do you understand where all of the equations you learn in macro\/microeconomics come from, but how policy and government intervention has evolved with the study of economics.",
                "Yes. I would highly recommend this course to any student; even people who may only have a slight interest in economics. I think the course was structured to be very accessible to students of all majors, yet still be incredibly interesting and informative to genuine economics majors. Its a shame that Yale does not offer more history of economics courses; I hope they change that in the future and offer more courses of this nature permanently. If Yale does decide to offer this course in the future - and I really hope they do - take it.",
                "Yes! If you're looking for an unorthodox and holistic introduction to economics, then this is the class for you.",
                "I would.",
                "I would if you are more interested in the intellectual history of economics. It brings lots of fun facts to the forefront and provides a better feeling of why economics is the way it is today.",
                "Of course, yes! History of economic thought has incredible merits for lovers of history generally and lovers of economics, too. Incredibly valuable.",
                "Absolutely! It was a really fun class and I learned about a lot of interesting economic concepts that were introduced in micro\/macroeconomics in a way that made a lot more sense to me than calculus-based models",
                "This was the first time a A History of Economic Thought class has been taught at Yale since the late 1900s, and suffice to say, I think it is a course necessary for all economists or those interested in economics, to understand that economics isn't just creating models\/graphs\/data analyses, but is rooted in a strong philosophical and social tradition.

                "I would HIGHLY recommend that you take this course if you want to get a sense of where on earth the ideas we learn in economics come from. This course was also kinda refreshing after taking intermediate micro and macro with the long psets and math everywhere. I was initially worried about the writing aspects of it like the term paper and the midterm\/final (I don't consider myself a strong writer), but the midterm was structured so that we had a lot of choice and didn't have to be experts on every single thinker. And for my term paper once I got into it it was fun to write (just don't start it late and you should be good). There is a fair bit of reading but it was manageable.",
                "Absolutely. It really is quite eye-opening to study the history of economics as it provides a better understanding of why we study what we do in today's Econ courses. I now know why and how the idea of marginal utility arose, instead of it being thrust upon me in intro micro as some self-evident truth.",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend. I think the econ major should require a course like this - it was really nice to connect all of the ideas and theories I had studied in my core econ classes (intro micro, macro, etc.) through a historical lens. Prof Dimand is incredibly nice and helpful, and clearly cares a lot about his students.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter, including History and Economics majors alike. This is an important area of overlap that can provide important perspective for both fields.",
                "Absolutely! I am a senior double-majoring in History and Economics, and I got to say this class is the ONLY one I found so far that both spoke directly to my intellectual passion and was well-taught. I truly hope Yale can open more courses like this one."
