   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to effectively judge war films of any era. Through Prof. Clark and Svetlana Tcareva's classes, students were given opportunities to not only watch war films through a critical lens, but also convey their interpretations through effective and cohesive writing assignments.",
    "Having taken film classes before I don't think I learned any new skills from this course- it will likely not change the way in which you watch films at all unless you have never learned anything about film analysis before. However, I learned quite a bit about a number of different wars, and it was a very enjoyable way to do so.",
    "I learned about the representation of wars in film and literature. We covered a wide range of historical events, such as the Crimean War, World War II, and Afghanistan War. The films were often powerful, as well as the text, and featured different countries, cultures, and styles. I enjoyed studying film and literature about war from an academic lens because we identified patterns and themes that exist across most representations of war while differentiating them in other ways. The discussion was lively in the classroom and I enjoyed hearing the perspectives of other students, who all come from diverse academic backgrounds.",
    "I think this course did a good job of developing students' ability to draw connections between film, literature, and actual war events."

   "comments": [
    "I greatly enjoyed the freedoms given in assignments. A great deal of structure presented during class time was coupled well with the open-endedness of possible assignment subjects. With that, I wish there was a little bit of class input as to what films would be watched (perhaps a few student recommendations), but overall, this course was one of the best I have taken (in terms of structure, teaching, discussion, etc.).",
    "The films are great. I wish some of the literary passages were better or more connected to the films somehow.",
    "The strength of the course was the way in which it facilitated class discussion; there seemed to be many classes in which not everyone got to say everything they wanted to say, because everyone wanted to contribute so much! And while there were disagreements between students, debate was conducted amiably. I think the main weaknesses came from the syllabus- there were many written texts and few films with which I felt disengaged (I have already named them specifically in the informal evaluation we handed in during the last class). I think the course could be improved by including some more well known, critically acclaimed films.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1. Great selection of films and texts\r\n2. Instructors were extremely knowledgeable and led discussion well\r\n3. Workload was totally manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. The timing of screening. Wish it were slightly earlier in the week to give more time to write the reading response. Otherwise, no other weaknesses!!",
    "Strengths of the course include the weekly film screenings and weekly reading responses. Film screenings allowed students to dedicate ample time to view the film and engage with such as a group. Additionally, as the weekly reading responses were due the day after the film screenings and the morning before class, the timing was great as it drove students to write the responses while the film was still fresh in one's mind. I also thought the small class size gave students a great opportunity to vocalize their opinions and engage in thoughtful class discussion. \r\nOne weakness of the course was that the classroom as it was in a windowless room and set up for more of a lecture style - the discussion would have been heightened had we been in a classroom with a seminar table."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this to another student. However given the heavily focused subject matter, I think this course would best suit students with an interest in history or the arts.",
    "Its a fantastic course with a fantastic professor.",
    "If you have an interest in war films, military history, or the artistic depiction of war, take the class.",
    "Yes!! If you have an interest in wars, history, films, or literature, this is a great course. We studied a diverse range of material which allowed everyone to gain new insight into this topic. The papers were fun to write because they built off of discussions in class, and I really looked forward to the movie every week since I knew it would be good. Prof Clark and Svetlana do not assume prior knowledge, so definitely take this! You will learn tons.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student looking to engage with film and in depth class discussion. I think the class does a great job of exposing students to different war films one would probably not watch unless on such a syllabus. I enjoyed thinking about how the realities of war are and are not accurately depicted on screen as well as the artistic and cinematographic elements to such. Additionally, I thought the readings supplemented the films well and added an positive new layer to class discussion."
