Cant think of how to improve the course of study, except maybe some more open-mindedness towards non classical repertoire would be nice (or more thoughtfulness about why repertoire is regulated and what that says about the values of yales Music department and school). Theres no reason to limit the repertoire of study if students have a legitimate technical reason to study a particular song (REGARDLESS of its genre)"
