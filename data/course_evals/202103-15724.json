The first few weeks cover pinyin and basic characters, both of which are used to assist in the instruction of more advanced topics. We would learn characters - usually six - on our own each night, and then learn/review dialogues and structures in class.",
                "I developed basic Chinese conversational and interpreting skills that have given me a wonderful language learning start. I also gained cultural insight on holidays and traditions through the textbook and in-class discussion. When the class questioned a new grammar structure or Chinese character, there was an in-depth answer.",

                "Its true - CHNS 110 is a lot of work, especially for a language requirement. But its equally rewarding, not just in the level of instruction but in the social atmosphere that develops in a daily small-enrollment class. I really appreciated the courses emphasis on all aspects of language learning (writing, listening, reading, speaking) and the corresponding balance in our daily/weekly assignments. If I were to change one thing in the class, though, I would try to spread the lessons out a bit more evenly. I felt that the last few weeks of the class were a bit accelerated, and maybe that was because of the uncertainty surrounding finals this year, but there was definitely a sense that this could have been avoided by assigning, say, one more structure per week in the beginning of the semester, and one less towards the semesters close.",
                "It was comforting knowing there was always an answer to any question. I felt that the homework feedback was helpful due to its detailed comments provided by the department and . Unlike my past language classes, the usage of the textbook and Chinese character book assisted in my comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can claim for this course is its grading system on Canvas. Once test grades were on Canvas, my understanding of it flew out the window. Instead of posting scores as \"earned points/total number of points,\" they added as \"earned points/0,\" thus making test scores into extra credit. If you take this course, be mindful and keep a personal record of your assignment and test grades."

                "I had absolutely zero prior Chinese experience coming into Yale and signed up for Chinese 110 on a whim thinking Id probably drop it a week later. But this class proved to be my favorite from this entire semester, and I now plan to continue with Chinese for at least the next year.",
                "I entered this course without knowing any Chinese and as a likely drop for add/drop period. Now writing this, I enrolled in CHNS 120 with a passion for the language and culture. Do NOT hesitate to pursue this course if you're willing to put in the time and effort. It's especially true if you're interested in conversational or long-term usage. Though it requires investment, Yale's Chinese language department is worthwhile. Nowadays, I can hold conversations with Chinese-speaking friends and order at restaurants.",
