                "The PSETs were challenging, even with a thorough understanding of the lecture material, and the exams were extremely challenging even with a thorough understanding of the PSETs and lecture material. The course notes, though, were a superb resource and should be implemented for all math courses!",
                "I loved your course (in all honesty), but I believe the following can be improved:\r\n\r\n1. I think it will be nice to NOT skip any section of the book. Because a lot of the materials assume that you know previous materials, it was very hard to follow later on. For instance, we have not covered how the limiting process works for a sequence of function in a pointwise manner versus and uniform manner. And yet, we had a homework problem and midterm questions on them. \r\n\r\n2. I think it would have been nice had there been less homework. To be honest, I was busy doing homework even when I did not fully understand due to the reason stated above. For many students including myself, I had no choice but to finish the homework. I believe all students taking MTH 255 are well motivated students, and I think it will better in future instances if students had to worry less about homework load. \r\n\r\n3. The course progressed too fast. I think many students moved onto practice problem before knowing how to prove theorems. I doubt if students can prove FTOC from scratch to be honest. I think the design of the problem set and exams encouraged many students to know how to solve problems without fully understanding the materials.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Psets are intense, but you learn how to do rigorous proofs.\r\n-Lectures are good\r\n-Professor Neitzke was a great lecturer\r\n-A lot of resources, such as ULA sessions and office hours\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-The parts on calculus, were quite rushed, we developed integrals in the last 3 lectures or so, and the fundamental theorem of calculus on the last day, I know this is the goal of the course, the FTC, but it would have been nice to have another lecture on it, especially since it was on the final. But otherwise, great!\r\n-Midterm II was harder to prepare for, it was a lot more difficult, average was 74, compared to ~87 on the first midterm.",
                "It was incredibly fun to look at math I already knew and more rigorously understand its origins. One of the biggest positives was that the new content came mostly through proof techniques while seeking to prove ideas that we had already known to be true. Taking this course truly allows to understand the real numbers in completely new ways. This is not necessarily a weakness, but I would warn students that the first 1/3 of the course may be significantly easier from the latter 2/3, with the jump in difficulty being relatively sudden, so anyone taking this course should be prepared for that.",
                "Lectures were clear and organized, homework problems were applicable and of good length. Sometimes it felt like there was a significant jump from the lectures to the p-sets and not enough resources on general proof strategies for different kinds of problems.",
                "Prof Neitzke is absolutely incredible and does a fantastic job of explaining the course material and answering any questions that come up. The psets are an appropriate difficulty level and greatly improved my understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professors (for both sections), ULAs, and TF. Lots of resources to help us succeed and a very communal/collaborative class environment. The material was well-paced and the exams were difficult but fair. Weaknesses: the only real weakness was that grading was pretty slow. Though the professors always made solutions available, which was super helpful, it could be hard to assess mastery of the material (especially before midterms) when we didn't have a lot of problem sets back.",
                "The strengths of this course were the problem sets where I learned how to apply the concepts we learned in the course notes and lecture notes. The weaknesses were that I wish we had more time to complete the problem sets so i can think more deeply about the concepts being asked in class.",
                "The lectures were engaging and interesting, the material/notes were posted after class, problem sets were directly related to the topics related and corrected in a clear way (the feedback is really helpful to make progress in the class).",
                "Super great teaching in class and office hours, very useful problem sets to learn from, logical and well-paced structure.",
                "I think that this course helps a lot with building intuition and deriving proofs from that intuition. The course is well constructed so that students thoroughly understand a topic before utilizing it in later chapters. I think that the difficulty of problem set questions could be changed to better facilitate individual proof writing. As it stands, there were some proofs that were unreasonable for this level of math, so students were essentially required to get large portions of the answers from ULAs or office hours. I remember one proof taking over an hour for a ULA to write out completely. Overall the difficulty was reasonable, but these outliers meant that when I struggled, I was less likely to continue working the problem as I knew it was possible that I would never be able to come up with a solution on my own.",
                "Strengths: the notes and materials repository is so organized and built to support student learning. It's clear to me that the profs put a lot of thought into how best to help every student learn, because you can review everything we cover in the online notes, plus go above and beyond by looking at the example sections within. I always felt well supported in this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: they assign psets even on weeks with midterms. That ended up being quite a bit of work, sadge.",
                "This course was fantastic--there are few ways in which it could be improved. With that said, I felt that the material from the beginning of the semester could have been taught at a slightly faster pace to allot more time to the more challenging material at the end of the semester.",
                "The difficulty of psets felt imbalanced. Some weeks it felt almost unbearable while in others I had extra time I wished I could be donating to more difficult weeks. The strengths were the curriculum and open-ness of content. There was a pdf of the entire course notes, which was amazing for reviewing and learning. It took a lot of the pressure off of writing everything from the board into the notes, and instead I could listen to what the prof was saying.",
                "The PSETs are very helpful practice, and I really liked that they provided extra problems too! It was a shame that we didn't cover the entire syllabus, maybe a faster pace would get us there next time.",
                "The course was very well organized, with material being taught in a logical order. There was a lot of support from the professors, the TA, and the peer tutors, which was super helpful.",
                "This course was great! Neitzke's lectures were awesome, exams were fair, and homeworks were challenging enough to help learn the course content. I feel like homeworks tended to be graded slightly harshly, but besides that, the class was super well structured!",
                "The course was very well-taught with an energetic and thoughtful professor. The problem sets were engaging and will force you to stay on top of the material. The topics themselves are interesting and give a fundamental understanding of calculus.",
                "Homework not representative of exams.",
                "This course was very well taught, and for the most part the test and homework questions were fair/ reasonable (with the exception of one or two homework problems, and test 2 was a bit too difficult but the grading policy allowed us to replace it with the final). I really appreciated the office hours being available at many times, and having two sections coordinated with two professors allowed us to go to both office hours. The workload was what you could expect from a reasonable pure math class. The only complaint I would have is the difficulty of the problems in test 2 and the difficulty of one or two of the homework problems (which I think the instructors are aware of which ones based on feedback from other students). Overall this was an interesting course! It was challenging enough even if youve seen the material before, but not so difficult that it was unapproachable for a newbie (though it is a fair amount of work).",
                "I think lecture and office hours were generally fairly well handled.  It did feel like there was a lot of support for the immense challenge this class often posed.  That being said, I do think the feedback loop of this course was difficult.  While solutions were consistently posted after a while, actual feedback on work was spotty and often took a long long time to get back.  For a course with a good amount of building, this was very frustrating as a student.  I also sometimes felt like the pacing of the course felt fast, though this could just be a personal issue.",
                "It was wonderfully curated and organized!",
                "The course is well taught and organized. I liked Professor Neitzke's enthusiasm about the course material and found his lectures very engaging.\r\n\r\nThe course does come with a rather hefty component in its evaluation; there are weekly psets, with no exception, and the two midterms are each 3 hours long. I sometimes felt stressed about this, and would hope to see a more relaxed approach to evaluation in future iterations of the class. I also think the course was a bit unevenly distributed; we spent a week for each important topics, such as limits, differentiation, and integration.",
                "Strengths: Neitzke, fantastic lectures and notes.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",

                "Yes, take it. If you are doing STEM, QUANT, or anything, you need to take it. I would suggest you to go through Rudin's principles of mathematical analysis before attending class though",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in math, it is really beautiful to formulate Calculus from the ground up! Can you really trust Calc I & II? This course allows you to trust the things you are given in those courses.\r\nAll together, a great intro to the math major!",
                "This was by far the most interesting and insightful math course I have ever taken. I feel like I have a far better general understanding of mathematics following Analysis 1. Anyone with any mathematical interest should take this course, even if it is not a major requirement in any way. It is absolutely worth taking proof-based linear algebra beforehand just so you can take analysis.",
                "Yes, best math class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you are relatively comfortable with proof-based math and want to improve your mathematical understanding, this is a great course to take.",
                "Very well-taught and organized course that will give you a great understanding of the material. Definitely be prepared to work hard, as the class moves fast and psets could be time-consuming. Would certainly recommend, even to non-math majors! Many people take this class after linear (225), and while the proof-based nature was the same I will offer a warning that the content of the class is very different. The \"type\" of math, and types of proof, change a lot between linear and analysis, and I found analysis much harder, although I'm sure it's different for everyone.",
                "I would recommend other students to take this course because it certainly helps improve one's proof writing and critical thinking skills.",
                "Absolutely! Anyone who is interested in math or proof-writing (and not only math majors)!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is quite an interesting class, and professor Neitzke is an extremely good teacher.",
                "Would recommend, especially with an organized prof like Neitzke! In fact would recommend any course with Neitzke but that's getting off track. You need an inspiring prof to teach you analysis - if you get bored in lecture, consider dropping and taking it another semester (I dropped 255 in a previous semester and took it again with Neitzke). Math 255 is like the gateway drug to math, so you really want a good prof for this one.",
                "Absolutely--especially if it's being taught by Professor Neitzke. You will develop strong proof skills while learning cool material. Essentially, at the beginning of the course, you're taught what a real number is, and by the end of it, you've proven single-variable calculus! It's amazing.",
                "If you are not looking to major in pure math but enjoy math, I would audit the course or take it C/D/F. It was very interesting and made me appreciate math more than Linear did, for example. It made me much better at writing and brainstorming proofs, and I think made me a more patient, thoughtful, and better student. The psets and exams are hard, but they push you to improve.",
                "I definitely would! I found it very interesting, and I learned a lot about math. It was a challenge, but definitely a rewarding challenge.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course. Analysis and topology seem like really interesting fields, and this is a strong introduction to both. Professors Neitzke and McAdams are both fantastic, and very supportive and helpful. One word of warning is that the material got significantly more difficult in the second half of the course, so be ready for that!",
                "I would! For anyone interested in mathematics or proofs, this class is super super interesting, and I learned so much in it! Every lecture was dense and packed with content.",
                "This course is another great introduction to proof-based mathematics. It builds well upon Math 225 but is not too much more demanding. I would only take this course if you're interested in proofs; the goal of the course is to define the limit, derivative, and integral using very rigorous language you probably already know these concepts informally. I nonetheless really enjoyed the course.",
                "If you are interested in analysis, take the course.",
                "Yes, if you are a STEM major or if youre interested in math at all. You get a new perspective on topics youve probably seen before, and itll change how you think about math.",
                "Yes! Great way to learn more about math!",
                "I would recommend this course to students who need this as a requirement or who are interested in exploring pure math (or know they already enjoy it). I think Professor Neitzke really made this class for me; Im not the biggest real analysis fan but I do love pure math, and the course was nice. If you can take it with Neitzke, it is definitely worth it. As a course in it if itself, it was a great comprehensive introduction to analysis and you will come out with strong fundamentals.",
                "I think this course does some things well and obviously is a requirement for the Math major (or 256 as an alternative).  However, I would recommend being aware that this course is pretty challenging and probably not all that interesting unless you are really interested in mathematics.",
                "This was an awesome course! You make rigorous a lot of the concepts that you have already learned in calculus with the addition of sets (my favorite topic) amongst other things like countability, metric spaces, compactness. It's approachable as you will have intuition on a lot of these topics from calculus classes, but Professor Neitzke does a great job of making you understand the intuition behind ideas and setting things up. One of the most important resources for this class is Professor Neitzke's notes (which are digitalized nicely), and the ULAs are also wonderful. \r\n\r\nIn terms of structure of the course: we have two midterms plus a final exam, and 12 psets (which was a bit ambitious)  we would have shorter psets on weeks we had our midterms.\r\n\r\nProfessor Neitzke is also extremely accommodating and interested in your wellbeing, so definitely reach out to him if you have any questions or ever need help!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to take higher level math courses. This is a key stepping stone for the mathematical sequence, and it will help you become a better proof writer.",
                "Yes! Especially with Neitzke! He will change the way you think about math!",
                "Yes, interesting material",
                "Yes! If not for the math, it teaches you a new way of thinking about problems.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should have to take this! I wish there was a less intimidating version for non-stem students, it filled me with awe!",
                "Yes, especially with Neitzke",
                "Yes, its a good course if you want to be challenged and know more about logic and proofs."
