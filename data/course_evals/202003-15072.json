                "I loved Professor Gendron. She's amazing and always so ready to help students. Strengths include the grace days, the reading quizzes, and only one exam which was open note. I liked the optional draft options for the final paper.",
                "I really liked the textbook and the online quiz format. I also received really good feedback on my papers, which was great! I think the main drawback of the course was that the instructions for the papers were sometimes very confusing, and it was hard to keep track of all of them. It was also difficult to know what information to include on the final paper, as we discussed so many different things, but I think Professor Gendron was pretty lenient, especially with the stats sections, which is great.",
                "Strengths were the set up of the course and the papers we wrote",
                "strengths: the content was always taught in a straightforward and detailed manner\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the textbook chapters felt irrelevant to class discussions\/in-class content; there was also a lot of work cramped into the first half of the semester, and much less in the second half (the distribution of work felt lopsided\/unequal)",
                "Very strong course in general, very engaging",
                "Strengths: good hands-on experience and you get to pick topics you're interested in; lectures and textbook all covered very helpful materials; Prof. Gendron and our TF were really available, patient, and warm\r\nWeaknesses: As part of the course design, we received less feedback on the 2nd research project. But since our class study (the 2nd project) was much more complicated than the group study (the first project), I wish we had spent more time debriefing it.",
                "i appreciated that there were earlier deadlines for larger assignments to receive feedback on our drafts. as a procrastinator, it helped me stay on track throughout the semester and also gave me the opportunity to revise and edit my assignments. it got overwhelming at times to have so many things due for one class (there were a lot of smaller tasks we needed to complete before each class along with the larger assignment, along with class readings we would have to do on our own time), but overall i think the prof and TF were pretty helpful in answering any questions and pushing back deadlines at certain points of the semester (i.e. the presidential election) if we as a class were feeling overwhelmed.",
                "Really amazing and intriguing!",
                "Professor and TA were very involved in student success. I can suggest no improvements.",
                "I really liked that the class provided us with a baseline. I hadn't had much experience with scientific writing or with conducting experiments, and this course helped me get the baseline that I needed. The professor didn't assume that students had any prior knowledge, which was super awesome. I liked the material that we covered (we specifically talked about how WASPy psychological research is). We also got lots of feedback on our writing, which was super helpful even if it was shocking at first to see the amount of comments on your page. The textbook was helpful, although it contained so much information that I wish we had covered some of it in class. We were expected to read the textbook and take quizzes on it, which was helpful but we never got to apply the information we learned to what we were doing in class. The quizzes and the one exam were good ways to test what I had learned, although the amount of reading and work this class had was often overwhelming. It was especially frustrating when we'd get assigned lots of work and then it wasn't graded until the end of the semester. Because there was so much work, I sometimes felt like I didn't absorb the important information as much as I'd have liked to. For example, we did two in-class exercises on SPSS, but we mostly worked on these independently, and I would've liked a class with the professor orienting us in SPSS instead of the worksheet. When I analyzed data one-on-one with the professor and a few other students, I understood what we were doing and why; when we did the in-class assignments earlier in the semester, I had no idea what our results meant or what we were really doing. It would've been helpful to have some orientation in this aspect and to have it applied practically, since a lot of this class doesn't make sense if it's not applied practically. I just feel like a lot of those in-class assignments should have had some more guidance from the professor."

                "The synchronous virtual seminars and lectures worked out nicely, but I hoped we had posted more class recordings for reviews, especially towards the later half of the semester. Since many of the hands-on research parts in this class are new to many, a platform for classmates to ask general questions outside of class time might be helpful.",
                "Lots of pollEv and office hours\/stats clinics and workshops to take full advantage of all resources offered to us! No pressure to answer questions, but an open and inviting environment to do so",
                "I think this class was, for the most part, well-adapted to the online format given that if we weren't having lectures, we would be working independently or working in small groups on our projects with assistance from the professor and the TA. I would have liked it if there were more ways that the professor engaged with students during the lecture portions because I often found it difficult to focus (the class was 9am EST and 8am for me). The TA held a really engaging lecture but that was on the last day of class, so maybe in the future, it'd be cool if the TA could lead some of the lectures as well. Maybe the lectures could also make use of more Zoom features, such as surveys. I really liked it when the professor would ask us questions that we'd answer in some kind of app as the lecture went along. I also feel like considering that we were in a global pandemic and people's mental health was not in the best spot, the course load for this class was a lot, especially because a lot of the work was what I'd consider to be busy work. I often didn't see how the in-class assignments applied practically to our research until I sat with the professor and we walked through them together. There was already a distance due to us being online, and I think the class could've done a better job of lessening that feeling of isolation. I often felt very disconnected from my classmates even when we were in breakout rooms together. I think having more class engagement could really help that."
