    "This class helped me situate social concerns ranging form extremism to ineffective urban infrastructure in the context of colonial ideology and practice. I developed a framework for conceptualizing several important social dynamics in francophone countries in light of their historical underpinnings in colonialism.",
    "I learned how to apply close reading techniques to literature in order to understand underlying political messages and the parameters of what fiction can teach us."

   "comments": [
    "The course could sometimes feel directionless and vague, which may have been aggravated by the presence of three professors, all of whom had different takes on the material. It was interesting to have so many refined opinions, even though the lack of a distinct structure could be frustrating. At the beginning of the class, we read some theoretical work. I found these writings very useful, and we referenced them frequently throughout the semester. They provided a framework for structuring reflections on the dense, often difficult literature we read. It may have been nice to read more. The readings we did do, however, were rich, informative, and often contained strong theoretical elements. I enjoyed exploring this subject through novels, which seemed to paint uniquely gritty and authentic pictures of the topics we discussed.  Even though it could fee directionless in the moment, I appreciated the intensity and freedom of our discussions, and ended up learning a lot about an important subject that there aren't many classes on.",
    "The quantity of reading was difficult to manage, but the texts were wonderful. I particularly liked the fact that while the reading was in French, the discussion and writing was in English, which made the course more accessible to students like myself who have much stronger reading skills than speaking skills. This made it possible for me to read novels in the original French and retain that degree of proximity without sacrificing my ability to contribute. Another strength was all the feedback! Our weekly reading responses were always returned to us with detailed comments from Professor Jarvis.",
    "I can think of many more strengths than weaknesses for this course. Some of the Reading was very difficult, especially when they incorporated Arabic or creole words. But the challenge of such works was part of what made the course so satisfying and engaging. As the course is set up, each week represents a different city, a different Lena through which to study post colonial literature. This made every week exciting, every reading or movie new. The small size of the course also created a wonderful environment that helped facilitate interesting class discussion. And above all, the weekly comments on Reading responses was invaluably helpful."

    "This class can feel directionless and vague, but in some ways that's a good thing. The material is complex and difficult to grasp, and you have to keep turning it over in your head and putting different pieces together until a coherent picture emerges. The professors are great, and really help with this. You'll leave with a nuanced understanding of colonial and postcolonial cultural dynamics, which is fascinating and valuable if you're willing to sit through some earlier frustration.",
    "Take this course! It's a fantastic blend of literature and postcolonial theory. You learn about so many different places, from Algeria to Mali to Martinique! The French readings are challenging, but the discussion and writing in English makes it accessible.",
    "Absolutely! Profs. Miller and Jarvis are fantastic instructors, who put immense thought into every detail of this class. One of the best French lit classes I've seen on offer\/taken.",
    "Absolutely. The best French class I've taken at Yale. Very well-organized. Good atmosphere for discussions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another study. But I would caution that a broad French vocabulary is necessary and that the more attention given to the works the better class will be."
