However, the deadlines were very helpful in urging me to produce tens of pages of writing that will likely make it into my final thesis. Also, being in community with the other WGSS majors was an invaluable part of my senior fall. This would not have been possible without this seminar."

The readings and exact details of assignments were not always very helpful for my specific project, but the professor gave us space to modify assignments to serve our individual needs. I came out of the seminar with a thoughtful presentation on my thesis and tens of pages of research/ethnographic notes. I think it would have been nice for the final assignment to be more specifically a partial draft of our thesis or maybe like 10-20 pages of polished content. Maybe also we could have had one meeting with all of our advisors present to bounce ideas across one another (but this sounds like a nightmare to organize)."
