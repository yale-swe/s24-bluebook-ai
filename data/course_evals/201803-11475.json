   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this course. This was the first psychology course that I have taken at Yale and it was amazing. I developed so many skills and learned about a completely new field of study that I am now intrigued in. I will definitely be taking more psychology classes in the future.",
    "how to initiate and maintain healthy relationships.",
    "interesting content",
    "How to better relationships in my own life and skills about how to maintain healthier relationships.",
    "The main knowledge that I gained from this class was familiarity with some basic principles in the study of psychology. Prof. Hirsch grounded these basic principles within the discussion of many studies that researchers have conducted within social psychology. I'd say that the course gave me some insight into a field that I had never before explored. Skill-wise, this class taught me a new way to think about meeting people and the processes that take place during these interactions.",
    "The contents of this course were very interesting as they regarded how to maintain healthy relationships and what constitutes them",
    "I developed the knowledge about the process of forming, sustaining, and ultimately losing close relationships. This dealt with not just romantic relationships, but also friendships and family relatives.",
    "I learned basic knowledge about attraction and the psychology behind relationships. I also learned how to analyze dyadic studies and how to critique popular media through the lens of psychological research.",
    "I felt like I really learned about how I interact with the people I have relationships with and actually know how to do better.",
    "I developed the ability to see deeper than just surface emotions. Now i understand why some emotions occur.",
    "lots about attraction and relationships, as the name suggests.",
    "I learned a lot about how relationships develop, are maintained, and then fall apart. I also learned a lot about attqchment style and how that influences relationships later in life. You will learn a lot about how people interact. Both friendships, family and romantic relationships.",
    "I learned so much about apptoaching relationships consciously and putting effort into everyday interactions with other people in a way that can better not only our personal relationships but also the general social state of society. This class has provided me with the most practical knowledge in my five semesters at Yale so far.",
    "I learned about the life cycle of a relationships. Relationships are much more complicated than I previously thought.",
    "I learned about the impact of different behaviors on relationships and the underlying reasons behind why many relationships are the way they are.",
    "How to better understand the dynamics of relationships, the influence of childhood experiences on our future relationship styles, etc.",
    "Course information was interesting, engaging, and applicable to my own life and relationships.",
    "I learnt theoretical foundation to a lot of aspects in relationships that we assume on a daily basis.",
    "Skills such as understanding how relationships develops and why humans are attracted to one another were developed. We looked into how to maintain relationships and what causing strain on the relationships. Finally we examined what life is like after breakups and the end of relationships and how to rebuild oneself afterwards.",
    "I learned a lot about relationship dynamics, everything from how they form to how they end. This includes romantic relationships but the class really extended to all kinds of relationships, specifically close communal relationships (we defined what that means in class). There were some intuitive things as well as some surprising things, but all of it was important to talk about. I also learned about ethical issues and how to read\/analyze psychology papers, especially in the context of popular news articles (and how those articles can misrepresent the research). Another big aspect of the class was applying what we learned to the real world, so I really appreciated that explicit connection (especially using TV shows).",
    "I learned what formed a relationship and how to maintain it. I feel like I learned a lot of different fields of psychology.",
    "I learned many new intricacies to relationships and learned a lot about how to solve relational problems and also how to prevent them.",
    "I learned all about the lifecycle of a relationship (all the way from relationship initiation to its resolution). There were so many concepts that are omnipresent in our daily life that we are not aware of, but this course brings them to the students' attention!",
    "Looking at my own personal relationships in a new light, and learning how to solve problems I have found in my own relationships"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course was perfect. There really are no weaknesses of the course.",
    "strength: the course content is interesting\r\nweakness: I wished the structure would be more interactive, e.g. replicating research we mentioned in classroom settings",
    "very good class",
    "Sometimes it was repetitive. that is my only critique!",
    "A strength of this course was the lectures: Prof. Hirsch was very engaging and made class well worth the 9 AM wake-up! At some points, the content did feel like more breadth than depth; maybe that's the point of an intro class, but it would have been better to sink our teeth into fewer concepts than glossing over a greater number.",
    "The course was not very engaging, I would have liked less of a lecture type class",
    "The weaknesses were in the multiple choice of the exams. There was strong ambiguity in the wording of some of the questions which led me astray in my answering process.",
    "Very well designed course overall--good balance of material from lectures and the textbook, fair midterms, manageable workload. Only improvement would be to get rid of the movie activity at the end of the semester; simultaneously keeping track of what concepts we needed to exemplify, filling out 15 responses, and continuing to follow the movie to find good examples was not a great way to assess our ability to apply concepts from the course. There were only a couple clearly good examples in the movie of each concept, and there was a high chance you would miss them not because you didn't understand the concept fully, but because you would be writing another response and not paying attention to the movie when that concept was being exemplified on screen, or because you did not remember (at that moment) that the concept in question was actually on the assessment (since we were only given the list of terms when the movie began).",
    "The strength of this course is that it's an introductory psychology course that is probably a good and easy start to taking courses within the field or the major. The weakness is that because it's an intro course, the material is really easy and so the exams get nitpicky and the multiple choice turns into trivia. If you're good at memorizing facts and spitting them back out, then you'll do fine. This isn't a flaw of the class persay, but a flaw of intro psych courses.",
    "fun stuff. I wouldve liked concrete visual examples for everything, but i understand that's not entirely realistic.",
    "Strength was dr. Hirsch. She is absolutely amazing and very engaging. Made me actually show up to an early 9am class and pay attention. Really interesting topic.",
    "The class was well organized and the assignments were interesting.",
    "I think there were no weaknesses to this course. I liked that lectures were very direct and that class materials and lecture slides were always provided. I also enjoyed out guest speaker and the interactive nature of the lectures. Professor Hirsch was simply fantastic.",
    "This course was very enjoyable and the assignments pushed you to apply what you learned in a real life setting.",
    "Weakness: the time. IT's obviously a very early course\r\nStrengths: the course and assignment structure, including the final movie assignment.",
    "The course material was presented in a way that was comprehensible even to students with no prior background in psychology.",
    "Strengths; homework and exam structure was beneficial and engaging. I especially enjoyed the movie activity",
    "The lab assignments were very effective. It caused one to see the real life applications and how relationships psychologically is changing currently",
    "The strengths were the variety of topics covered, and the different ways of learning and demonstrating knowledge that were used in the class. I liked that the work was spread among different things, like the two different kinds of homework and the exams and the movie activity. The only weakness is that I think there was less material to cover at the end so it felt a bit dry\/repetitive. Also the 9am life was rough and I'm sorry for all the times I slept through class or came late -- I was more motivated than ever before to come to this class because it was so interesting but sometimes the sleep won. Overall I really enjoyed the class. Professor Hirsch was also a big strength, she was a great lecturer and clearly very knowledgeable.",
    "Strength: the beginning of the course was taught very well and very engaging. I particularly liked the experiment where you had twenty students come up and demonstrate how partners usually end up having equal level of attractiveness.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the end of the course felt a bit like common sense. The textbook readings and the lectures were over topics like communication is good to maintain a relationship and intimate partner violence is bad, which isnt a revelation.",
    "I loved this course! I love how I am always excited to come to this class in the mornings, despite it being at 9am! The class is very interesting and there were times where students would be told to engage in experiment activities that would prove the concepts that have been talked about in class!",
    "Very easy to understand, and very interesting material. Sometimes material got repetitive.",
    "The course was fascinating, well taught, and very well organized! If I could, I would take it again!"

    "I would definitely recommend this course. The information you learn feels interesting and relevant. In addition, the assignments are varied and all engaging. The final movie activity was very fun. I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "This is a very interesting course. I highly recommend to any students deciding whether or not Psychology is the major for them. This is an introductory Psychology course and is taught that way. Great way to see if the field of study is a good fit.",
    "Yes. Take this course and learn the most important skills of your life",
    "yes. interesting material and relatively easy",
    "YES! it will help you with your personal relationships. everyone should take it, as relationships are key to a happy life.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you're looking for an interesting, somewhat feel-good class.",
    "Yes, the course is very interesting",
    "If they are interested in learning about the inner workings of the relationship process, and just finding terms that define some occurrences in their relationships, it's a very strong course to take. The experiements taught are also interesting to learn about as well.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're a first year looking to learn more about psych without being super committed to taking Intro Psych. I would not recommend for an upper year student, take another psych class, many are accessible, more interesting, and less \"introductory\" while also being not that hard to jump into.",
    "I love the movie activity! please don't get rid of that it was so much fun and I enjoyed applying what I have learned to actual scenarios. Definitely one of the best activities I've done in a psychology class. I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes! The course material is very interesting. The textbook is one of the most fun textbooks Ive ever read. The workload is not too much and Prof. Hirsch is very nice. Theres a lot of correlation to real life application and Ive found what weve learned to be useful in dealing with relationships in my life too.",
    "ya. fun. interesting. good prof.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class!  It is super interesting and Dr. Hirsch is amazing and very engaging. First 9am I managed to want to go to and actually payed attenyion during. Work are 2 midterms that are very fair, lab assignments most week that dont take long. Then a final movie activity where you watch a movie and have to pick out examples of things weve talked about.  TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "Yes, the information taught in class was very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students at Yale. If every student was equipped with the basic building blocks of relationship knowledge, I think or campus would be much better off.",
    "Yes - It is very applicable to anyone's life",
    "Yes. I think this course was exactly what I was hoping to get out of it. Professor Hirsch was very knowledgeable and in tune with what would topics would interest us. The work load is very manageable and did not take away from the course itself. made it enjoyeable to learn the material without the pressure\/ distraction of too many assignments.",
    "Yes, I think there's a reason students are drawn to this course. The material is important and relevant to each person's life and well-being.",
    "Yes as it is extremely relevant to day to day life.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It was enjoyable to take. The professor was interesting and engaging. Also there were interesting guest speakers.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. The lectures were interesting enough to get me to 9am lecture pretty regularly. The topics were sometimes intuitive and sometimes surprising, but overall it felt good to clarify all the processes that go on with human relationships. The class emphasized application of the knowledge to real relationships (often using TV shows which was fun). I liked that the class was structured to follow an example relationship, from attraction to breakup. However it doesn't just cover romantic relationships, all close relationships are important and were discussed. Overall this was an important and interesting class. It wasn't too much work, just enough to keep what was going on in mind.",
    "Yes, but only if theyre interested in relationships",
    "yes, it is a very fun class and there is not a lot of work. you learn a lot and it is not stressful",
    "Most definitely! This is a great class to take whether you are just interested in this topic or need it to fulfill any requirements! The professor and the teaching assistants are all so kind. This class will most definitely open the students' eyes to things that they have never paid attention to!",
    "Absolutely! My suitemates get annoyed by how much I talk about this class",
    "Yes! It was excellent and informative :) I'd recommend it to anyone that could take it!"
