                "Strengths: The readings and films were interesting and thought-provoking, the weekly reading response prompts helped me distill my thoughts into a concise format, our seminar discussions were very engaging (thanks to Professor Jarvis's and Walid's leadership and the grad students' presentations), and feedback on all of our assignments (even the weekly reading responses) was very thorough. I also appreciated that the midterm and final assignments afforded us lots of space for creativity.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "As an undergraduate in a course split about half and half with grad students, I thought the format of this class was very conducive to meaningful conversation from a range of perspectives. I only wish we could have had a more complete round-table setup for discussion."

Professor Jarvis is one of my favorite professors of all time and you will leave the course having learned so much. Don't be intimidated by the subject or material. Come in with a willingness to learn and you will gain so much.",
                "YES! Definitely! You will have super interesting discussions with your peers about the readings, feel very supported by the teaching team, engage with eye-opening texts and multimedia, and delve into important, often-overlooked questions about the very ways in which history is recorded and passed on.",
                "Yes! whether you have taken comparative literature courses at Yale before or not, this course is accessible and Professor Jarvis is great."
