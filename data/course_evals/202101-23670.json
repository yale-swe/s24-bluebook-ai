By the end of the class, we were all able to have rich conversations about the poetry, a testament to Professor Coles superb teaching ability.",

I also enjoyed the class discussionseveryone was engaged and passionate about the poetry! Professor Cole, as a person, is the course's main strength. His love for the poetry is infectious, his humility is grounding, and his inquisitiveness is energizing. It is difficult to identify weaknesses.",
                "Professor Cole is an expert and wonderful teacher; any question you have about the material will be answered in great depth. It can feel inaccessible or intimidating at times if you have no background in Hebrew or Judaic studies, but Professor Cole takes time to explain things and the poetry is surprisingly relatable. The class will teach you not to rest on assumptions about the cultural practices of the time.",
