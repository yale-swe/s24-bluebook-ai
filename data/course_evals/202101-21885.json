                "This class is a lot of work, which I think is both its strength and its weakness. Obviously, a heavy workload is not what you like to read about when you're trolling CourseTable, but in all honesty, I think that a lot of work is simply what it takes to actually learn the language. Other strengths of the course include the material, which was all generally interesting and enjoyable (though we could have engaged with books and films from a wider range of the French diasporaalmost all of the material was based in Paris), the in-class discussion (you really do have to speak, typically at least once per class), and the sense of community that you form with your peers and the professor (this is perhaps the only online course that I've took where I feel like I'll recognize my classmates around campus next fall). In terms of weaknesses, I'd say that the biggest one is the audio programsthough occasionally helpful in their simplistic repetition and pattern-drilling, I often found myself simply tuning them out, or filling in the blanks but not really absorbing the information in any lasting way. While these programs weren't that much of a hindrance, they could also occasionally take up to an hour, and at the end of them, I often felt like I hadn't really learned much and had simply wasted an hour of my time.",
                "This course has a high workload, but the workload definitely helps improve your French. The expectations can sometimes be unclear at the beginning of the course, but over the course of the semester, it become more and more clear.",
                "As mentioned in the question about what knowledge I acquired, I think a strength of this class is that it allows one to greatly improve their French reading skills. A weakness of the course was the lack of speaking practice. In French 120, there was a project that required presenting to the class, which forced me to practice my pronunciation. I think French 130 would benefit from a project like this, because I felt underprepared going into the oral portion of the final exam.",
                "The class meets every day, which is great for language learning. But there can be a lot work every day as well.",

Though I think most students simply take it as a part of the language requirement, I did genuinely enjoy it, heavy workload and all, and I feel like I actually learned how to read, think, and speak French more fluidly and naturally than I had before. I would recommend taking it as a part of a lighter workload, however, simply because the homework takes a significant amount of time and you have work pretty much every dayI took it as part of a 4.5-credit semester, for instance, and I think I would have been a lot more stressed out and would have taken less away had I take it as part of a 5 or 5.5-credit semester.",
