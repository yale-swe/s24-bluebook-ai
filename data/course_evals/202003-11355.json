We would have preferred more lecture time by Prof. Zedillo in order to hear about his own experience and opinions on the different economic eras and strategies, rather than extensive recaps by students of the readings we had all already done. \r\n\r\nThe readings were usually very interesting and well-chosen. Guest speakers were engaging and relevant.",
