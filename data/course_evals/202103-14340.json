I found that in this class the topics we ended up on were very poignant and focused on connecting and comparing works with one another in the broader context of history. I feel as though my outlook on classical thought and how past ideas affected and were incorporated into future ones has broadened.",
                "I gained an introduction to political and historical theories.",
                "I learned about the history of western political thought from Moses through St. Thomas Aquinas. I gained valuable close-reading and analytical writing skills.",
                "I learned about Greek history, various approaches to writing history, ways to examine politics\/history in conjunction with philosophy and literature, and how to analyze political texts beyond the thematics. I also learned about effective classroom participation and gained a greater level of comfort with asking questions during office hours.",
                "Critical thinking, close reading, textual analysis, ability to draw out beneath-the-surface conclusions about political thought, etc.",
                "-close reading (doing close analysis on key passages of texts)\r\n-offered competing historical interpretations of some texts read in other classes\r\n-improved my writing quality substantially",
                "The texts in H&P were very interesting from a historical perspectiveespecially since the classical and medieval periods are very captivating for me. Being able to read efficiently was another skill I had to develop in order to sift out the important conclusions.",
                "This course helped me develop my close reading skills as they applied to broader historical and political themes. It provided a good general survey of early Western political philosophy.",
                "I have a much greater knowledge of historical and political thought in the ancient and medieval worlds. More specifically, I have learned how to analyze and evaluate political historical texts in the context of both writing and discussion, and have come to a greater appreciation of the insights that such texts can offer modern society.",
                "Grasping authorial intent, seeing how different authors tackle similar problems",
                "By taking this course, I was given a solid introduction to the range of historians and thinkers explored by Directed Studies' Historical and Political Thought fall term course. I learned how to think about these historians in relation to one another and I learned how to write a better argumentative essay.",
                "This course taught me an enormous amount, providing an excellent foundation for further study of history and politics. Perhaps the greatest skill I developed during this course was learning to properly assess political and historical thinkers within their context, understanding how the regimes they lived under may impact or tamper with the texts they write. Further, by the end of the course I was able to understand how ideas developed, changed, and influenced thinkers over time in a variety of contexts and political climates."

            "comments": [
                "I feel as though the strengths of the class lie in the format of the seminars. The professor would \"lay the groundwork\" for our conversations to get our minds thinking about the work in a way different from how we (or at least I) thought about it while reading the text. The ability for multiple people to agree and disagree with the ideas, approaches, and\/or rhetoric of different writers and then in turn agree and disagree with one another was refreshing. I do feel as though a weakness was that sometimes I couldn't read and evaluate the text as deeply as I wanted before coming to class, though that is a comment more related to directed studies as a whole.",
                "This class is great. The material is mostly all interesting and is heightened by the DS seminar style.",
                "Because Directed Studies History and Politics was my first introduction to political theory, I have no benchmark to compare it to. With that said, for me, this course's strength was its engagement with political thought. I feel like I can understand and and explain many tenets of western political thought, especially concerning Plato, Aristotle, and later Medieval thinkers. The course's weakness was history. I do not, for example, understand how lawmaking worked in Athens or Rome; I am also unfamiliar with the relationship between church and state during the advent of Christianity.",
                "Strengths: high energy discussions, usually reasonably paced readings, variety of perspectives in the classroom\r\nWeaknesses: the City of God reading load is nearly unmanageable (there may have been other works with similarly overwhelming reading loadsoften we dont cover even a quarter of what we read, so it may be helpful to select more representative sections of an authors work rather than reading a wide selection)",
                "Lectures given by different people every week alongside small seminars that allow for engaging discussion on the text. Course could be improved with a greater level of spoken cognizance about sometimes uncomfortable concepts like the \"west,\" the \"western canon,\" etc.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-some of the most fun 1st semester DS texts are here (in my opinions), lots of hidden gems\r\n-H&P is the DS course where there is the most consistent overlap between the the remaining two courses; it constantly feels like the texts from Literature and Philosophy are in conversation with the H&P texts \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-same issue with all 3 DS courses: too much content too little time, we inevitably miss out on a lot that could be said because of time constraints",
                "This course benefits from a close-knit cohort of students and a very engaged professor. As with other DS classes, I was often left frustrated by not being able to dive deep into individual aspects of the works we read.",
                "Strengths: The breadth of the course gave me a broad knowledge of many important historical thinkers. The frequent essays, though challenging, significantly improved my writing skills and my ability to critically analyze historical and political thought.\r\nWeaknesses: Given the enormous breadth of the class, I was often left feeling unsatisfied with the time we were given to discuss certain texts, and the readings were so hefty that I often felt like I didn't have time to really engage with them.",
                "Strengths: energy put into the the class was high, it could be improved by commentary from Professor Schillinger that contrasted student points with what the devil's advocate would say.",
                "Of the three DS tracks, Historical and Political Thought felt the most rushed. While it was gratifying to study for finals and see just how many historians and thinkers we had covered, I did not feel as though I had enough time to absorb the ideas of the historians and thinkers we only spent one or two days on, especially those medieval thinkers we studied at the end of the term.",
                "The strengths of this course are innumerable. It provides an excellent foundation for historical and political thought. The biggest strength is that it is a survey course, surveying the extent to which politics and history are imagined, interpreted, and reinterpreted over time.\r\n\r\nThe largest weakness of the course is that there is not enough support for the level of writing required. I felt that I was thrown into the deep end, and I watched as others who came from more writing-intensive backgrounds (read: elite private schools) thrived with the tools necessary to tackle the writing from day one, whereas I struggled to understand what exactly each paper wanted from me. The requirements seemed vague and lofty, and it seemed at times as if the goalposts for each essay shifted on a whim.\r\n\r\nThis course needs to devote some class time, no matter how precious, to explaining, in clear and concise terms, how a model paper is written. That time would be better spent than pretending to read Maimonides."

                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I think the professor is fantastic and very open to helping students in any way he can. Also the course is a helpful overview of the origins of Western political thought for those interested in any major related to political science.",
                "Most definitely! Dr. Schillinger is absolutely brilliant and has a top-tier twitter feed. Wears nice sweaters too. The discussion is scintillating and informative, and there is always good feedback\/debate on points raised in class.",
                "Definitely. Directed Studies is great in creating an integrated curriculum which follows itself -- it's almost as if we are in one class split up into three disciplines. It has provided an incredibly thorough foundation in key works.",
                "Absolutely. Obviously this is large commitment of a class but in my case it delivered what was promised. I went in hoping I would become familiar with the important texts in the western canon, and while I didnt leave with total fluency, I feel confident that I can approach most any classical or medieval thinker and have sufficient background to explore their thinking on my own. Besides, I felt that the H&P curriculum was honestly legitimately fascinating. Great course.",
                "Of all the DS classes, I would recommend this one the most. Keep in mind you must take the other two classes in tandem.",
