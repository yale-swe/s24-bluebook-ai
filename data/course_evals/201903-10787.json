    "You learn an impressive amount of Japanese in one semester. both syllabaries and then about 75 kanji characters.",
    "I can read, write, and understand basic Japanese!",
    "Hiragana, Katagana, Kanji; Japanese greetings, daily conversations, simple sentences.",
    "Japanese language skills in daily communication",
    "I learned approximately 70 kanji, the hiragana and katakana syllabaries, and some basic Japanese grammar.",
    "Elementary Japanese: hiragana and basic katakana",
    "1. Learned so much of the basic language\r\n2. How to have basic conversations, it's surprising how much you end up being able to handle (Gets you to about a 5 year old)",
    "I learned a lot of grammar and vocabulary necessary to build a solid base of understanding of the language. I primarily learned conversational Japanese.",
    "I learned basic Japanese to use in daily interactions as a visitor to Japan, including introductions, how to order food, how to discuss what I did in the past, and how to explain what I am currently doing, with basic adjectives to modify. I also learned how to read and write hiragana, katakana, and a few dozen kanji.",
    "Lots of Japanese characters and words and grammar structures learned, also learned new general language-learning skills"

    "Yamaguchi sensei is an INCREDIBLE instructor. She made the class incredibly enjoyable, and in meeting one-on-one with her, she is very caring. She was one of the greatest strengths of the course. Be prepared for a lot of work (beyond just completing homework). You really need to study often.",
    "Though the constant testing\/quizzing is kind of stressful, I found it to be a great way of keeping me accountable about daily studying. I also feel like I learned a lot in class because we go over vocabulary very diligently. I wish homeworks were uploaded earlier though--maybe getting a packet of all the homeworks in the beginning would be helpful.",
    "Very intense but engaging.",
    "This course is very useful and intense.",
    "I think the course was really good at getting students comfortable with speaking. There could have been a greater grammar or vocabulary focus, however.",
    "Strength: regular practice on a daily basis during weekdays to ensure that students keep practicing what they learned\r\nWeakness: the schedule of the class is only till noon, makes it difficult for master students to adjust their time schedule. May be helpful for students taking the course in the future if classes are provided in the afternoon.",
    "Strengths: Everyday teaching really makes you engaged\r\nWeaknesses: You really have to commit to it, every day for sometimes 2+ hours each day. The professor can really expect more of you than you think is fair as well.",
    "I thought it was all around pretty great. No glaring weaknesses.",
    "Having homework every day is very helpful in keeping the material fresh in the mind. Essays are also helpful for testing ability to express oneself in writing.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think we spend too much time in class going around the room and everyone reading one sentence; this is better done in pairs, as it gives everyone more opportunity to practice reading aloud than one at a time.",
    "Canvas often seemed disorganized, homework often uploaded late"

    "Take this if you're ready to commit a great deal of your semester to learning Japanese. It is a lot of work, and if you start falling behind at any point, it's very hard to catch up and stay up to speed with everyone else.",
    "Yes! It's a relatively painless way of learning Japanese and you really do form a community with the students in your class.",
    "Yes, for students who want to grasp a new language during college this is definitely a good course to go.",
    "Five times a week is really helpful to learn the language and the teachers are really good.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Japanese it is an excellent course. The pacing of the course is very fast, however, so be prepared for a sizable workload.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to students who are willing to study Japanese.",
    "Really think about whether or not you're going to be able to commit to this class.",
    "Yes. Good introduction to Japanese.",
    "That would just depend on their interest in the language"
