                "So much! The aim of the course is to prompt students to critically think about \"how the incentive structure of market exchange encourages businesses to commodify social relations in a way that raises moral questions about the pursuit of profit.\" The first few weeks of the course focus on creating a strong foundation for the four central ethical theories of the class: Aristotelian virtue ethics, Kantian deontology, utilitarianism, and Lockean property rights. Then the rest of the course allows students to use those ethical theories (and their own moral judgments) to analyze various specific business ethic issues, such as surveillance capitalism (privacy invasion at the hands of tech giants like Google and Facebook), \"woke\" capitalism, and sweatshops. You'll learn so much about each issue and, because Professor Collins is so intentional about assigning readings that cover a wide breadth of perspectives, you'll leave each class with a matured take on each. It's one thing to believe sweatshops are unethical, but it's another thing to be able to explain *why* you find sweatshops are unethical through a deontological lens or as part of an educated critique of free market capitalism (and it's highly possible you'll leave that class session thinking sweatshops aren't as unethical as you initially felt...). Through written reading responses, in-class discussions, a debate, and two papers, you will sharpen your ability to construct and present a strong ethical, political, and economic argument and respond to counter-arguments.",

                "As someone who was unfamiliar with business terms and concepts prior to taking this course, it provided a solid introduction to important concepts such as shareholder and stakeholder theory, corporate social responsibility, and the merits and demerits of both. Professor Collins did a great job at helping us connect concepts from week to week, and the course overall felt very unified. By the end, I felt like I had a solid grasp on some of the most pressing business dilemmas, including surveillance capitalism, religious liberty, and price gouging, and could analyze each from different ethical lenses, including Kantianism and Utilitarianism.",
                "I learned about current dilemmas in business ethics and how capitalism has led to the commodification of social relations. I developed writing skills as I had to write philosophy papers that considered multiple frameworks and applied them to the questions we discussed in class."

                "Strengths: Even if you are somewhat unfamiliar with prominent ethical theories like kantianism and utilitarianism or need a refresher, this class spends just enough time laying the foundational theoretical knowledge so that you will be able to apply these theories to the issues you later analyze. The readings for this class were incredibly interesting, and in-class discussions highlighted some of the key tensions between the authors.",
                "Strengths: great selection of readings that provides both a theoretical framework to analyze pressing questions in business ethics as well as diverse perspectives on those dilemmas.

                "Yes, a million times yes! This class is undoubtedly in my top 3 favorites that I've taken over my six semesters at Yale. The material of the class is by far some of the most interesting I've encountered during my time in college. I was so excited each week to unpack the readings with my peers because each piece discussed issues or advanced perspectives that I had never before considered. I've truly never learned so much during one semester. The course is intellectually challenging, but in a rewarding--not burdensome--way. The readings literally helped to clarify/solidify some of my career aspirations because they're just that interesting and impactful! Additionally, one of the best parts of the course is Professor Collins himself! This was my second course with him, and he is such a thoughtful instructor. He provides detailed feedback to each reading response, and every sentence of your papers will be marked and commented on. It's refreshing to have a professor so committed to facilitating the intellectual development of his students. He also devotes some time each class session to review the material from the previous class in order to make sure that everyone has a strong grasp on the material, which I really appreciated; that's particularly helpful for the midterm exam and papers.",

                "Definitely, but only if you intend to actually do the readings and put some work into this course. If you do, then you really will get a ton out of it",
                "Absolutely, Professor Collins is awesome. Almost every week covered an interesting topic and the professor always kept things interesting.",
                "Definitely would recommend it! The readings were sometimes a lot to keep up with, but they're absolutely worth the time.",
