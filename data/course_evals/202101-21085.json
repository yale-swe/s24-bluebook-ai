                "I think some of the proofs were difficult to follow or to at least think of ourselves without being guided in the right direction. Working out examples was the key way for me to understand a concept rather than looking at the proofs first.",

The professor is willing to answer any questions, so he is very helpful. One thing that could improve the class would be to add a TA for student assignments, but the teacher was a great resource.",

                "The professor is a very talented and smart game theorist. He genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and their continued academic success and learning. I truly enjoyed working with him. One weakness of the course is that sometimes the material was hard to follow. Perhaps a consequence of the virtual environment, but I found myself lost on many of the topics. Additionally, there were no TA's or peer tutors to turn for and we were not allowed to work on the problem sets with others, making it extremely difficult to receive outside help.",

It was also extremely tough paying attention to the course sometimes due to a unorganized course schedule."

                "3 Psets a midterm and final. Both midterm and final were basically psets. Professor is nice and works with students to make sure the course is well paced. Very good spring semester senior course",

Some of the games and theorems you learn are interesting and make sense when playing with the example problems but became difficult and mundane when considering their proofs and general cases. If you really want to understand it, you may need to read through any of the notes in Canvas or material online.",

I came into the course already having completed a game theory class, and still found the material to be extremely challenging. However, the professor is great and the workload is relatively low (yet VERY hard), so depends on what the student is looking for.",
