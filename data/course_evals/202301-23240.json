                "Overall I thought this class was super fun. But I wish there were more discussion. it was mostly Professor Franks reading a bunch of slides (which was interesting and a good summary of the readings, to be fair!) and then the grad students saying they liked x or was confused about y or something. It wasn't really an environment that made a lot of room for undergrad participation.",
                "Strength comes from Cavell's careful and insightful treatment of Wittgenstein. I think Prof. Franks is good at picking reading materials. I always find the readings of this course to be the most interesting and thought-provoking among all courses this semester.",
                "I thought it was a well run course and Paul did an excellent job introducing complex topics to a large class. I came away from each class with a better understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nI did find that at times a small group of philosophy PhD students dominated the conversation and made those of us outside philosophy not feel as comfortable sharing our thoughts.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Manageable amount of reading\r\n- Very well-curated and tight syllabus\r\n- Rigorous, but supportive\r\n- Super helpful slides\/lecture-section and lots of referencing of prior material\r\n\r\nNot so much a weakness, but a consideration:\r\n- There was kind of a disconnect between the undergrads and grads, and I would have liked to hear more grad student engagement to learn from them (like their thoughts in a regular Canvas post, for example)",
                "Could have been a little more discussion oriented, but also: listening to Paul Franks is an unmissable experience.",

                "Would definitely recommend. It is rare nowadays to be able to take any course about Wittgenstein and ordinary language philosophy at all and he is such a important (and incredibly smart and insightful) philosopher. And Cavell treats Wittgenstein properly. Let me just cite a passage here: \"there is no approach\r\nto it[Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_], anyway I have none. Approach suggests moving nearer, getting closer; hence it suggests that we are not already near or close enough; hence suggests we know some orderly direction to it not already taken within it; that we sense some distance between us and it which useful criticism could close.\"(Cavell, _Claim of Reason_, 6) Also let me say that the thoughts of Cavell (and maybe Wittgenstein as well) are incredibly close to Heidegger's, so you might want to try out the course as well if you are a Heidegger maniac.",

                "Yes, if you're interested in these relatively niche areas of philosophy and have ample training to handle the rigor of the course.",
