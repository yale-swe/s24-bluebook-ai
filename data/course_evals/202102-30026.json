The readings took us to different parts of the world, and yet made me realize an anthropological way of thinking applies to everyday life-- one of my main takeaways from this course.",

                "The readings and lectures were interesting, allowing class discussion to be fruitful and enjoyable. Readings were challenging as they could be long and difficult, especially the theories but the ethnographies were fascinating. With less time in between classes for readings, I found it difficult to internalize ideas to form insightful and cohesive thoughts, but the discussions were well facilitated by Professor Harms so I did get a lot out of the course. The assignments were actually a great way to apply anthropological concepts and ethnographic techniques because they encouraged me to think about common rituals and behaviors in a different light than I otherwise would have.",
                "Strengths: many free discussions, clear instructions, interactive \r\nWeaknesses: a bit too many readings for 5-week",
                "the professor encourages students engagement which is awesome. only weakness is the compression of the course into 14 class meetings, which left out some material that would normally be covered during the semesters",
                "This course was taught extremely well, and the \"lectinar\" format was great for the summer class. Harms is a great teacher and I learned a lot, and the pop quizzes were easy enough that I felt like I was retaining information, but in a way that wasn't super stressful. \r\n\r\nI do believe that the class was a lot of reading, however, although it would probably be manageable in a normal-length semester."

                "Yes, this course was a great way to start learning about anthropology and cultural anthropology-- the concepts, methods, and challenges. Reading stories and having context and opportunity to talk about new concepts make it much more digestible and memorable than dense textbook learning, so I highly recommend.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely. Anthropology is not a major option in my host college, thus it is a relatively new and interesting topic for my classmates and friends to explore. Besides, I believe that anthropology is significant to building a better society for our next generations.",
                "Please take this course with Dr. Harms!! hes extremely inviting and understanding to students and knows how to encourage student engagement. its a great intro course whether studying anthropology or not!",
