                "I think that the lectures could have been more structured, sometimes it was hard to follow and the professor sped through concepts pretty quickly. If I didn't have high school physics background coming into this course, it would have been extremely difficult.",
                "Strengths - Mehdi knows the material very well and teaches clearly. The only weakness was the confusion that comes with such a fast paced course. There wasnt much downtime for transitions, so lecture was 100% content",
                "I know it's a compact course, but the professor needs to slow down when teaching. I would rather have had longer class time than have him speak so quickly",
                "The weakness of this course is that each lecture crams in entire units, and it is hard to keep up if you haven't read or prepared yourself beforehand. However, the strength is the care of the professor and TAs for the students. They want to see you succeed and will help you whenever you ask.",
                "- strengths: super friendly prof who is very good at explaining concepts, very fair assessments, clear organization and expectations\r\n- weaknesses: I've had other classes with better TAs (maybe it could have helped if they had been in our classes\/had a better understanding of exactly how and in what way the prof was teaching us)",
                "Strength of this course- it isn't quite in depth, so you only need a foundational understanding of the material and then you can apply that knowledge to multiple cases. A weakness would be how fast paced the course is, it is very easy to fall behind.",
                "The course was very well organized and straight forward. The course could be improved by being more clear about which things in lecture will or will not be covered on the exam.",
                "Strengths: Mehdi is a great professor and he does a good job of providing us with the most important information.\r\nWeaknesses: This class is very hard to take online and requires a great deal of concentration and involvement to suceed.",
                "Course material was on the occasion incorrect and would pass by uncorrected. Overall, good pacing of the course material aside from the few mistakes that slipped by.",
                "Being a summer course we moved forward really quickly, but that can't be helped. One piece of input would be for the homeworks, especially the ungraded final one, it would be nice if all of the problems were odds, so we could check our answers in the book to make sure we were doing them correctly.",
                "Strengths: Professor explained things well, workload not overwhelming, so many options for TA and professor office hours. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we spent more time on the last few topics, since I felt they were very rushed.  I think sections would be more useful if they were more structured, since sometimes I felt like we didn't get much done.",
                "Sections go a little slow and the material is sometimes hard to follow since the class goes so fast. but the practice problems were very helpful in class.",
                "The course does a great job encompassing a lot of general physics topics in such a short amount of time. The structure of the lecture is set up nicely but I think the sections should be more structured to be more helpful. Whether it's the TA giving a 15-minute review, taking questions and then working questions, or simply working questions the entire time I think the questions should be picked out ahead of time so it's more beneficial. Another idea is that the sections could go through a worksheet that is the same for each TA to eliminate the strengths and weaknesses of the TA. Moreover, I think it would be extremely helpful if the TAs could attend lecture because it was difficult to ask a question about the lecture when the TAs weren't there because they often didn't know what we had talked about or learned in a day.",
                "Strengths - exams were quite fair, PSETs were good to prepare for the exams, material was taught quite clearly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the quizzes didn't correspond with the material we learned in class, sometimes there were gaps in conceptual knowledge",
                "Strengths: Interesting enough content and the professor's lectures are generally structured well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TA session felt pointless, only going over homework problems and a five minute quiz. Office hours (via zoom) felt kind of disorganized. The \"oral exam\" aspect of the course didn't make any sense.",
                "The professor is really accommodating and truly wants to reward improvement. He is always willing to meet and help assess how a student can improve, since the course is very fast-paced, which can not be avoided. I think the syllabus was very clear, and I always knew what was expected of me. The workload was not heavy in terms of PSETs a such, but since we do almost a chapter a day, it will be heavy on the studying end of things to keep up with the material.",
                "Professor Mehdi is a strength of the course because he is really nice and genuinely wants his students to do well (and isn't as strict on the percentage breakdown of final grades) but his teaching style might be harder for people who don't have as much physics experience, background knowledge...etc",
                "This is a summer class, and it has to move fast. But the instructor spent every class deriving as many formulas as possible with very little by way of intuitive explanation, making it hard to feel like I was actually learning anything at a deeper level. However, if you just want to get a science requirement out of the way, this is perfect - the summer session went by super fast.",
                "Strengths: Good lecture format, weakness: moves really fast so a lot of concepts are not explained well.",
                "Lots of great practice problems and practice exams, felt like it was easy to fall behind from lectures, but to be somewhat expected considering the fast paced nature of a summer course",
                "Strenghts: straight-forward lectures, strong teaching team, great TA's that are always willing to help, workload and problems assigned were manageable and relevant in terms of difficulty to the exam\r\nWeaknesses: the pace (but it is a summer class), besides that this is a great summer class option",
                "Overall this course was good. Mehdi is a good lecturer (he does go a little fast but that's the nature of summer courses), and although there is a limit to how great an online class can be he did well under the circumstances. I was also really pleased by the amount of help available to us outside of class - usually at least one TA was holding office hours every day. I do wish the sections were structured more - I liked having the quizzes that we did together but the Q&A with the TA, which took up most of the section time, seemed unnecessary since there were already so many office hours being held. If I were to make alterations to the course, I would add more quiz questions in sections, and let us work together on them for more of the section time because I think those kinds of activities facilitate learning and reinforcing information really well. Lastly, I never really understood why we had an oral section for the final exam - it seems to me that the written final is enough to measure our competency in the course.",
                "strength is the lectures are to the point and exams are fair. weakness is that the discussion sections are not that helpful",
                "the discussion sections were not very helpful, the professor was terrific.",
                "The class did a good job at following the textbook, however often the class moved far too fast (perhaps this is just a side affect of being a summer class). I think a slower pace would definitely help the course",

                "I would only recommend this course if it was a major or premed requirement because it is a lot of work in a very short amount of time, especially in the summer",

                "If you have a strong background in physics, definitely take it over the summer. I had taken AP Physics 1&2 and Physics C in high school so doing the homework I was just reviewing what I had already learned. I cant imagine how difficult this would be to actually be learning all of this material for the first time at this pace. It is doable but will take significantly more time.",
                "Yes- efficient way to learn introductory physics",
                "It is a requirement for many students, so yes, however, if you have the option to take 170 and dont have much experience in physics, I would probably take that. It can be tough at times, and sometimes you can study and study and still pull terrible grades on the exam.
