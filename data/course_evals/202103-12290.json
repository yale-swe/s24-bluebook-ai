                "Pros:\r\nI liked how we tended to have a lot more interactive discussions than just lecture. This meant that I never really fell asleep in class. I also liked how the structure of the lecture slides and the project/essay topics we were assigned. A lot of our big assignments were super fun to complete, as it gave us a lot of freedom in terms of our response. I was able to talk about subjects that I actually found an interest in.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nI'd say most of the vocabulary we learned was pretty relevant and could appear in the day-to-day life, but there were also some words that seemed slightly outdated or too formal. There was also the issue of our \"textbook\", which was really just an unpublished PDF apparently written by someone in the Chinese department at Yale. Therefore, some of the subtopics did not seem very refined and relevant, and there were many typos in the textbooks, ranging from simple grammatical errors to the complete omission or incorrect placement of certain content.",
                "Very engaging and fun class! Students knew each other very well.",
                "Strengths: everyone gets really close in class because it's such a small seminar class\r\nWeaknesses: as a result, we often get distracted with personal details about our lives instead of finishing the curriculum",
                "strengths: organized, fair\r\nweaknesses: so much unexpected work towards the end",
                "Strengths: small group, good atmosphere\r\nWeaknesses: doesn't facilitate enough actual discussion, could be more emphasis/curriculum on chinese traditions/idioms/etc.",
                "Our instructor was excellent, and the course was well structured with clear guidelines on how to do well in the class.",
