                "I thought the course had a very interesting range of texts, and I liked the chronological approach. However, one slightly irritating thing was the large variation in the size of the texts; some would be a few pages, others would be much, much more. As a result, budgeting time was different week by week. \r\nI also greatly appreciated the draft-based approach to the papers, because it gave me a good chance to practice my longer-form German writing and get constructive feedback.",

There was a lot of background knowledge that I didn't necessarily have coming into the class about German\/European history that might have been helpful to know, but overall if you have a general interest in German and literature, it is a good course.",
