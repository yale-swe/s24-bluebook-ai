I have learned when it is best to use quotations in an essay. I have spent a good deal of time reading and writing, and in that discipline have developed a writing process I find works well for me.",
                "I improved my writing and close reading skills. It was also the first seminar style class I took so I learned how to participate in a seminar class.",
                "Coming from a background in English focused on writing factual papers and novel analysis which have set structures of topic sentence, evidence and explanation- writing creatively was something very foreign for me. I have learned how to go through the entire drafting and revising stage of an essay and how to effectively answer a prompt, as well as write from different point of views to deliver a message.",
                "I have never accelerated in my writing as much as I did by taking this course. Taught me to think about message, theme, and the potency of my craft.",
                "This course without a doubt made me a better writer, reader, and overall more confident student in my literary abilities. Because of this course, Im considering changing my major. It was my favorite class I took this semester, and it was my favorite class I have ever taken. Lincoln Caplan is an extraordinary professorI owe him a million thanks.",
                "I gained confidence in my abilities as a writer, and I also developed a greater appreciation for picking up on the stylistic choices of other writers. Additionally, my overall attention to detail in regards to reading improved significantly.",
                "I learned about close reading and writing.  On the writing side, I learned about my own writing process and how I best structure essays, as well as giving a sharper and more coherent purpose to my writing.  I learned about editing my pieces and about eliminating unnecessary fragments in my sentences to make them smoother.  I also gained a greater appreciation for the importance of creativity in word choice, sentence structure, description, and theme.",
                "I learned how to become a more analytical reader and writer. From the class readings and discussions, I know better understand the importance of close reading, identifying an author's tone and voice, and much more. I think Professor Caplan was a wonderful professor and I learned a lot."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course came from Lincoln Caplan's instruction. He created a highly engaging discussion environment for when we were discussing various essays in class. He created a supportive critique environment for when we discussed and analyzed our own writing. I would say the only weakness was that I wish we had an overview of different elements of craft at the beginning of the course.",
                "Strengths: The readings are fun, the size of the class is just right (14ish people in the room), the level of attention each piece of student writing receives is tremendous.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Genuinely, I cannot think of any. I loved this class.",
                "A strength of the course was the readings we did. I felt the readings were very insightful and helpful guides when writing essays. One weakness was that we were never able to do a third revision, and it may have been helpful to have a third revision for at least one essay.",
                "Strengths) The workload across the semester in terms of actual writing was really good. I felt having a week to write a draft and then get feedback before another week to write a final revision was a perfect amount of time and never left me feeling too stressed or too slow. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses) The readings in class were sometimes extremely long and hard to get through, I found it difficult to engage with them.",
                "The seminar style of this course was fantastic. A strength I think was my professors level of engagement.",
                "The structure of this course is certainly its strongest feature. Writing five works of roughly equal length, with a chance to submit a draft and a revision gives students freedom that isn't found in most other English courses at Yale.",
                "Strength: I loved the selection of essays we read.  They showed me the wide range of goals one can achieve when using this form as well as the craft that is common to this type of writing.\r\nStrength: Our class discussions allowed me to share ideas with others to see if they agreed with my thinking or not, and they allowed me to hear the ideas of everyone else.  I frequently reached new understandings with regards to the texts because of points my classmates brought up.\r\nStrength: Workshopping.  It was helpful for me to read my classmates' pieces in part because I enjoyed their writing and in part because they showed me things I could use in my own writing.\r\nWeakness: We often received feedback on our workshopped essays, but did not turn in another revised edition because we had already turned in a revised piece on Wednesday.  I wonder if there could be an option to edit the piece again after the workshop and turn in a third edition on Friday.",
                "I think the class discussion was a strength. I think there could have been more group or peer interaction rather than just large group discussion. I also think there could have been a variety of activities rather than just readings."

                "Absolutely! I was a senior in this class and was a little hesitant to take it because it is primarily a class for underclassmen. After taking it, I would recommend taking this course (at least with Lincoln Caplan) to students of all years and majors. It elevated my writing skills in ways that I could not have anticipated and has even improved my scientific writing. I seriously could not recommend this class more.",
                "A thousand times, yes. Forget the practicality of it (you will no doubt become a stronger reader and writer), it's just a ton of fun. You become very intimate with the other students in your section because you read each other's personal essays all term. Great environment. I always looked forward to English 120.",
                "Yes I would. I feel like nonfiction creative essay writing is a good skill, and I was able to improve a lot throughout the term. It was also interesting and engaging, and I grew close with my class.",
                "Yes especially in freshman year. The baseline skills that you develop and/or improve upon are so helpful for further study across a range of disciplines.",
                "Yes. Like I said, my writing has never improved as much as it did during this course. It's also incredibly refreshing to write non-academic essays that feel meaningful to you because they have something to do with your personal experience.",
                "Absolutely. This was the best class Ive ever taken.",
                "Yes, I have already recommended this course to some of my peers, and they will be taking it next semester!",
                "Yes.  I really enjoyed this course for three reasons.  It gave me the opportunity to read a selection of great essays by modern writers.  This showed me who great modern writers were, what the were writing about, and how they were writing.  Secondly, I got to write a collection of non-fiction personal essays.  These allowed me to reflect on myself as well as develop my writing skill.  Finally, I enjoyed my classmates and Professor Caplan.  He had such an impressive control of language, gave detailed, insightful feedback, and led interesting discussions in class.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. I think Professor Caplan is wonderful and believe I became a much stronger writer in my time with him."
