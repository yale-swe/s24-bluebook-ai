                "Pros: you will learn old English! \r\nCons: it does take a lot of work to do so, but I found the work interesting",
                "Professor Thornbury is incredibly knowledgable and a great instructor. The course felt very satisfying for covering a wide variety of Anglo-Saxon texts, and it was always intellectually fascinating.\r\n\r\nMost of the assignments had us translating into Old English. While this felt novel and interesting for studying a dead language, some of the grading for these assignments felt unnecessarily harsh, especially given the complexity of composing Old English poetry.",
                "Honestly this course is extremely well structured! I have",
                "Strengths: This is an excellent course. The perfect balance of learning Old English and then using it to actually read quite interesting texts and analyze them. The skills and path for learning are concrete - something too many English courses lack - and the structure of small weekly assignments with detailed feedback was wonderful for measuring my understanding. Could not ask for more from Prof. Thornbury and Carson. I wish I had gone to more office hours!",
                "This course is a reminder that there is a pleasure to learning for the sake of learning  maybe one student in that class will become a medievalist, but everyone in the class benefitted from learning a new and interesting idea. There were very few weaknesses to this class; the workload was quite high, and sometimes it was impossible to be fully prepared to translate the passages in class while also staying on top of the other assignments. Perhaps there is a way to slightly lower the overall workload? The long passages at the very end were probably the most unproductive ones, as I could tell the class just could not handle the sheer amount of translation that was technically required of them. This is a small thing, but it would also be nice if the textbook had a more comprehensive table of contents listing which concepts are discussed in which chapters."

                "Yes I would! It was very fun and interesting. Professor Thornbury organized it very well. Our knowledge built upon itself well.",
                "Yes, because opportunities to learn Old English are not common and it's worthwhile if one is interested.",
                "Yes, but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into! I thought (as perhaps you are thinking) that the course would mostly be translating and analyzing Old English literature -- never did I imagine I would be learning to write and speak in Old English myself. The content and pace were both extremely challenging (it is easily the hardest humanities class I've taken at Yale), but I grew to really love the course once I got the hang of it. The instruction is excellent, the classroom environment is very fun, and it is sort of incredible to be able to read texts written hundreds and hundreds of years ago. I get emotional if I think about it too hard!",
                "A fascinating language, with often felt relevant to my understanding of the structure of English today. Interesting material and great way to get the Medieval requirement for the English major.",
                "If you're willing to put a lot of time into learning the grammar of the language/if that's something you enjoy, then yes!",
                "Yes absolutely! \r\n\r\nDon't shy away from this class even if you have no interest in medieval studies / you're only here for a medieval credit - you'll learn a lot about the history of the English language and have a lot of fun. This course is going to be especially interesting if you're interested in the history of English poetry. Because Old English is so similar to modern English (something you won't really feel in the beginning of the course when you're wading through grammar, but will very much feel by the end), you get the payoff / thrill of achieving some degree of mastery over a foreign language very, very quickly. \r\n\r\nThe only thing to be mindful of - this is a very high workload course. You will have to spend some additional time studying, outside of the regular homework / readings for class, and you will fall behind quickly if you don't. It's a very rewarding class but expect 8+ hours of focused work a week including class minimum.",
                "Absolutely. A must-take in the English major, in my opinion. It went from the course I was least inherently interested in to the course in which I learned the most, worked the hardest, and had the most fun. You have to pick up a lot of the language early in the course, but Prof. Thornbury and TF Carson were such helpful and generous teachers that with a little preparation, the course never felt overwhelming for me. I went from zero knowledge (and therefore access) to Old English literature to enough understanding to translate a good chunk of text (which we selected on our own) and write a long research paper about it. I felt genuine growth and improvement in my skills throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nYou only have to write one paper, but you write 10+ shorter compositions and close readings that are more than enough preparation to do it.",
                "Absolutely, but be prepared to work just for the sake of the intellectual challenge. You're not going to walk around speaking old english ever again in your life most likely, and if this is a point of contention for you, the work will probably just frustrate you. If you want a fantastically interesting intellectual challenge, however, I highly recommend."
