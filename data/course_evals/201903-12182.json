    "This class fascinating -- by far one of the best I have taken at Yale. It gives a foundation for the theories surrounding National Security and offers you the viewpoints to understand how the global actors will interact in the future.",
    "Critical thinking, and analytical aptness.",
    "Writing and analytical skills, especially when dissecting the validity, strengths, weaknesses, and further paths of research of very distinguished\/intellectual scholars in international security. I learned so much knowledge, skills, and insights that it would not do the class justice to try and list them all here. This is by far my most favorite class at Yale so far and I will be taking Professor Monteiro's classes in the future. To truly express how great this class was, this is the first course review in which I have written more than just a couple words in this section. This class deserves it.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of the historical and contemporary issues in the study of international security. We learned about how states think about power, different assessments of why peace has persisted since WWII, the rise of China, among many other sub-topics that are relevant to this field of study.",
    "General understanding of international security and several different viewpoints and challenges to the current study of security",
    "I loved this class. This was the first class in the Global major that introduced me to any sort of IR theory, and I thought it was a fantastic introduction. Professor Monteiro does a great job of doing a broad sweep of security theory while encouraging us to dig more deeply into the specific topics we were interested in. Learned how to read IR theory, basics of security theory, why I ought to study more theory.",
    "Basic insights into pretty much every topic that falls under international security - from realism, liberalism, and constructivism to civil war to the World Wars to terrorism to norms in international politics. Very interesting stuff complemented by Professor Monteiro's own research!",
    "I learned a lot about the theoretical basis of international security and how political science scholars understand the world and address some of its most pressing security challenges.",
    "1. Overview of international relations theory, major topics in international relations (e.g. interstate conflict, intrastate conflict, etc.)\r\n2. How to write a literature review--it was super cool to focus on a specific topic that I was actually interested in!\r\n3. Got to read some of the major papers in different topics--or at least recognize some names",
    "I learned more in this class than i did in any other class at yale\r\n\r\nGeneral outline of biggest topics in IR security",
    "Why states go to war, what is victory, why do states seek power, what are the causes of intrastate wars, what is our strategy.",
    "I learned the basics of security, with a specific focus on the US.",
    "This course focuses on answering questions like \"what influences how countries interact on the international stage?\" \"should countries have an obligation to intervene abroad?\" and \"how has nuclear proliferation impacted the distribution of power at the international stage?\"\r\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the course (although I thought there was too much work). I recommend you take it.",
    "A really, really solid understanding of the theories and principles of international security. I went in feeling a little iffy about the course material, since I'm more development-focused and sort of cringe at studying war theory, but this course was taught incredibly well and I had no trouble staying engaged. Even if you're war-averse (as we all should be) it's still important to understand the mechanisms behind international conflict, and I feel more prepared to analyze international politics after having studied them. If you're a GLBL major you have to take this, but don't approach it as a chore -- you'll enjoy the course if you approach it with an open mind.",
    "Learned more about international relations theory and how it relates to the world today.",
    "Good introduction to international security with specific case studies.",
    "Knowledge: of basics of international security, including theory and relevant historical examples (recent history, especially WWII and US-China relations). Basic understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of many common political positions in international relations. \r\nSkills: improved ability to critique, summarize, and synthesize academic literature. \r\nInsights: into international security, human nature.",
    "This course gave me a general understanding of issues pertaining to international security. It provided me greater exposure to academic literature pertaining to security and how to analyze them.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the theory of International Security and the questions it seeks to address.",
    "Theories regarding conflict, war, peace, security, and stability; nuclear revolution and other ideas; peacekeeping operations; US-China relations.",
    "I learned a lot about international security theory, including WWI and WWII, nuclear weapons, insurgencies and terrorism. The readings are extensive every week so this class also helped me improve my skills of understanding and summarising the literature.",
    "I learned about international relations theory and different aspects of scholarship in the international relations field.",
    "An overview of important topics and themes in international security, ranging from the World Wars to contemporary issues.",
    "Mostly learned about terms and topics relevant to security in the international arena. Learned about war strategy.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of the scholarly work and theory that exists on international and domestic security.",
    "I learned how to read social science literature, with an emphasis on doing so efficiently. Theres a unique cause and effect way of thinking that stems from realism and liberalism and I think this class taught that well.",
    "Basics of theory on international security (different ways to view the world, the logic of political violence), applied to the Two World Wars as examples and also to contemporary problems such as nuclear weapons, terrorism, and occupation. How to read political science literature with a healthy amount of skepticism.",
    "I learned the inner workings of international security and was able to consume important  literature on topics regarding various aspects of the field enabling me to have a more informed understanding",
    "The course gives you an introduction to major theories in International Security as well as a familiarity to how these broader theories can be applied to specific events in history. Students learn to take on a comparative approach to analyzing international dynamics or other political events.",
    "Although the Global major no longer has a Development or Security track, I'd always been of the idea that, if these tracks still existed, I would have chosen Development. After taking this course, I'm no longer sure. I leave the semester having a much clearer image of what international security is, the different elements that compose it, and the various scholars that contribute to the field. While our workload could often feel heavy in terms of reading, by the end of the course, I'd become so comfortable reading about international security and the theory that surrounded it, that the readings felt like more of a breeze.",
    "We learned about the philosophy and theory of international theory. Using historical precedent as case studies, we explored classical theories of international security, as well as newer theories that have emerged since the onset of the nuclear age."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength - very interesting material\r\nWeakness  - some repetition between section and lecture",
    "My only criticism of the class is that Professor Monteiro allows to many students to ask hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios that don't allow him to complete his scheduled\/designed lecture.\r\n\r\nA suggested improvement would be to require (or allow incentives for bonus points from) more writing in the form of additional 3-page responses and maybe another literature review in different topics. This was the greatest medium for understanding the course material, especially studies and papers outside of the lectures and required readings. While it is tough to convince kids that lobbying for more work is a good plan (especially in a relatively rigorous class at a rigorous institution such as Yale. I am ROTC and on a D1 varsity sport and would have liked more writing), I and other students (I believe) would have loved to write more if it was incentivized with better grades, etc. While it might be tough to believe, I genuinely loved learning more through writing.",
    "I thought the course was excellently taught, with a very knowledgeable and invested professor who you could tell cared about making the course better for his students. The TA was also excellent, so I really felt that I was learning from experts over the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nI think the workload was perhaps a little too high: I know that in the past the class had the same assignments minus the midterm and final exam. If the professor wants to include these assessments, it might make sense to reduce the workload in other parts of the course (e.g. fewer\/shorter reading responses, no literature review, etc.)",
    "Strengths: Professor, Organization, Lecture content, TF Cole DeVoy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Workload (specifically the amount of readings), syllabus is very white-male heavy and does not contain much diversity",
    "Strengths: lectures were entertaining and engaging, readings were carefully chosen and topically discussed in class, sections facilitated deep understanding of readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 86% of the syllabus was solely authored by men (not including readings co-authored with women). I totally get that early security theory was dominated by men, and I appreciate reading the foundational texts, but felt like a couple more women (or people of color) could have been included for some more perspective.",
    "Strength: Professor Monteiro is fantastic - he is a HUGE strength of this course. He's cracks jokes that honestly only Yale Global Affairs students would laugh at - but we do because they're hilarious and sarcastic and just great. He's very engaged with his students, and cares about helping them out. He's organized the course content great - he's taught this class before and he knows just how to. \r\nWeakness: Professor Monteiro is SO smart - I think he forgets we're not as smart as him. He essentially took his class from previous years, and added two components: a midterm and a final. And for a class as qualitative as this, with THIS much reading (literally 200-300 pages a week), having a midterm AND final is honestly just not feasible. This is in addition to 3 (2-3 page) response papers, a 12 page critical literature review and mandatory section. TOO much was going on in terms of assessments - I felt completely overwhelmed by the readings to the point that I failed to complete them all most weeks, even though they were so interesting.",
    "It is a hard class for sure, there is a lot of reading and the concepts are complex. However, Professor Monteiro is an amazing lecturer who provides a lot of insight and can condense the complex topics discussed in the readings into more digestible information. The professor is a huge strength in this class, Monteiro knows more than anyone on the topic and is able to lecture in a very interesting manner.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1. It does its job really well: you learn about international security\r\n2. The lectures are engaging and interesting, especially when he dives juts deep enough on research that he parses out debates\/summaries\/finding but not so deep that you're filled with jargon that doesn't make sense\r\n3. Throws in a couple jokes\/anecdotes that are fun!",
    "Too many readings... there was so much reading that a lot of the time i just didnt even do any of it because it turned me off...i recommend shorter readings for next semester, because i recognize how important a lot of those readings were but not all of them were super important",
    "Well organized, great, relevant material. Was a pleasure to read a large majority of the readings because of how insightful they were.",
    "I learned a lot in the course, but thought the readings were completely useless. In the beginning I did all the readings, but there was just too much for me personally to do and I felt like I did not gain any new information that couldnt be summed up in one sentence. I wouldve liked if there was more discussion of how the readings were relevant in class and if less reading was assigned in general. Surprisingly, I did like the number of assignments. I know a lot of my classmates complained about having 3 reading responses, a midterm, a final, and a literature review, but I felt like these assignments and the exams particularly really helped me consolidate information that otherwise wouldve been wildly scrambled.",
    "Strength: I genuinely enjoyed attending lecture and found that the material was very interesting. \r\n\r\nCole was a great TA. \r\n\r\nWeakness\/Advice: \r\nThe workload was too high. Between the 150-300 pages of reading, the three short papers, the midterm, the final paper and the final exam, there was too much work. \r\n\r\nI personally found the exams very beneficial to my learning as they forced the to revisit the material and condense my knowledge of the subject matter. Therefore, I suggest that Nuno keep the material. However, I would make the midterm worth AT LEAST 15% and the final 30%. This makes students feel that the hours spent preparing are worth it. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Nuno should shorten the reading responses or make them more casual (submissions via canvas). The point of the reading responses is to understand an author and to critique their argument, this can easily be done through the discussion section on canvas. Decreasing the emphasis on the reading responses then makes the entire semester easier to manage. \r\n\r\nI also recommend re-introducing two options for the final paper. I found the process of writing a critical literature review exceptionally dry. I also don't think that I became incredibly familiar with the debate surrounding a specific topic (which as I understand it, was the point). As such, re-introducing two options would help students like me.",
    "The strengths of this course are in its instructors. Prof. Monteiro is a concise, humorous, and engaged lecturer, and it's tough to get bored listening to him talk. Cole is also the most dedicated TF I've had at Yale, so section was always very productive for understanding the material (can't speak for Mike). The reading load can be heavy some weeks, but know going in that you really do not have to read every piece in detail to do well in the course -- Prof. Monteiro endorses this. Spend only the time that is necessary to pull out the central argument for the pieces on the syllabus, and you won't struggle to get through everything. Feedback on response papers is detailed for a course this big, which I was also impressed by.",
    "Strengths: TA was amazing, professor is a good lecturer that presents in an interesting and informative matter, topics are interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor is cognizant that he assigns too much work\/readings and yet is not willing to adjust that, there is an unreasonable amount of work (weekly readings in the hundreds of pages + three response papers + one 12 page final paper + midterm + final), the grading on the midterm seemed very random and arbitrary, information about what to expect on midterm and final was kept intentionally vague despite us being the first year that had to take the midterm and final.",
    "The course is incredibly dense and overwhelming - between the reading, the work load and sections. I recommend finding a balance between having enough assignments that students have to continue to stay engaged in the course, but not so many that it seems overwhelming and so you dont bother to even start the reading etc because it seems insurmountable",
    "Organized lectures and readings \r\nA lot of reading and writing on top of a midterm, literature review, and a final exam.",
    "too high workload and too many assignments",
    "Strengths: excellent professor, interesting\/relevant\/well-organized material, strong TFs, clear and actionable feedback. Nuno is truly a leader in the field, and a very strong instructor. I was grateful to have learned from him. \r\nWeaknesses: class often takes a cavalier tone toward serious historical events. Peers are often the type of people who do not seem to consider the suffering that these policies and phenomena have inflicted on real people. This class embodies a specific way of viewing  the world that some people, including myself, find somewhat reductionist, Eurocentric, and overly callous toward human suffering.",
    "Overall, the course was helpful insofar as it provided a substantive survey of matters pertaining to international security. The syllabus was aptly divided between topics and allocated the requisite amount of attention needed for each.  \r\n\r\nWhile I learned a lot in this course, I believe the amount of assignments given to students was excessive. In addition to a midterm and a final exam, students were asked to write three response papers and a 12 page final paper.",
    "The clases biggest strength is by far the lectures professor Monteiro gives.  The sections sometimes felt like a simply a matter of checking if we had done the reading. However, the in-section debate was very fun.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and I feel like I learned a lot. Lecture was always very interesting and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed the reading selection (I know some students thought there was too much reading, but I was fine with it). However, the workload for the course needs adjusting. The reading responses should not be structured as critical essays; it's too difficult and not entirely helpful for students in what's essentially an introductory course to try to tear apart (with evidence) a leading theorist's argument within a week in addition to the reading assignments. The essays should instead be reading responses published on Canvas that discuss, ask questions about, and critique the work in order to have stronger discussion in section, but not to stand alone as its own critique. Second, a twelve-page literature review in addition to a full, written final is too much. The way the course was laid out, once you met with the professor to make a game plan for your paper, you had two weeks before it was due. Because one of those weeks was Thanksgiving break, a time of rest and recovery, students essentially had one of the busiest weeks of the year to write a twelve page paper. It needs to be one or the other, paper or test.",
    "Strengths - The readings can be interesting and discussing them in lecture and discussion section can be fun.\r\nWeaknesses - It takes an imperialist approach and it seems more like a course on US foreign policy rather than a course on international security. It would have been much more interesting to learn more about international security in Latin America, Africa and Asia (outside of China and Japan) as this would probably have changed the narrative that most students are used to listening to. There could have been a greater focus on comprehensive, human, environmental or food security issues as these can be argued to be equally or more important than nuclear weapons or other security issues we talked about in this class. There aren't any classes in human security offered this year and I think it would have been very beneficial to the students in Global Affairs to learn more about these concepts.",
    "Great engaging lectures. only negative is that it is a ton of reading.",
    "Strengths: topics are interesting and Professor Monteiro makes lecture engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: so much reading and often times, the majority of the readings aren't necessary for assignments and aren't mentioned in lecture (for example...30 pages out of a 40 page reading aren't very important - could just read the intro and conclusion)",
    "Professor Monteiro is extremely knowledgeable and gave us insight into many important issues. His lectures were always informative and interesting. Section was also helpful as we discussed readings and went over concepts from lecture. I, however, felt that the workload for the course was too large and often made interesting work a burden. If the exams are going to remain a part of the course, some of the essays need to be cut out.",
    "I felt as though the content was great to learn. The Professor really is the best, but the assigned readings took away from most of what we learned in the course. After doing the readings I felt as though I had spent hours consuming information that wasnt necessary.",
    "Learned a lot, but sometimes lectures were too crammed.",
    "The course was really interesting and I think it touched on a broad range of topics. However, there was a large amount of reading and a lot of the course evaluations required that you memorized readings.",
    "The strengths of this class are the sections on the two world wars, and the one on implications of nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nThe class could have the reading load reduced by 30% or so and I would have felt like I would not have missed much. There were multiple instances in which authors wrote on the same subject, without disagreeing points of view but just different interpretations, and I felt like we should have just read one or the other. Nuno could have taken the opportunity in lecture then to briefly mentioned the reading now left out.",
    "Too much work",
    "Extremely well structured but the new workload this year was quite intense, could work on maybe finding a happy medium between the old courseload and the new one",
    "Monteiro is a great lecturer, and very engaging. The course is an overview course, so you'll get a lot on different topics but necessarily as much as you want on a given topic. There is also a lot of reading.",
    "strengths were the lectures and the selection of readings; weakness was the load of readings per week",
    "A definite strength of this course was the excellent breadth and depth with which the different sub-topics were addressed. I felt I learned a great deal even in topics I felt confident about going into the class, and was introduced to new topics I had not been as aware of beforehand. Another strength was the focus on the craft of research and experiments in international relations which I found a valuable discussion to have in such a class and one that took the course beyond simply introducing theories. All in all I really enjoyed this class, which makes it all the more upsetting for me to have to go into what I saw as fairly significant weaknesses. The biggest weakness in my opinion was the restructured workload of the course this semester. While I grant that the introduction of a midterm and a final was used to ensure active student participation and engagement, the way in which they were implemented seemed to me to have been done without appropriate consideration or consultation. Before proceeding further, I want to note what I believe the purpose of academic assessments such as exams and papers are, which is to assess progress in learning the course materials. With three papers, a final paper, a midterm, and a final examination, I believe we reached a point of diminishing returns with respect to this goal and evaluations ceased to be milestones to make sure students were grasping key themes, and were simply additional work piled on top of students. In perfect honestly, my own impression of the course was that these assessments felt almost vindictive at times, punishment for lower student engagement in previous years. I say this especially with respect to the examinations, which, although described as simply checks on reading completion and lecture attendance, in practice seemed to go decently beyond this. In theory, if a student was engaged in the class, did the readings, and attended every lecture, they should feel set up for success on such assessments. However, the language used concerning these evaluations did not take this tone, and I, as someone who greatly enjoyed the class, still did not feel prepared to succeed on these tests. I want to stress here that the consequences of this were not simply matters of attitude, at least for me. The additional workload and expectations created by these evaluations negatively impacted my ability to study and succeed in my other classes, a sentiment shared by others who I talked to in this class as well. Nevertheless, these, in my opinion legitimate, student grievances tended to be brushed off by instructors and teaching fellows as \"whiny\" which, though I do see the rationale behind it, I would contend that it is particularly harmful for a student who feels the increased workload of a class is taking a toll on their mental\/physical health and wellbeing to hear their complaints brushed off so easily. Compounding this was the fact that no really strong reason was given for this significant hike in workload, leaving me personally to feel a little blindsided by the class. In sum, what I would say is the greatest weakness of this class would be the fact that the structure of assessments seemed adversarial, designed to make you fail, rather than cooperative, designed to give students the tools to do well.",
    "The strengths of the course were the breadth and interesting lectures. The course covers a variety of contemporary topics that are relevant to today and there are a lot of assignments and avenues of engagement in place to make sure that you're understanding the material.  That being said, the course could do more to really carve out the contours of the major schools of debate.",
    "Nuno! Professor Monteiro has such a great sense of humor that, combined with the fascinating nature of the material, going to lecture felt like a treat. In fact, at the end of the 50-minute period, I often felt myself wanting more. Lectures are extremely well-organized, content is interesting, professor is superb, and TA's are readily available. What more could you want?",
    "This course was excellently taught -- Nuno is awesome. However, the reading load for the class was overwhelming. I don't think I know a single student in the class who completed all the readings, simply because they ran out of time. A smaller amount of reading would have helped students actually dive into the course material and get a firmer grip on the concepts, rather than just having us drown in a sea of paperwork. Other than that, the workload was mostly fair, lectures were a joy, and section, while difficult, got more enjoyable as the semester went on.",
    "Strengths: good overview of broad strokes of IR theory, covering a lot of ground. (Somewhat) detailed feedback provided for all the response papers, essays, and even some of the exams, which is impressive given the class size of 60. Lectures are perhaps some of the best I've had at Yale: engaging, interesting, organized, clear, accompanied by good slides, and even humorous.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n1) As it was taught this semester, FAR too much work. Grades were based on three response papers, a 12-15 page literature review, midterm, final, and participation. The stated intention (by Professor Monteiro) of adding the midterm and final was to ensure students were doing the readings, but I can guarantee the course staff that there was still absolutely NOBODY doing the readings.\r\n\r\n2) Exams don't fit the philosophy of the class, because studying for the exam just led to memorizing all the terms and little details that were mentioned in class, and given the breadth of the class, there was A LOT to memorize. Because IR is so broad and students have interests in different areas, it would be far more effective for students' pedagogy to replace the examinations with (slightly less) writing and allow them to explore specific interests, building on the theoretical frameworks introduced in class.\r\n\r\n3) A reviewer of a previous iteration of the course said that Professor Monteiro has been living in a nuclear bunker, and that couldn't be more true. If the course is intended to introduce present \"approaches\" to international security, I don't see why 6 lectures were spent on the military tactics of World War I and World War II, and then another three lectures on nuclear proliferation, considering military tactics have changed substantially since the early 20th century and nuclear proliferation is (arguably) NOT the primary focus of foreign policy development today. Reduce the time spent on war tactics of WWI\/WWII and make the discussion of nuclear weapons more targeted towards how they apply to Iran and North Korea, and spend more time on present issues in international security and the theoretical frameworks that underpin how countries are dealing with them. I can name a bunch: cybersecurity (Professor Monteiro mentioned cybersecurity at most twice in the entire course, which is SHOCKING given how prevalent and relevant an issue it is); US-China relations (there was one lecture devoted to this, but it was a highly theoretical discussion); and more time spent on asymmetric conflict and violent extremism. Reflecting on the course, I just don't find that spending so much time on WWI\/WWII helps me understand much of present day IR, particularly for someone who's long-term interests aren't squarely in IS and therefore won't be taking many more IS courses at Yale. Nuno acknowledges the limitation of his viewpoints, but I don't see much effort to actually adapt those viewpoints."

I had to take the course as a Global major, but honestly came away feeling like I had learned much more than I had anticipated. I would even recommend it to someone who isnt a Global major.",
    "Yes. 1 - it is required for the global major. 2 - I genuinely found class very interesting and you will too if you care about how countries pursue power on the international arena. \r\n\r\nChances are you have to take this class, so here's my advice: \r\n- Do one of the readings each week well. You can speak to this in section and rely on lean on these in the exam. Otherwise, just learn about the other readings in class and in section. \r\n- Ask Nuno questions, he likes when students are curious about the material and show that they have been thinking about it. \r\n- Take Cole's section (he's a TA). He's awesome. \r\n- Do the reading responses early in the semester. \r\n- Attend every lecture and take notes, especially on the key terms and the main points. This will make studying for the exams A LOT easier.",
    "If you're in GLBL you have to take it, but it now has a PLSC course number as well -- if your Poli Sci focus is international relations, you should absolutely take this course. It provides a foundational understanding of security concerns that govern much of international politics, and it is taught so so well. If you have the chance to study with Prof. Monteiro while at Yale, I wouldn't pass it up.",
    "No, unless you enjoy an insane amount of work.\r\nBut global majors have to take it...",
    "Yes, it is a Global Affairs requirement. Nuno is very nice and helpful and so is the TF.",
    "Yes, would provide a good baseline for someone interested in security.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because the amount of learning is not commensurate to the workload associated with it. There are other means of acquiring a rudimentary understanding of international security at Yale which do not require taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class as essential to any student interested in understanding international relations.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are interested in looking at international relations from a security perspective or are interested in nuclear theory. It is a very US focused course though.",
    "If you need to take it as a Global Affairs major, sure. It can be an interesting course and you learn a great deal between the readings and the lecture content. However, the imperialist approach and the extensive focus on the US can get a little tiring.",
    "you have to take it for global and its a solid class.",
    "I am not a global major and took this for fun..which I dont recommend. The content was amazing, but the sections were horrible and the tests were extremely hard.",
    "Global requirement. I didnt love it but it wasnt bad.",
    "Yes. The workload is heavy but you learn a lot.",
    "Yes! It's a requirement if you're a global affairs major, so you would have to take it anyway, but it was really interesting.",
    "Yes! I originally thought it was just a class that I had to take for the major but I ended up really loving it! Professor Monteiro and the TF, Cole, who is hands down the best TF Ive ever had, made the class incredible.",
    "This is a required course of the global major, and otherwise I dont know who would be interested. I would say that for students like me who werent the most enthusiastic to learn about violence and war, have an open mind and focus on the skills of reading literature that the course is teaching rather than letting the depressing subject matter get you down.",
    "You probably have to take it for Global, but if not, I found it to be a worthwhile course in and of itself if you are interested in security. Just keep in mind that it is a lot of reading, writing, and work in general (midterm, final, three response papers, and a final literature review.)",
    "Yes, if interested in international politics",
    "As an introduction to international security studies, and more broadly international relations, this is an excellent course. The workload is decently higher than other equivalent courses, but Nuno is a great lecturer and makes himself very accessible to students. Overall, highly recommend if you know what you are getting yourself into.",
    "Given that this is a required course for Global Affairs major, I would simply say that this is a major enjoyable required class for the major as compared to other classes. However, if this course is not required, I would only take this course if the student is still highly interested in the material. The workload is high and the amount of material that one needs to get to is notable.",
    "Yes!!! Not sure if it is restricted to Global majors but, if not, then definitely take it. You will come out with such a strong and rich knowledge of international security that can be applied to the news we see today.",
    "I would! Nuno is awesome and lectures were always very engaging and funny, while also teaching you a lot. I feel incredibly equipped to study pressing contemporary issues of international import. It's also worth noting that you DO NOT NEED EXPERIENCE in International Relations or history to take this class -- it is much more theoretical and strategic, using history really only for its instrumental value toward assessing various theories. Nuno does a great job providing students with new literature and controversies in the field of international security and helping you decide for yourself which theories you buy. Even if you're not a global major, I recommend taking this class. Beware the reading load, but if you take it Cr\/D you'll be absolutely fine.",
    "No, but unfortunately, this course is required for Global majors, so most people taking this course are there because it's mandatory. However, supposing there were a choice, there are two main weaknesses with the course: course structure and Professor Monteiro's worldview. As it stands, there is far too much work, and the exams should be removed. But that can be easily fixed. Structurally, however, Professor Monteiro's view of international politics doesn't seem to sufficiently accommodate for evolutions in both theory and practice of international security. For a course intended to teach all approaches to international security, not just Professor Monteiro's realist view, there is not sufficient time placed on topics like cybersecurity, human security, and the intersection between security and issues like climate change, migration, and economic insecurity (particularly in Africa and the Middle East). One subpoint of Professor Monteiro's antiquated view of world politics is his strangely dismissive attitude towards any form of quantitative research. While he does take sufficient time to present this research, many of them are clouded in criticism that seems to dismiss the very nature of quantitative research and almost feel fueled by an ideological resistance towards the introduction of these new methods, rather than taking the attitude of addressing shortcomings to create better research in the future, especially given that natural\/quasi-random experiments in security studies are still a relatively new practice and will take time to mature. To be clear, I appreciate skepticism, I very much prefer that Professor Monteiro remain skeptical about the application of quantitative social sciences towards international security rather than blindly embracing it, and I firmly believe that the discussions he has led about the flaws he has pointed out in several of the studies and readings has made me more effective at evaluating research  so I hope Professor Monteiro should continue doing what he's doing. But I do hope Professor Monteiro can move from ideological opposition to more of a cautious embrace."
