                "So much! Frameworks and toolkits for abolitionist thought, mutual aid, restorative and transformative justice, and more. I walk away from this class more confident in a great amount of knowledge, and curious about the areas where my knowledge is less developed.",
                "loved this class!! I learned so much about abolition and transformative justice.",
                "I learned so much in this course. I looked forward to this class so much, and as a senior it is by far the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "This course was everything I was hoping for! I came into this class considering myself to be a leftist, believing in ACAB and all that jazz but not really understanding abolition as a whole, and I have learned SO much since September. Dissecting the poisons of white supremacy culture and learning how to prefigure (and even learning what prefiguration was and then realizing I've been doing it all along) will stay with me forever. I was exposed to theories and ways of thinking in this course that I would never be able to access anywhere else in academia, and I am very thankful for that opportunity and experience.  This class also taught me how to write a 15-page final paper and how to manage a big reading load, which is going to be so useful!",
                "This course does a great job of 1) teaching about current conditions that necessitate the discussion of abolition, 2) what abolition is and how we can practice it, and 3) modeling prefiguration in the classroom. Sarah and Kailyn do a great job of the first point, but that's perhaps the easiest knowledge to get when you're interested in abolition. The other two, however, are special and specific to this class. We spent so much time discussing how to prefigure abolition in our lives and communities, explaining transformative justice and mutual aid, and brainstorming ways to imagine futures beyond our current predicament. That doesn't mean we came away with all of the answers. But, as a class, we learn key ideas and ways of thinking that expanded our horizons of knowledge, practice, and imagination. Pretty powerful.",
                "This course definitely changed the way I view a lot of the world. I really appreciated the time we spent reading different texts with differing perspectives and learning how to engage with them critically, instead of taking every opinion we were assigned to read at face value.",
                "I learned the ideologies and practices of abolition at both the interpersonal and community level.",
                "I learned SO much about abolition, from so many different angles and perspectives. The syllabus covered a wide variety of books, articles, videos, and podcasts, but more than that, the class itself was structured in a way to cultivate creative and progressive new ideas. I learned a ton from the instructors as well as my classmates as we tackled hard, complicated topics together.",
                "- Good grasp of prison industrial complex, defining abolition, mutual aid and transformative vs restorative justice \r\n- Somatic abolition became a key aspect of my learning - learning that knowledge is more than just mental intelligence but also physical and emotional intelligence. This allowed me to be more in tune with the embodied learning of the class, especially when topics were emotionally difficult.\r\n- I have learned a new way of understanding classroom dynamics between students and facilitators - asking for permission to go through the assigned syllabus for the day, reaching out before and after classes for extra support in learning and clarifying"

                "This was one of the most (if not the most) well-taught classes I've had at Yale. Both instructors were well-informed and acted as guides through the materials, but still explored the materials with us in a collaborative and vulnerable manner. The reading selections were great, the class discussions were insightful, and the assignments were a lot of fun and actually promoted learning and exploration.",
                "This course was amazing. Kailyn and Sarah were phenomenal instructors and made sure that students had an active say in topics we discussed and the course structure.",
                "I loved the style of teaching which was really inclusive.",
                "Strengths: I loved the consent-based structure of class, from individual seminars' schedules to the syllabus itself. I have never felt more respected or in control of my learning in a Yale classroom than in Sarah and Kailyn's. It was also evident that everything we were reading and discussing was selected very intentionally, which helped me read more intentionally. I felt like I was there every week to learn in community and have fun, not just painstakingly show up to class to say one thing about the readings and then go home. This class was a joy, and I'm glad I was able to participate! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: Sarah and Kailyn are incredible. They are great teachers, bring working experience to the table about abolition. And the facilitate a class unlike any others I've had a Yaleeach component of the class is considered with the greatest care. The class also brings awesome people togetherso many different and powerful voices! And the content is also huge for learning about how we got to the present, what's wrong with it, and how we can go about imagining better futures and practicing them in the present. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For any class as ambitious as this one, sometimes it can feel like you don't have clarity or enough information about something (how do you prefigure abolition in a way that feels meaningful? what exactly does transformative justice look like?)however, Sarah and Kailyn do a great job of getting you as close as you can to understanding.",
                "I think a strength is how inclusive, safe, and comfortable the environment in the class felt. We discussed a lot of really important and difficult topics but everyone came from a place of respect that made it a great, if challenging, experience. I think the only weakness I would say is there could have been a little more guidance or structure in writing the midterm and final papers, but I also just have a lot less experience with that so it could be a personal preference.",
                "strengths: everything!! from the people (both peers and instructors) to the materials, the course has everything you could hope for to foster a positive learning environment on the topic of abolition.",
                "Strengths - the instructors were incredible, the readings were always eye-opening and genuinely captivating, class discussions were respectful and enlightening\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - we honestly just too much good stuff every class, and I feel like the syllabus could be pared down a bit to give the important parts more room to breath (rather than always needing to jump to the next thing)",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Good balance of academic readings, videos, poems, real world examples \r\n- A lot of opportunities to apply learnings to our own contexts, communities and personal learning \r\n- A lot of opportunities to share knowledge between classmates\r\n- Clear communication of what was permissible and what was not tolerated in the class \r\n- Sincere engagement with texts by classmates, opportunities to include texts that we have learned from in other classes or workshops \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Unable to deep dive into some topics of interest in the class because there was a lot of ground to cover"

                "absolutely!! I would highly recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in abolition.",
                "Absolutely! I loved this class and told all the people I know to take it the next time it is offered.",
                "I'm sure it won't be taught again, but if it was I would recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in abolition. The reading and writing load may seem daunting, but I promise it's worth it, and Sarah and Kailyn were both very helpful along the way. This class changed the way I view the world and myself perhaps more than any other Yale course has, and I see myself as a better person for it. Taking a class on abolition at Yale is a formative experience that you should absolutely not miss if you get the chance!",
                "Absolutely! There are certainly other classes where you might learn about abolition, but this is a class that truly gets into and practices it. It's special. Great instruction, challenging material, great discussions, and projects where you actually practice abolitionism.",
                "Yes! Such a lovely class with great instructors, and an essential but radical change to my worldview!",
                "Yes! Especially those interested in learning more about how they can bring abolition into their everyday lives",
                "Yes! For anyone interested in imaginative, progressive approaches to criminal justice and\/or politics, this class is eye-opening and intellectually satisfying. I could imagine someone less politically compatible might find the course frustrating, however.",
                "Definitely, I would recommend this students who want to sincerely consider what abolitionist futures could look like both practically and imaginatively. This is an incredible class for students who are engaged in any way with activism, social justice, abolition or anything in that general sphere to have a safe space to thoroughly consider their own personal motivations and objectives for what they do but also clarifying larger term goals for their own work and aligning themselves with the values and principles of abolitionist movements."
