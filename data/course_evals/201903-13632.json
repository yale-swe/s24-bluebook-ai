   "comments": [
    "I gained a fundamental understanding of the problems with media coverage of various issues around the world. As someone who did not read the news frequently, it was interesting and important for me to learn how to dissect the information presented and learn what one should and shouldn't believe about coverage. By focusing on one beat, I not only gained a comprehensive understanding of one particular issue\/phenomenon\/region, but I also learned how to apply these skills to all articles.",
    "I feel like I am a more knowledgable and skeptic consumer of news, a new skill I really value.",
    "During this course, I learned a lot about different writing styles that journalists use. Comparing articles (especially when they're written about similar topics) between different writers over the course of a few months really helped me understand how to become a better writer myself, but also the different biases in writing. This course has helped me understand why journalists write- is it because they have an agenda? Because they really want to solve systematic problems with the beats they write about? Because they're bad writers and think they're really good? The class completely flips the lens through which you see reality in the news, which is important. There are so many underlying problems you learn about in writing itself, but the actual issues that are being written about. I've become better at analyzing writing, understanding the context of them, and thinking about how I would write meaningfully as well.",
    "Media criticism abilities",
    "I got to do a deep dive on a topic I was truly interested in which made doing work and research at home really fun. Looking at media coverage on a specific issue at home and discussing media bias in class allowed me to view coverage issues in the micro and macro scale. I also feel as though I'm more aware of how I consume news and the sources from which I choose to read.",
    "I began paying better attention to bias within news and noting where my own prejudices where coming in.",
    "I learned how to analyze the media, what constitutes good journalism, and to critically think about the portrayal of certain topics the media focuses on",
    "I now have a much better understanding of journalism and media bias.",
    "I was able to delve deeply into an issue I cared about and really gain insight into the coverage of the issue and that problems associated with that as opposed to the problems with the issue itself.\r\nI found the content of this course to be fascinating.",
    "More insights into the current news climate",
    "Media criticism skills, such as how to identify bias and flaws in media coverage of a specific topic. Also a look into how a newsroom may operate.",
    "I learned about the types of biases that pervade media and evaluate news using these established categories and my own critical thinking. Moreover, I was able to learn about a facet of news that is not typically covered and proposed solutions to the its media issues.",
    "This was probably the most valuable course Ive taken in education. We were given knowledge and context for news reporting on important topics in the real world such as global warming. That didnt just mean examples of how flawed media coverage could present itself or occur but analysis and information about where it actually did in the real world. I didnt agree with everything, however, I still value what I learnt.\r\nThe main purpose of the course was to develop a system for engaging with media coverage that we could apply to our following of the news throughout the rest of our lives. I believe that I have that with the beat notes. We were given a template to use to follow media coverage (overcoming the flaws in it) and an awareness of the potential traps and obstacles we could come into contact with.\r\nEach individual was made to focus on a specific topic of media coverage e.g. global warming or the US judicial system throughout the semester in assignments and readings. The result was that I learnt a lot about a difficult issue that interested me and can finally have some confidence in my understanding of it and, more importantly, the opinions on both sides of it. It can be difficult to achieve depth when studying certain things at a liberal arts university or high school. I think this course gave me more depth on such matters than most would have.\r\nIt can be very easy for certain opinions at an educational establishment like Yale never to be challenged. That wasnt the case for me in this class. I had my opinions challenged and changed. Moreover, I now can substantiate my opinion to someone who thinks otherwise, explain it to them in a way that is compelling and reasonable to them and understand their opinion. That is extremely important if you seek to make a difference at Yale and beyond.\r\nUniversities often fall into the whole of teaching you content or skills that dont really apply well to the real world. This class was a brilliant example of teaching that wasnt aimed at doing that. I think thats one of its greatest strengths."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was taught well; the professor's style of teaching was both engaging and interesting. I think everyone in the class learned a significant amount but could have benefited from more concrete guidelines for homework assignments. Journalistic writing is quite different from analytical writing and it took some time to grasp these differences. I think that clear instruction at the start of the course would have made the transition easier. However, this was not a major issue at all, rather something that would improve the class and further improve class discussion if implemented. I think the class was structured in a way that allowed everyone to contribute to the discussion, as well as learn a lot about many different topics. Each person became a 'master' of their own journalistic beat, and it was great learning from everyone in this setting.",
    "Strengths - the course is very unique, and does not compare to other courses I took. It allowed me to choose an issue that I am very passionate about, and independently research about it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the professor often is not very organized and feedback is limited.",
    "This course was weak in that it wasn't really structured towards the beginning. Only near the middle and end of the semester did it feel like our work was amalgamating towards something meaningful. Granted, this was the first time it was being taught and so I assume that it will be structured much better next semester. There wasn't much feedback that we received towards the beginning of the course, and undefined standards\/rubrics that we knew about meeting for assignments. What was good about this, however, was that it allowed us to think much deeper about how we can make our own work meaningful. Furthermore, for those who didn't keep up with the news a whole ton, or even read the news way more than necessary, this class was a great balance!",
    "This class was made up of very fun and collaborative students. However, the course itself was pretty disorganized, and I feel like we got along well because we were all very confused about the purpose of this class",
    "Maybe the lectures could be a bit more structured. Often we would have a set of articles to read and then didn't get to discuss them all in a class period. However, I think the alternating Page One meetings and Lecture classes kept the seminar interesting and kept me engaged. The main area of improvement would be to have a rubric for the project because at some points I felt as though I was flying blind.",
    "First of all, the course in itself was poorly organized. The apparent lack of structure had the entire class running around like headless chickens, struggling to complete both the midterm and final assignment; seeing as we did not particularly know what was expected of us. The constant bombardment of e-mails and suggested readings was more confusing than helpful, and just led to the actually important memos being lost among so many e-mails. However, the bond between classmates saved the course. When the discussions were student run, no one was afraid to either jump in or shut up and learn.",
    "Professor Butters was very passionate about what he was teaching and shared with us his journalistic experience that made the class feel engaging and interactive, every week there were class days where we held \"page one meetings\" where we would share what we learned about our beats (specific topics in the news) and got to learn from each other, the professor was receptive and would adjust the class schedule\/assignments to reflect our pace and help us learn efficiently, this class was new and it was the professors first class so overall it was a learning experience for all of us, he held meetings\/office hours often to work with us individually\r\n\r\nsome of the assignments were vague which led to confusion, feedback\/grades were sometimes delayed, lack of clear organization",
    "Strengths - each student chooses their own area of focus which allows them to learn more on their specific beat than they would be able to generally\r\nWeaknesses - the course often lacks organization, which could be due to the fact that this was the first time it was offered",
    "Strengths: the content, the amount of personalization and individual support provided to each student, engaging readings and discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the level of personalization can lead to other students losing valuable time for discussion. Overall, however, I enjoyed the way this course was taught.",
    "the course itself was really interesting and covered important ideas\/topics. It couldve used some more structure, but it was nice that the course was flexible and adaptable",
    "professor can improve by having a more developed and organized course structure",
    "It was able to offer a lot of real-world application to the content that we were learning relating to journalism. It could be improved by being more organized.",
    "At times, the course felt jumbled and disorganized. Since this is a new course, I understand why the course felt a bit unstructured at first. Next year, there should be clearer explanations of pitches, page one meetings, and beat notes from the onset. However, once the class found a working routine, we were able to have productive discussions. I appreciated the autonomy students had to direct our own conversations about media.",
    "I think there were two big strengths of the course. One was the selection of readings was extremely comprehensive and beneficial. I learned so much from the variety of journalists we were able to analyze and contextualize, and the amount of readings we had to explore was very refreshing. I also got a lot of good guidance on authors to explore outside of class. The other strength was the ability to select a specific topic to stick with all semester and the regular practice of hands-on media criticism throughout the semester. I'm a very learn by doing sort of person and this was helpful to me to build the skills the course demanded. It was set up fairly well. The weakness of the course were slightly more numerous. One was that the sense of structure was essentially non-existent. The syllabus was not a good reference point for most of the semester, and the platform for turning in assignments was always in flux. I was never really sure if I was doing well in the course, which was pretty stress-inducing. Also, there were many times in class when I was unsure what was happening, and it was hard to get the point of some lectures. Overall, I think the weaknesses outweighed the strengths, unfortunately.",
    "The strengths of this course were that I gained real, practical skills, mechanisms and knowledge that can translate into my real life. The content of the course wasnt too difficult. It was clearly intended to teach us valuable skills first and foremost instead of challenging us or informing us for their own sakes. He gave us templates (like the beat notes) for applying to following the news in the real world that I will certainly use and have taught me a great amount about really complex issues. Even with a decent awareness of the degree to which we are actions and views of the world are subject to the whim of the media, this class showed me that it was tenfold.\r\nThe class really shone in the readings, content and assignments: interesting, valuable but not too challenging. The readings were fascinating, well put together and not too intensive. Youll want to do them most of the time. There was never a time where I was worried or very stressed by those readings. If you cant do all of the reading properly sometimes, it isnt the end of the world. That was a life-saver. Assignments also werent very intensive and could be flexible. The issue was that he struggled to make what he wanted from us clear and didnt always have the examples or words to do it. That caused a lot of issues. I think that that will have becomes far less of an issues as he now has a number of examples so I think that will be far better next semester.\r\nThe weaknesses of the course regarded the approach the professor took to it, rather than being intrinsic to the course. It was disorganised (the syllabus was unreliably and constantly changing from the start), assignments and content were presented far less clearly than they could have been and there was a lack of academic bias and neutrality to the professors approach. The class participation in seminars was done poorly and limited and the seminars could often be dull and unclear.\r\nThe writing style and assignments for this class will be different from what youre used to but it shouldnt be too much of a problem. A lot of the challenge there was simply getting past the sometimes ineffective aspects of academic writing that weve been trained to use.\r\nIt ought to be mentioned, however, that these weaknesses all abated throughout the semester. Professor Butters learnt from many of his mistakes and improved as he went on. The course will be far better if it is taught again and I know that none of my classes will refute that. I would also suggest not making it a first-year seminar in the first semester next time. Its very different to what a first year will be used to."

    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. Regardless of whether or not someone is interested in politics, this course provides students with fundamental critical reading skills, as well as teaches students a unique style of writing that can be applied to all aspects of academic writing. Throughout the semester, we refined our reading and writing skills, and it was great to see our progress in front of us. In addition, the workload was very fair, and coupled with the class discussions, was the perfect balance between in class and out of class learning. It sparked my interest in many topics and provided me with a new perspective that will benefit me for years to come.",
    "I am conflicted on this. The course did improve my understanding of the way the media operates institutionally, and I understand many of the issues it faces today in a better way. I just think that the course was very disorganized and could have been taught better.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that I acquired skills in analyzing the media that no other class would have given me and this class gave me enough independence to explore topics that I would find interesting.",
    "If you choose to take this class, make sure you understand the purpose of it and what you hope to take out. If you seem confused by the premise, dont take it.",
    "Yes, because I think the material is EXTREMELY topical to today's consumption of news and specifically the coverage of Trump and American politics.",
    "i would recommend this course to any avid news consumer.\r\n\r\nin \"how to read the news,\" we explored how media impacts and is impacted by pertinent current events (e.g., fake news, global warming, the Trump administration, the #MeToo movement), also investigating how and to what degree our perceptions are  or aren't  influenced by the writings of others, and why. in trying our hand at media criticism, we learned to detect these influences and also learned how to be an active news consumer in our age of information overflow.",
    "yes if you are interested in the media\/journalism",
    "I would recommend this course only to someone whos interested in journalism or preparing for a potential career in journalism or the media, so long as this person doesnt mind that the course isnt particularly organized.",
    "Yes, it is very beneficial if the student wish to pursue a career in journalism",
    "Yes, if you are interested in journalism and have a specific topic in media that interests you. However, you have to be okay with being flexible and understanding that there isn't always an exact rubric to follow.",
    "I recommend this course to students who want to explore news from nuances angles and are willing to engage in conversations about mainstream media that challenges how you interact with the news.",
    "It's hard for me, because I think the content of this class is so, so important. There was so much value in the readings and the exercises. There really was. It's content I think everyone should be familiar with, and a Yale class is great way to do that. That being said, I don't know if I can recommend this course. With it being a new class, it's hard to judge whether the issues ar inherent or just because it's new. But the issues were not small. There were a lot of moments when I thought my time in the class was being wasted, and the lack of structure and concrete feedback was very hard to handle at times. I just feel like the course never really found it's footing or lived up to its potential. Which sucks to say, but it would be wrong of me to sugar-coat, no matter how important I think the content was.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course was great and valuable even though some things went wrong.\r\nThe fact is that in education, we learn a lot of lessons that have little real-world value. This course teaches the real-world skills and knowledge that help one understand the nature of media coverage and important issues in the media that will apply to my life at and after Yale. The content was really interesting and engaging and the assignments neednt have been too much of a burden.\r\nThere were significant issues. The course was often disorganised, the classes were often unengaging and information and assignments werent always presented clearly. That said, there is no doubt in my mind that the instructor and course became infinitely better as time went to the benefit of all of us.\r\nMost importantly, the class improved throughout the semester. What the next batch of students that gets the opportunity to take this class will gain from it will be much more than what we did.\r\nThe most important thing I can say is simply that I would retake the course. I dont just mean that I dont regret my decision but that I would be happy to and gain a lot out of taking the course a second time. Maybe not in my first semester though."
