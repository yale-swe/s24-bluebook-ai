                "Maybe this is because classes were virtual, but I wished we spent more time practicing extemporaneous speaking. Professor Titus would ask each of us one question at the beginning of class (e.g. \"What did you do this weekend?\"), but other than that, we mostly worked on textbook exercises. Some of those exercises were so simple that they didn't really improve my speaking abilitiesfor example, they might ask us to fill in the blanks but give us the exact phrases we had to insert in the blanks. It would have been helpful if instructors had only selected more challenging textbook exercises. I also preferred it when we went through exercises as a class and weren't given the chance to will them out ahead of time. We often got five minutes to fill in the answers and then went over time; I think this is partly why my writing abilities are far stronger than my speaking abilities."

This course will give you a solid foundation, and there's something so wonderful about waking up every morning and spending 55 minutes speaking Russian. At the same time, keep in mind that this course is a lot of workand the language itself is inherently more difficult for English speakers than romance languages. Only take this course if you're genuinely vested in learning Russian, and be willing to spend a lot of time on it."
