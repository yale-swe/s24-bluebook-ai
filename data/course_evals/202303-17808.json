                "I learned so much about a major part of not only U.S. History, but global history as well. I never knew much about the history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic or the science behind HIV. As someone interested in humanities, the science was very accessible and never a barrier to understand what was happening in the course. Further, the midterm and final projects allow you to explore any topic related to the course that interests you.",
                "I learned so much about the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The course really did span the pathophysiology of the disease and the social and political threads of the epidemic. A lot of the material I had never heard about before and was really engaging and interesting.",
                "This is a great class if you need a science credit and you're interested in history and politics. You learn a lot about the larger epidemiological picture behind HIV and have good discussions, readings, and incredible guest speakers that highlight different aspects of the epidemic. It was also very helpful in learning to use Yale's resources from the library to the art gallery.",
                "How to be critical of and analyse scientific papers and research. How to conduct my own research and gather sources to write my own scientific paper. My presentation skills were improved. My ability to ask insightful questions about the reading and not just absorbing the information.",
                "I learned about the HIV/AIDS epidemic both in the United States and abroad. I further developed my skills on writing research papers and presenting on a selected topic. Insights: several guest speakers during the semester helped me develop different points of views on the topic."

                "Strengths: Professor Bazell is incredibly knowledgeable, and the course content was very interesting, especially the parts about the organizing/activism around HIV/AIDS. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the technology was a bit hard to navigate in class and how the Canvas was set up.",
                "The biggest strengths of this course are how much room you have to explore your own interests, along with the incredible guests and invaluable experience that professor Bazell brings to the class. We were able to speak with so many people who worked behind the scenes during the epidemic and learn so many untold stories.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bazell is the BEST person to instruct this course. He has so much experience as a journalist covering AIDS and he invited the most accomplished guest speakers to give us a first hand account of the epidemic. Weaknesses: Seriously no weaknesses, would take this course again.",
                "I would have liked slightly clearer feedback on assignments, but this class did a great job and easing me into college while still teaching about a very important subject in the history of science and politics.",
                "The course was extremely engaging, and there were plenty of opportunities for students to explore their individual interests relating to HIV/AIDS.  The course utilized a variety of teaching formats, including research papers, documentaries, and guest lectures. The guest lectures were incredibly informative and interesting. Sometimes the grading criteria was a bit unclear.",
                "Sometimes too much reading but rare. Interesting content.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bazell is very nice and a leader in the field of journalism. His knowledge and connections to those fighting against the epidemic allowed us to engage with the topic in a unique way. Grading was not bad at all just make sure to put the work in for the two papers and presentations. Great science credit for those not very STEM-inclined. Weaknesses: none, honestly. No improvements needed."

                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! This was my favorite class I took this semester and was a great way to enter Yale. You learn so much about an important topic and Professor Bazell is the best. The workload is relatively low and the course is more rewarding than most other classes Ive taken. Its also a great introduction to Yale resources; we meet with the librarians and visit both the YUAG and the Beinecke. The homeworks are usually just video clips or movies, with never more than 20 pages of reading. I have already and will continue to recommend this course to anyone.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the history and politics of modern epidemiology. It was a great classroom environment and I loved to hear from the incredible guest speakers.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, but especially to students interested in medicine or public health. The workload was reasonable, and the professor was extremely knowledgeable and engaging.",
                "Yes, the professor is extremely knowledgeable and an expert in his field. The classes are varied and include interesting class trips as well as meeting the people that we have studied.",
                "Yes, absolutely. You have nothing to lose from taking this course especially as a first-year. Learning about the HIV/AIDS epidemic is important for those wishing to become more worldly and socially cognizant. Again, Professor Bazell is amazing and he truly cares about each of us."
