                "Professor Fadiman was incredibly well-organized, the course was seamlessly taught and executed, down to the last minute. All of us were in a state of constant awe at her organization. Professor Fadiman also exhibited a deep devotion to her students and approached the coarse as something potentially life-changing that could push students towards (or away from) a career in journalism. The camaraderie that Professor Fadiman encouraged among us was amazing, as were the lengths to which Professor Fadiman went to help us get in contact with and meet real-life writers. \r\n\r\nThe course held us to a very high standard, which I loved. Because of the renown of the course and Professor Fadiman's half-ironic, half-genuine references to the ritual and tradition baked into the course, sometimes it felt like the stakes were higher than I was comfortable with or think stakes should be for a college class. There were rumors circulating that meant that Professor Fadiman would ask students not to pass/fail the course if she particularly admired their work, and I think these put everyone ill at ease, half-expecting and half-hoping that she would approach them thus. Of course, Professor Fadiman knew nothing of these rumors and they could be totally false.",
                "Strengths: you write a lot and get a lot better at writing; Anne is amazing and so supportive of her students. She actually spends SO much 1-on-1 time with you\r\nWeaknesses: you don't really talk about being at home in America... also, class is very white",
                "This is one of the best workshops I've been a part of at Yale for a couple of reasons. Everyone bought in and committed the time and effort to this. Really, it all boils down to Anne. She is an amazing professor and cares so deeply about this class. Anne is exceptional and inspires everyone in the class to step up their game.",
                "This is one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale- it has so much hype, but I learned that it was well-deserved. I worked so hard in that class and am leaving feeling proud of myself and the work that I produced. Anne devotes so much time to her students, both in the seminar and in one-to-one meetings, and we fostered such a wonderful classroom environment that even though it was a three-hour seminar at the end of a very long day, I still looked forward to each session. It's a lot of work. A lot of work. And I do think you get out of it what you put in, but if you devote a good amount of your semester to the essays and revisions, it's so worth it. If there's one potential improvement, I'd say that I'd love for there to be more free-flowing discussion about some of the readings rather than a lecture with some question and answer format.",
                "The biggest strengths are Professor Fadiman and your peers. Professor Fadiman plans this class down to the minute: its a well-oiled machine. She packs every moment of the three-hour seminar with rich analysis, show-and-tell, and writing lessons. Its amazing to join this community of absurdly talented and driven writers.",
                "A strength of this course was the individualized feedback.\r\nA weakness was that it was sometimes hard to stay focused for the three hour block.",
                "This course is far and away the best one Ive ever taken at Yale. Despite taking it credit/d, I put the majority of my academic energy for the semester into this course. I think every aspect of the course was strong, particularly the workshopping and peer review and the close attention from Anne. My only critique would be that we spent fully 1/3 of each class period receiving generalized tips for writing. Some weeks, I wished there had been more applied/creative uses of that hour.",
                "Strengths: your classmates will be terrific, you will learn how to write and report, you will become obsessed with Roget's thesaurus. Weakness: it is a TON of work. Don't let that dissuade you. Just make sure you plan your other classes accordingly!"

                "Yes, if they can get in. The course was transformative for me in many ways. It helped me realize what nonfiction writing really entails, in a professional setting, and just how much work it is. It helped me better understand which writing jobs I might hope for more realistically and which ones I might probably only aspire to. It helped me understand the current journalism job market and the sacrifices and rewards it entails. It helped me take many critical looks at myself, how I approach writing, and why. It helped me realize what I do and don't like about my own writing. It helped me become a FAR better editor (both of my own work and of my peers'). It helped me be a better team-mate and better appreciate the power of mutual-support and appreciation.",
                "Yes - it's changed my writing forever and the Yellow Pages assignment is amazing",
                "Absolutely. Anne Fadiman is one of the best professors at Yale. She certainly cares more than any professor I've ever had about me and my work. The course itself is great, but Anne makes it a special experience.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much and, though I spent ungodly amounts of time agonizing over my written work, wish I could go back and do it all over again.",
                "If you can commit to it, yes. You get out of 469 what you put into it. Youre going to want to examine every word of the readings, pour hours into your peer critiques, and edit your essays until the deadline demands you turn it in. Be warned, you are going to spend way more time than you expect on this class. Professor Fadiman encourages you to take the class Credit/D so that you can show yourself you can write for your own benefit rather than for a grade.",
                "Yes, absolutely!",
                "Highly! I feel so lucky to have been in this course. Of course, its really only suitable to people who want to write a lot and read a lot of peer written work.",
