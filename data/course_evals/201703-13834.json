    "If you get the chance, take this capstone! Professor Hopkins was the absolute best capstone facilitator. He is also a phenomenal person and really cares about the students. He wants us to learn and truly take something away from the class. Overall, this capstone was much better than some of the others I heard about. We had a clear deliverable, it was an interesting project, we had a reasonable client (the IFC), and our professor was great.",
    "Pick your capstone based on the professor. Bo is a great instructor and I would highly recommend the class with him.",
    "Take Bo's capstone! He is great at organizing the course so that you don't feel you're not grounded. He found us an amazing client (the IFC) with a great and well-structured requirement. I had a phenomenal time working on this project and learned SO MUCH.",
    "I have heard horror stories of capstone projects, this was not one such capstone. It was a joy to work with the IFC and with Professor Hopkins."
