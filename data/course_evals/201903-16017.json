    "I learned about western musical structure, primarily focusing on the baroque and classical periods. This included study in harmony, counterpoint, 4-voice writing, structures such as sentences, periods, and binary form, as well as composition.",
    "Music theory! Basics of. More holistic interpretation than the actual theory, which we learned pretty quickly overall and used kind of infrequently.",
    "Theory",
    "I learned voice leading rules and the function of chords",
    "You will learn so much! I entered with no formal theory training, and left with a solid understanding of Roman numeral analysis, common classical structures (periods, sentences, sequences, etc.), and even four-part composition. At the beginning of the year, I could not have imagined composing a minuet for a string quartet. By the end of the term, it was very feasible!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course's main strength was the freedom that it gave us to explore the ideas we learned in class in short composition assignments each week, as well as bigger composition assignments for the midterm and final. Professor Cox's feedback on these assignments let us know quickly if we really understood an idea or not. I think that this course could be improved by pulling examples from non-western, baroque\/classical music to be examined in class as well. I feel that we learned from a very limited source of materials and I think it would be interesting to learn how the theoretical concepts of western classical\/baroque music compared to music from other cultures\/time periods.",
    "Because we were all of different levels, the foundational learning was kind of haphazard and treated like review even when it wasn't. As someone not super familiar with it, that was tough. Overall, though, it worked.",
    "I thought the class was too serious at times",
    "Dan Cox is a wonderful professor who creates a welcoming, collaborative atmosphere. Students of varying levels will find that the material is communicated well and that they have the resources to compose on their own! Music 210 is a great way to meet other music majors and music-lovers, and it will leave you with the skills to go further!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has not taken any previous formal music theory classes, though is somewhat comfortable with musical ideas such as scales, modes, keys, triads, and rhythm. I learned a lot from this course and it was really satisfying to see my progression of knowledge through the various composition assignments assigned each week, as well as the more involved Midterm and Final. Also, Professor Cox is great and I highly recommend taking a course with him if you can.",
    "Yes if you want to learn theory",
    "Yes, highly recommended for music majors or for any music-affiliated people who would like to try their hand at analyzing\/composing classical music!"
