    "Instrumental case, expressing regret, second and third person imperatives, genitive plural, using prepositional and genitive cases for dates, impersonal statements, and many other grammatical lessons, along with a lot of vocabulary, reading and listening improvement, and cultural facts.",
    "I developed a great deal more understanding of the Russian language and more grammar concepts and vocabulary.",
    "I can speak Russian far better than I could before!",
    "I developed a better knowledge of Russian grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I learned a lot more Russian! L2 is a good introduction to some more complex Russian grammar.",
    "Learned the Russian language.",
    "Professor Tsabei provided us with a grammatical foundation of the Russian language. She instilled in us an enthusiasm for the culture and the confidence to speak the language.",
    "L2 level russian vocabulary and grammar"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are creative and active learning exercises in class, the listening portions of the homework, and the videos for homework. The biggest weakness is a lack of additional online options for practice that could align with the lessons. In Spanish, the textbook also had an online site that accompanied it where you could go and practice vocabulary and grammar with the corresponding lesson in case the homework exercises weren't enough.",
    "I think that it would be good to have a bit of a review of L1 information in the beginning of the semester because it is so cumulative. I think that in the future it would be better to either only cover the highlights of Unit 13 and use the extra time to review in the beginning of the semester, or cut Unit 13 altogether because it was very rushed and felt jammed into the end of the semester.",
    "Weakness was probably the old-fashioned video, and the strengths are the knowledge of the professors and the smart structure of the course.",
    "The biggest strength was being able to meet every day, which helped a lot with learning.  The biggest weakness was the large amount of course material packed into one semester.",
    "There is such constant testing that you get very little time to fully cement the information you are learning. We had to cram for one test, and then didn't return to that information to go over it, and suddenly we started having to cram for the next test. Language is supposed to build on itself so we should theoretically have been revising everything by taking a new test, but we simply didn't have time to do that!\r\n\r\nThe strengths is in the classroom atmosphere, thanks to both my fellow students and our amazing teacher Liubov. She made learning Russian so enjoyable.",
    "We could have been pushed a little more to speak properly.",
    "The course attempts to cover way too much material in too short of a time span. It would have been useful if the teachers took one week, perhaps in the middle of the semester, to just review all the material in a condensed fashion. There is no time to really absorb all the information, despite doing hours of homework every night.",
    "Fast paced but well taught since consistent practice is needed for languages"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This is a great way to learn Russian.",
    "Yes! The Russian department faculty is amazing, and they have many extracurricular enrichment opportunities available in the Slavic department that really give you a feel for the culture in addition to the language. Also, it's very nice how the course follows the textbook and the workbook almost exactly, it makes it very easy to follow along.",
    "Absolutely, intelligently designed and facilitates learning well.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone looking to learn a more challenging language.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The professors and TFs are wonderful and want to help you learn Russian. As it is a challenging course, they are willing to make themselves available to help.",
    "I definitely would. Learning Russian at Yale has been intense, but really rewarding.",
    "Its tough but rewarding! Russia is an extremely interesting country",
    "I would caution other students from taking this course. If I did not have Professor Tsabei, I would not have taken this class. It is a huge amount of work and constant participation. If you do not memorize all the different cases early on you will struggle enormously."
