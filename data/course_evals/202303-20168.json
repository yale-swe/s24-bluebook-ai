                "I gained the ability to write long French essays, read French literature at a faster pace, and speak comfortably in class in French. I also learned about a range of topics, from French colonization to the Holocaust to Ancient Roman history.",
                "I greatly improved my reading comprehension and gained valuable practice in literary analysis, and I also improved my speaking abilities as participation in the discussion required forming sophisticated thoughts and being able to convey them, which was very rewarding at the end.",
                "I learned vocabulary to study literature in French, new literary devices, and the skill to present a literary analysis. I was exposed to works from Diderot, Colette, Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, and Marie NDiaye. From the content of the books we read, I saw the relationship between the artist and the artwork, humanity and nature, and life and death portrayed in various ways.",
                "I greatly improved my ease of reading, writing, and speaking in French, and gained a robust and intertextual foundation in a wide range of movements, genres, and geographies of French literature."

                "STRENGTHS: I loved the consistency of work for this course; the schedule of readings had a clear rhythm. Also, the class meetings had a nice balance of space for students to talk and direction from our professor. I found our professor Tertrain's comments and direction to be very insightful and interesting, and the class was all willing to participate and build on each others' ideas. I also appreciated the broad range of literature that we read; from postcolonial poetry to eighteenth century children's fables to somewhat confusing contemporary literature, there was enough variety of material that students are bound to enjoy at least one piece.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: One weakness of the course was that sometimes our professor would ask about a reference to another piece of French media that none of us knew. While it was great to be exposed to new media, sometimes the connections were unclear given my lack of context knowledge.",
                "The variety in the syllabus is a major strength, as all students can find readings in which they're particularly interested. Another strength is how the course encourages students to draw intertextual connections between different works, which was especially fun in the essays."

            "comments": [
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are looking to improve their written French. The weekly discussion posts really helped me get comfortable with writing in French on a regular basis, and the essays were a sufficient length to be a satisfying intellectual challenge.",
                "I would recommend this course if you really want to improve your French while reading interesting works that are a bit challenging to understand at times, both due to their style and their rich language.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to keep up their French, read provoking work, or study a survey of literature in French. The workload was manageable, with three spikes throughout the semester for the presentation and the two essays. However, it is a course where your insight an enjoyment is likely proportional to how much time you put into it; doing the full readings makes this class very fulfilling. Also, Prof. Tertrain was very willing to help students after class or in his office hours.",
                "I 100% recommend this courseit convinced me to become a French major. You'll gain an incredible foundation in French literature, within a rich intertextual context of philosophy, art, film, music, and even science."
