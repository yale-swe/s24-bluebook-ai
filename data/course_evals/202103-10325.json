                "Strengths: the people, the discussion, and the instructor. Craig is literally the best. Also, our class formed pretty close bonds and we had a great time during our in-class discussions. Also, Craig has amazing edits for essays: he's an incredible writer that can really nail down where you need to go with a paper.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Despite this, I felt like I didn't grow as a writer all that much.",
                "Strengths included the engagement Professor Eklund had with his students but the weaknesses was that there wasn't alot of writing practice",
                "This class does a good job of introducing students to academic writing, how to build claims, find logic and motives, and use evidence to support the claims. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot about narratives and how they are perceived in society. However, I didn't enjoy the content of the class so much, so it the class a bit harder for me.\r\nAlso, I think future student would benefit from knowing from the very first day that the class is about narratives mostly, and how they are told and perceived. I believe this would give students a better idea of what to expect later within the semester.",
                "The class discussions were great and the readings were very engaging. Also, the workload was not too high. Craig always made the classes interesting and fun which made me look forward to it every week.",
                "good class",
                "One weakness that was brought to my attention was the passive approach to learning storytelling; I thought we would be telling stories ourselves. Instead, we learned about the elements and uses storytelling while very rarely getting to do so ourselves.",
                "The strengths of this course were engaging material, open writing prompts, and the classroom environment. The topic of the class provides a really interesting way to look at many different facets of life and made for really interesting discussions and essay writing. The research paper was a really good time of getting to explore topics of interest from this perspective, and it also offered a really good introduction on doing research at Yale. The small class size was nice for an intro class to meet people and feel comfortable in discussions. I would say that the course could benefit from more foundations of narratology. We didn't learn many terms related to the study or much organized theory, most of our knowledge came from the readings which dealt with narrative in its more vague nature."

                "I would because Craig was an awesome professor who made the class very interesting. I'm not all that fascinated with narrative, but when Craig talked about it he kept our class very engaged.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes I would writing is a crucial skill to develop for any major so taking this class your first year establishes a strong foundation that could be used throughout the rest of your Yale career.",
                "Definitely.\r\n\r\nAside teaching one how to properly write an academic paper, building claims, and other important things, this class helps one engage with several issues and events happening in the real world.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if you have the chance to take it. Craige may be the nicest and most understanding English 114 prof out there and he gives really great feedback on all the papers you have before the deadline. Overall, he really cares for every student in his class and does all he can to help us succeed. The topic of the class is interesting and the discussions changed my point of view on how powerful narratives and stories are. Furthermore, the workload and deadlines were more than manageable and he often asked us if we needed dates to be moved or more time to work on our papers. Discussions were very laid back and low stakes. Take it!!",
                "yes if u want to improve your writing kills",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who would like to learn the fundamental skills of college level writing. It's also interesting to learn about how to tell stories.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this class because it really changed my perspective on how narrative shapes a lot of parts of our world and perceptions. Craig is an awesome teacher and created a really great classroom environment. It's a good intro english class to work on analytical writing, reading academic essays, and researching."
