                "I think the only weakness would be to not include the fragments from historians, which Professor Solodow has already identified as not being necessary. as for strengths, I think the course was perfectly structured in its length for each historian; I always felt that we spent just enough time with every historian. Moreover, while at first I was not as excited about the biblical readings, I felt them to be extremely useful. It was very interesting to see the biblical texts placed next to Herodotus, Thucydides, and Polybius; therefore I think their inclusion was definitely a strength. The major strength and defining feature of this course was Professor Solodow, who is a very engaging, accessible, and thoughtful Professor.",
                "Great introduction to Greek historians. I think the essays and exams were of appropriate difficulty and length. Perhaps in terms of the syllabus the following class should read the entirety of the first book of Herodotus.  I particularly enjoyed the time we spent on Acts, and think we benefited from all the class time we devoted to it. I was also very interested in the topic of the Hellenization of the Jewish world. Perhaps optional secondary readings should be made available to those who want more historical context etc."
