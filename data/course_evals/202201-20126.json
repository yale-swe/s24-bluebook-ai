                "I learned a lot more about French colonialism and the effects it had on the people in colonized countries. As a result of this and the material that we discussed in this class, I also learned how to have more serious conversations in French and what it means to put yourself out there in order to gain confidence in your skills. This improved my oral skills a lot!",
                "Greatly expanded my knowledge of French culture and language. Established better fluency as well.",
                "I learned and practiced a lot of grammar in this class, including the faire causatif, imperatif, past participle agreement, country prepositions, and lots more. We also lots of \"Francophone\" texts, including some written in and based in France but also some short stories from Haiti, Algeria, and Canada, among others, so I learned a bit about what life is like in those places. We did presentations on World War II, so I learned a lot about what World War II was like in France.",
                "I became a lot more comfortable speaking French through the various both small and larger group activities in class. My grammar greatly improved and so did my writing skills.",
                "This course helped tremendously in refreshing my ability to speak and understand French. I had not practiced this language for a few years, so my reintroduction couldn't have been smoother."

                "It could be improved by going through homework. More importantly all of the texts and books are really sad and its a little annoying by the end.",
                "I thought the content we learned this semester was fantastic and truly helped contextualize my position in the world as someone who wants to learn more about France and francophone cultures. That being said, I didnt like most of the movies that we watched in class and I also thought that our conversations about the movies somewhat glossed over the problematic themes present. \r\n\r\nInchAllah Dimanche was extremely islamophobic and I dont think we need to watch this movie at all in order to learn about Algeria. The domestic violence and the subjugation\/regulation of the wife were aspects of the movie I was very much unprepared to watch as well. \r\n\r\nLe Rafle was definitely better than InchAllah Dimanche, but I still think there has to be other movies about the Holocaust that dont center Christian narratives and have a tendency to humanize Hitler.\r\n\r\nAs far as books go, I really liked the stories from Diversit, but I didnt like La Symphonie Pastorale at all. Maybe it has a little bit to do with the way we discussed the book, but I dont see why we needed to read and talk about a predatory Pastor and his obsession with a blind girl.\r\n\r\nI also wish there was more time to learn about colloquialisms and generally how people really converse in France as opposed to drilling grammar concepts.",
                "Overall, a very well rounded class and a low stress environment. It would have been nice to have accomplished a bit more in class, because at times we lingered a little too long on specific reviews. But that was a very minor thing.",
                "This class is great if you are willing to put in a lot of work. In L3, I think the grammar and readings were less difficult but more time consuming. In L4, a lot of the grammar is very confusing and un-intuitive at first, so it requires a lot of thinking-about to understand what's going on. But the materials (like the course pack and the Barson grammar book) definitely do help, and so do the professors, so I think that's a definite strength! Five things I'd wished were different: 1) The course pack is apparently wrong sometimes (??) -- at least our professor, who is French, said some of the stuff in the course pack was incorrect. It would be nice if it wasn't incorrect, since it's confusing enough as it is. 2) I wished we'd had more audio grammar sections for La Symphonie Pastorale, because there are identification questions on the exams but not in the homework, so they were really hard. In general, actually, it would have been nice to have more grammar audios towards the end of the semester. 3) It'd be nice if the grammar audios taught you how to do the grammar before testing you on it, and also if they gave you the right amount of time to write down your answers. Sometimes it's way too much time and sometimes it's bizarrely quick, which is stressful and annoying. 4) I was ambivalent about\/disliked a lot of what we read and watched for class. For one thing, it's all extremely depressing (and the lack of trigger warnings was frustrating too!). But also, I feel like there are probably a lot of French classics that are a bit more engaging\/interesting\/educational\/beautiful, and it would be nice to work with those instead. 5) A more open array of topics for the presentation would be nice. \r\n\r\nBut despite all these things that could be improved, I definitely learned a ton and really enjoyed taking this class!",
                "A weakness of the course is the homework load. While it is nice to have skills to review and practice every night, and it provides a routine for students to follow, the 1.5-2 hours of homework can make it difficult to put forth our best effort since it can be challenging to complete both grammar and reading and audio programs all in the same night depending on the rigor of the other classes we are taking. I think the amount of nightly homework could be decreased and would encourage students to put forth more effort and participate more in class when discussing the topics covered in the homework. \r\n\r\nThe course has many strengths. I really appreciate the focus on a discussion-based class time because it really pushed me to engage with the material and practice speaking, which I was initially scared to do but now feel more comfortable doing. Another strength of the course is the implementation of grammar skills in short writing activities and the unit essays because it offers students a chance to see how the grammar structures are used in various contexts.",
                "I wish we would have done more virelangues. No one had a solid grip on pronunciation of certain French words or phrases, and it is not entirely intuitive. These may have helped with our oral sections on exams too, as I found my self trying to remember how to pronounce a word rather than compose the sentence that succeeds it."

                "Yes, especially if you're willing to put the work in! The French department really likes to give a ridiculous amount of homework, but definitely try to do it all -- otherwise it's hard to follow along in class, especially with the weird and unintuitive grammar rules.",
                "Yes because it really helped me improve my French skills. I now feel a lot more comfortable using the language and appreciate French culture a lot more after learning about various aspects of it."
