Furthermore, this class allowed me to become even more independent in lab work than I had already become in PHYS 165L.",
    "I'm honestly not sure what I learned in this class, other than how to regret my decision to come to Yale. This class is the epitome of an awful pre med class; the amount of competitiveness among students made the class really stressful. Also, there was an inexcusable amount of variation in grading among TA's: my friend had a TA who began giving perfect scores to everyone in the class, whereas my TA was a much harder grader.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Same complaint; but why complain as they will never change it: Instead of grading the reports SOLELY according to arbitrary rubrics, in the manner of checking off boxes, why not also factor in the quality of writing\/insights? It is easy to hit all the marks on the rubric and hand in something not very good. You should reward good thinking, not box checkery.",
    "The course packets make no sense. The final assumes knowledge of things that students cant possibly know.",
    "Making labs less confusing and more helpful to us in the real world.",
    "The course was a bit disorganized and some of the labs were difficult to follow. As someone with prior electronics experience, some of the questions in the lab handout were still confusingly worded and difficult to understand.",
    "Strengths: The help available at the labs, the instructions in the course packet\r\nWeaknesses: giving more chance to practice for the final. But also having a lot of experiments to do in a 3 hr period. I believe that the experiments were sometimes too much and it caused the students to become stressed out and feel rushed.",
    "It's an intro lab. It's never going to be fun but helpful for intro to electric measuring equipment",
    "So bad: this whole sequence did not match with PHYS 170\/171 in terms of concepts. I was trying to learn physics that I had never seen before for the laband the prelabs were written poorly so I had to go on other websites (Wikipedia!) to learn things. Also bad: we were expected to know how to use the equipment without being taught anything, which made the final extremely stressful. Also bad: the TAs didn't know how the labs worked either; they would try to ask the professor during our lab if we had questions. Overall one of the worst classes, probably the worst experience, I've had at Yale.",
    "I think it was well-structured, and the lab handouts provided clear instructions.",
    "Poorly synched with the class. \r\nEasy example, we are never taught how to draw circuits, it's just assumed. Lenses came up in lab before they came up in class. We never learned how to draw lens diagrams in class and had to figure it out as we went in lab. Little things like that. Frustrating",
    "I like that the lab handouts are pretty well-written and that the lab reports are limited to one page. I wish the time commitment was a little more consistentsome labs took the full three hours, while others were more like an hour or an hour and a half. If all of the lab sessions could be a consistent two hours that would be awesome. I also wish the grading rubric for the lab reports were published. The merging black holes section of lab 4 was confusing, and I felt like the TAs didn't have good explanations for all the behaviors we observed in the RC circuits, Harvey, and induction labs.",
    "Some of the labs were unnecessarily long and complicated. The final was also a little tricky but straightforward for the most part. I thought the grading for the lab reports was pretty fair.",
    "The regular labs could replicate the practical exam more or we could have a midterm practical exam.",
    "Concepts are hard to grasp without having the instruments in front of you. I always felt like we needed to value pace over understanding. So I often zipped through the lab without fully understanding what was going on.",
    "This class is a horrible class. Having more standardized grading among the TA's would make it more fair because some TA's naturally grade lower than others.",
    "Did not go along with physics course well",
    "The structure of the lab course makes each week's lab quite predictable, but monotony is not a bad thing necessarily. Some of the labs felt like they did not correspond at all with the lecture (optics for example) and I sensed that they were thrown in because the instructors had run out of relevant labs, so I would recommend reviewing those.",
    "Some labs (especially the optics labs) were just confusing and even the TAs didn't understand certain concepts even to a basic degree. It was just a weird aggregation of topics thrown together.",
    "I think that all of the assigned work was reasonable and useful. There were a few weeks when the lab was crazy long, so maybe splitting some weeks up and combining others would avoid those high-stress days.",
    "I like the idea of the course and the concepts taught. In practice, however, the lab sessions could be really messy and chaotic, and in general, the course didn't feel well-organized to me. Students weren't necessarily prepared for the final either---ostensibly, the weekly labs are meant to help students prepare, but it didn't really feel that way.",
    "Strengths, hands on experience. Weakness: labs don't need to be as long certain weeks...felt like just busy work.",
    "The course could be improved by tying in more cohesively with the lecture class.  For example, doing labs with inductors after they are covered in PHYS 181 would have been nice.  Also, the lab on optics did not relate to anything we had learned in lecture, and instead we had to learn the concepts in the lab from scratch by reading the prelab.\r\nOverall, though, the class is fair and the TAs were very helpful with any problems that arose.",
    "The labs are pretty tedious and the lab handouts can be very dense.",
    "I rarely understood what we were doing. The labs were so long that I couldnt process what we were doing. Make the labs shorter so we arent rushed!!",
    "strengths: does help with some learning and visualizing some gen phys concepts. oscilloscopes are cool  \r\n\r\nweaknesses: super dry and way too much work for every lab leaves you scrambling to print a bajillion graphs to get out on time opposed to having enough time to actually internalize any of the concepts. Time crunch final is a poor indication of your knowledge level and really stressful for no reason. Grading is super arbitrary and depends on the TA. \r\n\r\nReducing the number of tasks (every lab and on the final) would HUGELY improve this class. We'd learn more and be less stressed out. Please!",
    "Strengths: well aligned with 181 topics, labs were interesting and relevant. Weaknesses: labs often felt rushed which made it hard to actually understand them, some labs were not well explained before doing them",
    "One big weakness of this course is that the topics covered rarely correlate with what we are being taught in physics lecture. As a result, we often cover advanced topics in physics lab before we learn about them in lecture. This makes the labs very difficult to understand and puts much more work on the TAs who end up having to explain these concepts to the students during lab. Also, the students would get much more out of the lab if we did labs on concepts we had already covered in class. As is, people often do the labs without actually understanding the concepts behind them since it is their first time being exposed to the concepts.",
    "The topics of these labs were much more interesting than Physics 165L, which kept students more engaged. The lab handouts usually provided clear instructions for students as well. However, often times we had not learned about the lab topics in our lectures. This made the labs quite frustrating at times when we were asked specific questions about topics we did not know much about. Additionally, topics like optics were never covered in lecture and seemed like they came out of nowhere.",
    "The labs were varied and interesting, and it was a good refresher of many physics concepts. However, I sometimes felt very rushed, and other time the labs were very short. It was occasionally hard to predict how to budget time in the lab.",
    "The class was good in that it covered a wide variety of physics material and was set up so it was easy to prepare for the lab before hand by reading the handouts that guide us through the experiment. It can be improved by making the lengths more consistent as some labs take longer than 3 hours while some others are less than an hour long.",
    "Strengths: you learn how to use all the tools well, the final itself is well structured\r\nWeaknesses: Most labs in the course packet are too long, trying to teach too many subjects as opposed to focusing on one main technique or topic. Labs themselves should be shortened and made more concise so that students actually take away a key concept.",
    "The course is structured very well. There are no surprises week-in and week-out which is definitely nice. I think the labs could sometimes be a little bit shorter, especially considering the labs on the final exam are (a) one hour long and (b) time-sensitive.",
    "No noticible strengths or weaknesses",
    "Strengths: Good organization and labs were all designed to be completed within the 3-hour slot, which I appreciated. Lab reports had reasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one lab using the breadboards and related electronic equipment was hard to grasp because most students had never used that device before and it was never covered in other settings except for a brief introduction in the lab handout, so a more thorough background would be appreciated (or at least more time to read up on the concept before lab). However, the majority of the labs covered concepts we were familiar with, thus strengthening our conceptual knowledge with concrete experiments. So, overall this was a good course.",
    "There are pretty much no strengths to this course. However, weaknesses include TAs who didn't prepare for teaching labs\/didn't want to be there, lab handouts that didn't actually provide any useful information for the lab, and many more.",
    "There really needs to be SOME method of standardization of the grading between sections. Really so much of your grade in this class depends on how hard or easy of a grader your TA is, which I don't think is very fair.",
    "Not a particularly intellectually interesting course. I wish it aligned more with the material covered in the physics lectures.",
    "Strengths -- definitely a course that taught me a lot about different applications of physics in the real world through the labs. \r\nWeaknesses -- there is definitely a lack of preparation for the final exam given that we work every week with a partner on a lab that is three hours long and then get thrust into the final that is done individually, with three experiments in three hours. There is a final preparation in the sense that they put out three past questions that you can come in and see before the final to give you an idea of what type of questions will be on there -- but it just isn't enough preparation.",
    "My TA this semester was great, but I again feel like physics lab was just a waste of my time. The labs were quite monotonous and often boring.",
    "Strengths: Cool experiments \r\nWeaknesses: Many instances of poor wording in the lab manuals. The experiments did not match well with the lectures (at least in 181). Circuits come up in the middle of the semester for 181 and these is the first topic that we cover in the labs. It got confusing conceptually.",
    "It is good to take this in conjunction with Physics 180 because it helps solidify some of the concepts you learn in class. I don't know how much physics knowledge I gained from this course, but the labs were usually pretty interesting and insightful.",
    "This course was excellent in its introduction to practical usage of electronic and magnetic equipment and phenomena, as well as its ability to expose me to novel concepts related to these topics in the course of my research for lab reports.  It was  hindered, however, by experiments that were either confusing or mistakenly put together.  Engagement with the course would be smoothed and heightened with insurance that all labs are typed and laid out clearly and in a manner that does not require the TA to come around and explain to individual groups what is being asked of them",
    "The course is fine once you get the hang of it.",
    "The strengths were that it was well organized, and the professors and TAs were dedicated.",
    "This course was boring yet hard based on nit picky grading.",
    "strengths: so much easier than PHYS 165 because we don't have to do uncertainty calculations and the data collection is so much easier, my TA became way more chill this semester, I actually learned about a lot of important electricity and magnetism concepts and I'm a premed\r\nweaknesses: the final is kinda scary because it's such a huge part of your grade",
    "This course was very structured. The writing in some of the experiment guides was a bit confusing, sometimes typos or mistakes would impede my understanding \/ ability to complete the experiment efficiently. Our TA was a definite strength, quickly pinpointing any inconsistencies and guiding our progress.",
    "The instructors that I encountered were all good and the workload expectation was very reasonable. My greatest criticism is that sometimes the labs just expected way too much preliminary physics knowledge or other knowledge which students just wouldn't have in their first year of physics classes. If the labs were over some more basic topics that tied more closely into the 180-181 curriculum then that would have been very helpful. For instance, there was a lab over logic gates in circuits, which is nowhere to be found in 180-181 and was completely unnecessary.",
    "Fine course. Exactly what you expect. Generally not the most interesting, but occasional gems and not too heavy of a workload. Definitely more challenging than first semester of general physics lab.",
    "The course assumed that students had a lot of knowledge that we had not come across before",
    "Some of the experiments were very interesting and it was great to make connections between concepts and results during lab. I will say that some of the experiments were boring or kind of redundant, so I didn't feel like I learned that much during those particular days in lab. There were also some topics that lab covered that students in Physics 181 never learned, so the course could have been more general to apply to both Physics 171 and 181, rather than focusing more on 171 material.",
    "The material never matched up with what we learned in class so I never had any idea what was going on in lab. This made lab extremely frustrating as I felt like my success in completing the experiment relied completely on my TA's help and guidance through a task that I didn't understand.",
    "It's great the way it is now. It's so hard to create a good lab with only 3 hours, so they are doing a phenomenal job.",
    "The final for this course needs to be either removed or significantly changed. It does not test one's mastery over the topics throughout the semester but rather tests one's ability to perform under a highly stressful environment. you get 55 minutes to do an experiment that could go wrong for a myriad of reasons that don't test your ability in physics but your Luck. A computer error could be the reason you do terrible (and was so for many people I know), and this is simply a ridiculous and poor measure of one's physics abilities. The professor's need to seriously reconsider what their values here are and how they want to teach. The TA's for this course work so hard to teach PHYSICS throughout the semester and for the knowledge that was transmitted throughout the semester to be so poorly tested is almost disrespectful. Do better for the sake of the future students PLEASE.",
    "Weaknesses: This course is completely disjointed with the PHYS 180 curriculum, which makes it extremely difficult to really engage with the course. Often, we would do things in the lab (i.e capacitors and magnets) that we wouldn't cover in class until 6 weeks after the lab. So most of the time, the students are just in lab with no idea of what was going on. In addition, there were topics covered such as optics and digital logic that were completely irrelevant to the 180 curriculum meaning we never covered it. Overall, this makes it so that students are often just in lab with no idea of what they're doing and rushing through so they can get out as soon as possible.",
    "The course was overall better than 165L in the fall. Some labs were really interesting, and you could clearly see the results because the data was always relatively clean. The labs in the middle of the course came ahead of the lecture and were extremely difficult for everyone. All the students in my section practically relied on our TA, asking him for each explanation question. The last labs were not taught at all in the course, but all the information was given in the packets. Thus, it would help to switch the order a bit.",
    "This class is boring, I dont feel like I learned much, and it was unnecessarily stressful",
    "Sometimes the lab handouts are unclear on procedure, so a lot of time in lab is spent clarifying what we are supposed to do, which gets frustrating.",
    "Overall I liked second semester physics lab better than first semester because I felt like the experiments were more interesting and because I more or less already knew the drill. Overall I felt like it was structured well to facilitate student learning, although it's not most peoples' favorite class....",
    "Does not align well with the phys 181 curriculum",
    "The labs this semester were actually more interesting, still though the format of the class lends itself to making students focus on just getting the lab notebook done rather than actually appreciating what they are learning. Maybe not as much writing, and much more analysis with guided help from the TA would be beneficial",
    "This class is tedious. The labs would always run late unless you rushed to finish everything. A strength is that you learn how to use the equipment.",
    "Labs are too long and the TFs are unprepared to make them run smoothly each week.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is infinitely more interesting than PHYS 165L (both in terms of concepts and lab activities); real-life applications were abundant and always made obvious in lab handouts; quizzes were easy if you studied; and the lab handouts were far more fun to read than they were in PHYS 165L.  The primary weakness is that the class only has a single exam that basically determines our entire grade, which is high-stakes to say the least; having a midterm in addition might be nice. The errors in the lab handouts were also pretty annoying at times, especially the one on page 5 of lab 3, where the formula for a triangular wave was completely butchered (I wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out); it'd be nice for someone to proofread all of the handouts again before re-distribution next year. Lastly, a few of the labs were quite long, given that we only had 3 hours (often closer to 2.5 after the quiz and pre-lab lecture).",
    "I honestly can't think of any strengths, besides that some labs were interesting and Dr. DeMille was a good instructor and explained concepts well. Other than that, the class was really stressful, and I'm glad I had it early on in the week so I could get it over with. I spent so much time on the lab reports for this class that the workload went well above a half credit, and yet my TA always found nitpicky things to take points off on. Don't even get me started about insight points: its basically an open invitation for TAs to grade subjectively depending on whether they like you or not. And the final exam was the most stressful exam I had this semester, despite taking a heavy courseload of six classes. The final exam places a completely unreasonable amount of stress on students, and tests us on concepts we didn't learn in the semester. The final exam should either be completely scrapped or at least replaced with a less daunting exam. And finally, it's pretty ridiculous that the same exam is given to students Monday-Friday; course instructors must know that by later in the week many students have a good idea of the three different experiments, and this poses a significant disadvantage to students on earlier lab days.",
    "Sometimes, it feels like busy work, but the course often had interesting applications that extended from the experiment at hand to the wider world.",
    "The course did not line up with the lecture and they did a very poor job at establishing theoretical understanding of the actions we were doing.",
    "Lots of available help, clear lab instructions, most labs were interesting.",
    "This was a horrible course, even though the professors wanted to make it pleasant. The structure is painful, and sometimes the TAs don't know the answers to the questions being asked. The experiments were unnecessarily long, and I had to stay past 6:00 on more than half of the classes, and three times until 6:30, which caused me to miss shifts at my student job. The lab reports and that system were fair, even though it is impossible to get insight points. The final exam is also wild, because I do not understand what skill it is assessing. Being able to do the experiments is important, but under that time pressure is ridiculous.",
    "The material that we learned every week seemed random and uncorrelated with each other, and I wish there was more direction that built on the things that we learned in the past week to structure our labs every week. Sometimes, the labs were very long and difficult to finish within 3 hours.",
    "honestly, it's a pretty great class as far as physics labs go.",
    "Weaknesses: the final exam is completely bogus",
    "One strength was that we had the practice problems set up a week before the final practical. The practice problems were very helpful in preparing for the final exam and they helped me narrow down parts of the physics I didn't understand throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was that some of the lab packets were confusing and difficult to follow.",
    "A weakness in this class was that the content of the labs often did not match what we had learned in lecture. This made it difficult to follow along during lab, and I often felt like I was just going through the lab steps without really understanding the underlying physics of what the experiment was doing. A suggestion would be to match the lab experiments up more closely with what is being learned in lecture.",
    "The strengths are that the course handouts for each lab are quite detailed and informative, and that the course instructors (for my lab section, Professor Ramos) walk around during the lab sessions and are very available to help students work through questions. I also think the structure of the course works well, in which students prepare for each lab session by reading the handouts, are held accountable for doing so by the weekly quizzes, record what they do during the lab sessions, and reflect on\/analyze the work done in lab with the weekly lab reports. The greatest weakness is that sometimes the course seems to throw new material at students without thoroughly explaining it, which leads to frustration among students because they don't understand what they're doing. It does not help that the individual topics are usually covered in lab earlier than they are covered in the physics lecture course, at least for 181.",
    "It's very TA dependent, so it's hard to say. A midterm like in PHYS 165L would have been nice, as it currently feels like there's a lot of weight placed on the final, but not a lot of preparation for it.",
    "Good workload and good TAs.",
    "Labs were good and well organized, especially because I had a good TA. It was always clear what was expected of me, and it was easy to make sure I understood all of the concepts at play. Nothing was too crazy complicated.",
    "Your grade depends on which TA you get. The final wasnt that bad this round and we had no midterm, which was good (bc all the exams will MESS YOU UP). It improved a lot from 165 but the lab manuals were still so obscure and cryptic.",
    "This is a great intro to electronics.",
    "strength: course content\r\nweakness: your experience too contingent upon your TA",
    "Felt like lab handouts could have been more structured\/assumed less that the student already knew the material.",
    "It would be very helpful if the instructions in each lab report were more self explanatory, perhaps with diagrams. I felt as if throughout the semester I had to rely heavily on my TA when I came to different parts of the lab because the instructions were just unclear.",
    "The labs were sometimes difficult to understand and connect with the physics course because they did not always align.",
    "n\/a",
    "Very interesting, some times too extensive. Better than 165L",
    "166L is much better than the fall semester course, because we spent less time bogged down in uncertainties and more time understanding the physics through experiments. I think the oscilloscopes were a bit outdated. I think there is too much emphasis on the final in this class, as most people do decently well on the lab reports, but the final creates a distribution that isn't necessarily representative of how well students understood the material-- it's more a matter if your equipment was working right and you can do well under time pressure without asking for help.",
    "The class seemed irrelevant. Labs were completely disconnected from PHYS 181 and PHYS 201, and the onus was on the student to fill in any gaps in mathematical or scientific knowledge. Grades depended largely on a single lab practical that was difficult to study for and challenging in person. Overall, this was far too much work and far too much stress for a half credit course, especially one that everyone takes as a prerequisite and not because of interest.",
    "The labs were often to long for the time assigned",
    "This course would be a lot stronger if it matched the lecture more! 170\/171 or 180\/181 it doesn't matter--learning material (in a vacuum) from a handout and being expected to recreate it in a lab is more difficult than it has to be.",
    "See 1",
    "Its strength is its tas, and its diversity and experiments.",
    "The weakness is that there is only one exam that your grade depends heavily upon.",
    "it seems about as alright as it's going to get, i feel like there are intrinsic barriers to this class being enjoyable, and the instructors being kind and generous with their help really makes things as good as they can be",
    "The quality of the lab handouts, compared to other general science lab courses (such as chemistry!) is severely lacking. I was in the Wednesday lab and every single Tuesday, nearly without fail, an email would get sent out with corrections of mistakes that had been found during the Monday lab session. Even after corrections, the lab handout often had unclear wording\/instructions, and was overall not well written or clear. \r\n\r\nThe reports that we were expected to write were essentially pointless and I think could use more structure or a more specific formatting.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this course is definitely in that the material is relatively interesting and very few labs were unreasonably tedious.",
    "The major strength of this course was having the course instructors available who are more familiar with the equipment and the instructions of the lab themselves.",
    "The worst part about this course, besides how boring the labs were, was the modules. They were written, quite frankly, like high school lab reports by a student who didn't know physics. Most of the information in those modules could have been taken out, and the important information was written in such a way that students couldn't understand without getting help from the TA (who often had trouble understanding the module as well). The directions never made sense, and often were hidden in the convoluted language of the module. Also, the lab should definitely have been at least from 1:30-5pm since the lab often went longer due to confusion over the notes and the labs took longer than they should have. For some of the labs, my TA often waived the last part of the lab due to confusion as to what was wanted and lack of time.",
    "This course does a poor job (much worse than 165L) at matching up with the curriculum from Physics 171. I thought it was just a physics 171 problem, but I talked to friends in 181, and they experienced the same issues. For example, we did a lab about induction of magnetic fields before I had even learned what a magnetic field or magnetic flux were. This made it really frustrating, and my TA didn't seem to realize that we were seeing this material for the first time and then being asked to apply it. I would hope that next year, the curricula of the lecture course and the lab course will match up more coherently. This made every lab a struggle to get through, and I found myself just trying to find a way to finish instead of actually trying to learn the concepts (because it seemed impossible in this setting).",
    "I think this was a pretty nice lab class. It wasn't too stressful and the labs were pretty straight forward. The thing I would improve though is the final exam. I think it's too much to have three consecutive one hour labs back to back. I also don't think it was very fair testing optics, when we only covered that in the last two labs we had.",
    "More effort could be made to relate the labs to concepts studied in the lecture courses.",
    "Often the experiments were not very clearly explained, or were missing key background information - as a result, your experience was extremely dependent on your TA. Did not pair up very well with the lecture course so we often didn't quite understand what we were doing.",
    "It does not line up (at least with the 171 sequence) the concepts in PHYS 166L are always a couple or several weeks before what is gone over in actual lecture (if it is even gone over) which makes lab really difficult. Also the variation among TA grading is very apparent as well as their level of engagement with students. There are definitely some TAs that are much better and will help their students whereas others are completely useless.",
    "The strengths are that the course material is presented in a clear and interesting way. The experiments are sometimes not timed that well, but overall they are ok.\r\nThe weaknesses are that the course might be not appealing to students who feel that they are not going to use the skills they learn later in life."

    "You have to take it, not the worst thing",
    "Never",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you would like a laboratory component but it is not absolutely necessary to take the lab in order to learn the concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course over labs 205 and 206.",
    "Well you probably have to take this course. So, have fun!",
    "Unless you have to please AVOID THIS CLASS LIKE THE PLAGUE.",
    "Only if necessary",
    "if you have to take it you have to take it",
    "Only for your major. It's a decent amount of work for half a credit and your grade will depend quite a lot on your TF (I was lucky this semester, unlucky last semester)",
    "Only if you have to, to be honest.",
    "yes",
    "I don't think I got anything out of this class that would have been worth taking it if I didn't have to, but I do think it solidified my understanding of physics.  If anything, it's extra practice and keeps you thinking about physics.  I still wouldn't recommend it if it's not a requirement, though.",
    "no unless you need it",
    "Only if you need it",
    "Absolutely not. Only if needed for a requirement. Super dry and way too much work for every lab leaves you scrambling to print a bajillion graphs to get out on time opposed to having enough time to actually internalize any of the concepts and learn deeper details. The crazy time-crunch of a final is a poor indication of your knowledge level and really stressful for no reason. Grading is super arbitrary and depends on the TA. Reducing the number of tasks (on every lab and on the final) would HUGELY improve this class. It's frustrating because this small change would vastly improve the course. \r\n\r\nOnly upside is you kinda feel like a badass using oscilloscopes.",
    "Only if required since it's a pretty large block of time and learning the techniques wouldn't really be relevant for anything else",
    "If you have to take this class, well you have to take this class. Otherwise, I would not recommend taking this class.",
    "I'd recommend 166L over 165L. The hands on experience gained through using an oscilloscope and function generator is valuable.",
    "This is a fine course, but I probably wouldn't recommend it if it weren't a requirement or a prerequisite. I can say that it was far less stressful that 205L, which I took as well. However, I also felt like I learned less.",
    "Yes, its a good way to learn how to use physics lab materials and equipment and further your understanding of phenomena.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It is very clear the grading of this course is extremely arbitrary and TA dependent. Not to mention a rubric for any of the tests is never provided (not even for an example lab) so students are left unclear as to how exactly to maximize their performance.",
    "I'd recommend this to any students even remotely considering entering the STEM field or a STEM undergraduate program. Physics is the building block of all sciences and this lab is a nice, simple introduction to many profound physical principles.",
    "Yes of lab work is part of your requirement",
    "If you need this as a requirement, this course will not be too bad\/worrisome. If you want to learn hands-on lab skills with fundamental physics concepts, I would still recommend this course because it is very instructional and helps you form problem-solving skills.",
    "No, unless you have to take it for a major or pre-med curriculum.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course, but obviously pretty much everyone in the class is taking it because they have to anyway. It is just not an enjoyable 3 hours every week lol",
    "I would recommend it only if you need to take it for a requirement.",
    "If you absolutely have to take a physics lab class, then take it. But expect it to be stressful in the end when there's the final. I mean the week to week work load is definitely not bad and the labs themselves sometimes are annoyingly long but they are definitely doable and the professors\/TAs are there to help you at all times (they are all incredibly helpful)\/",
    "Only take if you need to.",
    "Absolutely not. What an awful class. Dull and incompetently run (they literally LOST our grades last semester).",
    "The course overall is fine, but the final is WAY too hard compared to the actual labs. Prepare yourself, and make sure you know how to use an oscilloscope.",
    "Yes, if it's required. Otherwise, not much point in taking this.",
    "Fun, low-key half credit that can be annoying if you dont prep. Also a pre-req fora lot of majors\/classes so is useful to do early!",
    "Yes, if you need this for a req. it is a fine course.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Dont take unless you had to",
    "PHYS 166 was so much better than 165 because there weren't uncertainty calculations and the data collection was easier. Honestly, taking PHYS 165 was super hard for me bc I'm premed and I was confused all the time, but in PHYS 166 I got my act together, learned from my mistakes in 165, and improved a lot.",
    "Only if you have to take it. Its not hard but not that interesting\/rewarding in my opinion",
    "Don't take this for fun, but if you are required to take it don't worry because it's really quite reasonable.",
    "No",
    "Only if it's required by your major. Otherwise, you don't really learn much. Mostly helps people who are struggling in PHYS 181 better understand the concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who needs to take a physics lab course. Some of the experiments were boring but others were really interesting, at least in my opinion, and the workload and material were very manageable.",
    "No, not if you don't need it. It does not supplement the physics module well and does not teach you anything unless you work really hard to understand the material on your own.",
    "Yes if it's required or if they have a busy semester and cannot do a higher level of physics lab.",
    "Yes but beware of the final, and try to get a good TA it will make or break your experience",
    "Unless you have to take it, don't take it. It's a waste of time and I can't really say what I learned coming out of this course.",
    "Only take if u have to",
    "Do not take this class unless you're premed.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs it for a major or has some uncommon interest in applied physics. Probably not the type of class to just take for a half credit though.",
    "I would recommend this course because it was very helpful in explaining a lot of ideas we learned in physics lecture and also opened my eyes to the various equipment available to study the concepts of the lab.",
    "If you have to.",
    "No. Not unless you need it. It's 3 hours straight each week and it isn't that interesting.",
    "Take it only if you must. It's not fun or intellectually fulfilling.",
    "If you need a physics lab, this one is good. The lab handouts are clear and helpful. Sometimes you will finish early, other weeks are to the line, but generally it's manageable. The quizzes are usually very fair and based off the lab handout.",
    "It is a pretty chill lab, not too difficult but requires critical thinking. Definitely better than the other semester of physics lab.",
    "Yes! If you're taking this class it's probably because you have to anyway, but know that it's way more fun than PHYS 165L! Also, if you're taking the MCAT and are in PHYS 180-181, this lab covers topics on the MCAT that aren't covered in PHYS 181 lecture, so that's a bonus.",
    "Absolutely not, but this is irrelevant because only a sociopath would willingly put him\/herself through this.",
    "If you need it.",
    "It's a pretty fun lab, and the energy in the room is very upbeat and collaborative. If you need a physics lab, this is a good one! Nothing is too intense and everything is explained pretty well\/you actually learn.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The experiments were full of errors and it felt like no one, not even the professors knew what was going on.",
    "Yes but only if required. But it wont be a super bore.",
    "This course is likely required. For some reason, it was the worst required lab I've taken, even though it was less work.",
    "I would recommend it only if needed.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to students who don't need it as a pre-requisite or aren't very interested in physics.",
    "It's very TA-dependent, so it's kind of like playing the lottery. Kind of a waste of time, but if you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "Yes if they are premed or an engineering\/physics student.",
    "I'd recommend this course especially after dropping down from 205. This was much more reasonable. Not a lot of homework, and the labs were not stressful. Pretty enjoyable overall for me actually. There wasn't a lot of intellectual challenge, more like just a chill way to reinforce concepts.",
    "Yes.",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Unless it's a pre-req, don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are required to take a physics lab course.",
    "n\/a",
    "Only if your TA is one of the understanding ones that will listen to all your questions.",
    "Only if required.",

    "Not particularly",
    "Yes.  For a required class it was pretty good.",
    "Yes, if interested in physics this is a perfect introductory course.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "you definitely should only take this if required",

Usually the lab was done well before the designated end time, so in general this is not the most stressful lab you could take. It is not bad.",
    "If you are taking this course, you're probably doing this because you have to. Best way to get through this is to sign up for the same section as friends and get through this together.",
    "No. Only take it if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they need a physics lab requirement. The TAs are very nice and the class is structured in a way that it is low-stress for most of the semester, until you get to the final.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Yeah. Great introduction to doing labs. Much preferred over the harder lab.",
    "Take it if you need to - if not, it's pretty tedious and not very interesting, but not very challenging either.",
    "Take it only if you have to. It is the worst part of every week.",
    "I thought this course was amazing, and I really didn't expect to like it so much. So I would recommend you approach it without prejudice - this is actually a very cool intro-lab, unlike some other intro-level labs."
