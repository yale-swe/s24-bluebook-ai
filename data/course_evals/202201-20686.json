            "comments": [
                "It's very hard to find strengths for this course. It is a lot of frivolous work that just takes up time. The workload needs to be significantly decreased. Data analysis takes forever, especially when error analysis is involved. Even when using the ultrashort format, the lab reports could regularly take 20-30 hours to complete. It needs to be more facilitated on learning and guiding students and less on making students do too much.",
                "The course gives you a lot of experience with data analysis in a way that most other courses in mechanical engineering department do not. That being said I felt like I learned little to nothing about fluids or thermodynamics through this class apart from things I had to teach myself. The course covers far too wide of a breadth of content with nowhere near enough depth. The course assumes you have a practical understanding of real-world fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, when the prerequisite courses are primarily theoretical. The course would be exponentially more effective at teaching if the pace was reduced and the depth into individual topics was increased. Additionally, the course would be greatly improved in my opinion if there was at least 1 experimental design assignment rather than 10 labs where you follow a handout directly to measure a handful of values to compare against known ones with no clear reason.",
                "Strengths are that the labs are interesting and I learned a lot. Definitely helped me to learn material better than any of the non-lab courses I have had which was surprising.\r\nWeaknesses are that this is the hardest class at Yale. Lab reports take easily double digits of hours a week and often felt overwhelming. Providing an off weak or two throughout the semester would ensure that students don't burn out and can appreciate the material. No other lab course at Yale is so persistent with workload",
                "The lectures are good but both professors did not seem like they wanted anyone to learn. They gave very subjective and inconsistent grades and mocked me in the comments for getting stuff wrong. They clearly do not care even after hearing the reviews for the last 5 years.",
                "The work for this course takes infinite time for ten weeks of the semester.",
                "This class has an extremely hefty workload.",
                "The main issue this year was the schedule of when grading was done. We only got lab report grades that our professor had graded in the last week of classes and so had almost no ability to improve our work based on comments.",
                "Very heavy workload, even after it was reduced after the professor was forced to reduce the limit. Spent 3 full nights each week doing data analysis and writing the lap report.",

                "No. Sadly this course in it's current state is required for ABET mechanical majors. The workload of the class was significantly reduced this year as the format of the reports changed, but in a way such that the work that was left was the most tedious and least helpful. The course simply needs to cover less content. I have heard this exact comment about the course the entire time I have been at yale, but whoever is in charge of formatting the course refuses to understand that covering more topics does not mean that students will learn more. There is a lab report due every week which usually covers 2 separate experiments, with 5 or so hours usually spent editing cells in a spreadsheet. The class leaves little to no time to actually spend trying to further understand the experiments you are running, and most of the lab reports are basically just verifying known values and commenting on their accuracy.",
                "It is exactly as hard as everybody says. You will not believe it until the first two weeks of class are done and then all of a sudden you have a twenty hour lab report due. I would recommend this to mechanical engineers though because upon completion, I feel like I have completed a rite of passage and am ready to be an engineer. If you don not want to actually go into engineering, run away because this course is not fun and so difficult.",

                "Only take this course if you have to.",
                "No. I would only recommend you take this class if it is required. It is extremely stressful and time consuming.",

                "MENG requirement. The workload was heavily reduced by having us do shorter lab reports this semester but it was still pretty time-consuming I'd say. Not the worst class ever, though."
