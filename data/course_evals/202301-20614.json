The few that we had were actually very fun and very memorable, so I think it's a great way to learn the language.",
                "I love the Korean department at Yale so much. Every class I've taken has been one of my favorites and choosing to do this as my language was one of the best decisions I've made here. The courses are so collaborative and so fun. I look forward to going every day. \r\n\r\nI wish this class had been taught more in Korean as it was supposed to be, as this would have helped develop our listening skills and confidence in speaking. I also wish there would have been more reinforcement of previous concepts in new lessons, because I found that I would often very quickly forget old grammar or vocabulary once we moved past it as it was just never touched on again. This is also my fault for not doing more reinforcement outside of class on my own but doing more in class would have been very helpful.",
                "I truly enjoyed this course and felt surrounded by other students who wanted to learn Korean",
                "Strengths:   is one of the most supportive professors Ive had at Yale. Really great at answering questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more daily homework/opportunities for practice. I feel like my Korean wouldve improved if I were given daily assignments.",
                "This course is quite well-organized and ensures that everyone in the classroom is able to take part. Our speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills were always challenged with students constantly being put on the spot to participate. This class can be a little fast-paced, but its nothing that students won't get adjusted to and I would argue it makes for a better learning process."

I love going to this class every day and have met some of my best friends here in Korean. The workload is not very high and the grading is very kind but still requires you to work hard and learn. I hope I get to take more Korean classes in the future. If you are looking to take a new language, this is one you won't regret.",
