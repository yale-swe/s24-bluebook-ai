                "The ability to assess the surrounding political world in a new way, and the knowledge of why certain behavior patterns in politics play out the way they do.",
                "Honestly, I did not learn much. All the material was pretty basic, and we first covered it in reading, then during lectures, and then once again during the discussion section - it felt like a huge waste of time.",
                "Learned a great deal about the comparison between different politics by looking at different events and classifications of politics. It was a good introductory course into comparative politics.",
                "I learned a lot of different political science theories as well as how to better read an academic paper.",
                "I learned a lot about the behavior to states, nations, regimes, and citizens, and learned to not evaluate different countries on the same standard when it is necessary to look within a country at their socioeconomic and political structures.",
                "This course has taught me the fundamentals of political science. I really enjoyed the course material even though it was very theoretical. This course taught me to think more like a political scientist and open up my mind to different types of governments, regimes, institutions, and political behaviors. It involved a decent amount of historical overview and there were a lot of case studies.",
                "In this class, I gained much knowledge on the fluctuations and continuations of a wide range of countries, including the United States, as well as how they have chosen to interact amongst themselves or have been influenced by global movements.",
                "This class provided a very solid basis of the content of comparative politics. It was taught thoroughly and deconstructed the readings in a way which really made sure the students in the class understood its thesis and evidence.",
                "Awesome class. This was my first political science class ever and I loved it - lecture was incredibly engaging, and I felt every topic was somethifn new and exciting. I learned about political systems within countries, how elections work, why revolution takes place, different regime types and their implications",
                "I learned a lot of foundational concepts and terms that I didn't expect I would learn before taking this course. Now, because of this class I feel confident to compare different regimes across the world and classify them as democracies or dictatorships as well as understanding the spectrum states fall on in terms of how power and freedom is distributed. This was a great introductory course that I think was very helpful in understanding basic yet complex concepts about the world of political science.",
                "I thought this course was a great introduction to the study of comparative politics. Through readings and lectures, we also learned a lot about what it means to study political science and how we interact with data and empirical analysis.",
                "I became well-versed in the political processes interacting throughout the world. It was a foundational political science course that is a great starting point in this study.",

                "I don't think I learned very much.",
                "From this course, I gained a familiarity with basic concepts in comparative politics such as what a state is and how regimes change/affect things in a state. I also learned about the field of political science and poly sci research. This course also allowed me to practice writing for social science classes."

                "This course is incredibly good, with clear expectations for the assessments, useful Discussion Sections, and high-quality lectures. The last reflection assignment was poorly designed and confusing, but I'll let it slide.",
                "The sections and readings for this class were incredibly interesting, along with a very good textbook. However, the lectures were pretty boring and drawn out.",
                "strength --> length of detailed analysis\r\n\r\nweakness --> poor essay prompts, confusing, sporadic and seemingly irrelevant or overly specific which limited my ability to relate or provide any personal opinion",
                "Very engaging and interesting material; connected to current world events. I enjoyed not only learning in class but then applying it to current events and issues. Overall great class with little to no weaknesses. Not entirely clear on assignment expectations is the only weakness for this course.",
                "The strengths are the clear presentations and guidelines given for each week. The weakness are some of the readings, they felt too repetitive at times.",
                "This course covers broad base of important key ideas, terms, and readings, which I appreciate. I think the course could be improved by translating and the broad and sometimes abstract concepts to concrete policy examples.",
                "Strengths- the engaging course content, the organization, the interesting paper prompts (for the most part), and the freedom to write about a long list of countries. I also absolutely loved Professor Khan! She is a great lecturer. The format of the final exam (24-hour take-home) was very convenient. It felt like the professor was trying to be there for the students over the semester.  Also, many don't like this, but I really enjoyed it when the lectures helped explain the readings. However, some find it too repetitive. Depends on preference. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Khan spoke too quickly. Way too fast. It was often hard to catch up, especially when the lecture covered things that weren't in the readings. The lecture slides were really long, dull, and too wordy. It made it hard to listen to Khan since I would try to see what I can learn quickly from the slides. I really loved my teaching fellow, but overall, they felt a bit inexperienced in teaching. They know the material but are not the greatest discussion leaders. Lastly, I feel like the course tried to avoid the U.S. as much as possible. It is way too bad because I think it would have been really helpful to spend more time comparing the U.S. system and how things are done here to other countries.",
                "First off, I want to voice that this class was facilitated very well. I was always engaged in the material, and I think this was a result of the refreshing length of  class (a bit shorter than most) and the charismatic presentation and organization of topics. I also found myself learning a lot in section, for my TA was very much the same as the professor (Ekin). I don't really have any suggestions in terms of improvement besides the final exam. It was said that it could have been accomplished in 3 hours, however it took me the entire day. I think it could be made shorter or given two days instead of one.",
                "The course is taught very well and both Professor Khan and the TFs prioritize student feedback to better the course.",
                "Strengths - Professor khan is incredibly organized. Really values student input and feedback. Great content. Weaknesses - not many, but I thought the final was brutal. 24 hours and writing 4 essays in those 24 hours I wasnt expecting it to be as hard as it was but I spent 12 hours nonstop on it",
                "This course was great in that the readings were very helpful in understanding the deeper concepts, though the readings in the beginning were a bit long and I felt sometimes the additional reading in some of the chapters wasn't all that useful. I also liked having a discussion section to meet with and discuss what had been read in the readings. I think the lectures were interesting and I enjoyed having real world examples to pull from whenever a new topic was introduced.",
                "I think the content is interesting. The biggest weakness was that for the first assignment, the expectations/rubric for the class was not clear to me. After that first assignment, I had no issues with expectations. The final was supposed to only take 3hrs, but it too, me far more time. I do not know how somone could have finished the final in under three hours.",
                "A strength of the class was the clear discussion of different concepts and Professor Khan's explanations of political phenomena in the context of various global political events.",
                "The course is foundational, and it is fairly accessible for students with a limited background in politics. It is more difficult to engage with if the student is not well-versed in current global affairs.",
                "The course lectures were very helpful in elaborating on concepts we learned in the readings. I appreciated the ties to current and historical events. The readings were chosen well. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred fewer, longer papers. It often felt that there was not enough space to formulate a good argument in the papers, so it would be preferable to have a larger word count for each paper while reducing the number of papers assigned.",
                "Partially due to our professor's heritage, many of the countries used in examples throughout the course were Middle Eastern and North African. Since this is a comparative politics class, it would have been more useful to focus on how countries compare around the world, not just in those regions. I felt the course was greatly lacking in examples from Latin America (I only remember one example being used there, from Argentina) and Eastern Europe.",
                "Strength: lectures are well delivered, discussion sections are very helpful in organizing my thoughts, and essays and reflections are graded in a detailed manner, readings are interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: I do not really understand what my grader wants from my essays.",
                "My teaching fellow was very accessible in the course and was always willing to give feedback and ways for me to improve. I think the lectures and discussion sections often felt like a summary of the textbook readings, so I think that the class could be improve to go beyond the scope of readings. Additionally, we were required to write a discussion post with questions each week before our discussion section, but we almost never discussed the questions our classmates posted.",
                "Strengths: Course material was interesting, Professor Khan was very knowledgeable, workload was not bad\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were often just repeated in lecture (making either doing readings or going to lecture redundant), final was extremely long (10-12 page paper meant to take 3 hours!",
                "The open-note take-home final is amazing and as long as you follow the rubric/prompt for the papers you will do well. Also, since you can choose what nations to research for the papers, you can see how the material translates to the real world through countries you actually care about (which helps make the course engaging and even rewarding).\r\nThe readings were at times very long and dull but as long as you pay attention in class and take notes, you can get away with quickly skimming the readings; Prof Khan's lectures basically summarize the textbook anyway.",
                "The readings and lectures bolstered each other, although sometimes the readings were a bit much to keep up with each week.",
                "I felt that this course was far too analytical for a subject which claims to study human interaction in the political sphere. The material was focused far more on implementing theories which, most of the time, could be disproven or otherwise contradicted by anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of current events. The only major takeaway from this class for me was that trying to fit human interaction into broad data models would only result in gross misinterpretations of societal consciousness.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are well organized and easy to follow. The material wasn't always the most revolutionary, but I liked how we talked about current events to tie the simple concepts we were learning to interesting real-world trends. I also liked how the essay prompts encouraged you to take a deep dive into learning about a new country's political systems.\r\nWeaknesses: The paper word counts were far too short for the topics we were writing about. Having to boil a whole country's government structure into less than 1000 words was very difficult and required you to oversimplify a lot. Since the papers required so much research, I would have appreciated more space to write about what I had found, particularly niche/interesting points that I usually ended up having to cut. Alternatively, the word counts can stay as they are, but the number of tasks we were required to complete/sources we were required to cite in each paper should be cut down."

                "Not really. Especially if you took AP Comp Gov in high school - you will not learn much, please don't take this class. I am sure there are many more PLSC classes that are more engaging and will intellectually challenge you. People in my discussion section were not the brightest students at Yale I had ever met, and barely participated, and we went over and over the same few papers. This class was sooo boriiiing. On the other hand, you can put 0 work and still get A if you have any idea of comparative politics.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in politics and political systems you will love this class! Great class with great instructor!",
                "Yes I would recommend the course if they were willing to put in the time to do all of the required course work which is what really makes the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking to gain a broad understanding of the working of political systems on the whole, but not if you are looking for strong intellectual conversation or debate in political science.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about politics. If you're a polisci major, take this class as one of your requirements. But if you're not, then still take it but only if you are prepared to learn a lot of theories that often contradict each other. Sometimes it felt like it was hard to make any conclusions about the content material but overall it definitely opened my mind. Between the class structure, the staff, the material, and the workload (which is manageable but the readings can be an overkill sometimes), I think this is a really solid course! Not the best course you'll take at yale, but one you are sure to enjoy.",
                "Yes, this course was very enlightening for me, and I feel as if the knowledge I gained is useful for understanding other cultures and schools of thought, from those in power to those struggling to survive or be heard.",
                "Definitely! It was a very good overview of the foundations of comparative politics such as states, democracies, autocracies, electoral systems, identity and electoral violence; but it also required a certain degree of engagement and active evaluation of the material such that even on the rare days that I didn't learn a lot of substantial content in lecture, I would gain a deeper understanding of about to think about politics and consider different perspectives. Professor Khan is also a great lecturer! She explains complex concepts in a straightforward way and makes the class very engaging. Her selection of readings and other resources (podcasts, documentaries) was really diverse and well-chosenI felt like it was a good mix of more foundational texts dealing with core concepts, and more modern articles dealing with current issues (e.g. racial authoritarianism, how women are excluded from nationalist movements). The 5 papers and final take-home exam are definitely short enough to be very manageable. I actually appreciated how they forced me not to fall behind on doing the readings and understanding the concepts.",
                "Yes, but only if they are interested in taking subsequent political science courses. While the content is interesting, it is not interesting enough to take this class without needing its skills/content to be better prepared for more advanced political science courses.",
                "Absolutely. Improtant to understand basic government structures",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is clear they want to go into political science/major in it. For someone who isn't sold on majoring in political science I would sway them away from taking this course as I don't think it'd be as useful as it would for someone who is going into political science.",
                "I would recommend this class for any student interested in studying political science. It provided a broad overview of many different topics while focusing on certain concepts such as regime type and electoral institutions.",
                "I would with students interested in political science. However, I would not recommend this for students with mild interest. The assigned readings can be intense and monotonous for students who don't have a strong interest in the subject.",
                "Yes, if they're interested in theory and reading classic essays in comparative political theory.",
                "Yes!",
                "I felt that the class relied too heavily on the textbook and didn't always involve a lot of original thought, so I would likely not recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes, the course was interesting and not too overbearing.",
                "Yes, I think it is a good introductory course on comparative politics.",
                "Yes, it's fairly chill. As long as you take notes during lecture and follow the prompt/rubric for the papers you will do well. And the take-home final reduces so much pressure. Also, since you choose what nations to write your papers about, you really feel like you're learning and applying the concepts to the real world (which helps the course be engaging).  \r\n\r\nDoing all the hw readings can be overwhelming and frankly you don't need to as long as you pay attention during class (and skim over them to make weekly discussion posts).",
                "While I dont think this course was best fit for me, I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to have a introductory course into political science.",
                "This course, while worth taking if you're interested in Political Science, does not offer much of an intellectual challenge and focuses more on restating contradictory theses of other political theorists rather than developing the skills to understand and interpret data.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in taking an introductory political science course. The course is organized in a way that",
                "This is a great course for a first-year who is at all interested in political science. Outside of the actual material you will learn, I think the course gives you a great introduction to political science research, papers/writing, and vocabulary. For instance, one of the most helpful skills I gained from this course is how to read and understand a political science research paper. If you already have a familiarity with political science content as I did, then this class probably will not be very useful. Still, it has a manageable workload and I learned a couple of things so I do not regret taking it."
