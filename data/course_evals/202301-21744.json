                "I learned a lot about \"Western Art Music\" history from Beethoven through the mid-20th century. Having played this music seriously all my life it was an interesting experience to think more deeply about the historical connections between these composers.",
                "A LOVE for music history, and a vastly expanded knowledge of it. I understand many more musical references and genres when they are mentioned in other classes. Super important for me as musician in general.",

                "I learned so much in this class! I learned about important musical\/artistic eras such as romanticism, impressionism, minimalism, etc. I learned about the historical and artistic context for many of the pieces I already knew about, and I learned about new incredible pieces. I also learned how to right a good music review and how to analyze a piece of music in terms of form and harmony."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - conversation with Frances Pollock, engaging choice of material\r\nWeaknesses - at times felt not progressive enough in terms of angle of understanding the material particularly in section, would help to have more engaging and visual lectures as opposed to primarily auditory learning methods",
                "I think a more hands-on grading scheme (more assignments and quizzes) probably would have kept me more engaged and forced me to actually learn the material better.",
                "The lectures were extremely good, and it was so easy to take great notes. Sometimes it felt like the quizzes were pretty high-stakes, and I would have definitely preferred more frequent, smaller graded assignments to be part of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kreuzer is a great teacher. The course material is very interesting too, especially as we get into the 1870-1950sish period. Workload is not terrible.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not super interesting\/engaging always.",
                "I wish there was a better coordination between the 350 series. It felt like a big shift in vibe going from 351 to 352. For instance I liked basing the class off of the anthology in 351 more so than basing it off the textbook in 352",
                "Prof Kreuzer and the TAs are super approachable, knowledgeable, and so clearly dedicated to teaching their students. The strength of this class is the leminar format -- where the materials are taught in lecture style, but classroom attendance and participation, including active listening, kept me engaged.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kreuzer's lectures are extremely organized and easy to follow; each slide is clearly put together, and the work she has done to make score-analysis accessible (even for someone without a large music analysis background) is immense. The course is graded well and the feedback was helpful and valuable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 quizzes for a whole semester felt at times stressful. I think a model of 5 quizzes, whereby one could be dropped would be good. This serves the purpose of breaking up the material, giving everyone a better chance of success, and also (partially) avoiding the issue where people didn't study as much for the 3rd quiz.",
                "I loved this class and don't have major issues with it. My couples suggestions are related to having some more consistency between this class and Music 350\/351. Maybe it's a mistake to compare 352 to the other two classes--352 is quite different from the other two because it is much more focused on close musical analysis of harmony\/melody\/form in pieces. However, some consistency from someone like me coming from those classes would be nice.\r\n\r\n1. I would have loved if the listening quizzes had been shorter and there were more of them. Especially for the last quiz, it felt like there was SO MUCH content on it. Having more, shorter quizzes takes the pressure off of each individual one. For example, each quiz could have 2 listenings and 2 out of 3 short answers, and there could be 6 of them instead of 3. This does pose the issue of needing more section time to do them, but in 350 we did the quizzes at the beginning of class, which is a possible option. \r\n2. In terms of grading, 351 was nicer with partial credit. On one quiz in 352, I identified a piece incorrectly, and from what I remember, I did not receive any credit. In a similar situation in 351, I received partial credit because the things I said about the piece I THOUGHT it was were correct. This kind of partial credit would have been nice to receive. \r\n3. Finally, along these lines, some clearer expectations BEFORE the the first quiz would have been helpful, in particular av to the fact that we were supposed to focus solely on what we were HEARING and draw answers from that instead of regurgitating historical context that we had learned in class. 351 was always about regurgitating facts, so I personally was still doing this on the first 352 quiz."

                "Absolutely. Professor Kreuzer is amazing and will make you love music even more than you already do. Even if you see yourself as primarily a performer or music theory person, this course will absolutely be relevant to you because of how much many connections appear in music history.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to music majors, as the course provides excellent historical and analytical context for the Western musical trends of the past 200 years. However, for those without a background in music theory (such as myself), I would still highly recommend this course because of its fascinating content, but only if taken under the Credit\/D option; the listening quizzes and analytical assignments require a knowledge of music theory concepts that are, for the sake of time, not explained thoroughly in class.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you like classical music, yeah!",
                "Absolutely -- the course is super engaging and interesting. Each lecture is on a new composer (practically), so it goes quite well, but I love the idea of studying a composer and their style of music through the lens of one or two representative pieces. Sections were always engaging and interesting.",
                "Yes, with enthusiasm.",
