                "As the second intermediate level of French at Yale, this course secured my understanding of the French language to a level that I feel that I can comfortably continue my French education on my own. This is because the course helped me increase my French reading level to the degree that I am able to absorb information about the language through reading books instead of requiring a class environment. Additionally, after this course, I feel as though my conversational abilities in French have greatly increased and that I would be comfortable having conversations with any other French student and some native speakers.",

                "This course was well structured and very effective at teaching me French. I think the mix of media and ways that homework was assigned made the course helpful for making me more comfortable with all of the modes of French engagement. I think the learning in this course may have been a bit more enjoyable if some of the texts we engaged with were more historically appropriate. Specifically, the text \"Diversite\" featured incredibly un-nuanced descriptions of the relationship between French-colonized nations and their colonizers.",
                "Strengths: The way the course was organized allowed for us to learn the required tenses and grammar for the readings beforehand. In addition, the required presentations were a lot of fun to make, and it was wonderful to listen to others as well. The discussions on the material allowed for a lot of speaking practice as well. Finally, the choices for the rdactions were fun and allowed us to expand on the ways we write in French. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course did a wonderful job preparing us for more advanced French. I think the two things I would like to see are more related to the bi-weekly examinations. First, I wish there was more practice for the identification sections on the tests, as there was not a lot of material in the course packet to prepare for them.  Finally, I wish that there was a pause button on the test as it was sometimes was very hard to process and answer the questions in the allotted breaks.",
                "I thought that it was very valuable that we read multiple books about non-French francophone culture as well as watched movies concerning the same subject. Although this representation was appreciated, I felt as if it came too late in Yale's French curriculum. From the very beginning, Yale's French program should be teaching students about other french speaking cultures other than France. Especially due to the many people of color who take french at Yale because of their non-France related ties to the language, this representation is that more important. I will also say that the type of representation is very important. At times, even though there were movies or stories from different francophone cultures, they still perpetuated stereotypes about the cultures and did not provide a full and accurate view. These two issues must be remedied. Especially as the french language is one that has been used to oppress so many people of color over the world, it is extremely important that these voices and stories are given a lot of attention in our curriculum.",

It didn't feel as if we needed as many synchronous classes as we had and I feel as if too much time was spent on grammar, where it is easy to lose focus, where as conversation during the virtual space would have better served the class. I also feel as if breakout rooms could have better been used. This would have helped create a more cohesive class dynamic and allowed for more people to participate in class discussions.",
