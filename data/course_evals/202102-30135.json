                "I was able to develop my analysis skills throughout the course by reading many interesting texts and discussing them during our lessons. Furthermore, we had the chance to lead classes ourselves which allowed me to gain some kind of leadership skills.",
                "I have acquired knowledge of ten highly influential social theorists, spanning 300 years of history. For each of these theorists, this course provided my the ability to dive deep into their central beliefs through their most famous works. In group discussions, I have learned to apply century-old ideology to the modern-day. I have also learned to compare the works of theorists with striking resemblances in their beliefs despite not being born in the same century, and striking differences between theorists that were born in the same decade. In this course we are only assigned selections of readings, so my grasp of history and sociology is not yet wholistic, yet I feel much more prepared to face this topic (potentially in college) than I was prior to entering this course.",
                "I learned a lot about political philosophy and early sociological theory. My ability to critically analyze and evaluate arguments for sociological ideas was also pushed to its limit, ultimately making it stronger.",
                "This course provided an introduction to the some of the most influential thinkers and works of social theory, from the 17th to the 19th century. I gained skills in reading primary sources of political and sociological theory, thinking historically and contextualizing writers in their times. It was fascinating to discover how much of our modern social understandings can be linked back to ideas from a centuries ago which continue to be insightful."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n- Well-chosen texts to explore from\r\n- Low teacher to student ratio",
                "strengths - Professor Adams is amazing, papers are not too long & you have creative freedom; weakness - heavy reading load",
                "The pace of this course is both a strength and a weakness of this course. I feel that covering a few different theorists with drastically different writing styles is one of the greatest part of this course, but it means that discussions are usually quite rushed. If there was an offline discussion post of some kind that would allow us to follow-up our thoughts about theorists we covered in the first week, or someone else's comment that we did not have enough time to make, that would supplement the live discussions very well.",
                "The seminar format was very challenging, as it meant that everyone had to gain from the readings not only a basic awareness of the ideas of the authors but also (and even more importantly) an understanding of the arguments behind the ideas. I personally really enjoyed this level of rigor, as I think it forced me to critically engage with the ideas, accepting or rejecting them not on their apparent validity but on the merits of their author's arguments.\r\nI will say that I think I would have preferred slightly more breadth (at the cost of depth) with regards to the authors and ideas covered, but the roughly one-author-per-class format did make our discussion feel coherent.",
                "A major strength of this course was its small seminar format, allowing for in-depth discussions of the class material. Having a student discussion leader for most days was also very valuable, as students were encouraged to help each other work through  complicated works. One potential weakness of the course was a lack of time for situating the discussed thinkers and writers intellectually and historically. Although helpful lecture slides gave some background information, class time was mostly spend in discussion of the works themselves. One way of improving this might be to group the thinkers and works into larger \"units\" and spending some time at the end of each unit talking specifically about intellectual and historical context. That said, time is limited and this is not an intellectual history course."

                "Yes, the texts we learned in this course was very interesting and can become useful in the future.",
                "If you are majoring in Sociology, yes! As far as required courses go, it isn't so bad. If you aren't majoring in Sociology, you should only take this course if you're genuinely interested in the content. It is pretty dense, so you need to be motivated.",
                "Absolutely! I'm not sure how many high schoolers feel about taking class with people older than them, but I have definitely told my friends about how excellent the course is. When I explain how class progresses in a very non-stressful, engaging, and truly insightful way, they never believe me. The reading load is quite heavy (especially compared to the usual levels at my high school), but that is one of the unique appeals of this course.",
                "I really enjoyed this course, as I found it exciting to engage with the ideas of the authors in our discussions. At times, the lengths of the readings made it difficult to read through them as carefully as I would have liked, but ultimately they were manageable, usually taking me around 6 hours to complete. I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to put in the time needed to succeed.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in how thinkers have analyzed and understood society through history, and how their ideas have often helped to shape society into the present. Students interested in politics, social psychology, philosophy, history, and sociology might be especially interested in the works discussed, but I think all students would benefit greatly from delving into some of the intellectual foundations of contemporary western societies. Students will emerge from the class with a new set of tools for understanding the social world that they inhabit, and they might also come out of it with some new favorite thinkers (I know I did!)."
