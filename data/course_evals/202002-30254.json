   "comments": [
    "It was at 6am so that sucked.",
    "The exercises and assignments were fun, and they allowed students to incorporate their own style\/creativity in addition to implementing lessons from class. The class atmosphere was also relaxed and friendly--a good place for anyone without significant prior experience with the visual arts. Good exposure to art pieces through slideshows and a few videos. While it would have been nice to have readings that were more accessible for students who are new to art, class discussions helped clear a few concepts.",
    "Strengths: Alex is a very kind and engaging professor. He is very passionate about different forms of art and provides valuable feedback to students as they are creating art of their own. He assigned very engaging projects for students and I enjoyed them very much. No weaknesses."

    "Yes. Very good class. Very fun and good intro to art class.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn about adobe photoshop and illustrator and have no experience with adobe software tools, this is the class to take! The projects are very engaging and you will get valuable feedback from the professor.",
    "Yes. The course is fun and worthy taking. The group project is a highlight as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants an introduction to different art forms and techniques. The lectures provided examples of multiple artists and their work that informed the direction of the projects. The projects strengthened our understanding of these areas while giving us creative liberty. We were allowed to be experimental and creative with the projects which made them very fun to work on."
