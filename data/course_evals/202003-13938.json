I learned about all the ways reproduction is monitored, medicalized and affected by societal assumptions, from obvious ways like birth control to less intuitive things like access to assisted reproduction technologies. We also discussed the history of some of these practices, and the way different people have been excluded from progress in reproductive rights, or even ways reproduction has been weaponized to exacerbate the oppression of certain people.",

I also learned about the connections between culture, science, individualism, policies, and large institutions and how they all play a role how we view reproduction."

Not so much a weakness, but the readings are ESSENTIAL to get something out of this class, and the length of the readings may be daunting for some people even if they are genuinely interested in the material.",
                "I loved this class! It's all strengths Prof. Almeling is fantastic at facilitating discussion, the readings were almost all fantastic (and Prof. Almeling was extremely open to feedback on those readings so you're welcome, future seminar-takers), and the assignments were engaging and extremely reasonable. No weaknesses whatsoever.",
                "No weaknesses! Although some readings could be shortened a tad\r\n\r\nStrengths: The teaching was phenomenal. We created our own community in a zoom environment, and I think that is the biggest thing to be proud of. The class readings were interesting, discussions were engaging, and Professor Almeling was approachable and caring. I walked away a better person because of this class!",
                "Strengths: Well-organized---sometimes seminars can devolve into really abstract discussions, but Professor Almeling was always focused on helping students understand the course's main questions. This was a really enlightening class, and the readings tied in perfectly to the discussion without relying too heavily on remote details from the text. \r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",

Also, Professor Almeling was super accommodating with assignments and adjusting due dates in order to make all of our lives easier."

Not only is Professor Almeling well versed in the material and very excited to share her knowledge, she also remains dedicated to making sure students in her class take away information they can use for years to come."
