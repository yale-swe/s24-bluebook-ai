Every week I was blown away by the ways in which my past education and popular narratives regarding the Black Experience were a misrepresentation of what it means to live a Black Life.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The discussions were always thought provoking and insightful. I never walked into class (regardless of wether or not I did the readings) and walked out without a mind-blowing idea having been introduced to me by either a peer or the professor. This professor is also the kindest soul ever, they are really really understanding that life can be hard and are very fair with extensions. The class as a whole was a very welcoming environment, as a first year in this class I was very intimidated by my upperclassmen peers at first, but as the semester went on I felt very comfortable voicing my half flushed out ideas with the expectation that I would not be judged. I also really appreciated the demographics of this class. As this is a course surrounding Blackness, I wanted to hear Black voices but I was pleasantly surprised when a vast vast majority of the class were Black women. As a Black woman, I have never been in an academic setting where I felt so safe, represented, and understood. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were really dense, and sometimes this class could be a lot to handle if you have a massive workload outside of it. For people who are able to fully immerse themselves in readings, and dedicate time to a class, this is perfect but if not, it can be a bit challenging. I will note though, that the readings were always very fulfilling, it was just finding the time to read all of it that was the issue. This is class is also a very heavy class at times, a lot of important yet emotionally draining content is covered.",
                "Strengths: Class discussion was well-organized so that everyone got the chance to share their insights. I liked that we got the chance to ask questions on Canvas and then answer those questions in class. \r\nWeaknesses: The grading distribution was a bit confusing, 40% of the grade was a 5-page paper and 15% was three 3-page papers. I felt like the majority of my effort and improvement in this class happened while writing close reading papers.",
                "I really liked the novels and secondary readings that were assigned, the in-class format of discussion and activities, and appreciated the frequency of and feedback from the CREs because it really felt like I was learning in a very concrete way. However, I really did feel like there was too much reading assigned. At times this prevented me from being able to sit with the material as I typically would like to.",
                "We had a very strong, diverse syllabus which included a depth of topics and authors. The organization of the class itself was fantastic, giving us ample opportunities to have large group discussions, partner work, presentations, and independent work. I was very engaged with this course all throughout, all thanks to Prof. Smith's facilitation.",
                "The strength is the material is interesting the weakness there is a lot of material to cover and classes are quite long"

                "I absolutely absolutely would. I loved this class so much, it was a lot of work but so worth it. The professor provided the perfect space to discuss the course content.",
                "Absolutely. The readings were smartly organized around themes each week, and all of the books Smith chose were so engaging I sometimes forgot they were assigned for a class. Smith was very helpful during office hours and created a brave class environment where people could work through their confusion or excitement about the course content.",
                "I absolutely would!! I think that within this course, we had very important conversations regarding Blackness and different aspects of Black Life all in a very safe learning environment cultivated by Professor Smith.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Black life and Black study in any capacity. Professor Smith is absolutely wonderful, they give such great feedback which actually helps you become a better writer and reader, and the classroom environment is so positive and supportive. It is a great place to explore new ideas and curiosities with your peers.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have time to read a book a week! The professor is very kind and understanding!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to someone who would like an understanding of how concepts like motherhood and disability are defined against and through blackness. The content draws from seminal texts, including writing from Hortense Spillers and Frantz Fanon, and classic novels, including Meridian and Beloved. While the professor tied each text to specific weekly themes, it was clear that they were relevant to past and future topics. Although it has difficult (heavy) subject matter, it is well worth the time and energy it takes to parse through the challenging material."
