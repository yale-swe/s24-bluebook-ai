                "I've learned so much throughout this course. Through the use of case studies, we've learned essential and applicable truths about leadership. We've studied why education policy change is so messy and often difficult to make, and broke it down the way superintendents and teachers in the real world do. Most importantly, we learned that context matters, and that in order to create a solution you must first deeply understand and identify the problem. \r\n\r\nWhile we were doing this coursework, there was an ongoing independent group project, where we choose a complicated education problem and ultimately propose a solution to it. It was super hard but really worth it!!",
                "I learned about how change and transformation works in educational spaces throughout the US.",
                "This class provides a really good study of the complex factors and theories involved in educational reform and policy. I learned how case analysis works and how to apply theories to real-world situations.",

                "This course was incredible! I learned so much about how schools and educational systems function and how so many levels of commitment and research go into ensuring best possible education for students. We learned how schools can go wrong but also how schools can be significantly improved to increase equity.",
                "I learned a TON in this course. I learned not only about the intricacies of the American education system, but also how to think about problems and problem solve more effectively.",
                "You basically learn why leadership, change, and improvement in education is complicated. The course is case study based, so each week is a very specific example of a problem, and as a result you walk away with a broad understanding of current issues in education.",
                "I learned so much about theories of leadership and different ways to implement, plan, and analyze change. I learned how to write case memos and work on distilling my thinking and differentiating between what a root cause is versus what are symptoms that perpetuate a problem. Most importantly I left with new ways to think about change and to be excited about it despite the many pitfalls and unknowns that come with change.",
                "I learned to look at issues from many different facets; I would enter the class with an idea of a solution to the case study of the week, and by the end of the class, that solution would get blown up. I always left class going then what is the best solution? and my thinking would continue outside the classroom.",

            "comments": [
                "The absolute strength of this course is Prof. Lemons. He is so knowledgable and is truly an expert in education. Most importantly, he fosters a community of buy-in and psychological safety, so you end up learning a lot from your peers too. He set high expectations, and the class community and learning we do equips you to reach that expectation, even if its hard. You become intrinsically motivated to reach it! \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is the intense workload. It all feels reasonable, expect for the case analysis that ends up being an isolated project. The only thing I would change about the course is removing the case analysis, all the rest is amazing!",
                "Could be improved by changing the case analysis. The final projects take up more time each week than he realizes I think, so the case analysis on top of that just sort of added stress instead of adding learning.",
                "During class, I really enjoyed this class. We had interesting discussions, approached problems from a variety of angles, and looked at education from a whole range of levels. I think the structure of this class was interesting and the class time allowed for good participation and development of thought. The main weaknesses of these courses that I can think of have to do with the assignments. First of all, many of the instructions were confusing, making it difficult to understand what was expected, and feedback was also often vague, making it hard to improve throughout the semester. Additionally, the workload of the course was not super spread out throughout the semester. This is not something necessarily easily changed, but important to know for students who are planning their course loads.",
                "I loved our class environment. The pedagogy was engaging and gave everyone an opportunity to share their ideas in class. The group project was fun and unlike any other assignment I have done at Yale!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignment instructions were often unclear. Workload is also pretty high compared to other ed studies seminars",
                "The course content is very interesting. Weekly case studies are a very effective way at immersing oneself in the topic of the week. However, while Professor Lemons is very conscious about his teaching style, oftentimes we fall short at being able to rigorously dive into a topic. Whether a product of time or structure, I felt there should have been time built into class for the group projects, while still not having enough time to discuss each week's case.",
                "It is a great course! I honestly wouldn't say there are any weaknesses. The readings and discussions are incredibly engaging and so interesting. This course was a pleasure.",
                "Professor Lemons is a great professor and I really liked how he structured and organized class, especially grounding each class in a case. One way the class could be improved would be having clearer directions for the final project in terms of what is to be expected in developing the initial problem to solve and topic. Additionally the grading rubric for the weekly memos could be clearer.",
                "This course was really well structured to facilitate learning! My only suggestion for improvement is making the workload slightly less. I think all the assignments towards the final project were crucial but the case analysis was not.",
                "Dr Lemons is a great professor and the course is very well-structured so you learn a lot, but the biggest weakness is that the workload is way too high and you have no choice but to prioritize quantity over quality.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lemons is so engaging, the seminar really flies by (to demonstrate Professor Lemons' expertise, energy, and dedication) and the cases are all really interesting and relevant! \r\nWeaknesses: This is a bit personal but I wish I had done the case analysis assignment sooner. I also think some of the directions for assignments could be a bit clearer.",
                "Professor Lemons is an incredibly engaging professor, and I always felt like I contributed something to the classespecially since he employs some cold calling in the class. I also loved the collaborative nature of the classroom.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lemons is amazing and this is the most engaging seminar Ive ever taken and really pushed our thinking. The final panel/exhibition of learning at the end of the class was such an amazing experience as well \r\nWeaknesses: Pacing of class sometimes\r\nspends too much time on the background of the case, I wish we spent more time talking about potential (and actual) solutions. Also, so many graphic organizers that were difficult to distinguish from each other"

                "Among the best, if not the best course I've taken at Yale. 1000% worth taking. In the first day of class, I learned more than I had in some other classes over an entire semester. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",
                "Yes! Professor Lemons makes it a joy to show up every day to classthe material is interesting, relevant, and worth the workload!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to Ed Studies students and people interested in educational policy and reform. It fosters a really good classroom community and I learned a lot about the actual ways that education and education policy works in the US. Some of the assignments were annoying, but nothing was undoable, and Prof. Lemons is great.",
                "Yes, definitely! Great class for those interested in education studies. I liked the case-study format, and the class was a great way to practice analyzing and making decisions about educational issues",
                "Yes! Professor Lemons has so much knowledge to share. The cases are cool, too.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this class if the topic sounds interesting to you! It is so fun and you get to learn so so much! This class is so engaging and you really get invested in these issues and topics over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes, I found the readings to be really interesting and I always loved coming to class to discuss the cases! It's a very accessible EDST class in case you have only taken one or two classes and is more practical in terms of learning about education problems, schooling, and education leadership, rather than learning about education theories.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Prof. Lemons is really really engaging, and this course got me thinking about the education system in ways I never have. Favorite course taken at Yale. Totally recommend.",
                "Yes! But please know that there is an INSANE amount of work (like wayyy too much) especially during Reading Period. The weekly 2 page memos are manageable, but when the group project starts, youre expected to do extensive research and meet with your group on your own time, and the main piece of feedback you get is to keep reading when you already have reading and writing to do for the memo and to turn in the group project components. Then, during finals, we had FOUR large assignments: the big presentation showcase night with the invited superintendents, a group 10 page final paper about the group project, an individual 10 page paper on one of the case studies, and then a 6 page individual reflection on the semester. Also, the grading seemed quite arbitrary at times. That being said, putting in that much work also means you get a lot out of the class, so even though I think the workload should be cut in half, it does force you to do some deep thinking. Also, if youre apprehensive about such a big group project like I was at first, it turns out that the project was one of the strengths of the class and the best one Ive ever done in many years of schooling. So yes, take the class! But be prepared for a lot (of work but also learning).",
                "I would absolutely!!! Especially if you are interested in ed studies and policy in education. The final project is such a tangible and exciting moment to work on creating real policy and using the skills and research from class to present to actual education leaders!",
                "100% and if not this specific class, any class with Professor Lemons. Hes one of the most understanding and engaging professors Ive ever had, and he really takes time to give specific feedback to your assignments.",
                "Yes, absolutely"
