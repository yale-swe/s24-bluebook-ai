                "A lot of busy work for this class but generally helpful for learning spanish. Some assignments felt very high school though. Wish a little more though went into how best to learn new material.",
                "I think the activities can sometimes be a bit much and I personally did not find a lot of value in the unit discussing art, I think the course does a good job of helping students better understand both the language of Spanish and the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries.",
                "The strengths are that it really helps you to learn spanish quickly. You are practicing so often that your growth is pretty rapid. The weakness is being cold-called in class sometimes, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Also, there is a lot of content really fast so you need to keep up.",
                "Strengths are certainly the course organization, with everything organized week by week in the modules tab. This way, even with occasional lack of clarity on instructions because of the language barrier, I always knew what we were supposed to be doing. A weakness of the class was its location, in the Bass basement. Especially in a class that meets 4 times a week, being in the Bass basement was sincerely unideal. Another weakness may be the length of the asynchronous activities on asynchronous days. These would often take longer than the class period would have and sometimes put me behind in my other classes.",
                "This course was very strong in that my Spanish has drastically improved. However, I don't recommend hosting it in Bass Library where I once couldn't attend class because of an ID problem.",
                "Some assignments should be reviewed to determine whether theyre really worth our time.",
                "This course was well-organized and offered an extensive learning experience of Spanish. However, it was very overwhelming to the point where I found things counterproductive. Not everyone in the class was at the same level, and some students had been learning Spanish for years longer than other students, but there wasn't much put in place to minimize these gaps in understanding.",
                "Strengths - Interesting material taught through engaging methods.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some assignments seem to provide little benefit to the student."

                "Yes, but it is very tough. L2 is known to be quite rigorous and this is the case. But you WILL learn Spanish in this class. It is a lot of work and quite difficult to keep up at some times but you will absolutely learn to speak Spanish and take important steps toward fluency.",
                "Yes, as it is well taught and teaches you valuable lessons related to language learning.",
