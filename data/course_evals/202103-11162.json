This class helped me to get more creative with my writing, to experiment with the language and the way I can use it. I also really improved my oral communication skills thanks to the small class size and seminar/discussion format.",
                "Vastly improved my own writing through learning about the writing techniques of a variety of contemporary authors, and in sharing with and hearing from the class. Learned backgrounds for particular authors, and the histories of different genre-specific movements. Developed techniques for writing in a huge variety of forms through unique assignments and prompts that forced me to challenge myself.",

                "I learned how to write short stories , use dialogue, and mimic well-done short stories by Spanish authors. We studied a lot of modern concepts like antipoesa that allowed for more creative freedom.",
                "I became better at expressing creative thoughts verbally and in writing. I gained reading comprehension and greater knowledge of spanish speaking authors.",
                "Thinking and writing creatively. I learned to read and write poetry and short stories, and I improved my spanish writing.",
                "I developed both my Spanish speaking/listening/presenting skills in this course and especially my Spanish writing skills. The feedback I received from both Profesora Jordn and my classmates during the workshops (amazing parts of class!) helped expose me to different perspectives and learn how to improve my writing in a way that both expressed the ideas that I wanted to convey and clicked with the audience. On top of creative writing skills, I gained knowledge about major writers from the pieces we analyzed and the presentations we heard about them from Profesora Jordn.",
                "I learned so much in this course! My facility with Spanish greatly improved, I learned to write fiction, and my creative writing became so much stronger. We wrote in and analyzed many different literary styles and were introduced to some amazing authors and pieces of writing."

                "Strengths: The readings for this class are so interesting and fun. They covered a wide variety of cultures, time periods, genres, and tones and were always a joy to discuss in class. Professor Jordan is absolutely amazing and always knew how to stimulate the conversation and help us to understand deeper elements of the texts. We had lots of freedom with the assignments and always got super helpful feedback on our first drafts. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The only weakness was that the syllabus was sometimes unclear or would reference a text that we didn't have access to. We often needed clarification on what the homework would be.",
                "Strengths: Maria is a truly one of a kind teacher!! She is incredibly thoughtful, caring, and kind, and looks out for each individual student. She knows how guide a class through a discussion and engage everyone, and build a friendly environment. She has an expansive knowledge of Spanish literature and truly illuminating comments for all the works we read.",
                "Its a great course if you want an intensive curriculum based around improving your literary criticism skills. If youre looking for a gut, this isnt it. Profesora Jordan did a fantastic job at facilitating discussion and making every student feel welcome. Our class developed a great peer to peer relationship.",
                "There is not a single weakness. The strength is the professor. I wish every professor at Yale was like Mara. So caring, so knowledgeable, so supportive. Take any of her classes if you can, I can guarantee you it will be one of your favorite classes at Yale! I also love how she changed the syllabus as we knew each other better to accommodate everyone and fulfill everyone's expectations, covering a wide range of material taking into account everyone's interests.",
                "If you have mostly taken instructional Spanish classes, this course is a great opportunity to apply your knowledge in a creative space. It feels really empowering to produce creative work that you are proud of in a non-native language.",
                "I love we were allowed so much creative freedom. I also loved sharing our stories in class. Some of the lectures on poetry toward the end were a bit tedious... it would have been fun to do a project involving all the authors or writing in the style of our favorite author from class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Jordan is the kindest and most invested professor I have ever had at Yale. She put so much thought into reading all of our work and was understanding when we needed extra help or extensions. I really enjoyed all the readings selected for the class and reading my peers writing. One strength was the group of students itself- it's a lot of fun when people are engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: You shouldn't expect to improve your grammar and overall proficiency much in this class because the content of the work is much more important that your syntax and grammar errors. The poetry unit felt overly long but I don't like poetry.",
                "Great readings and fantastic assignments. Sometimes it was a little confusing what we had to turn in and when.",
                "Strengths: Profesora Jordn, the feedback from Profesora Jordn, and the workshops!! I found her comments and feedback from workshops very helpful in developing as a writer and learning how to best tell my stories in Spanish. The setup of the class with one day of literary analysis to learn methods, techniques, and have exposure to how different genres of creative writing are in Spanish and then having a chance to put them in practice with writing and workshopping is perfect. I loved how eager everybody was in participating in class; I have taken some Spanish courses where few people jumped in but the seminar setup really was conducive to learning. I genuinely loved this class and would take another like it in the future. I liked how I could also reach out to Profesora Jordn without problem; she was always so excited and willing to speak with me about both literature and writing!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I would say that the workload was a lot at times, with the written pieces due the day before class and then having blog posts and readings on top of that. However, Profesora Jordn was very understanding when other courses or commitments interfered with our ability to hand in assignments on time. I would have also liked to switch up the groups we worked in a bit more, so that we would be able to hear the perspective of other students, although that also happened in class when we all shared our ideas with everybody. For the poetry unit, I think it would be useful to include more poetry samples that are longer in the mix as well. Overall, these are minor, and I really really don't have complaints about the course."

Plus, you're really missing out if you never get to have Professor Jordan!!",

                "YES! TAKE THIS CLASS! Or any other class with Mara. Best professor I've had at Yale. She creates such a magical space to learn. She's the best in her field and she's also a wonderful person.",
                "Yes! If you enjoy creative writing (or have never done it but are passionate about it) and enjoy Spanish this is a really supportive space in which to learn and practice writing alongside others.",
                "Yes!! Maria is an incredible professor and any writer will love this class. It is unlike any other!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student that enjoys reading and writing in Spanish. I was intimidated at first because I am not a native speaker but the professor is so encouraging and will push you in ways that are helpful.",
                "Yes!! I did not think I was good at creative writing and this course completely changed my perspective on that. I found a love and appreciation for poetry.",
                "YES! Everybody at Yale should take a creative writing course at least once. Creative writing in Spanish presents you a novel experience with writing than what you are used to in English (if you are L2 or heritage Spanish and not a native speaker). It's a challenge not only with writing but organizing and transforming your mentality to one in another language and culture. I always find writing in Spanish liberating, although it isn't easy, and find that I am better able to convey my thoughts in another language than I can in English. This is because I have to slow down, take the time to actually think about what I want to say and figure out how to best say it. In English, I quickly and sloppily jot down anything that comes to mind, but in Spanish, I take the time to search for synonyms and appropriate words that will best suit the type of theme, plot, character development, and moral I am going for. In the end, when you see all that you have created with your own hands (and with the enriching comments of Profesora Jordn and your classmates), there is a feeling of satisfaction that is unmatched. You will also have a polished portfolio of various kinds of Spanish creative writing pieces as sample works for any future endeavors.  Long story short: if you're thinking about taking this course, take it! It would be amazing if this course was the introductory course for other, specialized creative writing courses in the department as well -- there is an energy and class dynamic particular to creative writing courses that simply CANNOT be match in technical/analytical essay-focused or cultural-focused language courses.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! I think it is an amazing opportunity to learn Spanish and creative writing and to make friends."
