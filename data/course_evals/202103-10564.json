            "comments": [
                "Strengths \r\n- really cool experiments in theory (anesthetizing/shocking worms to see their nerve responses, working with grasshoppers and flies, cutting out a tiny nerve in a frog leg, etc) \r\n- they seem really chill with grading/scoring the lab notebooks (overall, just a much more chill lab class than any other I've taken)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- the experiments/equipment never actually end up working, so you have to just stay there for 4 hours fiddling with stuff/waiting for one of TAs to help you (even though they don't know how to do it successfully either lol), oftentimes just to get no data...can be very frustrating/boring during those 4 hours per week",
                "While the lab was very interesting and allowed us to study a variety of different neurobiological processes, it was very reliant on all of the equipment working (which was often not the case). So, a lot of time in lab was spent sitting and waiting for one of the TAs or Prof. Keshishian to come look at the setup, and even then, the recording would often not work. Therefore, it was hard to accomplish all the goals for the assigned lab in a given week, which became frustrating when trying to put together the lab notebook (where we have to write our observations/discussion for the lab). If all the pieces of equipment were tested before lab by the TAs, then lab might run more smoothly and this course would be more enjoyable.",
                "I just looked at my transcript, and there are no other classes I have taken that are worse than this class. It is a complete waste of time to come in to lab, try to get an experiment working, and then leave without getting any data and have to get data from classmates. Out of the eleven labs that we did, my lab partner and I obtained usable data from just TWO of them. If most of the students cannot get the labs to work, I think there needs to be serious change to the curriculum. I understand that scientific experiments don't work every time in the real world, but they SHOULD in a lab class that I am taking for credit.\r\n\r\nOne thing that made the class inefficient was spending two hours watching the professor demonstrate the lab that we were doing, then doing it ourselves. I think this wasted a lot of time and it would have been better if he did the demonstrations while we were simultaneously working on our experiments.",
                "Strengths were the ability to work and dissect with various animals such as grasshoppers, worms, frogs, and flies. Weaknesses were that the class rarely was able to conduct complete experiments, we rarely were able to obtain data unless the professor came and did the experiment for a group.",
                "The ideas and experiments we are theoretically supposed to do are interesting however, they rarely work or students do not get to the interesting part because dissections or other preparatory steps take so long.",
                "This class was very interesting, however it was difficult at times due to time constraints / exhaustion. After a full day of classes, a technically difficult lab like this one was difficult to complete correctly. There was also a lot of confusion between the TAs and what we were supposed to be doing. The class itself was an incredible experience and it was well sized - one lab partner to carry out experimental procedures was perfect and the procedures were well explained and relevant to class material. \r\n\r\n* I think PHYS 181/171 should be a pre-req",
                "When Haig teaches the method in class, he would usually go through it all by himself and then let the rest of us do it. I think it would be more useful if he stepped through the method with us so that we wouldnt forget how to do earlier stages of the experiments. Also, we do the readings in preparation for the quiz, then Haig would essentially give a recap in the lab class on the reading for about an hour. This felt redundant and not very interesting, so it could be removed to save us an hour, or he could go more in depth with different material.",
                "Overall, it was a good course, but the main weakness/most frustrating thing was the variability of the equipment working and therefore how long we spent in lab. It's also not their fault, but because the TAs often didn't know what was wrong with the equipment, they would walk away to try to help someone else after not being able to fix ours. This wasn't held against us, and data sharing was allowed, but it was unfortunate to continually experience.",

                "If you're looking for a pretty easy/low workload/good grade in a neuroscience lab, sure...but just know that the stuff won't work, and it will not be a particularly fun time during those 4 hours lol",
                "It isn't a bad lab because you do get to see very cool neurobiological findings in real life. But, it can definitely be frustrating at times.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you need a lab course for the neuroscience major, take literally any other class. It's not worth it for the frustration that you face during the course. Keeping the lab notebook/writing lab reports isn't too much work though, especially if you keep up with it every week and don't backload it.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in Neurobiology and want a hands-on experience. If you take this lab along side the Neurobiology lecture course, they do not align at all and does not make a huge difference. Be prepared to not get data for most experiments and leave the lab after 5 hours with nothing.",
                "Not particularly just because nothing ever works so it is particularly frustrating.",
                "I think soI took it because I wanted hands on experience in neurobiology lab techniques, as my experience is mostly computational. I definitely got that, and have learned that i dont want to do experimental work that much, but it was good as a learning experience.",
                "Overall, it was a good course, that was relatively uncomplicated. If you don't like formal lab reports, this will probably be a good class for you, as the assignments are just quizzes at the beginning of lab on lab manual and reports. These reports are done in a composition notebook, with print outs of the readings you got in lab. However, the main weakness/most frustrating thing was the variability of the equipment working and therefore how long we spent in lab. It's also not their fault, but because the TFs often didn't know what was wrong with the equipment, they would walk away to try to help someone else after not being able to fix ours. This wasn't held against us, and data sharing was allowed, but it was unfortunate to continually experience. This class, unlike almost every other lab I've taken at Yale, did not feel like more than a full credit of work and the workload felt fair. A good class if you can get past the frustration of the time in lab (and have a good lab partner).",
                "I think it was really cool, but I would probably not recommend this course because it is very tedious and overall not that rewarding.",
