   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the history behind the theory we have now.",
    "generous critical reading - a crucial skill for social studies majors!  how to analyze visual pieces and primary sources for theory; how to identify and analyze theory not expressed through colonially-defined \"Theoretical\" texts",
    "I learned so much from this course. Roderick is such an intelligent professor and scholar and learned so much from him. This was my first course in queer studies and politics and know I feel as if I have enough knowledge about the various aspects of queer studies to take higher level classes. More relaxed options to an intro queer studies course.",
    "I learned so much about the less-touted histories of the queer liberation movement. We also spent a lot of time dabbling in various themes and issues throughout the semester. The course was at times influenced by others students' interests, allowing us to engage with topics that bared personal significance and explore nooks and crannies of the theoretical field we were functioning within. The course made me really mindful of the legacies that came before us, the way contemporary culture celebrates these narratives (or doesn't), and I developed a larger appreciation for queer art and its social significance.",
    "I was able to study multiple primary documents from mainly queer POC authors on the subject of queer and trans politics, with a focus on organizing\/activism. I learned many terms, concepts, and histories that aid me personally.",
    "I feel like most of all this course re-taught me how to read, in the sense that it helped me develop an entirely new way to approach materials (particularly primary sources) that I am going to use for the rest of my academic career.",
    "Professor Ferguson guided us through a wonderful selection of primary source material and contemporary critical works related to queer and trans political history. As valuable as the material itself, however, were the reparative hermeneutics that he consistently encouraged us to practice. The critiques we developed were more trenchant for being as recuperative and fine-grained as possible.",
    "A much deeper and richer understanding of the complexity, contradictions, and multidimensionality of queer communities, organizations, and politics."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: we read a lot of really important works that are often referenced in other wgss classes but not assigned as often\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "Excellent teaching of material, analysis, and skills; incorporation of primary source materials and archive work; active class engagement (small class size); personal and well-sized and timed assignments; strong class community; EXCELLENT syllabus in terms of intersectional content and form.",
    "The course was a structured like a discussion course and discussion were very lively and interesting because of Professor's and student engagement. The organization of the course could be improved. There were various moments in the semester when I was unsure what were reading or going to be discussing in the class.",
    "The class felt open to everyone for discussion. My ideas were furthered not just by the amazing professor, but also by the knowledge of my peers. Every session was extremely engaging.",
    "The course was fantastic, the syllabus was wonderful and I really appreciated the mix of primary\/secondary written sources and visual media. I was often moved to tears from how amazing some of the materials we looked at were. Dr. Ferguson is a fantastic professor, literally one of the best teachers I have ever had."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The instructor is great and the readings are really interesting and varied (sometimes we looked at art or watched documentaries so it wasnt all reading).",
    "YES! this is an excellent class and fills a much needed gap in the WGSS curriculum re (a) intersectional histories and approaches to queer theory (b) learning to read theory that does not present as Theory and primary sources and (c) independent artivism work. With a combination of film, poetry, visual arts, novels\/literature, and academic work the course paints a picture of the 1980s in the U.S. too often neglected of skimmed over in WGSS curricula.",
    "Yes. Great fifth class and learned a lot. Very fulfilling class to take as a queer person.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Such a fantastic learning experience, was really valuable to be able to contribute to the curriculum of the class. The material covered was both familiar at some points, and super exploratory at others. The readings really broadened my thinking and the writing opportunities were both fun\/imaginative and challenging me to think in different and more radical ways. Such a fantastic class.",
    "YES! The readings for this class have helped me refine my politics as an organizer. I recommend it to anyone at any level of knowledge with identity, trans, POC, etc politics.",
    "Yes, 100%, especially if you are interested in queer\/trans social movements\/issues. This course is wonderful and challenging without being overwhelming, which was a breath of fresh air.",
    "Yes - Professor Ferguson is compassionate, witty, and excellent at fostering community among his students. His generosity is evident not only in the care he extends to his students but also in his intellectual practices, which are citational, relational, and recuperative. He is invested in ensuring that his students read closely and in ways that are generative rather than reductive of meaning - i.e. queerly. All for very little time\/effort - we never had to read more than 30 or so pages for class. Do yourself a favor!",
    "I cannot recommend this course to another student enough!! This is the most impactful course I have taken during my time at Yale. Professor Ferguson has given queer life and discourse on this campus such a gift by teaching this class, giving students the opportunity to learn and engage with a history that has been denied them. Everyone who can take it should.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students interested in queer history, politics, and art, or more generally in organizing and activism history. The course touched on moments of queer history that I had never before been able to encounter in the classroom, and did so in a meaningful, expansive, and hopeful way. Professor Ferguson is a phenomenal teacher and scholar, and he made this class a phenomenal experience."
