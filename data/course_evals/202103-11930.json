                "Strengths  Cosmin knows the material incredibly well, is fantastic at explaining, and is super understanding towards his students. This is also super refreshing if you're used to analysis courses with painstaking epsilon-delta proofs, since this class operates at a fairly high level (a lot of the results are asymptotic behavior, and there are no shortage of geometric proofs). The homework is also very well written! Honestly, no weaknesses come to mind. I think due to the nature of Math 345, this class likely won't be offered the same way again, but if it somehow is, take it!!",
                "Cosmin is a great professor and he always finds ways to simplify proofs. The homeworks are difficult and engaging.",
                "This course was well organized and the content was interesting.",
                "Strengths: content is both very interesting and very approachable. Weakness: it's not actually a modern combinatorics course.",
                "Main strength of the course was the instructor. Cosmin was excellent. He always did the most to make sure we were following along / enjoying the class.",
                "The worst weakness of this class was the time of meeting; 9 AM is way to early to be fully operational. \r\nThe greatest strengths of this class, on the other hand, were Cosmin and the way he designed the problem sets. Cosmin was always available for anyone who needed any kind of help and/or accomodations. He is a brilliant teacher and always made sure that the students learnt and enjoyed the materials. For many of the PSets, he basically took a consequential paper and divided it up in problems with helpful clues along the way. As a result, its quite amazing and fullfilling to work on those PSets. I am not exaggerating when I say that I once spent a solid half an hour explaining to a girl at a frat why I love Cosmin's PSets so much. You can't lose by taking this class. (Well, you might lose your morning sleep!)"

                "Take this class!!! If discrete geometry sounds at all interesting to you, you seriously won't regret it. The workload is pretty manageable, and you learn about some of the most recent results in the field.",
                "For sure! We covered a lot of interesting math, and the pace of the course was good enough to learn a lot, but not so much that I felt overwhelmed. Cosmin is also an awesome professor, he made going to class at 9 twice a week somewhat bearable.",
                "What struck me about this class is how different the thinking required for discrete math is compared to the kind of thinking required for analysis. It is important to be good at both types of thinking. They complement each other. No matter what field of math you like best, learning the type of thinking required for discrete geometry is important. Cosmin does a great job of teaching this type of thinking.",

                "Highly recommend. Who cares if your not interested in modern combinatorics, take it if cosmin is teaching. You will learn to love math a little more.",
