                "Pain",
                "I learned a lot about cell biology, specifically cell membranes, the RER, Golgi, actin, and microtubules. We also read scientific papers that represented some of the key discoveries relevant to each week's topic.",
                "Learned how to synthesize information from notes into pset answers.",
                "I learned so much about cell bio in this class. I learned about a bunch of organelles. I found it fascinating to really begin to think about why things happen from a structural and chemical standpoint, not just memorizing that something does happen. This course was really helpful in getting me to think like that. There was also a lot of focus on research methods for discovering certain things, which is really helpful for people to understand how to conduct effective research.",
                "none. this class is horribly taught providing very little information and support for students. the lecturer uses vocabulary that most students literally have no clue what any of what he is saying means. most students don't have the technical training/vocabulary to even understand half of the words he says its way to high level and dry vocabulary for an intro class.  how are you teaching about \"life\" on a freaking powerpoint slide show and charging 5000 for a  class. no type of interaction or anything or ways to apply understanding all we get are packets and frantically looking for answers in the slides. terrible experience all around. usually huge gaps in class. some ppl are getting 100's and others are getting 50's so it looks like the average is a 75 but that is a wrong representation. overall terrible all around.",
                "I think I gained the skills of being able to work together with peers to discuss complex topics. I do not think I gained a huge amount of knowledge of biology because I had never taken AP Biology, so this course was very high-level in my opinion and did not allow for basic understandings of the content first. The class mentioned a lot of topics that are relevant in the research I do and I think it's good to go into techniques but they were breezed over too quickly for me to comprehend what was happening.",
                "I learned about specific experimental techniques that pertain to cell bio as well as the mechanics of complex biological systems.",
                "I learned a lot about cell biology, particularly about protein pathways, microtubules, mitosis, cell signaling, and more.",
                "I learned a lot about methods in cell biology. I learned how to read a scientific paper and discuss it with peers. I learned how to take biology concepts and apply them to novel situations.",
                "I was exposed to a wide swath of information about a specific group of topics in cell biology. I learned how to prioritize which information I needed to know but did not gain a broad base of understanding or learn most of the course content.",
                "I learned a lot from this class, but the work is ridiculous.",
                "Reading primary research papers, techniques for studying cellular biology, complex mechanisms in cellular biology (membranes, ER, Golgi, etc)",
                "I developed a greater understanding of the mechanics of key functions in cell biology: protein synthesis, cell movement and motility, etc. I also learned how to more quickly and effectively read research papers.",

                "I learned a bit about cell biology, but mostly I was very confused.",

                "Learned hoe to read a research paper, and learned how to think about science from the point of view of trying to solve problems. Did not learn cell biology though.",
                "I learned the molecules that are key regulators/players in cell biology.",
                "In this course, I learned mostly how to gather information from slideshows to figure out the problem sets. Unfortunately, the lectures never made much sense to me and I did not have time to supplement my learning in review sessions or tutoring due to being in season, so I was mostly trying to learn from the slideshows. I learned a lot about collaboration with others though and that was very constructive.",
                "I learned nothing. this course was confusing and difficult and made me question my position in the sciences. I gained insight on how professors at Yale do not understand pedagogy and that teaching is not a priortity. I felt confused for most of the course and the material was unpalatable.",
                "I learned the about the details of some biology concepts and also how they could hypothetically be applied using various research methods.",
                "I learned a lot about lab techniques and methods of determining various aspects of cell mechanics and function. I learned a lot about very specific processes (microtubule formation and movement, membrane protein synthesis and movement, etc). I also learned about reading scientific literature and how to interpret it",
                "This course mostly focused on the methods used to examine biological functions. For example, we learned about microscopy, immunology, etc. as well as different types of experiments using these methods.",
                "Learned wet lab jargon and some skills (Microscopy, FRAP, sedimentation, etc)",
                "I gained insight into not only core concepts in cell biology, but the experimental methods used to elucidate that knowledge. I also gained more familiarity with research papers and how to dissect them in a 'journal club'-esque environment.",
                "This course delved into a handful of concepts in cell biology, including the plasma membrane, the synthesis and transport of proteins, endocytosis and exocytosis, the actin- and microtubule-based cytoskeletons, and mitosis. We also covered relevant lab techniques and the experiments that led to key discoveries. There was a good amount of critical thinking and application of knowledge in this class.",
                "Basic understanding of cell biology",
                "I learned a lot about problems solving and research methods through this course which was actually really interesting. I also learned how to take notes very rapidly as well as how to try to get myself to focus for long periods of time with high content throughout the entire period of lecture. I also learned how to help myself in STEM courses, Yale has a ton of resources and I discovered that Peer tutoring & Entrichment are truly this course's best assets.",
                "This course is the perfect course to take if you want to be discouraged from studying biology. Bio 102 was frustrating. Bio 102 is part of the introductory biology sequence and advertised to students with no prior experience learning biology. The instructor however insists on teaching it graduate course style making it completely incomprehensible for anyone who has not done biology before. The course furthermore uses jargon and implicitly assumes knowledge which was not taught in Bio 101. This made trying to understand immensely frustrating and unenjoyable. In addition to this, the lectures were disorganised and unhelpful. Since this course is mandatory for many majors, the course gets away with being poor quality while still having high rates of enrolment. In conclusion, I have learned absolutely nothing of note.",
                "Solid intro to cell biology. I loved how we explored different components of cell bio through reading the papers in which the function or structures of organelles were discovered. Understanding the experiments that demonstrate why something is the way it is feels much more concrete (and is much more empowering for the student) than simply being told thats what it is.",
                "I learned about different research techniques and landmark research studies that were performed. I also learned about various concepts in biology that relate to cell structure, transport, and function.",
                "I learned all the parts of the cell, fluorescent bleaching recovery, sedimentation, centrifugation, Inhibition, Cop I and II coats, Motor proteins, cilia and flagella, microsomes, the role of puromycin, GDP is used to conformational drive the Signal recognition particle(SRP) synthesis, affinity chromatography, immunoblotting, gel filtration chromatography, Mitosis, Endocytosis, pH sensitive receptors, how to test what is and is not on the surface of a cell, oligosaccharide, KDEL complex and its role in maintaining the rough ERs make-up, Proteolysis, Negative stain TEM, Types/Classes of tubulin/ MT binding proteins, beating waveforms, Katanin, Sequestering proteins, nucleating of the centrosomes, etc.",
                "To be honest, I'm not sure if I learned information that would stick since this was my hardest class thus far in terms of learning content. I vaguely remember topics from BIOL 102 yet could not retain the information like BIOL 101. I think this is a course that could do a lot of improvement.",

I also learned about some of the pathways present within the cell and also about some of the key components of the cell and how they relate to each other.",

                "Variety of concepts in cell biology such as actins, cell division, cell transport, membranes, and more. Learned how to read into scientific literature.",
                "I learned a lot about the experimental procedure of how to work in a cell biology lab and how to experimentally discover the inner-workings of a cell. This class taught me a lot about what it would actually entail working in a biology lab and how the different parts of the cell interacts to create the systems that are living beings.",
                "Reading scientific literature critically and understanding its applications",

                "I did not develop any useful skills by taking this course.",
                "I learned how to apply the content presented to real life situations. The problem sets called for a deep understanding of the material and so I had to develop an effective way of taking in the material and knowing it well enough to apply to the problems.",

                "Strengths: Discussion and enrichment were super helpful in understanding the material that was in the lecture. Go to peer tutor hours for the collaborative p-sets!\r\nWeaknesses: The material that we learned in lecture and in the slides were too dense and it was difficult to determine which material absolutely needed for basic understanding.",
                "The course is poorly organized and the lectures are a mess. I didnt learn anything from attending lecture.",
                "Not interesting, not engaging, not taught at an intro undergraduate level",
                "Strengths: Prof. Loreng and peer tutors \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were hard to follow",
                "The lectures for this course are very confusing, but the slides are helpful for doing the psets, as are the peer tutors. Without a strong biology background, it is very difficult to understand the material thoroughly.",
                "this course moved quickly to cover a lot of information and seemed to assume a lot of prior knowledge. I wasn't expecting to have to teach myself so much of the content of this intro class.",
                "Strengths: Content was interesting, lectures were engaging for the most part, a lot of demos really helped enforce concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Mooseker uses a lot of jargen, which is difficult to follow at first. There's a learning curve, but eventually you get used to it.",
                "strengths: none. actually i take that back. making friends and learning how to work together with my classmates to pass/ do well in this class because literally no support from teachers and overall terrible in class instruction.\r\n\r\nweakness: again just terribly taught. confusing, so fast pasted, no projects/interactive engaging work just frantically looking through slides to find answers. so much material that is feels unnecessary like no one can retain all that information and like really understand it/know deeply whats happening. lecturer mumbles, goes over so much material extremely quickly just overall horrible it feels like your running a race without legs, and your crawling on your hands to the finish line. actually my discussion section leader was really good shoutout to her. thats it. everything else awful.  truly felt like a waste of time and i will retain nothing i learned here. even  writing this i can't remember what i learned at the start of class.",
                "The strengths of this class are the small discussion sections and the lack of closed note exams. The lack of closed note exams really led me to try to actually understand the material instead of focusing on memorization. Because we were able to look back at the notes and textbook, I think I engaged with those resources more than if it had been closed note. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness is the speed and lack of clear explanations in this course. The course is focused on research methods and experiments primarily, with very little focus on the basic explanations. I often found the material to be difficult to understand from a beginner perspective, and I think that maybe these research methods should be held off for higher level bio courses. The teaching was also not super clear, especially in discussion sections. I think the quality of the TAs varied greatly, and so did their grading styles which I found to be unfair. I think the TA grading should rotate so different TAs grade your PSETS each week to make it more fair.",
                "Strengths: I was able to take away a lot of new experimental techniques that have since aided greatly in a laboratory setting. I appreciated how there was no midterm or final exam, rather there were problem sets in their places. Prof. Mooseker was engaging and clearly very knowledgeable on the subject.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the material was taught quickly, leading to a lot of it going in one ear and out the other. It felt very dense and I'm not sure how much actual cell bio I was able to retain. What we learned was fascinating but I'm not sure it's exactly on-topic.",
                "Strengths were that the class had a very organized structure. \r\nWeaknesses included the fact that the pace of the class was very fast, so it felt like by the time I had grasped the key concepts, we had already moved on to another unit.  This made it hard to retain many of the concepts we learned in class because there was just so much material to go through.",
                "This class assumes a lot of knowledge about biology. It is a drastic, unexpected, precipitous leap from BIOL 101. The class focuses so much on methods that I think it should be called \"Advanced Methods in Cell Biology.\" I will take away the skills I learned from this class (reading a scientific paper, applying concepts to novel situations) more than I will take away any of the concepts themselves. If that was the goal of the course, then it has succeeded. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed was the wild grading discrepancies among TAs when it came to the psets. Even when I collaborated with peers, I would sometimes get double the points off for making the same mistakes as they did. I often felt like there wasn't a rubric, or if there was, it was being applied haphazardly. It is a shame to think that, at lease to some degree, my results in this class were dependent on the TA that I got. An easy solution to this would be to switch the TAs that grade the psets for each section or to have one TA grade a single question so there is continuity.",
                "The main strength of the course was that all of the assignments were open-note (quizzes and problem sets). There were a handful of weaknesses that had negative impacts on my experience in the class. For one, the lectures were not delivered at an introductory level, there was a high level of jargon used that made it difficult to follow the information. Furthermore, the slides were often very wordy and the images difficult to understand at times. Professor Mooseker seemed to fail to approach the class at an introductory course. It seems bizarre to me that an introductory cell biology course did not spend nearly any time on prokaryotic cells, plant cells, or mitochondria. Huh? If the course were a second year or later cell biology class, I'd think differently, but as an intro course, it was not an appropriate level of instruction or feedback. The teaching fellow was very helpful, but our \"journal sessions,\" were essentially presentations on the papers we read during the week requiring no preparation or participation from class members. Finally, the professors were very curt and often unhelpful in Ed discussion posts resulting in students not using the forum (and subsequently the professors complaining we didn't use the forum enough).",
                "Entire grade is based on psets, if you mess up one you are in trouble.",
                "Strengths: The workload is very manageable and predictable. Since the PSETs and quizzes are open note, there wasn't as much stress about memorization. I feel like a lot of the material (specifically the tool kits) are very applicable to work you might do in research labs at Yale if you do bio research.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material was probably presented at too high a level for an introductory cell biology course. If I didn't already have a significant amount of knowledge on cellular biology going in, then I would have struggled. Some of the discussion papers also didn't feel that relevant to the week's material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mooseker--I know some people struggled with Professor Mooseker's teaching style, but I quite enjoyed it. He asks thought-provoking red questions, his office hours are very beneficial, and he is very receptive to questions. Enrichment--if you have the opportunity, take enrichment! The packets are very useful and provide a good summary of the week's lessons. Problem Sets--the problem sets were a great way to focus on the most important parts of a week's content, and they were genuinely enjoyable to think about. \r\nWeaknesses: Pacing--I sometimes felt like the pacing of the course was too fast and assumed too much prior knowledge. I took AP Bio in high school and yet I sometimes felt like the material being taught was too disjointed and we were expected to fill in the gaps ourselves in the middle of a lecture. I would appreciate a smoother transition from concept to concept during lecture.",
                "Strengths: focus on applying material instead of memorizing. The psets focused a lot of experimental strategies, which I think was helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: I did not get much out of attending lecture (and very few people came) and grading seemed to be the emphasis of the class instead of learning.",
                "BIOL 101 did an excellent job teaching students of all backgrounds about biochemistry and biophysics, and I felt that the course taught us everything we needed to know & built up a foundation of biology knowledge. In comparison, BIOL 102 felt highly disorganized. In every lecture, it felt like there were segments that assumed prior knowledge of biology that hadn't been taught in BIOL 101. Many students in BIOL 102 have taken biology in high school, but for those who hadn't, it was extremely difficult to discriminate between what course material was important to learn and what course material was extraneous. For example, there was a lot of unknown terminology used in lecture that hadn't been taught in the course. Every time a new term was used, it made my brain panic for a second- \"I don't know this. Should I know this? What does it mean? Do I need to copy this word down? (etc).\" There was so much unnecessary information in every lecture, which frequently distracted me from the core concepts the course was trying to teach.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the end of this course, I actually feel that I couldn't describe a single \"core concept\" of this course, unlike in BIOL 101 which made the key concepts very clear. Yes, Professor M. showed the \"learning goals\" and \"course outline\" on a slide at the beginning of each lecture. HOWEVER, he wouldn't show the slide for long enough to process information. This made the lecture MORE stressful, not less confusing, because it was one example among many instances in which too much information was presented to the class at once, and we weren't capable of processing everything in time before the next slide was shown.\r\n\r\nGiving students access to slides at the beginning of lecture is NOT a solution. Psychology experiments have shown that students learn new material best when taking notes on a blank notebook, not when taking notes off of lecture notes / printed slides (maybe you can ask Laurie Santos for the proper citation). \r\n\r\nTo improve this course, I propose the following:\r\n1) that this course adopt the same strategies as BIOL 101: make it extremely clear to students what the core concepts are.\r\n2) to solve the problem of students being presented with too much information at once, instead of showing students powerpoint slides chock-full of dense text that they won't have time to read or copy down, use powerpoint slides ONLY for showing images / graphs. Anything that the professor wants students to write in their notebook they should write by hand on a blackboard - it's not fair to expect students to read through huge blocks of text on the powerpoint slides while listening to a lecture, discern what information is the most important, and write down all the important details before the slide is changed. Having the professor hand-write the most important information will ensure that students also have enough time to write down everything important. \r\n3) don't make quiz questions extremely specific / trick questions / that focus on the granular details of some data set. I would rather take quizzes with more limited time, but that give me a clear idea of what concepts I need to study, instead of quizzes that require me to command-F through slides to find the exact number I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThere are other things I could propose, but these are the main ones.",
                "The class covers a lot of very interesting information. The p-sets were an informative way to learn about the concepts presented in class. Sometimes, the lectures felt like they moved very fast and were somewhat disorganized.",
                "This course is very difficult. The weakness of this course is definitely the density of the lectures, as they're difficult to follow. I took AP biology in high school and scored well, and the lectures were still confusing. I can't imagine how it was for people that had never taken biology to try and understand what was being presented. However, there were a lot of strengths that branch from this difficulty. This course is very applicable in the future. Anybody who is pre-med or in a biology based field will need the skills derived from this course (reading scientific papers, figuring out what the complex words in concepts from lecture really mean, etc.), and I am grateful for the skills that I have obtained.",
                "I think learning in this course would be significantly easier if the slides are modified. Currently, from my perspective, the material is a bit all over the place, with lengthy descriptions of past studies spliced between information about biological processes. I wish there could be clear definitions of certain terms, as well as straightforward lists of what is happening at the cellular level (\"proteins do this when they are assembled in A, and then they go to B, and then they go to C\"), so we know what we are actually looking at when the microscopic diagrams are pulled up. \r\nI understand what the lectures are trying to achieve by introducing us to experiments done in the past, but it just doesn't feel very learner friendly, and it is extremely hard to follow the logic. \r\nOn the other hand, the discussion sections are super helpful, for they actually go into detail with what happens with the experiments.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets are applicable to lessons. \r\nWeaknesses: So much information to parse through.",
                "I think the assignment format of this class is perfect and supplements our knowledge/learning. However, as with many intro courses at Yale, the lectures were often hard to follow because they were taught in a way that was not easily digestible for intro biology students. By this, I mean that there was a lot of jargon used, and the course seemed to be aimed at more advanced biology students rather than a beginner course. However, the assistance to better understand what was being taught was provided.",
                "This class is very fast-paced and contains a great deal of dense material. The positive of this is you get to absorb a lot of new knowledge in a short time span. The negative is that there is a lot of information that you simply do not have the time to write down or understand, which can be extremely stressful when you're not sure if the material you understood is what is going to be tested on the psets. I do love that the psets are collaborative, which helps with the stressful aspect of the course. On another note, the time slot of the course is very aggravating since it is right after general chemistry (which most people in intro bio take). This means that you don't really have time to eat lunch and have to run to Steep to grab food before bio starts.",
                "Please make the topics a little bit more simple. This class should be called MCDB 402, experimental methods in cell biology. This is NOT and intro course, and should not be advertised as such.",
                "Strengths are that Mooseker and Loreng are very engaged professors, and I think the enrichment packets and sessions especially helped me summarize and synthesize the lecture content. The demos were also helpful, and the protein synthesis with different stop signal sequences, etc was helpful for me to understand that concept. Improvements would be to layout the lecture slides as in the course packet because I believe that the lecture slides overwhelmed me with information, many of which we frankly did not need to know for the p-sets nor for getting a solid understanding of the material. The lectures could be improved by including a summary of the key points of the unit in concise lecture outlines after going through the material because the current lecture outlines are filled with text, do not concisely summarize nor highlight the key points of the unit, and simply throw terms at the student before we discuss the content. Furthermore, I felt that lectures included many instances in which too much information was given to us for instance, if we were talking about a protein, Prof. Mooseker might mention what researchers thought the protein did, what we know now, which university the molecule was discovered at, how long it took them to discover the protein, the secondary structure of the protein, what other molecules the protein interacts with, etc. In most cases, this much detail was not necessary for me to understand the protein's function and the assays used to discover/test it, but rather, confused me because I didn't know what was important.",
                "This course was very very complicated and the lectures just didn't connect with me and I know I am not alone in that. I just really didn't get anything out of the lectures because I did not have the foundational knowledge needed to understand anything that was going on. It is unfortunate but true. There needed to be more of an explanation of the words he was using and he needed to lay a better foundation for the course. If I had a general understanding of the basics I would have been able to follow the lectures but I could not even follow them because I genuinely had no basis. It's disappointing because I know he is very knowledgeable and was saying interesting things but I could not take any advantage of it because I just did not have the basics. \r\n\r\nSection was a time that was desperately needed for enrichment. The journals were way out of our league and even if they weren't, we could have done 1 or 2 journal clubs. Section really could have been a place to supplement the lectures not getting through to me and a lot of others. This small environment could have been a great place to ask questions and it was disappointing that instead it was just a place where the disparity of understanding grew larger. Those with the foundation and the time to go to tutoring could understand the concepts well enough to decipher the papers but those of us who had no prior foundation with biology and no time to go to tutoring due to being in-season athletes got nothing from section. I was way too far gone to understand anything going on in section and I just really really wish it was used as a time to condense some of the lecture material like it was used for 101.",
                "The course should have clear learning goals and clearly lay out what needs to be understood for the content. This was not taught at an introductory level. I did learn how to stand up for myself when my TF would not give clear feed back and how to read a paper.",
                "The course is very detailed, however the lectures were very complicated and sometimes hard to follow.",
                "Weaknesses: the information is far too specific- we jumped into membrane protein transport and microtubule mechanics and all of these very complex topics before we even learned the basics of the cell, how it works, cell division, etc. It also felt too focused on methods of how various things were discovered yet I felt like I could barely explain what it was that was being discovered using those methods. So improvement would be via learning more general topics first before diving into the specifics and methods",
                "The lectures for this course were very fast paced and a bit difficult to follow.If slides containing less words but important key bullet points could be used, I think this would be beneficial to all students. I also wished that PSETs could be graded by a variety of teaching fellows, in order to ensure fairness in grading among students.",
                "The course might be helpful for students with previous cell biology experience (AP Bio 5s, lab experience, etc).\r\nFor the rest of us, the course was extremely unengaging and the common consensus was that we did not feel like we learned anything.\r\nIt was a struggle just to mimic knowledge for the psets and quizzes. It was so much material that there was not enough time to actually understand and absorb the material. I tried to do so at first (reading textbooks and all), but it was very unsustainable. I was able to understand pieces of information but rarely understood a lecture as a whole. The professor's lecture style kind of expects that students already know the jargon. There were very few students who sat in class understanding what was going on.\r\n\r\nEither the course should shed the lab part, or there should be stratified intro courses (students who've never taken bio/ taken/ taken advanced bio), like with other math and science departments.\r\nBut Prof. Mooseker isn't teaching the course next semester, so maybe things will be different.",
                "One strength of the course is that lecture slides are still easy to review even if one was not able to keep up in lecture. Another strength is that the research papers used are often previewed in lecture, so you are not going in totally blind. One weakness of the course is that lecture recordings were only made available to those who were sick, but I really would have found them helpful to review.",
                "Strengths: the problem set questions required us to apply what we learned, which furthered my understanding of the topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The in-person lectures could get boring, especially as they are long and cover a lot of material. Having access to the recordings would be helpful so that we can rewatch them after class, especially if we missed something that was said and wanted to hear it again. Although this might reduce the incentive to attend class in person, attendance could be promoted a different way, such as by having us respond to a poll in class or something of that sort.",
                "The instructor for 102 was not the best. Could not really keep up with what they were staying and they include too much superfluous information in lectures when only half of the material given is on the curriculum/is tested on. The lecturer is just not great at lecturing in general. The way the class is taught also makes it more difficult to complete the psets given and material is not very well learnt. I do, however, like that Professor Loreng provides a clear week by week to do list and he makes the course a little better.",
                "The strengths of this course include, in my opinion, the knowledge and experiences of the professor, Mooseker. Additionally, Professor Loreng is such a huge help in this class so I found the way that he explains topics to be a life saver. I would say the weaknesses of this course include how much content is thrown at us during lecture. I think that it would be beneficial to have a discussion section that is for content then another discussion section that is just for the papers because I did really enjoy going through the papers together in order to understand them.",
                "I like that most of the psets were collaborative. I think this was definitely not an introductory course. It felt like there was a certain level of assumed pre-requiste knowledge that we had no way of having. I think if bio 101 was more of a background/intro to vocabulary that could have helped becuase I honestly can't name a single thing I was supposed to have learned in that class. Also, there was just way to much information at lecture it was impossible to take notes and all of the info was on the slides so it felt pointless to attend lecture.",
                "The lectures were disorganised, material was poorly explained and intensely boring. This course could be much improved with better organisation and explanation of key concepts. Furthermore, this course should do what it is intended to do and be structured in intro course style. Quality of TFs was also highly variable.",
                "I loved my discussion section. I seriously got more out of it than any course I have taken so far at Yale. The peer review sessions were very enriching, and should certainly continue. I also really appreciated the fast-paced nature of the class.",
                "Strengths: the content was interesting, and I felt like I learned a lot. There was a lot of information in the slides, and pretty much everything on pSETs could be found in the textbook chapters. The pset questions made me think, but were not impossibly hard. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a LOT that was covered each lecture -- simply too much to learn at once.",
                "The content was fantastic and super interesting. The approach to teaching the content through experimental techniques was a great way to learn because it imprints the process of how to figure out how to apply the same to other scientific questions. I believe the amount of content was too large for a half of a semester. The course should be a full semester.",
                "This course should begin with a basic overview of cell biology. It assumes prior knowledge that many students, particularly those coming out of online school, didn't have. It didn't make sense to teach cell biology through experimental methods  there was an overwhelming amount of knowledge which blurred what was important and what wasn't. Overall though, I learned a lot.",
                "i liked reading the papers for discussion section",
                "Professor Mooseker knows what he's talking about but this is not the case for students in BIOL 102. With the lecture slides and complex content it was difficult to understand course material. Oftentimes, the collaborative PSETs involved going through lecture slides again to gather important info. However, Mooseker did make an admirable effort to be engaging. He would always have a class demonstration that was helpful. I think that Professor Loreng was a better instructor, though, and is more interactive as well. He just phrased things in a more comprehensible and accessible way.",
                "A strength was that the discussion sections really helped apply the information we learned in lecture so that we can gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. A weakness is that the class goes very fast and a lot of content is thrown at you at once.",
                "Incredibly difficult problem sets and minimal help given by TAs/professor when just trying to learn.",
                "Too much jargon. Too much background understanding assumed, but even those with background understanding were confused. Mooseker is very well intentioned, and obviously incredibly passionate about the material, but it simply isn't a well-delivered class.",
                "Professor Mooseker was the problem. He teaches like we have PhDs in the subject. Ask me where the mitochondria of the cell is, and Ill start stuttering. Nothing ever made sense. Hed start throwing out terms that never sunk in because they were never thoroughly explained. Just a terrible class.",
                "Strengths: Many outlets to get help on course material, disscussion section was very helpful for not only understanding how to read papers but to gain a deeper understanding of course materials.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are dense and complex and it would be nice to have access to class recordings. We had recordings from the previous semester but it had discrepancies that cost me losing points on quizzes and problem sets",
                "Strengths: the class did a great job at going beyond surface-level cell biology, which was interesting to learn. Weaknesses: the psets were difficult as they focused a lot on minuscule details and were often focused on things we barely learned in class. Also, lectures were often difficult to follow because we would be taught a lot of information without any introduction to the concepts.",
                "The strengths of the course include the opportunity for Enrichment, an optional session that breaks down the concepts and allows for an additional period of learning and review, and the vast amount of content covered, which also allows for a pretty comprehensive understanding of certain parts of the cell. The main weakness of the course, however, are the topics that are chosen to be taught. They are important, but some topics get so detailed without actually teaching what the basics are beforehand. It felt like some topics were jumping to the roof before actually laying the foundation. The course could definitely be improved by spending more time on building the foundations of cell biology before expanding into the niche and complicated topics.",
                "The course was fairly well organized; however, the transition from the asynchronous bio101 format was not great.",
                "I found that this course was extremely dense, with a lot of content thrown at students without being explained. I would appreciate if more time was spent on explaining less course content but in more depth.",
                "I think there was just a lot of content being packed into one lecture and tons of jargon being thrown around without giving time for us to learn the fundamentals. You would think that 102 builds on 101, but it actually doesnt (in my opinion). I also had a huge problem with the way grading worked in the course. Nothing is standardized. If you dont want to compare from semester to semester, fine. But why is there no rubric? People are walking away from the course with the exact same understanding as each other but two completely different grades. Some TAs are more difficult than others but the class average was based on everyones performance? The only way to justify the grading is if the class average and therefore, your final grade was based on section scores where students are being evaluated solely on how their TA graded. I also think an 11 AM deadline is strange, but thats just me.",
                "The course covers a lot of material which was difficult to keep up with and understand fully. But the problem sets were a good way to synthesize the material we learned.",
                "For someone with very limited experience in biology, 102 moves too quickly.",
                "The open-book format of the quizzes and most of the homeworks was very helpful in facilitating learning and not adding unrequired stress.",
                "Good information, but could be organized better rather than spilling into lectures in the same class and also the homeworks were very challenging, could use more leniency on this aspect.",
                "I thought that the content could be presented in a better way, especially if the discussion sections were used to reinforce the topics learned during lecture rather than reading research papers. While reading the research papers were interesting, I don't think they added as much value in terms of learning as they should have. Ideally, I would have more time with seminar type teaching to really reinforce what is being taught. Enrichment is very good for that, but I think if there were more enrichment courses offered, it could be even more beneficial to the course as a whole because, even though I was in Enrichment, I had some friends who wanted to do it but just couldn't get in.",
                "strengths: exposes you to content that you will likely expect in more focused STEM courses\r\nweakness: professor's lecture style was not a personal favorite",
                "Strengths: the pset and quizzes do help a lot to solidify your knowledge\r\nWeaknesses: it is impossible to follow the lectures, unless they are recorded and the slides/presentation lack so much key info, the TFs marking varies a lot",
                "The strengths of the course is the engagement with the students. The Ed discussion forum, office hours, peer tutoring, and discussion sections allow for a better understanding of the material. A weakness was the amount of work assigned and material was too much at some points.",
                "Course encouraged collaboration but course material was taught at a very fast pace. Also felt that there were inconsistencies in grading the p-sets among TFs.",
                "The professor is unwilling to listen",
                "Strength: psets are collaborative, discussion section is really helpful for understanding scientific papers, final exam is another pset which is good since theres a lot of information taught to us\r\n\r\nWeakness: too much material is thrown at us. We cover nearly 100 slides per class and its really hard to remember or understand all that material in lecture. I feel like this discouraged me from pursuing biology because I dont know if its me or the class that makes the material slightly unenjoyable to learn.",
                "Taught us very niche areas of concepts we had familiarity with from previous classes, which was cool",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were organized and effective\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were difficult to follow because they ventured into difficult topics too fast and were jam-packed with information, rough transition between biology 101 and 102 content and expectations, recordings were made unavailable midway through the course and those were imperative for my learning and retention",
                "The course was very comprehensive and applicable to real world scenarios",
                "There were so many slides yet when going back over the slides later, they did not help me deeply understand the topic. I think fewer slides with more concentrated information would be helpful.",

                "Strengths- large teaching staff and helpful discussion sections\r\nWeaknesses- the lectures were not very engaging and apart from discussion sections, I did not have many places to go to ask for pset help since the office hours did not work with my schedule. I found it very difficult to correlate lectures with the pset and did not think there were enough resources provided to score highly on the homeworks.",
                "The course seemed to be highly information based, and I felt like I spent most of my time in this class memorizing facts rather than gaining a deeper knowledge of the concepts behind them. I felt as though the information we learnt was highly niche and it was difficult to transition from the material we learnt in BIOL 101 to that of this class.",
                "There are no strengths in this course, only weaknesses. The lecturer is awful and the content is not at all streamlined. The assignments given in this class also do not accurately represent the student's knowledge at all.",
                "Strengths include Enrichment that was available to students and the online quizzes that made you revisit the lecture material. Weaknesses include that your own TA grades all of your problem sets.",
                "strengths: interesting and relevant. weakness: scattered, a lot of information gone through quickly in class.",
                "Lots of support from peer tutoring. However the class was too fast paced for me to get an in-depth thorough understanding of most concepts.",
                "Strengths of the course was being exposed to reading journals and scientific papers and learning how to analyze them. The way the class was taught in lecture however was not ideal. It was hard to learn and be engaged and more often than not the material was taught in a very confusing manner.",
                "The strengths were the in-depth slides, beneficial discussion sections, and peer tutoring offered. A weakness was the volume of course material taught in each lecture. Due to the large amount of concepts that were discussed in an individual lecture, it was hard to follow.",
                "One strength of the class is the emphasis on collaboration in gaining understanding, and the supplemental resources available such as enrichment and peer tutoring. However, the structure of how the class is taught could be more organized, and at a slower pace.",
                "I feel like I really learned a lot coming away from this course. I can pinpoint areas that I enjoyed and areas that I didn't enjoy as much, and have enough understanding about all of these areas to explain I find them interesting or not. The learning curve is steep, but overall the content is taught well\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, it's just too much content. The jump from Bio 101 to 102 is a serious wake up call, and I feel like we could have been better prepared to the significant increase in difficulty. There's just so much stuff. Way too much for half a semester.",
                "Having access to the recorded lectures was very helpful when referring back to things I still had questions on post lecture, continuing this would be helpful .",
                "There needs to be more introductory material.",
                "The resources for the course were easily accessible through Canvas, and the support systems in place  especially peer tutor office hours were very helpful for answering questions. Although the class used an Ed Discussion forum, I feel like it was not very necessary when a student could reach out via email about a question to the professor, a TA, or a peer tutor. Although this probably was not a common opinion, I enjoyed most of the papers (the first two were so-so) that would be read during discussion sections. I found them insightful about the kind of research and discovery that can be accomplished within the field of cell biology and as a good introduction to formal scientific writing. \r\n\r\nThe twice-weekly lectures were not always the most engaging and sometimes it would be difficult to follow along when the pre-lecture slides differed from the lecture slides used in class. However, I found that the other aspects of the class made up for this discrepancy.",
                "Strength: Discussion sections were very helpful in understanding the readings. Most of the readings were very hard to understand given that some people were new to reading papers. So discussion sections were very helpful. Also, being allowed to collaborate on PSETs. The information was often hard to comprehend on your own so being able to hear other people's interpretations helped tremendously. The recorded lectures from the previous year helped when I needed clarification of what was said in a lecture.\r\nWeakness: Lectures were hard to understand. There was so much new material being covered so it was hard to digest the material and answer red questions on the spot since I had no idea what was being talked about. The PSETs were always confusing. They were very ambiguous yet it felt like there was a specific answer for each question based on the feedback I received. Though the information is very dense in the course, I feel like there still is not enough to help us understand the material in 1 week. \r\nAlso, I feel like the demonstrations in class would also be a strength but since I didn't know what was being simulated, I can't tell if it improved my understanding.",
                "The strengths of this class was that the Sunday review sessions and recorded lectures from last year were really helpful for content review and the quizzes and psets. The weakness to the class was that the content was taught very fast in class. Additionally, grading on the psets were not graded equally among the different TAs.",
                "Lecture format was fatal weakness. It would make sense if this were similar to the other introductory biology courses. Being the odd one-out in this case was incredibly undesirable and hard to follow coming from 101.",
                "It is VERY fast paced and i had wished the slides were better formatted and structured to facilitate learning. Since there was just so much content, I often found it better to skip lecture and learn the content at a slower pace because it you get distracted for like a few seconds, you are confused the rest of the lecture that covers 100+ slides at a time.",
                "There was such a huge jump between BIOL 101 and 102. The material in BIOL 102 was considerably more dense than the first module and I struggled with identifying which information I needed to understand in their entirety.",
                "The course content often felt overly dense and challenging, and the curriculum felt rushed at times. I believe this could be improved by more involvement by the teaching staff to coordinate office hours to answer student questions. I liked how a lot of resources were posted on Canvas, such as past lectures and lecture outlines. I just wish current course recordings were made available, as well.",
                "I think that this course covers a great range of topics and I learned a lot especially in the seminar where the discussions made me really learn about scientific papers and what to watch for. I still think that we could have used less jargon in lectures to make them more understandable or at least more explanation if we keep the jargon.",
                "Honestly this class shouldnt exist the way it does. This class doesnt really focus on cell biology like its name implies. Theres a heavy focus on cellular biology lab methods, which are only introduced so that students can be expected to understand the methods section of the advanced papers given to us. The cell biology that we do learn is extremely specific. We only focus on a few organelles and then go extremely in depth into their purposes. This class should give students the ability to explain any major component of a cell, which it does not. This class should feel more like AP bio and less like an upper-level cell bio lab.",
                "Strengths: great TA (Nayoung), all assessments were take home\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be poorly labeled (eg different labeling between pre lecture slides and post lecture slides). Would be helpful if each lecture was assigned a single number (eg Lecture 1, Lecture 2, Lecture 3) rather than the Lecture Unit system which was very confusing to me",
                "I felt the emphasis, not on memorizing facts, but on a 'critical thinking' approach to making sense of cell biological questions and experimental methods was superb; the close reading of primary papers was critical to this, and very rewarding.\r\n\r\nI did not think Professor Mooseker presented too much material or that his lectures were too dense. The pace and content of the lectures enabled us to make a lot of progress in the semester, and be able to think critically about cell biology in a relatively short time.",
                "Strength: learning about important research papers in cell bio improved my ability to comprehend scientific writing \r\nweakness: we went through way too much content way too quickly so I never felt like I actually understood anything. A lot of people dont even show up to lecture because its too hard to follow along in class.",
                "The enrichment session and the peer tutoring hours were the greatest strengths of this course. It could be improved by more interactive activities during class.",
                "Prof. Mooseker's lectures were not engaging in the slightest. He lectures for over an hour non-stop, mumbling under his breath and never allowing time for clarifying questions. He does not go into detail about the topics he's teaching and assumes that everyone memorizes everything from BIOL 101. \"You should know this\" is a line that is often repeated.",
                "Weaknesses: too much content, lectures were not effective or engaging, I felt like everything went way too fast\r\nStrengths: discussion sections were good and helpful to understand specific scientific papers",
                "This course had such interesting information but was so hard to follow. In some sections, especially, the lecture was almost impossible to comprehend and the slides provided different jargon-y language so that you couldn't use them to help you understand what the lecturer was saying.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: too much information being taught in too little time. Hard to truly grasp concepts while in class.",
                "I think the class focused a lot on very specific components of cell biology. I wish there were more overarching concepts, however, this might just be due to the nature of the content. I feel like I understood the content well enough for each PSET, but looking back on it I'm not sure how much I will actually remember since there was just so much detail. \r\n\r\nI like the model of having open note quizzes and PSETs. I thought the quizzes helped focus the course content and the PSETs helped me more thoroughly understand the material. However, the quizzes sometimes seemed unnecessarily confusing. I felt like the PSETs were not simply assignments for a grade, they actually helped me learn. \r\n\r\nI think exposure to scientific papers is important and I like that this class incorporates that via the discussion sections. However, I liked how in BIOL 101 there were notes that went along with the paper that helped me understand what I was reading. I wish there were those for BIOL 102.",
                "I found that the TAs for this class were not very engaged and graded unevenly. I also found the psets nebulous. It was very difficult to determine exactly what they wanted in open ended questions. Furthermore, since there was no final assesment there was not a big incentive to go to class or retain information from week to week. Lectures go over an incredible amount of material, but the slides on canvas are a great resource. \r\n\r\nA couple of the demonstrations for remembering cellular dynamics were fun and the professor is very passionate about this area. He knows the history of the studies that supported our current knowledge about cell bio and went into detail about the microscopy of each one. However, if you don't care about the intricate details of cell bio this may not be the class for you.",
                "The course was very informative and interesting. However, the workload was very high and difficult.",
                "Strength- I love how the class materials connect to lecture information, experimental techniques, and critical thinking! \r\nAlso loved enrichment sections :) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- peer tutor sections could have been organized better / have more sections.",
                "Strengths: Professors Loreng and Mooseker are both really kind and care about what they do. Professor Loreng in particular holds enrichment sessions which are quite helpful, while Professor Mooseker holds sessions on Sunday which are beneficial sometimes if you can attend them. Likewise, the TAs are great and are very helpful for problem sets. Lastly, despite the material being confusing, I think the course might have a reasonable curve and it is certainly more forgiving than some other STEM classes (like Chem Lab I + II).\r\nWeaknesses: This still is a very difficult course. The material can be very difficult and dense, and the lectures can be very confusing; often I wasn't sure what the main points of the each slide and the lecture overall were (despite learning goals being periodically mentioned). While quizzes can take a while, they can be time consuming. However, problem sets can be extremely confusing and difficult; though TAs can help, the take home problem sets are extremely difficult.",
                "Strengths: as much as I disliked preparing for them, reading the papers helped clarify the weekly content much better. Also, PEER TUTORING, a true blessing and the best resource in the class\r\nWeaknesses: Mooseker's lecturing doesn't anticipate student needs and misunderstandings well, often lectures upon false assumptions about students' previous knowledge",
                "The weaknesses of this course lied in the lectures, as many of them were conducted in a way that students were implied to already have knowledge of terms and concepts before the course. If a student was asked about the interactions within certain terms and concepts, they could answer fine, but if they were asked about the terms and concepts foundationally, it would be much harder for them to answer."

                "I personally do not recommend the course unless it is a requirement for a major or as a premedical student. The content can be quite difficult to understand and requires lots of time outside of the lecture to fully grasp.",
                "No",
                "Not unless required, or if you have a lot of time to dedicate to fully understanding the content.",
                "If you have to/want to take the bio sequence, then yes. Otherwise, this course might not be worth your time if you don't already have a solid cell bio background.",
                "I would recommend this class if it is a prerequisite for their major.",
                "Yes; this is a great intro bio course that covers so much information in a small amount of time. It's not necessarily easy, but I found myself coming out of it feeling so much more confident in my ability to understand the cell and understand how complex it is and how important it is to our world.",
                "the only reason you may take this course is because your majoring in something biology related and or would like to be a doctor. if you are not in that boat, and even if you are, this class sucks and i would not recommend. the pace is so quick, the lecturer is quite bad and its really just a terrible experience would not recommend. its the type of class that makes you fall out of love with something you might have been genuinely curious about. but its a prereq for many things so if you have to just put your head down and do the work. probably wont be very fun or enjoyable though.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it required as a prerequisite for your major. If you are simply trying to see if you are interested in pre-med or biology, I would maybe take a different class before delving into the whole bio sequence because this class made many of my peers drop being pre-med which I think is unfortunate. You do not learn a lot about biology unless you are able to self teach yourself a lot and read a lot of scientific papers. Otherwise, it is very difficult to understand, and I often ended up relying on rewatching the lectures and looking through slides to try and find answers to the questions on the PSETs and quizzes.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in working in a wet lab at some point in their future. It was a tremendous amount of work and took a lot of time, however, it was very interesting. I most likely would not have taken it if it were not a necessary pre-req.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who absolutely need to take this class, for instance if it is a prerequisite for their prospective major or if they are pre-med.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you absolutely have to take it as a prerequisite.",
                "Most people taking BIOL 102 have no choice to take it, so that's a non-starter. However, I believe significant improvement must be made to meet students needs and provide a better introduction to biology at Yale. It's a shame that an intro course is so poorly taught and coordinated, it has turned off many students from biology. Bio was my favorite science in high school, but I no longer want to major in MCDB because of this class. The feedback and grading were incredibly specific, often looking for words or answers that were not asked in the questions, and TFs, while helpful in explaining the rubrics, did not have any leeway for my re-grade requests.",
                "take only if you have to",
                "I would recommend it, but only if the student already had significant cellular biology knowledge. Although it's true that 102 is harder than 101, I feel like it becomes doable. It's only the jump from 101 to 102 in teaching style that makes the transition jarring.",
                "Yes! Unfortunately, Professor Mooseker won't be teaching this course again for a while, but the content is still very enjoyable. It is a prerequisite for most, if not all, bio-related majors, but it is still a very enjoyable course.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless its a requirement. It felt like a box to check instead of focusing on learning and a love of the material.",
                "Only take this course if you have to for your major. BIOL 101 was much, much better in comparison - if you're taking biology because you're curious, stop at 101.",
                "The class teaches a lot about introductory cell biology, which if you are interested in that, it is really helpful. It is a lot of work, and you definitely get out what you put into it. The concepts are fascinating though!",
                "Yes, I recommend this course, but only if biology is in your future. The concepts and skills obtained in this course are really difficult and not necessarily beneficial if biology is not something that interests you in a career.",
                "No. Way too hard for an intro course and no one takes this class unless you need to.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in biology.",
                "If you're looking for a crash course cell biology course, I think this is a good option. However, I would recommend just taking the semester-long cell biology class if you're really that interested. Otherwise, take this class if it's a prereq for you.",
                "This is certainly for a requirement, so I would say yes. Even otherwise, I would say you should take this but do not expect it to be a walk in the park. It is a challenge, especially after taking 101 which is so much easier.",
                "I would not unless they have to take it as a prereq. It was not a class where I felt like I learned much so I would not recommend this class to anyone who doesn't have to take it. I just sadly didn't get anything out of this class since I never understood anything.",
                "No. unless pre med and need it",
                "No- I honestly felt like I learned very little about biology in general, and a lot about very specific mechanics of very specific aspects of the cell (which feels less applicable long term). I spent countless hours on psets asking questions about topics that I barely understood from lecture, just to have a ton of points taken off each pset because of imprecise wording or not writing the exact answer that they expected of us. It was also hard because some TAs were much easier graders, so it was tough to see my friends acing the collaborative psets while me and some of my other friends, who all had the similar answers for the collaborative assignments, did more poorly.",
                "Especially for a student on the pre-medical track, this course gives you important insight and knowledge on the methods used in many experimental processes.",
                "I had never taken biology in high school, as I was interested in math/cs. I thought this intro course might be a good opportunity to try bio, esp. since I was thinking of working in bioinformatics. I ended up spending more time in this course than my math and cs classes. Might be useful if you need the requirements, but if not I would take bio with other more interesting non-major courses.",
                "I would recommend this course because it gives you a valuable foundation for future study of the natural sciences, as well as applicable research. Learning about the Western Blot in class was a fun preview for my own coming research this summer.",
                "Yes, especially as it is a requirement for most biological science majors and medical schools. If you are looking for a distributional science credit, the workload and challenging content of this course may not be worth it compared to others, unless you are really interested in cell biology.",
                "No, unless absolutely necessary or there is a different Professor.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed it a lot. Definitely is a lot of work but they could really make it a lot harder and thankfully have not. The professors are really understanding and I REALLY appreciated that.",
                "Absolutely not, in fact I would discourage them from take this course.",
                "Absolutely!!! What you learn in this class is so empowering. It was somewhat scary for me in the beginning because Professor Mooseker is so smart and has a ton of experience, but when you get to the end of the semester youll realize you learned a ton.",
                "I would recommend this course o another student if they are interested and wish to gain a deep understanding of cell biology. It delves really deep into the specifics of the cell, its membrane, and its organelles, so if one is interested in that then it is a good course. If someone is simply looking for a simple overview of cell biology, this course may not be right for you.",
                "I would recommend taking this course even if you are not interested in cell bio. I came in with a strong opposition to biology, but left reconsidering my major. Everything is cell bio is incredible to imagine and that it all goes on within all of us. I believe even through the struggles of PSETs and quizzes the content is worth learning.",
                "The problem sets are tough, but fun to collaborate on if you make a good study group. Lectures are long and the material goes by very quickly, but you learn a decent amount and the slides are posted so it isn't hard to gain a good understanding of the material from the problems sets.",
                "yes since it's required for a lot of things",
                "I would recommend this course if it was taught by someone like Professor Loreng. I think that taking it with Mooseker would just cause a student more frustration because it is very hard to understand the concepts when you have no basis in biology.",
                "Yes.",
                "Absolutely not",
                "No, not with Mooseker. I think cell biology is important to know and can be interesting; hes just now the one to do it.",
                "Only take the course if you have too (such as a prerequisite for a major)",
                "Yes, it was a very unique course compared to any other biology class I've taken.",
                "Unless it's required, I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another student. I took it because I might want to take some courses down the line that recommend having some background in biology and I was looking forward to it, but it ended up being quite disappointing.",
                "I would! Professor Mooseker was very sweet, and the TFs were very supportive.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if there were interested in the pre-med track. Otherwise, I don't think this course would be very accessible to non-STEM majors.",
                "Yes, Biol 102 is a class where you learn a lot about cell biology, even though it is a significant step up from Biol 101 and will require more work.",
                "To advance skills in biology and training problem-solving, then yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning biology, especially the lab side of it.",
                "Yes! I think I learned a lot of content that will benefit me in the long run",
                "Yes, because it a pre-req for a lot of majors. This class is totally doable and not too time-consuming. The key thing to getting a good grade is having a generous TF. The variation in marking of the TFs is actually shocking. The people I did collaborative psets with would be 10 points apart from me when results came back.",
                "I would only recommend this course to somebody who needs it for their major because otherwise it is too difficult.",
                "Only if you have to take it for a major or premed requirement",
                "No, although the workload is very high, I didn't learn anything",
                "Yes only if its required for your major",
                "Yes, if you see biology in your future career, take this class!",
                "I would recommend the course because it taught me a great deal of content, but the course often left me feeling unmotivated and lost. I think that anyone who takes this course has to be proactive in reaching out for help.",
                "Yes, it is very useful for real world applications",
                "I would recommend it to someone who has previously taken a biology class and wants a deeper understanding of cellular biology.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in the details of cell biology.",
                "Yes because it's usually required",
                "Only if this class is a pre-requisite or necessary",
                "I wouldnt. While the class is part of the introductory bio sequence, I felt as though I didnt learn much in this class that I would retain and apply in the future.",
                "If you are considering this course it is likely because you are required to take it.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, if it is necessary. It takes a lot of work and commitment to do well though.",
                "Only if required for a major or for pre med.",
                "Yes, if this course is required for you to take. The slides helped me navigate the course, but I found the lectures and textbook not as helpful. I would suggest going to peer tutoring and forming study groups to help.",
                "I would only recommend this class to someone who needed it as a requirement for their major.",
                "If you have to take it for a pre req, like most people in there, then it's not too bad. I wouldn't recommend just taking it for fun though. It's a lot of work and a lot of material to get through, especially if it's not something you're super interested in already. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I wouldn't turn someone away from it either",
                "If this course was not required for their major I would not recommend it unless they were genuinely very passionate about cell biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with an existing interest in biology and/or cell biology specifically. A lot of the terminology goes undefined without student questioning, and the lectures can sometimes be very dense and hard to sit through. As someone who does not prefer lecture classes, I think that personally, I would have appreciated it if the content were taught in a seminar-style class (I am aware that a class like this exists), but for the sake of the course being a part of a lecture sequence, I understand that this is not possible.",
                "I would recommend this class a requires pre-requisites for many further biology courses. Additionally, the course gives you a foundation for reading scientific articles.",
                "No",
                "I would recommend only if you are committed to learning the course on your own time because most of the learning will not be done in lecture. The lecture serves more as a brief overview of what you should have studied a day or so before than actually serving as your first glimpse into new biology concepts.",
                "I would not take this unless it is required for your major of if you just enjoy biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, since I learned a lot of content. However, I would not take it during an already challenging semester, since this class was sometimes difficult to manage alongside other courses.",
                "Not unless it was required. You dont learn as much as youre supposed to because theres too much content and its not presented in a clear way.",
                "Yes, for the intro bio sequence",
                "Yes, for those interested in learning how to think critically about biological questions and being able to interrogate & evaluate primary scientific literature.",
                "Yes, but I'd say it's significantly harder than BIOL 101 so just be ready for the increased workload and utilize your resources!!!",
                "Not unless its a requirement. Im definitely going to have to teach myself cell bio at some point.",
                "This course is challenging but continues the introductory biology course. There are sections, peer tutors, and office hours to try to provide as much help outside of lectures.",
                "Yes, if they were interested in biology I would recommend this course because there are many opportunities to apply one's knowledge.",
                "I would not recommend this class for fun. It's a prereq that must be taken for pre-med or biological studies.",
                "Not unless it it a requirement for a major.",
                "Absolutely not. This course is the perfect course to cultivate a healthy hatred of Biology. Although i deeply admire and respect Dr Mooseker and enjoyed his openness and honesty with his students, I found this course a great challenge to my love of biology. The combination of a very fast pace and a lot of confusion around the vocabulary used and the way that it was presented as well as contradictory and confusing grading with very little feedback left me feeling lost and disheartened. If I had not had broader experience with biology, this course would have been the end of my following a major in Neuroscience.",
                "Yes, because it solidified and expanded my understanding of cell biology and made me certain that I want to major in BME. I loved every second of this course despite the challenge it brought, and I rarely ever say that.",
                "Yes because usually this is taken as a requirement for a major.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in biology. The content was really interesting.",
                "As part of the intro bio sequence many students have to take this course, but I would not recommend it if it were an elective. It covers an incredible amount of material very quickly, the psets have open ended problems that are graded for including specific facts, and the lectures are VERY FAST. The grading is entirely dependent upon the TA you get. Different TAs give very different grades. No idea how the rubrics are written but its odd and your entire grade is essentially psets.",

                "Though I would not recommend this class to most people, I can think of a few exceptions. I would probably recommend this course to either someone who really loves biology and research, or someone who needs this class as a prerequisite and has the dedication to complete this course. The problem sets are really difficult; each problem often feels like a really tricky riddle, and solving them either require a lot of experience in biology or time, patience, and perseverence. As a result, I would only recommend this class to someone who loves research or really wants to pursue STEM and needs this as a prerequisite.",
