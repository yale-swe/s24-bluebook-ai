I had a very basic foundation from a year or so of foundational high school chemistry (GCSEs), but the scope of this course was far beyond that and I learned many new skills. There is actually quite a lot of physics and maths in the course (the physics parts are, in my opinion, the most interesting). You learn about everything from gas behaviour to quantum theory and specifically how they relate to chemistry. A fantastic introduction to the core concepts of the field that prioritises a new way of thinking rather than wrote learning of equations and case studies.",

                "The pacing of this course, with midterms interspersed between weeks of lessons and at least one week after the last lesson on the midterm, was difficult to keep up with. It's really hard to learn new material while also trying to study for a midterm with no grace period. I'm not sure if there's a fix for this, though.",
                "Strengths - Good pace. Useful homework problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Practice exams were not representative of exam difficulty.",
                "The course was adapted very well to the virtual format. Dr. Cooper did an excellent job of preparing engaging lectures, providing numerous practice problems to keep the class engaged, and addressing questions both during and after class. \r\nI honestly can't think of any glaring weaknesses of the class.",
                "The weekly workload is pretty high, since there are two problem sets and weekly quizzes. It would have been nice to have a bit more breathing room around the midterm exams in terms of problem set due dates.",

                "1. Very well-structured\r\n2. Lots of practice material",
                "The way the course was structured allowed for a clear transition between the materials in the chapters. In addition, each chapter built upon concepts we learned prior. The sapling psets and learning curves allowed for a significant amount of practice in each topic before the exams. Finally, the practice exams were extremely helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course are the weekly homework assignments and the discussion sections, as these forced me to stay engaged with the course and helped prevent me from falling behind. A weakness of this course was the virtual format, but this was inevitable because of the pandemic.",
                "strengths- professor cooper is very nice. weakensses- i think the grading is unfair. if we don't put units we get a whole point off even if we did the entire problem right until that point.",

This was a big challenge because while the instruction was extremely clear, they're far more likely to mop up a good grade while doing less work--it would have been nice to also reward students on their improvement over time. I found the Sapling homeworks EXTREMELY helpful in solidifying concepts, although occasionally we had to independently learn concepts that weren't covered in lecture\/were skimmed over. The sections were fairly gruelling as some took place before the due date of the homework, meaning we hadn't really had enough time to ruminate over the ideas and their application. However, content was consistently interesting and accessible. Seriously, this class is super fascinating! This class was a fairly weighty time commitment - three very dense lectures, a learning curve hw, a pretty tricky (but not too long) PSET, and a 1hr section. Additionally, we had three midterms (during the weekend! Which objectively sucks) and a final (with no \"ignore the lowest grade\" policy). Each to their own, but it isn't the most forgiving class especially if you're taking a 5+ credit semester.",

                "Great Professor, but I did not love sapling learning site",
