                "I learned a thorough history of all major turning points and involvements in American Foreign Policy- ranging from WWI to present day and the Ukraine war. I learned how to analyse these situations for motivations, strategies, and goals. I learned how to write succinctly and apply my analysis to foreign policy context",
                "I learned an immense amount about not just US foreign policy in the 20th century but also gained an invaluable understanding of how diplomacy actually functions. You learn how to identify national interests, strategies, and tactics in an incredibly useful schema for analyzing policy decisions. You also learn how to make your points quickly and defend them well- because Ford will press you.",

It allows you to explore your own interests in the field of American foreign policy, but also to focus specifically on some key moments. Ambassador Ford leads discussions exceptionally well and gives very helpful feedback on writing.",

                "Strengths: Great professor with unique and relevant experience, interesting readings.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings are on the long side, so sometimes they are hard to get through. Paper assignments are very open-ended, which can be both good and bad at times.",
                "Class revolves around going through the readings on the whiteboard and analyzing them structurally. I wish it were a little more seminar-y, with less trying to remember facts from the readings. Aside from that I learned a lot and would take the class again.",
                "Strengths are Ambassador Ford and the focus on reading books. Professor Ford brings a wealth of of experience and practice to the table and cares deeply about his students and their learning experience. No major weaknesses except for size of the class was perhaps too large.",
                "Strength: Ford is great; the books are for the most part good and serve as a great way to learn about FP. I was a little shocked at how in detail Ford comment's on one's writing, but in the end his comments and suggestions make you a better writer.",
                "Professor Ford is a wonderful teacher. Rarely do we have the opportunity in life to learn from such a knowledgeable figure and engage in material theyve spent their lives dedicated to in a seminar setting. The material was well paced  and engaging",
                "Strengths: Ford himself is the real strength. He teaches the class incredibly well, and facilitates the most engaged discussions I have seen in my 3 years at this school. He makes sure you both understand the material and why you are learning it. The course also attracts students that really care - and they make you better in turn. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is a ton of reading- which is excellent if you can do it. But it may come at the cost of your other classes. Be warned.",
                "A lot of reading, some of it felt extraneous (certain books could be narrowed down to a few chapters)",
                "Strength: The class is incredibly engaging, not a single moment where I felt bored or uninterested. Ambassador Ford is fantastic in this seminar, take the class if you get into it",
                "Strengths: this is an incredible class, truly wonderful. The readings are engaging, class discussion is fascinating and Professor Ford puts so much care into his students. I also really like that the assignments help develop skills that will be valuable in the field including writing concisely and speaking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "The strengths of this course are the teaching and the small seminar style. The assignments are clearly laid out and fair. Each week I really enjoyed the student presentations and thought class flew by. I don't really have any weaknesses in all honesty.",
                "Strengths: readings are really great, teacher is very engaged with the class material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings are too long, not enough conversation in the class",
                "Ambassador Ford is a really great professor, who cares a lot about his students learning and is very available for office hours. I received detailed feedback on both my oral presentation and my first paper, which helped me better understand how to critique foreign policy. It's also a really cool opportunity to hear Ambassador Ford speak from his experience as a diplomat and cover how these kinds of policy decisions are actually made."

                "Absolutely. Professor Ford is wonderful and it was incredible to learn from him. The seminar setting made the material that much more engaging",

Genuinely, the course changed how I think about policy and the US role in the world. \r\n\r\nFord is also Excellent- he means it when he says come to office hours. Thats a ton of the value of the class, and I wish I had realized that earlier. \r\n\r\nThat said, this course requires you to work. Not only can ford tell if you havent done the reading, you also just get way less out of a seminar session if you didnt prepare- youll feel worse off for having skipped the reading. \r\n\r\nIn sum though - make this class your priority. Its just worth it.",
                "Good course, you get what it says on the tin.",

                "Absolutely! If you get a chance to take this course you must. Professor Ford is incredible and this is easily the best class I have taken at Yale",
                "Yes definitely -- you should be prepared to do the reading but gain lots from doing so! Ambassador Ford is an amazing instructor who cares deeply about students. Recommend to all.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot from it. Not only is Ambassador Ford a great professor, he is also a great mentor to his students and often would share events and opportunities that we should look into. I have taken a number of policy courses in my time at Yale, but this one really emphasized key lessons from each week's readings, and the way Ambassador Ford taught the course kept us all accountable to doing the readings thoughtfully and extracting key takeaways from them."
