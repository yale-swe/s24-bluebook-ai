    "Learned how to analyze music essays better for aspects I could incorporate into my own writing like nutgrafs, ledes, etc.",
    "We read a lot of really amazing pieces that changed how I view music. The class helped me think about music in the context of taste, class, culture, gender, race, and many other areas. I also learned how to evoke music through writing, and got a lot of practice with creative nonfiction in general."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the discussions and learning to react creatively to pieces of music in short periods of time. Also, constructing essays and revising while incorporating advice from others is a big strength. Weaknesses center around a lack of music played in the class based on student interests, as well as a little less instruction on what was being sought after in essays than I expected or desired."

    "I loved this class! Writing assignments were fun and readings were super interesting. Prof. Sexton is the bestso supportive, understanding, and gives great feedback on all your writing. Definitely recommend!",
    "Yes for the readings and fun essay topics, as well as stimulating discussion",
    "Yes! It was a really fun and relatively low-key way to practice writing creative nonfiction and to learn a lot about music in the process. The one caution I have is that it felt almost like a repeat of English 120, just with some more specific readings. I still enjoyed that, but it's worth noting that if you're looking for something more intense than 120, it might not be this class."
