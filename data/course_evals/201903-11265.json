    "I learned the fundamentals of multivariable calculus, from taking partial derivatives to evaluating triple integrals. I also learned a little bit about the history of calculus and the lesser-known thinkers (including Stokes) who made this field possible.",
    "I learned how to compute flux surface integrals, vector and scalar line integrals, and how to produce vector fields.",
    "Ive learn my fair share about scalar and vector line\/surface integrals. Beyond the actual math I think Ive learned that I have to put in a lot more effort if I want to achieve anything.",
    "I learned about vectors, the dot and cross products, three dimensional objects and their parameterizations, and three dimensional space as a whole. I also learned about the gradient and directional derivatives; the method of Lagrange multipliers; double and triple integrals; polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates; work (line) and flux (surface) integrals; divergence and curl; and several fundamental theorems, including the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes Theorem, and Divergence Theorem.",
    "Prior to this course, I had already taken a rigorous course on multivariable calculus. I did find this course still good in terms of explaining key concepts of multivariable calculus such as the fundamental theorms of calculus.",
    "I learned to do multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of 2 and 3 variable calculus. Differentiation, integration, some optimization and vector geometry.",
    "Multivariable calculus  concepts and application s",
    "I gained a solid understand of multivariable calculus.",
    "I developed a knowledge of multivariable calculus as well as a deeper understanding for the conceptual aspect of math.",
    "I learned how to think about equations, surfaces and objects in 3 space and perform calculus on them. It was very cool even purely mathematically, but also has great applications in physics, economics, and so on.",
    "How to visualize 3D objects and critically think about math problems.",
    "More than anything I think this course developed my intuition in thinking about 3D space, various types of vector and scalar functions, and vector fields. While the beginning of the course felt difficult because of the fact that I was not familiar with working in 3-space or visualizing objects like paraboloids, cones, spheres, etc, by the end, I felt entirely comfortable with these objects and able to do and understand how to do calculus on them.",
    "Learned how to work with functions in three dimensional space and functions of multiple variables, as well as doing calculus on both types of functions.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned the basics to multi-variable calculus and learned how to compute scalar and vector line integrals, scalar surface integrals, flux integrals, and triple integrals through various methods. The class also sharpened my critical thinking skills when we had to analyze which methods we had to use to solve different integrals and allowed me to process different integral problems systematically in order to find the correct way to solve each one.",
    "I learned how to think math in 3D space",
    "I learned how to utilize partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, and more."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the Ximera site and recap videos are extremely helpful, there are lots of resources available to you, office hours are beneficial\r\nWeaknesses: the material wasn't presented in a very engaging way but it's kind of hard to make multivariable calculus fun",
    "Not all sections are made equal. There seems to be a great disparity between sections in terms of provided materials and quality of instruction. For example, some sections received detailed review sheets and section-only review sessions before exams, while other students were limited to only general review sessions open to all students. From an equity standpoint, this course seems weak.\r\n\r\nI thought that the course material presented was clear and interesting. The instructors do a good job of emphasizing what students need to know for exams, and there are quite a lot of materials available online to study. Given this, the differences in section quality are less serious.",
    "This course moves quickly. More examples would be helpful.",
    "I need to learn to absorb information more efficiently. My strength is ,however, always asking for help.",
    "The course is very well organized. It has very specific learning goals (which theorems to know, which types of problems to solve) and achieves them well. There are a lot of resources (practice problems, review sessions, Ximera), so any student who puts the effort in will be able to succeed.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that the real applications much of the material are only glancingly referenced, if at all. It is a math class, so the focus is on the math, but I think making some of the problems a little more physics oriented (at least in language if not in technique) might make it a little more interesting.",
    "I think Math 120 does sufficiently teach the general concepts to understand calculus in 2D and 3D. However, many sections are left out from the course due to the briefness of the course. For example, jacobians and limits of multiple functions were not taught but I thought those concepts are necessary to understand the nuances of certain concepts.",
    "It's a good math course for students who just got out of advanced high school math (BC calculus and the like) and are looking for something challenging and fun.",
    "Overall I think the course is a good one. It seems like they've made some good improvements from previous years in that they removed some material to make it more manageable.\r\n\r\nSome people say the course has a lot of variability depending on the instructor. My instructor (Ian) was very good though, and Sudesh was also great in the study sessions.",
    "Strengths  definitely a lot of resources to support you throughout the course, passionate teacher\r\n\r\nweaknesses  none in particular, thought it was very well taught",
    "There were many resources available to help students study for the exams and complete the psets. The peer tutor office hours and Ximera videos and practice modules were very helpful. I liked that there were many practice exams to use when studying and the review sessions run for the final were very helpful. I would suggest that the graders for the psets write more clearly, as when I went back and reviewed my graded psets I couldn't tell what I had gotten wrong.",
    "I thought the lectures were taught clearly and in an efficient manner. Overall, I don't think there were really any weaknesses, I really enjoyed the course.",
    "I think it was a pretty good course overall, strengths were the Ximera modules, and a good course structure\/ design in terms of content. Weaknesses would probably be the rapid pace at times, which probably cant be changed, and that we dont ever get a break from the psets (for instance, in other classes, there are no psets due either the week of, or the week after a midterm).",
    "I think more questions could be asked in class (calling on different people) making it more interactive",
    "I think the course had many more strengths than weaknesses. It was incredibly well structured; I felt like the ideas flowed in a nice order, that Ximera was amazingly helpful, and that starting each class with a summary of the previous content was very useful as well. I also liked the mix between computational and theoretical discussions. I also felt the workload was fair. The only weakness I can think of maybe the teaching of the material for the first midterm; I didn't feel like I had as good of a grasp of that stuff even though the material is much easier than what we do later in the course.",
    "The course flows well, everything in the course seems to come from the previous thing learned. The biggest weaknesses of the course are that the homework does a poor job of preparing students for exams, and there are few resources for student help outside of their professor's office hours.",
    "The strength of this course comes with the curriculum progression. The way the course is taught allows the material to flow smoothly and sets up for the next topic in order to make it easier to process. The way that we transitioned from double integrals to triple integrals in order to analyze divergence theorem and how that can be applied to go back and solve flux integrals eased the transition between the two. One of the weaknesses of this course comes from the disparity in the review sessions. Review sessions are not centralized so some review sessions come across as weaker than others because not everyone has the same review sheet and some review sessions do not go over everything needed. Similarly, another weakness occurs with the disparity in note-taking. Every section has similar general guides but the way the material is transferred can vary between sections and the understanding of the material can be weakened in some sections by the way each individual section is taught.",
    "It is well organized",
    "The amount of material covered is not too overwhelming, but I think more time\/focus could be put into the end material (stokes theorem, divergence theorem, etc.) as it is much more difficult conceptually."

   "comments": [
    "The weekly p-sets are totally manageable and office hours are helpful. I personally did not find the material\/teaching style very engaging but overall I think math 120 has a reputation that makes the class seem worse than it actually is.",
    "I think that students should be cautious when taking this course. I took this course because I was interested in math, not necessarily because I plan on becoming a mathematician, engineer, or anything remotely in a STEM field. During this course, I worried a lot about my preparation for exams, often struggled through material, and was frustrated to see differences in how sections were being taught. Taking this course is not worth the effort or worry unless you are very interested in the material or have to take this class to satisfy prerequisites.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they had already taken Calc BC or the equivalent. This class was intellectually challenging but in the end it was a very rewarding course and you can learn very valuable insights and mathematical techniques.",
    "This course was difficult. I would recommend it if they don't have to take it.",
    "Not if they werent interested in math. Its a lot for someone to just take for fun.",
    "I'd recommend the course. It's very manageable (it often feels like a high school math course with a quickened pace) and I believe it opens the door to a lot of other math or physics oriented subjects.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who do need to learn multivariable calculus--either for a prereq for advanced science classes such as physical chemistry or as a gateway to more advanced mathematics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes math.",
    "If you want to study math and multivariable calculus, then definitely yes. It is a pretty good class that teaches the material well. If you just want to take a QR credit, this class probably isn't for you. Also, think about why you want to take multivariable calculus: as a CS major, I came out of the class having learned a lot but not sure if I would ever apply a lot of what we had learned.",
    "yes  taught well, and chimera, lots of practice problems, etc. ensure your preparedness",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who needs it a prereq for their major. For someone who isn't interested in majoring in STEM, this course probably isn't for you.",
    "Yes, I thought that it was taught well and the information is important for many majors. The experience you have in the course really depends on your teacher though.",
    "Yes, if you require this for your major or just like math. Im personally still unsure about my major and just took the class to do more math, and Im ultimately glad I did. I think the concepts we learn are pretty cool and will probably be helpful later on. I also think its well organized, and Ximera is very helpful. I think the professor you get does matter, however, so I would keep that in mind. I had Ian and he was pretty great, it was also helpful to go to Sudeshs reviews because he simplifies and clarifies a lot of the concepts\/ method.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students who enjoy math and are willing to put in work to keep up with the course, regardless of whether they are going into a STEM field or not. I feel like the material of the course is very widely useful and can be applied to many subjects, and is interesting and not overly challenging,",
    "I would, if that student enjoyed math. For people who enjoy math it's extremely fascinating, but if you do not enjoy math, and especially if you have difficulty picturing three dimensional functions in your head than I would not recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning about multi-variable calculus. It has a good progression in terms of the material taught and generally the material builds off each other. Also, there are a lot of resources available so even if they begin to struggle they can talk to TA's, peer tutors, residential college tutors, or even private tutors. In addition, teachers regularly hold office hours which allow students to ask specific questions they need help on.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it, but mainly because it is a prerequisite course for many other math courses and contains important concepts for the future."
