                "Great assignments & great readings. Nothing felt like busy work.",
                "This course is based primarily around four essays, as well as a supplementary food film festival and in-class seminar. The seminar was stellar, and I felt that discussion was able to proceed mostly without any awkward pauses, and Professor Stuart is a great moderator able to provide helpful feedback on her courses. The biggest single change I could make would be changing the grade cutoff for an A from a 95 to a 94: While Professor Stuart is a reasonable grader and her critiques of student works are generally valid, this high requirement put a bit of excess stress on myself and those I talked to. Also, the blogs, while short, kind of seemed like busy work (although she did do a good job of integrating them into discussions). Besides that, she is a genuinely kind individual that is both knowledgeable about the works she teaches and highly receptive to the interests of the class.",

                "I would strongly recommend this course, but be warned that it is not a free fifth credit--it is an intensive English seminar with four highly edited essays that may prove difficult to students that do not really, really like food. That being said, Professor Stuart is a kind, intelligent teacher that was more flexible to times of COVID-19 than any other teacher, and she seemed aware at all times of our difficulties getting through the semester. Her flexibility in regards to our struggles made this course the only I truly looked forward to this semester, as it proved a welcome respite from my other courses being offered. Although this is not an easy A, if you share a true passion about food it is an excellent place for you to express it."
