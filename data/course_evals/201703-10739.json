    "This course is an independent research project (senior project). As such, I learned a lot of new tools and techniques, but as a function of what myself, my partner, and my advisor Professor Radev put into it.",
    "I became much better at managing deadlines, realistic expectations for emerging technologies, and project organization.",
    "How to build an application from conception to completion.",
    "I learned more about NLP and also about scientific writing.",
    "I learned how to read computer science papers and replicate the experiments and results. I learned about NLP, coreference, question answering, and machine learning!",
    "Working without a given schedule, syllabus, and task list, is perhaps the most useful skill one will practice in this course.",
    "Lots of practice finding papers, reading papers, and trying to implement the algorithms described."

I know Drago is incredibly busy, but maybe if I'd been assigned to work with a graduate student, it would have been helpful?",

    "Did it with Yang Yang, learned alot and had a ton of fun. Not too challenging but depends on the prof",
    "All majors have to do it",
    "Gotta do it.",
    "You have to take this course if you're a CS or EECS major, so yeah. That said, I found it so much more fulfilling to have a say in the research direction and then follow it (partly because I started this initially as a project under CPSC 473 Intelligent Robotics Lab, which had us proposing our own projects) -- it means you have to do a lot more self-guided learning and literature review, but you learn a lot along the way, and gain the kinds of skills that are needed for future research in grad school, etc. If you can a lab or adviser in advance, I also recommend doing some research over the summer before senior year -- it gives you so much more time to focus on just doing research and laying the foundations for you work over the semester, especially if the project requires a lot of backend programming."
