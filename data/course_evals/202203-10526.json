                "This course has placed my approach to performance in a new perspective. When rehearsing a song or other performative piece, I am now encouraged to draw from many different factors that play into the character, including the show's historical context, character motivations, relationships, setting, and many other elements. I feel confident approaching performance not just as a form of entertainment, but academic artistry. I have learned how to close read music and lyrics in a way that translates to physical performance.",

                "I refined my process of approaching a musical theater song for performance from working on my song assignments and watching Annette work with other students in class.",
                "This class was phenomenal. I loved the way Annette pushed us to interrogate the material in new ways. The questions she asked pushed us to go beyond the material and incorporate aspects of the period and artists style when laying the groundwork for a performance. As a performer, I now feel better equipped to handle any song or monologue.",
                "My acting improved so much",
                "I learnt how to break down a performance by looking at the lyrics, music, context, and purpose of each song."

I always felt encouraged and the criticism I received was consistently constructive and insightful. I think there could be potential room for improvement by at least one performance that is required to be a duet/trio, but that can become understandably difficult.",
                "Strengths: organized\r\nWeaknesses: the room the piano",
                "The strengths are getting to perform every other week for the class. It makes you a lot more comfortable singing and gives you guaranteed exposure and time to work. One weakness would just be minimal collaboration between students. Unless you ask to work with others, you dont really have much of an opportunity. I would love to see a duet assignment or something of that nature as a part of the course.",
                "I loved this class and learned so much from the class and professor. The location was not ideal, but we made it work and it was very fun to get to work with so many amazing people.",
                "The class is set up pretty regularly, where people work on their songs from different time periods. I think that sometimes the time periods felt constraining, especially since the most contemporary one had 40 years of material to choose from.",
                "While I loved Annettes workshopping style of teaching, I wish that we had had more time to discuss readings and listenings in class to help solidify their teachings. Also, while I appreciated the freedom in exploring different musicals on our own through listening logs, it would have been nice to have some guidance through the vast cannon of musical theater offerings (such as a weekly musical to be listened to and discussed for class). The style of this class that gave us the chance to workshop each song was very enjoyable. Overall, I loved this class!",
                "Annette is fantastic and incredibly insightful.",
                "The only weakness of the course was the readings - for someone with little knowledge on the history of musical theatre, the reading we often difficult to understand (due to the many references to plays and musicals that I did not know."

For those who are seriously considering further their study of musical theatre, this is an inspiring course that propels the student's confidence in abilities and knowledge of the field. It values the deeper aspects of a song that can be often overlooked. It is also a strong artistic community that furthers engagement with the arts at Yale.",
                "Yes. Its fun, but challenging in the best ways.",
                "I would definitely recommend. More than anything, the course is just very fun to participate in. Annette is an extremely experienced instructor and the class just feels very intimate and makes you comfortable performing.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I gained so much confidence and learned skills to be a better performer.",
                "Yes, absolutely! If you're interested in acting (or directing!) working with Annette is an absolute masterclass. You'll learn more about the MT canon, get into a routine of preparing material, and make more specific, intentional choices on your songs.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in theater and performance.",
                "I loved this course. You will learn so much from Annette.",
                "Yes, this class was so fun because it marries the theory of performance with the actual performance so well. Every class is like a showcase that you can learn so much from"
