            "comments": [
                "For an introductory course, it is pretty fast-paced and comprehensive without being confusing, since Professor JDRS breaks down the concept well by going through example datasets in class. The way he uses humor and actively engages with students definitely help make the material easy to connect to. The simultaneous live classes\/pre-recorded modules format makes it really flexible, so you can do whatever is the most convenient or motivates you to learn the most at any given time. The pset instructions provide instructions that make sense logically for the most part, but there are certain questions where the expectations of what details should be included in the answers are not stated clearly (office hours should help with this, although I did not feel too much of a need to attend them regularly). An area of improvement I see is that the course could incorporate the social sciences element more actively during the second half, because it was treated as a secondary concern, only included in a few example datasets.",
                "Strengths: low stress, JDRS is great\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes hard to understand why doing some of the things we do is relevant to real life when computers can do most of it",
                "The strengths were the online format, the interactive engagement through MINITAB and Professor JDRS! The weaknesses include that I don't find statistics particularly interesting but JDRS did a great job making me semi-interested",
                "Strength include a lot of office hours, and recordings of lectures that I can rewatch. Also, how we have a lot of time for exams, this is helpful because Im a slow test taker.",
                "More engagement",
                "All-online format was awesome and JDRS remained highly engaging even in the pre-recorded videos.",
                "It's so convenient that it is offered in so many formats and it allowed me to take it in a very busy semester. The Professor is definitely a strength, together with the fact that there's a lot of office hours.",
                "I enjoyed that this course had many options to learn, whether it was through in person lectures or via the recorded lectures that you are able to access at a later time",
                "Wish there were practice exams",
                "The course moved very quickly but information was well organized on Canvas",
                "I appreciated that Professor Reuning-Scherer offered the course in an asynchronous format, along with live lectures, as my schedule would have prevented me from going to classes in-person. I also liked how Professor Reuning-Scherer provided both his own office hours, as well as several other options for office hours throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is by far the biggest strength of the course! He is funny and engaging in lectures and makes statistics interesting with his comparisons and demonstrations. Other strengths were relevance of the material covered, flexibility in being able to either attend lectures live or watch pre-recorded modules, open-note exams(!), pretty straight-forward assignments overall\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not attending class makes you feel more disconnected from the experience and possibly not understand the material as deeply, easy to fall behind if you don't keep up with watching the lectures, the format of the exams made it so that a lot of questions were all or nothing",
                "The course was highly flexible, and the resources were incredible. The problem sets were instructive, and the low-stakes quizzes kept me on track. While I liked having options for learning the content, I wish that more people showed up to lecture rather than watching the pre-recorded videos.",
                "This course was great. I love that its asynchronous and the Profesor was great.",
                "The class is really well-structured, and the asynchronous component certainly helps with planning and scheduling one's semester. The modules include the professor explaining everything we need to know in a clear manner, and the number of office hours per week facilitate learning substantially.",
                "Strengths -- Easy and flexible with the asynchronous format, lots of office hours. JDRS office hours were especially helpful. Quizzes and homework assignments were a good reflection of course material, with consistent work load and ample time to complete.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Easy to fall behind with online instruction. Tests were mostly a fair representation of course material, but I was frustrated that there was non partial credit awarded. This seemed like a real failing point that resulted from the course's online format.",
                "The course was very well-organized, and there were many ways to go about it which was very helpful: it could be taken asynchronously or in-person, which was helpful when I couldn't attend class in person. The notes provided to us were super helpful as well, which aided in homework and exams. I am not particularly interested in statistics, but still did well in the class because of the great resources provided and the structure of the class.",
                "Excellent pedagogical organisation of the course (ability to engage with the course via pre-recorded or live lecture, variety of options for seeking help). Midterms, especially the second, would have benefitted from providing practice questions. Need an accountability measure for TAs to turn up to office hours.",
                "Strengths: extremely well organized course, good professor. Great intro to the field.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes not the most engaging.",
                "Strengths - Asynchronous course which means you could do it when it best worked with your schedule. JDRS is also such a great professor and willing to help whenever he can. Weakness - Really nothing! Other than just making sure you keep up with everything, the course is set up for student success.",
                "I really appreciated the multiple ways this course could be taken. Slides, live lectures, recordings of the live lectures, and module videos were provided on Canvas ahead of time. This convenience allowed me to be flexible when I could not make it to class and helped me work out what worked with my learning style. I also found the professor's teaching style clear and direct, making the content easier to digest. At the beginning of the course, TAs were very helpful and available to help students out. However, after sectioning off from the 100 level, some TAs would not show up to their assigned office hours almost weekly which made it hard to rely on the multiple office hours scheduled.",
                "Course is very well designed.",
                "It's asynchronous which is both a strength and a weakness. A strength because it allows you flexibility in learning the content, but a weakness because it's very easy to fall behind.",
                "Strengths: The office hour availability and the 3 mediums in which to engage in class with. Weaknesses: None.",
                "One strength of this class is that the lectures were recorded, allowing students to get clarification on concepts we may not have understood after hearing it one time and providing another way to review class material. Another strength of this class was the availability of the professor and TFs. Lectures were also relatively engaging due to the professor.",
                "Strengths: Being able to watch lectures virtually and asynchronously was amazing, because I could pause and go back when something did not make sense to me, instead of sitting confused in a hall for the rest of the lecture. This greatly benefitted my learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "It gave me a great introduction to many different topics in statistics. However, many of the teaching assistants were not that helpful. With good intentions in mind, they would refrain from giving the answers to students, figuring it would be best for them to figure things out on their own. However, I feel that they would be better off giving tiny hints to students. Additionally, if a student is really struggling, the TA should feel comfortable helping them out even more. There shouldn't be a fixed limit in the amount of information a TA can give. Otherwise, their \"help\" lacks the necessary personalization for students to improve. This is especially so as the class moves very quickly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I really loved how the teacher was very engaging. I feel encouraged to continue tacking statistics classes.",
                "Strengths: easily accessible course materials and content\r\nWeaknesses: exams could be easy to cheat on and looking at other people's grades compared to the people I knew in the class who weren't cheating, it seemed like there might have been a decent amount of cheating going on",
                "Strengths: available in multiple formats, this allows us to have a reference at all times. Professor made the content as engaging as statistics could possibly be. Weaknesses: went very very fast, but such is the nature of having to get through so much content.",
                "I loved the opportunity to take the entire course asynchronously! This helped me pace the material, keep up with homework, and learn class material at a pace which was best for my learning style. JDRS's lectures are amazing, and I feel like complicated material was always taught in an easy-to-understand way. I loved this class!",
                "Having never taken a statistics class before, I loved my introduction this semester. The workload was extremely manageable, yet not so light that I didnt feel I was retaining the material. When I began the final, I was surprised by how much I had learned in so short a time. JDRS is one of the most engaging teachers or Professors I have ever had, and his way of making you have fun while learning was so appreciated. I dont know if I would have enjoyed stats as much as I did without JDRS as the prof. Thanks for a great semester!",
                "Strength: Virtual Format makes it better for many students to progress on their own.",
                "Online makes it at my pace",
                "I think the main strength is JDRS's teaching. He is quite animated and attention-keeping. I think the main weakness is content disorganization. The Canvas site and office hours are extremely well organized, but the presentation of the content itself felt disorganized. It felt like each day we would dive into some rabbit hole of complex math, then another rabbit hole the next day, without knowing how the rabbit holes were connected to each other. I think that the math could also have been presented in a simpler and clearer way. Having finished the course, I can say that I remember little to none of the math behind the statistics functions. All I remember is how to work Minitab to carry out the functions.",
                "The strength is the ability to do it asynchronously a weakness is that sometimes the TFs didnt know what they were doing",
                "Strengths engaging with peers at office hours",
                "Strengths: the lecture format and the easy communication style",
                "I really like how the course is taught in many formats. I also enjoy the amount of help that is offered.",
                "Really appreciated the accessibility of the lectures and office hours \r\n\r\nNo improvements possible in this regard.",
                "I like how the course could be taken online, but that is also a weakness because I would get behind on material if I wasn't on top of it.",
                "JDRS is a great professor and keeps things really engaging. He makes it really easy to do well (tons of office hours, multiple assignments so nothing is weighed too heavily, etc.)",
                "The strengths of this course are the asynchronous option for the class and the high amount of office hours. There are no glaring weaknesses for the course.",
                "Great instructor, clear instructions. Does move very fast.",
                "I loved how it was asynchronous so I could still see all of the material while traveling for sports",
                "Loved the different options to take it online or in person., Strength is the TAs. Go to office hours to work on the homework.",
                "I enjoyed how you could complete the course at your own pace and there was lots of material available if you needed extra review.",
                "Strengths: the asynchronous format of this course is a particular strength--the flexibility makes it much easier to adapt the class to your schedule and review the material. Downloadable PDFs of the notes, and the low academic weight of quizzes (given that they're low-stress, they are really useful for review) are also helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the class moves incredibly fast--if I hadn't taken AP Stats in high school, I think I would have struggled far more with the concepts--and sometimes it took multiple days\/questions to get a question answered on gradescope, or an extension request granted.",
                "Make psets more similar to exam format.",
                "Not engaging and there were unclear expectations on what exams would look like. A strength was how many resources there were, but there were lots of TAs that did not show up to office hours or didnt understand the material themselves. There were also very unclear expectations on what the homework needed to include.",
                "I thought this course was exactly what I expected it to be. Taught me what I needed to do.",
                "A strength of this course was its hybrid format. That allowed me to be really flexible with my schedule which was nice. A weakness was that the lectures were not really interactive (maybe because I never attended in person).",
                "I think that this course offers a lot of resource to help student effectively understand statistics, however i think a weakness is that sometimes the office hours would get cancelled too much."

                "Yes the assignments and exams were very straightforward and not too difficult to get through",
                "Yes, JDRS is a great professor and the availability of lectures online made it possible for me to go back through concepts I didnt understand at first",
                "Yes, the course was well organized",
                "If you're genuinely interested in statistics, I would recommend this course. Some PSETs and exam material can be a bit challenging, but if you're willing to put in the work and make sure you do not fall behind in the material, I would say the course is worth taking. Professor Reuning-Scherer, as well as the TAs, do offer lots of support via office hours, which definitely helped make the course more approachable as someone who isn't particularly interested in STEM.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in having a foundation in statistics for future work, research, or classes.",
                "Yes definitely! JDRS is an amazing professor! He is really funny and engaging, and he knows how to explain concepts in a simple and interesting way, even acknowledging when a specific part of a lecture may be a bit more challenging. Most of the material in the course feels very useful and relevant, and I really enjoyed the use of Minitab. The exams were generally straight-forward and awesome that they were open note exams! Though the only downside is that they are all multiple choice or short answer where you can only enter your final answer. You have the option to upload your work, but because of the nature of the questions, they were really all-or-nothing questions where if you got a question wrong, you'd lose all of the points. If you choose to only watch the pre-recorded modules like I did, don't make the mistake of falling behind on them because it's a total pain to catch up on 4 lectures. Overall, this is a great intro stats course where you learn useful information with a wonderful professor. Great course if you're looking for a relatively easy QR credit that isn't too much work!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides a great introductory look at stats - perfect if you have no background or if you want to brush up.",
                "Yes if interested",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Knowing the fundamentals of this course is really useful no matter what you do, and JDRS does a great job explaining them.",
                "For anyone who needs a QR credit or needs to take a stats course, I absolutely recommend this class. A lot of material was covered, but learning it was still very easy: it was overall a great introduction to stats, and for a QR class was not bad at all! The professor was very helpful, there were always convenient office hours available by him or TFs, and there were many other helpful resources made available.",
                "If needed for a major requirement, or if you have any interest in stats, then yes.",
                "Yes, it's a great intro to statistics.",
                "Yes! It is a good introduction to statistics and provides a pretty good fundamental basis to statistics. Just keep up with the work and you will be good!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started with statistics. It is a great introductory-level statistics course and familiarizes you with some of the common programming tools and methods used in statistical analysis.",
                "YES! It was a great introduction\/refresher on basic statistics. JDRS is a great professor and really breaks down the subject into manageable pieces in this class.",
                "yes, if you need a QR. It is a good practical course and leaves some leniency for people who are not as well-versed in math.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is seeking an introduction to statistics because the professor is very engaging and teaches the class material in an understandable way.",
                "I would. It was a relatively low-stress class and looking back I learned a lot. I now often catch myself thinking about things using the statistical frame that I learned in this class.",
                "Absolutely! I was say it is a great way to, at the very least, earn a QR credit.",
                "Yes, definitely. I'm a cog sci major and this made me understand other people's research much better and plan out my own research.",
                "b",
                "If you don't have to, probably not. The course runs through material incredibly quickly and that makes it hard to keep up with. However, if you are in between different stats courses, do take this one. The professor is great.",
                "Yes! This is a fantastic class for any basic statistics requirement for many majors. I took this course asynchronously the whole semester, which was such a weight off my shoulders in a busy semester. Lectures are easy to follow, homework assignments progress in difficulty slowly (and never become too difficult), and JDRS is a wonderful teacher.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in statistics who hasn't yet gotten an introduction. A great course, all around!",
                "Yes. I think this course is a very flexible alternative, which makes it better than all other into stats courses.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wants a general understanding of statistics and ways to analyze data.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes it is a good QR to take and useful",
                "No because the course was too self led",
                "Yea",
                "Yes! This course is great for learning foundational skills in statistics.",
                "Yes. Relatively self-paced yet accessible, this course was a great introduction to QR as a humanities-centered student.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in the time to go to office hours and actually attend lecture.",
                "This is definitely a good class to take if youre looking for a useful QR.",
                "Yes, I would. The topics were interesting, and the class experience was positive.",
                "Yes, great intro course for anyone who has a basic math background but hasnt taken stats",
                "Absolutely. I think statistics is very interesting and this is a great way to get into it",
                "Yes, not too difficult, but learned a lot. Definitely go to office hours for the hw.",
                "yes, if you need a statistics credit this one is easy and if you don't have much background in statistics it is a good intro.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an overview of statistics and social-science relevant statistics, with three stipulations:\r\n1. It really helps if you've previously taken stats or AP stats in high school. You will grasp concepts more quickly and thoroughly (unlike high school stats classes, you will have to calculate very few things by hand, it's much more about comprehension and application using the relevant stats programs), which is INCREDIBLY helpful given how quickly the class moves through various topics. If you're unsure about whether you can keep up\/have enough background knowledge, I'd recommend auditing the course a semester before you plan to actually take it, or taking it while keeping the option of dropping it open. \r\n2. Familiarize yourself with the course structure beforehand, and make sure you have a lot of time for it in your schedule. Intellectually, this isn't an unreasonably challenging\/painful course. The concepts aren't hard to grasp, but the work takes up a lot of time, if you're trying to do it and do it well, and it can be difficult to adjust to a steady weekly rhythm. I highly recommend the pre-recorded modules as opposed to the live lectures, which allow you to really go at your own pace, break learning\/studying down into more manageable chunks, and review more easily. \r\n3. Take this with friends! Or make some friends to study with in class. Get help early and often, and help each other.",
                "If they want a basic introduction into statistics but at a fast pace, yes.",
                "I think its a good introduction to statistics",
                "Yes. If they need to learn about stats.",
                "I would recommend this course. Unlike the other Stats 100 courses, you have the option of doing it asynchronously. Plus the final exam is online, open-book, and asynchronous.",
                "Anyone who wants to dip their toe into basic statistics, yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students because I think statistics like coding is an essential skill to have and I cannot think of a better intro course than this.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as I think you acquire many valuable skill sets from it."
