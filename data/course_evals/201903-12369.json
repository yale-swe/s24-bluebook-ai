    "We learned about the modern history of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia from the Great Game (a cold war of sorts between the British and the Russians over Central Asia in the 19th century) until today.",
    "I gained a basic history of Central Asia and its interactions with the Great Powers over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. I learned, broadly, what the imperial powers sought with their holdings in Iran and Afghanistan and how that shaped the world today.",
    "This course is great for developing historical research skills. Professor Amanat is really great about directing the final paper and helping to find resources.",
    "This course focused on great power interference in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia and how such interference has shaped Iranian history. We specifically delved into the British-Russian rivalry and the role of the United States.",
    "Introduction to modern history of Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. Focus more on the first two than the latter",
    "This class provided insight into Iran, with emphasis on the Great Game power struggle between Britain and Russia."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is interesting and class discussions were engaging. The reading assignments were also interesting, but I believe the course would be better if the readings were cut in half, at least. I believe that I and other students would have done the readings more consistently, gotten more out of them, and had more to say in class if they were more manageable.",
    "The strengths are in the syllabus and Professor Amanats guidance with the final paper. The readings, while way too long, were good and Professor Amanat is friendly and really keen to help students learn. The discussions were often dry or dominated by certain students, and it was apparent that many did not do the readings (simply because they were way too long).",
    "The timeline of this course makes a lot of sense, and the readings are really interesting. The class dialogue gets steadily better, as with most seminars. \r\n\r\nThe course could be more structured with clearer deadlines and assignment expectations.",
    "Professor clearly very knowledgeable and attracts dedicated students. Readings were very comprehensive. Sometimes could go on tangents. Some of the Great Game sections in the beginning seemed a little repetitive. Odd that participation counts for so little in a seminar.",
    "Way too much reading, long student presentations, too much reading from his own book",
    "Strengths: Professor Amanat is lovely and knowledgeable! It was a pleasure to take his class. He was so kind and accommodating, and I learned so much in this class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized! I had a very hard time finding instructions for assignments, and expectations for assignments (word length, style of paper, prompt, etc.). Due dates were frequently changed. This was quite frustrating and stressful, since I often didnt know how long a paper was supposed to be or what to write about."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the subject or want to learn about a part of history that is new to you, I certainly would.",
    "I would recommend Professor Amanat, but perhaps not the course. He is very helpful one on one, but sometimes he would lecture too much in class.",
    "Absolutely.  For any student interested in leaving Yale with a solid understanding of Iran's modern history, this course is a must.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as this class provided great insight into how foreign interference has shaped contemporary Iranian politics.",
    "Yes for access to information that gives a comprehensive overview of the region in question and dedicated students. Participants benefit greatly from prior knowledge of the region, but course doesnt assume it.",
    "No, it was impossible to do the readings, discussion was overtaken by the student presentation and the professors own opinion",
    "Yes, I would. This was a fun and interesting class. You will learn a lot about Iranian history, culture, and economy in the context of the Great Game. Professor Amanat is truly wonderful to learn from. For him alone, this class was awesome."
