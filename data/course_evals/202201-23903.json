I think I got much better at all of these skills. I also learned a lot about South Asian inequity and the systems / institutions that propagate it. The class approached life in South Asia from a wide variety of perspective, which was super conducive to having a large and contextual understanding of South Asia.",

                "There's a lot of reading each week but it's all very interesting. Try to start the final paper when Shivi indicates on the syllabus  it's tough to start in conjunction with other classes' work.",
                "Strength: thematic readings and weeks were a good structure I think!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often 100+ pages of reading a week",
                "I thought the course dealt with a lot of interesting ideas, but did not quite explore them with much depth or nuance. I think a lot of this was due to the way classes were run the professor lectured a lot or went on very long tangents, which although interesting, did not allow for much student engagement",
                "A strength of the course is how you are assessed. Reading responses are not of super high importance (like they don't have to be the most high quality writing) but are a good way to ensure participation if participating in class is harder. There are only two essays and I think they are a great way to delve into what interests you about the class, which makes them interesting and not too taxing. A weakness of this course is that it can be boring, especially during some discussions. Also there is so much reading that it is nearly impossible to get through, so you will have to read what you can and use that information for discussion and participation.",
                "I really loved this class. I think the main strength is that it was such a small group of students, and that we sat around one table and discussed during class. I liked getting to know my classmates and sharing in such an intimate learning environment. I also really liked the style of the course where Shivi gave a mini-lecture for the first 30 or so minutes, then students presented, then we all discussed. I think it made the course engaging and broke up what could otherwise be a very long section. I think a weakness of the class is that there were a TON of readings, often too many for me to get through (or at least read fully) in a given week."

                "Yes! Shivi is very knowledgeable and very insightful. Plus, the readings he curates are often spectacular and renewed my interest in urban studies.",
                "Shivi is a brilliant and kind instructor. He's a leader in his field, producing and advising some really great research in South Asian Studies/EVST/Anthropology and yet so incredibly generous with his time and mentorship. Cannot recommend taking a course with him enough.",
                "Yes! A fantastic opportunity to learn more about South Asian cities",
                "This was a really tight-knit, interesting seminar covering various issues of urbanism in South Asia. At its best, the class featured really interesting anthropology readings that let you learn a lot about specific aspects of South Asian urban culture; at its worst, some readings were very dry and full of anthropological jargon. I had no background in anthropology before the course began, but I managed all right. Some familiarity with Indian history and culture (not necessarily a class) will definitely help you when it comes to understanding cultural nuances like the caste system, terms like Dalit and Adivasi, etc.",
                "This course is a good way to get a basic understanding of some key issues in urban India  but it might not be for those looking to specialise in certain areas or those who are already familiar with such issues, since it doesn't offer any big novel insights or skills",
                "Yes, if you are interested in issues of South Asia. This is a great course for developing anthropological reading and research skill and learning a lot about South Asia. The readings. can be pretty dense and long though so keep that in mind.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student (and already have!). I think Shivi is a fantastic instructor and he creates a really special learning experience in this class. I feel like this is one of the few courses I've taken in my life that not only furthers my concrete academic goals, but actually improves the way I think about and comprehend the world as a human being. It's really fun to learn about history and other cultures through people's stories."
