Readings exemplify a commitment to understanding the full story of the events that took place on this territory by breaking down colonial narratives. This class helps put Ukraine's history into the context of all of its neighbors throughout its tumultuous history.",
                "Knowledge of the history of Ukraine and Eastern Europe, became stronger in studying historical dates and terms",
                "you learn a TON about the history of ukraine, as well as the historical theory of nation-statehood, development of nations, historical storytelling, etc.",
                "A deep history of the lands that form Ukraine. The course did a great job discussing thematic trends as well as covering all important events in Ukraine since the formation of Rus in the 900s.",
                "A fantastic overview of Ukrainian history as an essential context for Russia's aggression in the country in the 21st century. Gained a much better understanding of modern European history through a different lens than usual. Interesting observations also about the emergence of the EU, Prussia, Poland, the catholic and orthodox church, Russian imperialism, and much more.",
                "I learned about Ukrainian history starting with the earliest inhabitants all the way up to the current war.",
                "Learned lots of history and context of the last hundred years",
                "Snyder's lecture served as an extremely valuable space because it challenged otherwise entertained \"suspended realities\" in academia. No class went without mentioning the ongoing war in Ukraine. The space was one with heavy emotions looming overhead. It's the only class I have ever had where the final lecture ended with tears-- my own, my peers, and the professors as well. Words won't do the course justice, it left an indelible impression on my academic experience. Even if I did poorly on the midterm and found it kind of hard. This was not a class about grades. Or trivia facts about Ukrainian history. It truly broadened my undersanding of the world, and how I will view state affairs moving forward because of the mortal stakes at hand.",
                "This course provides a comprehensive overview of Ukrainian history.",

                "I learned more than I could have possibly imagined about Ukrainian history and its relationship to world history more broadly. There were innumerable intersections between history as I knew it and the history of Ukraine; truly a fascinating course."

                "The lectures are fantastic. The seamless transition between states and periods of time allowed to see the full picture of events taking place. The professor's deep understanding of the cultural nuances of the country helped convey concepts more fully to the students. Some of the lectures didn't necessarily align with the planned material, but this may be because this class was taught for the first time this semester.",
                "The course was super interesting but was also very fast-paced and covered an amount of material that was often overwhelming or impossible to keep up with. The fact that the course was being recorded was not inherently an imposition, but I do wonder how the course might have been different were the students the only ones watching.",
                "strengths: it's interesting and relevant; weaknesses: the lectures felt very hard to follow and all over the place, it's a ton of material (~3000 years) and can feel super overwhelming if you don't have any background studying this region, and the content often felt disorganized and not fully chronological (skipping around)",
                "At times there was just too much reading for the average Yale student to get done in a week, but picking and choosing the most important ones worked for me. I thought that sections could have been geared slightly more to be a discussion rather than a lecture. Snyder's lectures were always incredibly engaging.",
                "Excellent prof and teaching staff!!",
                "Amazing lectures, wonderful discussion sections with expert Teaching Fellows. Could be improved by modifying the reading load to a more reasonable extent or at least directing students to which readings are the most important. The current system/amount is a little overwhelming and even counterproductive.",
                "Snyder is a very engaging lecturer and the content was very relevant. It was often hard to study for the exams because they required a level of specificity that wasn't taught in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: good lectures by snyder, textbook readings were interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: section was boring and not helpful. Guest lectures were not instructional, and the textbooks he had us read were low in content",
                "I think the midterm took everyone by surprise, there could be a greater emphasis concerning what information we are responsible for.",
                "It's strengths are the lectures and its TAs. Prof. Snyder is an amazing storyteller/lecturer and his team of TAs were extremely knowledgeable. The main weakness of the course was that it was just a mess and maybe because it was too ambitious or hard. It was frequently the case that the lecture was in a different place chronologically than the reading and what we were going over in section. For students without a background in the area, putting over 1000 years of history of a large country into one semester is brutal. Hopefully this will improve if it's taught again.",
                "Professor Snyder is a phenomenal lecturer because he can tell (and write) captivating stories. Each lecture was distinctive and equally fascinating in their own ways. The readings, however, were way too much for a lecture course. We had multiple weeks with whole books assigned, which was simply untenable in a lecture class for weeks on end. In the future, the readings should be adjusted to match the structure of the course."

The class gives a very thorough understanding of a subject that spans a very long time period. Readings tend to ramp up as the semester goes on, but it is very helpful in getting the historical context for much of the material described in class.",

                "Absolutely! A fantastic course. Lectures felt like a podcast.",
                "Yes! Professor Snyder explains the concepts crucial to the area's history better than perhaps anybody and communicates clearly ideas that are of importance to the rest of Europe and the whole world. Especially critical now with the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war.",
                "Yes because the information is very interesting and relevant, for both history majors and others.",
                "Yes! Snyder is great and you learn a lot",
                "I think everyone at Yale should take Snyder's class as least once. Even if it isn't your style, it's relevant. The course is only as hard as you want it to be. I don't think that anyone get's bad grades, even if the midterm is daunting, the final isn't. There is a deep mutual respect and appreciation for anyone taking the time to learn history that challenges our prior-held narratives.",

                "I would recommend this course to students who have a background in Eastern European history and are eager to learn more. I would caution the average student, even the average history major, thinking of taking it as in order to do well in the class you must put in a lot of work and the organization of the course does not help you.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Ukrainian (or really any) history. Be wary of the reading load though and consider credit-D if they aren't shortened significantly."
