I learned SolidWorks and more about CADing parts. I learned about current research in robotics, including about topics like agricultural robots, surgical robots, space robotics, robot abuse, and delivery robots. I learned how to put together a 15-20 minute lecture about a research topic and how to effectively read research papers. I learned how to use pre-trained neural networks and RealSense cameras."

It was also hard to find workarounds for hardware/software that we may have needed but didn't realize we needed until it was too late in the semester.",
                "I really enjoyed the fact that the class is a seminar course in addition to the project, and the materials and topics we covered were very important",
                "I like the format of the course a lot. Each lecture consists of a 15-20 minute student presentation on a current robotics research topic, followed by a relevant class discussion. You do one hands-on lab project (in a group) over the course of the whole semester, which means you have lots of room to be creative and build or study something that's interesting to you. Advising by Scaz and Debasmita is superb (and also rigorous).\r\nFeedback could be improved; you don't get any feedback about your presentation which I think would have been nice. The only real feedback you get is after each check-in presentation, which is not often. But that feedback is good feedback."

                "Yes, it's a challenging course but you can learn a great deal",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you love project-based courses or have an idea for a robotics project with useful applications that you want to realize. There are no exams and you won't receive any grades throughout the course, so keep that in mind. But this class lets you be creative. It'll also teach you a lot about how the Internal Review Board approval process works. That process can be a pain. This course also gives you the opportunity to do a real human subjects study and write a real conference-level research paper! And there's a big budget for ordering hardware."
