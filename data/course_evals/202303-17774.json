                "Strengths: wonderful readings\r\nWeaknesses: one of the most disorganized classes I have taken at Yale (if not for the TA)",
                "I thought that the readings for this course were spectacular and relevant in helping us improve upon our skills in reading critically. I enjoyed the fictional readings and learned a lot from the theory / literary criticism pieces. \r\n\r\nThe greatest issue with this class is that we were chronically off-schedule. Although readings would be assigned for a particular day, the likelihood of covering all of the content for the week was very slim. The seminar was thus rather disorganized, and we would often not even discuss readings that were assigned for that week.",
                "The strengths of this course are the syllabus, the student's knowledge (since many students in Comparative Literature must take the course and are well-versed in this topic), and the teacher's assistant's involvement. In particular, the criticism and the literary works on the syllabus were highly engaging and interesting, but when we were in class together, the structure used to discuss these works was flawed. For example, students were asked to give presentations 5-10 min explaining the works we had read, which often resulted in rushed explanations of complex works, leaving students confused about the content we had just read/discussed. Also, I believe that a clearer structure and timeline of the content we were discussing would have been very helpful for students to hold on to as we discussed works that should be understood in their historical context and period. In other words, I think that the weakness of this course was a general lack of an overarching structure for students to use as guidance for topics that are complex and difficult to follow. Also, the writing prompts were always the same for all of the essays we wrote, and they could have been more engaging, which would have encouraged students to be more involved in the content and essay-writing process.",
                "More systematic theory.",
                "Given previous reviews of this class, I believe this semester was an improvement in terms of class discussions, however it still felt like more of a lecture than a seminar at times. I think I would have enjoyed the class better if we kept to the schedule on the syllabus more rigidly and if we were given more time to discuss each text equally. The essay prompts were also all the same and that got a bit repetitive. Some pros were that office hours with both the Professor and TA were quite helpful and I liked how each student would present on the readings."
