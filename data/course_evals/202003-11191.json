Along with broadening my knowledge of Chinese characters, through the activities and homework in the class I was able to incorporate my new vocabulary into conversation and writing. I was also able to improve greatly in my speaking, listening, and reading. This course has made me more excited about learning Chinese and connecting back to my family's culture.",

This course material covered was actually developed in such a way to be useful, even to a relatively moderate\/high level Chinese speaker. Typing and conversing in Chinese were also developed.",

                "Prof Xu made the class very engaging, and gave us opportunity to practice speaking. The vocabulary we learn is also useful in discussing events in daily life.",
                "This class was fantastic. I think its hard to teach over zoom,but Xu Laoshi did a fantastic job keeping us engaged, being funny, sharing anecdotes, and being patient and understanding. The pace of learning can be really really rapid (we learned SO many words) but it ramps up in a reasonable way. Weaknesses- not much, I really think the class was good. Sometimes the weird canvas post hw was weird (the things where we had to critique a movie), just because there was no time to really read 100+ comments...",
                "Xu laoshi was very good at maintaining a high level of energy even through Zoom, and she made sure everyone was involved in discussions in class. The class was very well organized and since it was taught over Zoom, the Chinese teachers adjusted the course content to make learning online more manageable while still teaching a significant amount of content. In terms of weaknesses, there were moments in class when we were covering grammar or vocabulary and it would be a bit dry. Also, the grades listed on Canvas often do not reflect your actual grade due to the way the professors calculate grades (a lot of the assignments we had to do were listed as 10 points out of 0 points total and skewed grades above 100), which can be a bit annoying.",
                "I think the class time could be spent a little more productively",
                "Strengths - very good teacher, quite interactive for an online course\r\nWeaknesses - less opportunities to handwrite characters",
                "Strengths:\r\nI really liked the format of pre-learning phrases and other material before class began, and going reviewing important vocabulary during class instead of being taught less organically. I also enjoyed the small class size, because I was able to participate in class and interact more with the professor and my classmates. Additionally, I liked the group project at the end of class, and I felt that the daily quizzes were a good test of my understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSince this was a language class, I think that the online format made it more difficult to have conversations and immerse ourselves in the discussion. However, in a normal year, this wouldn't be the case.",
                "Professor Xu was a wonderful teacher that really made the class engaging and fun.",
                "The course material was structured to be useful outside of the class setting; personally, this has been a strength of this course, since I have used the course material outside of class as well. Discussions are interesting, however virtual format makes discussions difficult to facilitate due to the virtual nature of the class. More clarity in coursework expectations would have been appreciated as well; for example, the instructors notified us that we could earn 'bonus' points for some assignments, which seemed to imply that these assignments were optional, when they in fact factored into participation grades. Better communication in the case of coursework in these cases could have been improved. Overall, instructors were very passionate and helpful in their teaching, and the course was fun and interesting in itself.",

Since most of the classes were lecture-based and covered grammatical structures and vocabulary, it did feel a bit monotonous and boring at times.",

More small discussion groups in breakout rooms would have been preferred, as these allowed for more discussion and were generally less awkward than large group discussions.",

I also learned so much new vocabulary and feel like my Chinese has improved significantly over this past semester. The work was very manageable, and the professor was extremely kind and accessible. One important thing to keep in mind is that paying attention and taking notes during class lectures is essential- lots of the exam questions required you to understand small differences between two vocabulary words or when to use certain grammatical structures that were mentioned during class time.",
