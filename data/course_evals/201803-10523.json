    "This was a senior requirement for Architecture Design track. It was a great experience but a lot of work.",
    "If you really dont use a computer in this studio as Turner emphasizes, you will learn a lot about how you work and think. It was definitely a slow process but worth it. \r\n\r\nUnlike other undergrad studios that are structured around design exercises that eventually build up to a large project, this one focuses on actual buildings which is refreshing.",
    "Obviously, this is a design studio, so you're developing your design skills, but more than any other studio we've had so far in the major, Turner's studio brings a human sensitivity to the process of design that stretches beyond the process or concept based methods we've learned in the past."

   "comments": [
    "I wish we had more time on the final project, especially since it was a very real problem that we were trying to address. I felt like I didn't have the required level of skill or knowledge to produce the building that was being asked of us and in the end the projects varied greatly from each other in terms of depth.",
    "A strength of the course is the amount of time to work on an assignment and generous amount of one-on-one time we have with the instructor.  \r\n\r\nAn area of improvement could be more structured use of that time. The freedom allows for complete exploration of our ideas when used wisely but often the Friday sections felt a bit long and unstructured. It would be nice to have presentations or skill-based workshops from TFs during section.",
    "The advice given for specific projects was really good, but there wasn't a lot of overall advice on things we needed to improve on in our design process (models, drawings, etc.).",
    "I thought that the three projects this semester allowed me to really stretch my skills more than studios have in the past, though I wasn't the only student frustrated with the way our final project was coordinated--the quick succession of deadlines early on in the project meant that students didn't have much time to develop their schemes, which was frustrating given the gravity of the project.",
    "As with all studios, the timing of the projects could sometimes be an issue - there would be weeks with little to do and weeks where 40+ hours were required. Some of this is due to the nature of architecture as a field of study, but perhaps setting clearer intermediary steps for projects would be good."
