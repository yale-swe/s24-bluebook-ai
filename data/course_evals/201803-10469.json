    "I learned a lot about the theoretical applications behind statistics in the first half of the course, understanding WHY certain tests were used and what they meant; the second half of the course, the theoretical applications of the statistics became more difficult to understand and I mostly learned about the use of the online Statpack JMP which we learned to use. Interesting knowledge about pottery inclusions, hafting techniques used on arrow shafts, and Mongolian khirigsuurs (and other fabulous stories regarding Professor Honeychurch's life and research)."

    "Definitely. However, a student wishing to take this class should definitely have experience in archaeology. Little mathematics preparation is required but knowledge of archaeological techniques and vocabulary is strongly encouraged. The final paper requires application of statistics using real data gleaned from personal projects or colleagues' projects."
