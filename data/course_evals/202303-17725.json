                "good",
                "Yes, I would. I think learning about ASL as a distinct language and Deaf culture is definitely worthwhile. Sure, Prof. Rubin's a bit more particular about student participation than some of the other ASL lectors, but all within reason. As long as you do your assigned work and actively engage\/ pay attention in class, it'll all be smooth sailing!"
