You may understand the problem completely at times while other times, it will take hours of your time to even think about the problem. You spend the day thinking about the problem and eventually, you will get there, either by thinking about it for long hours or getting some assistance during office hours. Additionally, it covers everything a fluid mechanics class would teach plus more! Some essential topics covered intensively in the course are the mathematical background required for the class, Couette flow, the Navier Stokes equations, the Bernoulli equation, Macroscopic balances, creeping flow, lubrication flow, boundary layer flow, and inviscid flow, just to name a few!."

I actually connected with my classmates, with my professor, and with the TA, and I gained problem solving skills not just by cramming notes or looking online or reading a book and it was really rewarding. This is the only class that actually pushes you to learn instead of cram in the major.",
                "Professor Vanderlick hands down is the best part of this course. The way she assigned PSETs and the way she gave lectures only fostered learning and collaboration. Not a weakness and more of a warning but you will be thinking about this class every single day!",
                "Perfect class best Ive taken. No weaknesses",
                "The structure of the course was great -- it really rewards you if you're willing to just put in the effort, and there's never a point where you can't turn your grade around!!! The content and hard, and Prof. Vanderlick teaches it in a way that if you try, you're going to learn, and your grade will also reflect that.",
                "Material was presented well and in a logical progression",
                "Strengths include the lectures and pacing of material. Weaknesses include the copious homework, punitive HW grading, unforgiving exam grading, lack of recorded lectures or notes for students who have to miss class, and lack of a main source textbook.",
                "VANDERLICK, the best professor I've had that pushed my boundaries to continue learning. Her lectures are on point and the material covered is quickly reviewed in homework assignments due by the 3rd business day. Vanderlick is amazing and there are plentiful amounts of office hours. Just make sure to ask the right questions when going into office hours!",
                "The problems are good for making sure we keep up with the course material, but sometimes I feel like they are due a little too frequently. Also, since you  only need 75% of points to drop an exam, and the problems don't otherwise count towards your final grade, if you have a lot of points stocked up, there's not a lot of motivation to do them. As a result, it can be easy to fall behind, or just skip all the problems on a certain topic. I think it would be better if the problems did count towards at least a small proportion of our grade, in addition to the exam dropping policy. \r\n\r\nWe also had a second threshold where you had to do 75% of the problems after a certain date if you wanted to drop the 3rd exam, which I felt like was unfair to students who did do well on the first two exams of the term, especially given that there are fewer \"easy points\" in the second threshold, and just far fewer problems. The problems were also quite hard, so even if you did do them to the best of your ability, there was a lot of doubt as to whether or not you would get full points on them. The whole point of the 75% is to give students some flexibility, but people who did well in the beginning of the semester didn't have close to as much as those who wanted to drop one of the first two exams. Though I understand that the second threshold is there to make sure people who have a lot points keep up at the end, so I feel like having a threshold is find, but I think it should apply to everyone who wants to drop any one of the three exams and start a little earlier. \r\n\r\nBesides how the homework works, I think the course content is very organized and taught well."

This class is hard and will kick your butt (it did for me) but it is worth it. You will learn way more about what it means to be an engineer and think like one in this class. Professor Vanderlick is a source of knowledge and Yale is so fortunate to have her.",
                "Yes",
                "All the students taking this course probably are required to take it, so I would say that I loved this course. It's one of those classes that really reminds you why you're in school in the first place -- you learn to think and solve problems that are truly such real world problems. Nothing in this course feels pointless, and it's the perfect class for someone who wants to be an engineer because they like problem solving!!",
                "Only if required for your major",
                "If you have to take this class (or the MechE fluids), then this one was taught well and everything was interesting and applicable to everyday situations",
                "I would not really recommend this course, but you're probably a ChemE major and have to take it anyways. The lectures are good and Prof. V is a good teacher, but the structure of psets and grading for this course is just crazy. Expect homework almost every night of the week (which doesn't really let up even over breaks), and whatever grade you think you'll get in the course, drop it by a letter grade. This course is really well taught, its just extremely difficult to do well unless you have really really strong math and engineering background. Overall, if you have to take this course just don't underestimate it, and stay on top of the homework. Prof. V does make the material engaging at least, so if you have to take it maybe take it with her.",
                "RECOMMEND for any engineer that needs to take a fluid mechanics class! It is quite a workload but in all fairness, it is there to help you understand the concepts from class and get you to be proficient at fluid mechanics. If you put in the effort, you will be rewarded fairly, Vanderlick grades very fairly as long as you understand how to set up the problem and understand the conceptual questions.",
                "Probably not. Other than ChemEs who have to take this class, I would say only take it if you're really, really interested in fluid mechanics. It's a lot of work to have problems due twice a week, even if it's only around 3 problems each time, and that also takes a mental toll because you end up feeling like you're always working on transport."
