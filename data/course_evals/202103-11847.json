If you want to get a good grade in the class, just devote some time to studying and doing these and you will be fine.   Weaknesses: The problem sets can sometimes have problems much harder than those shown in class.",

                "The strengths of the course are simple: the curriculum is stagnant and easy to see what is necessary to learn. The weaknesses lie in the teaching systems. While I enjoyed my TA as a person, I felt disadvantaged as compared to other students in the course with different TA's as I had trouble understanding them throughout the whole semester, and felt like the teacher was too \"smart\" and thought the material too trivial to be able to consistently and successfully teach me the material.",

                "I would recommend this course to a student who has either taken calculus ab/1 in high school or is prepared to take some time to really study and learn (sometimes by themselves) the material. If one studies the material a bit outside of class and pays attention in class and to the Ximera's, they should do well. However, I do reccomend that students try to get into a class with a good teacher. The teaching isn't very good overall in the course, which is bad considering the semi-quick speed of the course. In the instance one gets a poor teacher, be prepared to self-study the concepts they didn't understand in class.",

                "I would recommend this course because I think the information is valuable.",
                "Yes, its an absolute gut and an easy way to get a QR credit out of the way especially first year first semester.",
                "Yes, as it is the basics necessary to lay a calculus foundation which is important for many different majors and courses in the future at Yale.",
