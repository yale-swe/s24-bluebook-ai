                "Recorded lectures were convenient for time zone differences!",
                "This class was fun and the professor is super funny. My only qualm is with the language it is taught in, because it feels super clunky and documentation is bad, but there is not much that anyone can do about that. Not an issue with the class itself.",
                "This class functioned fairly well as a virtual lecture. I wish more people had participated in class, but it speaks to the class and not the instructor and the class structure itself. Would have run more smoothly as an in-person lecture due to technical difficulties with zoom.",
                "Strengths: the topic was fascinating, something I definitely hope to work on in the future and something I don't think I would have learned anywhere else. The lectures were engaging (even if often off-topic) and the projects were super open-ended and became a great creative outlet for me. Using the course blogs to force students to see everyone else's projects was great, as we saw what everyone else had worked on, and got feedback from our peers on our assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness was the lack of feedback on projects and assignments. I understand that it's hard to give detailed feedback with only one TA and a 20-person class, but the work could sometimes feel a little wasted if it's not looked at thoroughly by anyone, and I felt that I was making the same syntactic mistakes in SuperCollider from the very beginning of the course. Our understanding of SuperCollider  was also a little superficial. I would have really enjoyed perhaps one or two more homeworks strictly focused on SuperCollider syntax and working with SynthDefs and stuff, even if it meant one or two less creative projects.",
                "Overall this course did a great job of addressing the challenges of Zoom, using multimedia offerings, live coding and other interactive methods in addition to lectures. The course does a good job of balancing the wide musical knowledge of its participants, but having additional musical prerequisites or even a brief musical \"placement quiz\" at the beginning of the course might help.",
                "The projects were very fun and the material was also super interesting, especially live coding\/seeing what cool things are happening in computer music today. It was great to see classmates' projects, everyone was very creative.",
                "The strengths of the course include the amazing instruction from Professor Petersen and the interesting projects. I felt like Professor Petersen was great at keeping each lecture lively while still providing students with enough information to perform well on the assignments.",
                "Instructor is very knowledgeable and passionate, homework were somewhat long especially in the middle but well structured as well to facilitate learning"

                "As mentioned I thought the course did very well in dealing with the online format. The course blog was an especially nice way to engage with community without the bizarre social dynamics of Zoom. Discussion groups were also helpful for virtual engagement. I think the biggest challenge is soliciting engagement during the lecture itself, when students are sometimes hesitant to participate not due to lack of interest or engagement, but due to the awkward nature of the Zoom format. I think the mid-semester course evaluations were very useful in fine-tuning the dynamics of the course."

                "For anyone interested in learning about algorithmic music composition, this is a good introductory class. Only downside is learning Supercollider, which has very bad documentation and software incompatibilities all around. If there were another accessible and more effective alternative to Supercollider, I would definitely petition that to the instructor.",
                "Absolutely, one of the best classes I've ever taken, and can appeal to people of different backgrounds. I would say that it would fit better for people who have taken music theory before, at least those who know how to read music and basic information about keys, since I thought my knowledge of music theory was really vital. That being said I know many students got past that. I don't think you need an extensive background in computer science or any particular language (this was my first CS class, although I had tons of experience coding in other languages) but you definitely need coding experience of some kind.",
                "Yes, I think this course was a great introduction to some of the systems used in computer music.",
