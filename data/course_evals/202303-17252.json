                "I gained a lot of knowledge about all parts of the animal kingdom that are not vertebrates. Thats a lot of animals! It was really great to understand more about how life works and how body systems work.",

                "Learned about every animal that exists ever, so cool! My first true bio class at Yale and it was cool to learn about so many fun animals and develop a vocabulary to talk about biology. Have many fun facts that I can bring to friends and family now.",
                "I learned a lot about how phylogeny works and the ins and outs of a huge diversity of animals. It gave me a better perspective of how evolution works, where humans are in the tree of life, and where all other animals are situated.",
                "Through this course, I acquired a deeper understanding of invertebrate phylogeny and the relationships between different organisms. I learned about the complexities in morphology, behavior, feeding mode, reproduction and lifestyle in different clades. This class also illuminated the rich diversity of animals and gave me a deeper appreciation for lesser-known organisms.",

It was a great application of the knowledge that I gained from evolutionary biology, learning how common it is for essential features that we commonly associate with animals -- a nervous system, circulatory system, and the head -- to evolve independently and repeatedly across different groups of animals.",
                "I learned so much about the biology of basically every living thing. This course covers A LOT of material, so you won't get too in depth on any one thing but it is a great introductory course. Non-majors beware!!!! I took this class to fulfill my science credit and it was SIGNIFICANTLY more work than I had expected. If you are good at memorizing things that you have no prior exposure to, then good one you. But if you aren't, know that this is not a science gut in the slightest. Professor Dunn is amazing though, and I really did find the coursework interesting when I wasn't cramming for exams and quizzes.",

            "comments": [
                "Dunn is an amazing lecturer",
                "I found this course interesting just because I enjoyed the topics and there was always brand new information, and animals that I had never heard of before.",
                "The professor is great, this is a fantastic course to get you excited about concepts. The pacing gets a little fast towards the end and it felt like we just wanted to cover every species instead of actually learning about some of them.",
                "Professor Dunn is a wonderful lecturer and obviously so invested in what he is teaching. This is the greatest asset of the course. He also brings in animals for us to see occasionally which was great. Good balance of workload with not any reading and periodical homework and test prep.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course isn't really a weakness but it is a caution. There is A LOT of content. The sheer number of animals we cover is extensive and then we learn a ton more about each animal. It is all interesting!! And you can totally pick out patterns, but it can also be hard to keep it all straight in your head all in a semester.",
                "Strengths - Professor Dunn is fantastic! He's engaging and knowledgeable. The material itself was interesting and lecture was very well done. The exams were tough, but fair, and the homeworks were time consuming but, again, fair. The project was also a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - There was a bit too much material to digest, leading to a lot of rote memorization. If the syllabus was just decreased a bit, I believe I could have gotten more out of the cours",
                "Prof Dunn is wonderful lecturer and i really enjoyed the class overall. There's a lot of material and the exams take a while to study for but good class",
                "Relatively lower workload, Dunn is a very generous and kind person who listens to feedback and is nice about grading",
                "too much stuff taught too quickly and uninformatically. could be improved by reducing information or at least giving students more time to grapple with it",
                "Strengths: Casey Dunn! Kind, empathetic, spirited, passionate. Great at explaining. Inspired a genuine passion for invertebrate biology in this humanities major. Kind and available TAs as well.\r\nWeaknesses: A LOT of content. Performing well on exams often meant knowing every single detail of the slides; core takeaways alone did not suffice. This isn't really a weakness but a warning that this is not a gut.",
                "Well taught, although the lectures in the second half of the semester were clearly less prepared for, and included less information. There is too much coursework--the course would benefit from the professor thinking about which assignments are most important. Why was there homework, quizzes, midterm, a huge final project, and a final exam?",
                "This course covers a lot of material, most of which is just brushed over quickly and never mentioned again. I think if the course went less in depth into topics like the reproductive anatomy of a small invertebrate subgroup and instead focused more time on broader topics like ecological importance of certain animals, the material would be more digestible and useful.",
                "Assignments are very fair, and I think the tests, while very difficult, are doable if you put in the time to study. Like a lot of time. Casey is a gem of a teacher and make the lectures fun and really enjoyable, and the TF's were great and very forgiving graders. For non-stem people, you can do it, but this class will be hard! It's a lot of memorizing and hard to pull on any general knowledge, so you will have to put in a lot of outside time to make sure you are keeping up with the people who have solid bio knowledge already.",
                "I just felt like the course had a bit too much content, and it was a bit overwhelming sometimes in class. However, I think that is also just the nature of these types of classes.",
                "The lectures were very engaging, interesting, and well-organized. A potential improvement to the class would be more evenly distributing the workload across the whole semester.",
                "This course had a lot of very interesting content, but it was difficult to keep up with the large amount of information provided to us.",
                "strengths: every day i'd come to class and casey would start talking about inverts and it was great. we love inverts <3\r\n\r\nweaknesses: i'm sad that we never learned about insects ._.  ofc i like my jellies & sponges & worms a lot, but insects are cool too",
                "Strengths: Interesting content most of the time. Passionate professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No regrade requests on the final. Disparities in TA grading.",
                "Strengths: Casey is a great professor. He's super engaging and is clearly excited about the material he teaches, making the lectures fun to listen to (though fast). Weaknesses: There is a LOT of material. It's run through very quickly in lecture and there's not much clarity about what's expected for the exams - there are a lot of details and all of them are fair game.",
                "Strengths: Professor Dunn is an amazing and compelling lecturer (and an equally exceptional researcher) who knows how to engage listeners and tell fascinating stories, while preserving the scientific rigor of the course. Lizzie and Dalila were fantastical TA's who provided generous guidance and feedback throughout the entire semester. The lecture material is fascinating, and most of the course material is sufficiently accessible to most individuals regardless of their academic background.\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the broad scope of the course (we tried to cover EVERY group of animals, with the except of vertebrates and insects), there is A LOT of material that was covered, with most of the course being extremely memorization-heavy. As a result, I wish there we were given more details about exams before they were administered, as their difficulty varied heavily.",
                "Strengths - awesome professor, right amount of evaluations (quizzes, homeworks)\r\nWeaknesses - no relationship with TFs (maybe because of lack of section), clear divide between majors and non-majors",
                "Strengths: Professor Dunn and his enthusiasm and ability to get students excited about whatever he's teaching. \r\nWeaknesses: Can sometimes be difficult for students to determine what is important to learn versus a random (yet interesting) tangent that Prof Dunn goes on.",
                "Professor Dunn is excellent. I can tell he is extremely passionate about the subject matter and receptive to student feedback. Lectures were engaging and the pictures/videos were great. My main piece of feedback would be to have review sessions before the midterm and final. As a non-STEM student, this course was pretty daunting--even when I would put multiple hours into studying, my grades were less than stellar. It would have been nice to have a guided review so students know how to study science material/what to focus on.",
                "It would have been nice to have a better sense of what information was necessary to know for the exams, rather than trying to intuit based on the slides what the most important material might be. \r\nI personally really loved the final project and felt I learned a lot from the homework. Personally, I would have liked if the homework was weighted higher.",
                "This course was so dense. It was made comprehensible by Professor Dunn but it was definitely a lot of memorization that made my head hurt. I wish there was a bit more focus on big themes. Professor Dunn was the strength of this class. I think the high stakes assessments were its weakness.",
                "We learned about every animal ever. Also, did I go into this course hoping for really solid writing advice? No. But one of the final project options is an essay, and the support for that is incredible--if you ask, the TAs are willing to read and comment on outlines and drafts. As someone with a humanities background, I really appreciated the intro to scientific writing. The process of explaining, in simple and clear language, how crab organs work, or having to read and cite scientific research is really useful and can be applied broadly.",
                "Strengths: Super engaging lecturesvery fun and cool! Assignments helped me learn, and the AI policy was very cool. This course was structured amazingly with great pacing, and lots of support. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final. (grading was a little rushed and way harsher than midterm and quizzes).",
                "Inconsistent application of grading policies, lecture is frequently cut short? like 1520 minutes short weekly, which was a little annoying when I woke up to go to class. Wouldn't recommend to another student, there are other, better taught science guts where you'd learn more and probably be more intellectually stimulated. Prof. Dunn doesn't really make an attempt to make the content accessible to non-STEM majors.",
                "Dont let people tell you to skimp on the worms. They deserve their time in the limelight too.",
                "I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS COURSE!",
                "Invertebrates has been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. I was excited to go to every single lecture since they reminded me of nature documentaries. Professor Dunn made every topic interesting and accessible to students from both science and non-science backgrounds with his clear explanations and interesting anecdotes. For the final project, we had the option of either writing a research paper or making a stop-motion animation short film. Both projects were equally difficult in different ways, so I liked that we could choose what we wanted to do. I ended up making a stop-motion animation, which required the use of the professional-level studio in the Peabody Museum. The Peabody staff who assisted us were all great, but my experience could have been slightly improved if I had more time to use the studio, since the hours that the Peabody studio was open often didn't align with my class schedule, causing me to rush towards the end of the project timeline.",
                "This course was always engaging and interesting, though it was often hard to take notes on all the information. Still, slideshows were always posted, and lectures were eventually posted as well, which helped with any knowledge gaps.",
                "The class was engaging and Professor Dunn sometimes even brought live organisms for us to inspect."

                "Ive read reviews that this was people's favorite class in all their time at Yale and I was skeptical but I can actually concur now (taking this in my last semester at Yale). I have taken numerous great classes but here you learn a lot about how to perceive and understand the world and yourself - because understanding animals (ie invertebrates) helps you rethink how you understand the world and yourself. Few classes can do that in a convincing and compelling way, and this is the ONE class that really does because the facts of animals just force your mental model to update. Also Prof Dunn just loves invertebrates and that definite rubs off in a good way.",
                "Yes I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to learn more about animals. There are so many cool and unique animals introduced in the course that I found fascinating.",
                "This course is good, and I learned a lot of fun and interesting things about invertebrates, but is not a gut. It was reworked to include a midterm, final, homework assignments, quizzes and a final project. I would still encourage taking the course, but the workload is definitely non-trivial.",
                "If you're a humanities student looking for a science credit, or a stem student who's considering majoring in E&EB, yes.",
                "Yes I would! I am a non-stem major and really enjoyed it. I expect though, if I wasn't really interested in learning about these animals, it would feel more overwhelming and not as rewarding. So (as should be a general rule) take the class if it sounds interesting. Granted, if you are a non bio major, you may not know prima facie if this is interesting material to you and I think that is ok. Worst case scenario, you understand evolutionary patterns and many structures in our own biology, and get to see how patterns emerge across animals while having to learn a lot of content (especially before tests). Best case scenario, this class really sparks your interest in the topic and you come away with a better appreciation of our world and the life on it.",

                "do NOT take this course if you're looking for <10hr/wk of studying on average. this final requires you to study for maybe 5 days straight to really understand everything. random niche facts, etc.",
                "I would recommend this to a student genuinely interested in invertebrate biology on the level of morphology and anatomy as well as phylogenetic classification systems. I would not recommend this to a student looking for an easy A, low-investment science gut, or student mostly interested in ecology/environmental interactions with animals.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to be in a environment where students are happy and the professor is engaged. Professor is extremely reasonable and accommodating to students' needs. Overall, I really enjoyed the class, but there is a lot of memorization involved.",
                "Yes, it is very cool.",
                "It is interesting, but the professor is distant and not warm. Lots of coursework for this kind of course.",
                "This is an amazing class to get to better understand the vast majority of animals on our planet. Take this if you love invertebrates (or think they're fun) and genuinely want to learn more! The lecture is relatively easy-going, and the workload is on the lower side, but there is A LOT of content to learn, especially what you'll get tested on in the exams. This is not a gut!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about obscure animals (mostly worms). The course does require a lot of memorization.",
                "For you non-stem people, it's NOT a gut! Assignments are chill but you will have to put in a LOT of time studying and memorizing a ton of biology specific information. Casey is awesome and many of the animals are super cool to learn about, but be wary of the amount you will need to know for the final. Other than that, the class was super welcoming and fun to take with friends and discuss random facts about these animals with.",
                "Yes, I really liked Professor Dunn and felt like the content was super interesting!",

I thought the content was very interesting, but it was a lot of information to process. If you plan to take this course, it is important to set aside time each week to study the lecture content.",
                "HIGHLY recommend to any biologist or any yale college student looking to fulfill their Sc requirement. This class is fascinating and tbh it's an easy A too. You will learn so much about animal biology and biology in general. it's just overall an excellent class",
                "If you need a SCI credit and have time for significant memorization.",
                "Yes! It's a great opportunity to learn about a load of cool animals that aren't often spoken about with much appreciation. Professor Dunn is a great teacher. That said, he does move through the material quickly, and it can sometimes be hard to follow.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biodiversity, particularly invertebrate zoology or marine biology. This course is definitely the best fit for E&EB majors and other individuals with some experience with evolutionary biology, although some folks without that background can definitely still succeed. There were portions of the class where a strong understanding of evolutionary biology (phylogenies and the tree of life), genomics and development (animal development), and biochemistry (animal physiology) were helpful, but were by no means essential -- there is some brief but interesting overlap with BIOL 103-104, E&EB 225, and MCDB 300 throughout the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another Yale student who is either (a) very interested in invertebrate biology, or (b) an EEB major. I would NOT recommend this course to a humanities major who thinks this will be something like Bio, the World, and Us. It is not.",
                "Yes absolutely if you are interested at all in learning about all the types of animals you probably havent learned a ton about previously.",
                "YES!! This class made learning fun. I would not take it as a gut science course because it's really not a gut by any means. You have to study pretty hard for the tests because it's vocab and structures and specific characteristics of certain phylum. But if you're EEB, then you'd definitely love this course. We learned about so many animals!",
                "Definitely! Instructor and the TAs are fantastic. However, students should be prepared for some hard core memorization.",
                "Please be warned: this is not a gut!! This class should be taken only if you are willing to put serious time into memorizing content for the quizzes, midterm, and final exam. The course is pitched as an introductory course, but this does not mean that it will be easy in any way.",
                "I honestly did enjoy the content and teaching of this course. But it is definitely a lot of work. Like so much work. I put in a lot of hours into this course. But I did have fun. But if you are not looking to spend 24 hours, like legit 24 hours (like 6 hours a day consistently for 4 days) studying for a final then I would say no.",
                "This course is NOT a gut; it required 6-10 hours of studying for each quiz and 15+ hours of studying for the final. You have to memorize all 200 of the facts on crustaceans and ctenophores, and all the rest of the dozens of animals we study. You can probably be more strategic than I was (choose 150 facts to memorize instead, because the exams let you choose between options for questions to answer; also, the final is \"cumulative,\" but it's 90% on post-midterm content). I was intellectually curious about biodiversity and Casey is a great lecturer who is at the top of his field and shares his stories from being on submarines and researching in the Antarctic; for all non-future invertebrate biologists, you can decide for yourself if this makes the course worth the time commitment. Last note--the first two lectures are easy to follow in a way that the rest of the lectures, especially in the latter half of the course, did not always match; something to consider during add/drop.",
                "100% Professor Dunn almost converted me into pursuing invertebrate zoology after this class. Its a really fun, eye-opening class that exposes you to animals you otherwise will never even hear about. The reoccurring ideas of human-centered classifications of what is  complex and not was really humbling, or what we deem shocking is simply something that defies our assumptions. I will always remember these lessons.",
                "No, pick another science gut.",
                "Yup. Fun class, unique material, great prof",
                "Yes, definitely. I was looking for a random science class to fulfill my distributional requirement, but this didn't only meet, but exceeded my expectations. I learned so much in this class, even though I think the only practical applications as they pertain to me will most likely be pointing out sea creatures whenever I'm in the ocean. Still, I love this class and would (and have been) recommending this class to as many students (especially Humanities-oriented students like me) as possible.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student regardless of their major, but especially to other E&EB majors such as myself who are looking for 200-level classes and labs to ease themselves into the subject. If you like marine biology, or even if you just like learning about animals in general, you will enjoy this class. You will have to memorize a lot of facts about many different invertebrate phyla and you will eventually have to know how to draw the entire invertebrate phylogeny (to the level of detail that we discuss in class). Therefore, I wouldn't necessarily call it a gut, but if you put in the work and study ahead of time for the quizzes and exams, you will definitely succeed. I think the high enjoyment level of the class balances out the harder aspects such as the amount of memorization required for the tests.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a class with material that isn't difficult to understand but willing to memorize significant amounts of information. Anyone interested in marine life or zoology as a whole would likely enjoy this course.",
                "Learning about the animals this class features is so fun, but humanities students looking to get a science credit should beware: Not a gut!! Not a gut!!! Only take if youre ready to do the work!!! Also there was a huge jump in difficulty between the midterm and the final with zero warning, which was uncool.",
                "Yes. I am a non-EEB major and this course was great. There is a lot of memorization but it is fascinating learning more about creatures in the world. The final project also allows students to explore their organism/species of interest and present a paper on them or show off their creative prowess with an animation."
