                "This course gives an amazing overview of the different debates on education that have paralleled different eras of American history. I feel like I have such a better understanding of the major themes that have guided the education debate over time, and how they inform current debates.",
                "This course provided a survey/introduction to the history of American education. There was a heavy emphasis on primary sources throughout the course, which I enjoyed. Although the class did not revolve around current day policy debates, we often drew connections between historical events and present-day issues, which I found enlightening. Despite how unprecedented the education and culture wars seems today, all of this is rooted in a deep educational history that goes back to the founding of the nation.",
                "Developed a comprehensive knowledge of how the education system in the U.S. developed historically. Analyzed primary and secondary sources to inform historical discussions about education history and some philosophy. Also discussed how many challenges in the present day are informed by, even grounded in, issues that have plagued education systems in the U.S. from the start."

                "Professor Rosenberg is great - very caring and good at facilitating the conversation. I would have enjoyed it if a bit more of the class was a lecture by Professor Rosenberg since the class was fairly long, but we were able to discuss the readings in depth.",
                "Great course overall. Some more insight into grading",
                "Strengths are a great structure, interesting/engaging readings and classes, and an acceptable workload. The only potential weakness is that the class is the most seminar-like I have taken, meaning that the class will rely heavily on student input. For this semester, this was a strength.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the readings. First of all, everyone did them, and second of all, they were incredibly well picked. There was a mix of broad scope stuff that gave you a good framework for thinking about the topic of the week, and more in depth ones that touched on topics not usually focused on in major history books (Latinx immigrant education, the perception/sexualization/desexualization of female teachers, etc). The class was all vey engaged and discussion was a great mix of student led and professor guided. The course load was never overwhelming though. I'd say there were no major weaknesses.",
                "I enjoyed the seminar format of the course. Our class grew close throughout the semester, and the 2 hour long block went by quite quickly. Professor Rosenberg also did a good job breaking up the class time to make it more manageable. We began with student presentations followed by discussions of the reading. The course also have a very manageable reading and work load. With the ~80-100 pages per week, I feel like students actually committed to doing the reading, which enhanced the seminar discussions. We were also able to address all of the readings at least partially, which isnt often the case in other seminars.\r\n\r\nThe course relies on a primary source reader to guide a lot of the discussion. While I appreciated having a collection of documents to contextualize each period, I felt like our analysis of these documents fell short. They were often relegated to the end of class, and none of our secondary source readings engaged with these documents in a critical way. I would like to see more connections between the primary and secondary sources to encourage more critical historical thinking as opposed to just discussions on things that happened.",
                "Strengths: The class is entirely discussion-based. Primary and secondary reading load was very manageable. The class assignments, two response papers and a final paper, gave a lot of flexibility. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to find and bring in different primary sources into our class discussions twice during the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class discussions were shaped by student discussion and guided by what students wanted to discuss. Adding a weekly discussion post requirement would incentivize more students to do the reading regularly. Some week, discussions were really difficult when it was obvious that only a few students had done the reading. Also, there was not much feedback offered on paper proposals for the final paper. It would be nice to have an option to turn in a rough draft for feedback before final paper submission.",
                "Prof. Rosenberg lets discussions flow naturally and chimes in with guiding questions rather than definitive answers. This seminar has a good balance between primary and secondary sources, and each reading feels relevant because we really dive into the themes of each piece."

                "Yes! I think exploring the history of American education is an excellent way to contextualize current policy debates. Professor Rosenberg also leads a very approachable history seminar, so if you are nervous about taking a history seminar as I was (as a CS student), this course could be for you.",
