                "Robert Storr is a great art teacher and storyteller. He has many connections to museums and famous artists (which he is one), and he tells us anecdotes of them and is able to strongly analyze their artwork. He also explains well on how to use different artists' styles to input into ours. Additionally, he played music during class, which was relaxing.",
                "This is a great course. But taking it through zoom is a pretty poor substitute for in person learning. There were frequent technical difficulties. But it was low pressure, and a really nice way to round out a schedule during the pandemic.",
                "The course was amazing as Professor Storr tried to engage us as much as possible due to the virtual format. He provided useful wisdom both in art and real life. I enjoyed the stories he would tell and the conversations he had before class started. One weakness would be that sometimes the instructions were unclear, but that was easily resolved by asking him on Zoom."

                "The class was all on Zoom, which was incredibly difficult but unavoidable given the Yale mandate to socially distance and use online methods as much as possible. Instead of the professor being able to walk around and critique our paintings while we painted in a classroom, we had to paint and then hold them up through the Zoom camera. However, Rob and the TA did their best to critique our artwork, as well as pull up examples of pieces by artists.\r\n\r\nA way to improve is being able to sit in a classroom (socially distanced, with masks on). This would probably work and be of minimal risk to the instructor and students since there are less than 15-20 people in the class. But of course, with virtual learning and not everyone in New Haven, it was not possible this semester.",
                "It's really hard to say whether this class can ever be considered a success, at least to the same extent as it once might have been, in a world where we cannot paint in the same room and where we can only see each other's work through a webcam on a laptop. With that said, if anyone can squeeze the most out of circumstances like these, it's Robert Storr.",

But maybe wait until you can do so in person. And make sure you like professors like Rob. He can be intimidating, but that's because he's an expert. Be confident and take creative risks and you'll be fine.",
