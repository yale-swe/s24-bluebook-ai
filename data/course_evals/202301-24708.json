The theory was often really dense at times and went over my head, but I appreciated being exposed to it and see myself coming back to these ideas in my future education, even if they did not make the most sense now. I also really loved our YUAG trips!",

                "I liked that we viewed the art in person. It is so much better to view art in person than online. This course was super theory heavy and it seemed that the professor operated on the assumption that everyone knew how to read theory. I did not understand a lot of the texts until it was explained to me and even then I couldnt reproduce the ideas of the text. It was like learning a new language. I think there should have been less texts per week so that students could get a greater understanding of the texts. I found myself reading only half the text in an effort to understand each one at least partially but make sure to get to all of them. Also, we werent really trained on how to analyze art or even discussed it but we then had to write a paper about it. I wouldve appreciated more guidance in that area.",

                "I loved the subject matter of this course. The connections drawn between visual art and Black feminist theory were enthralling and helped me to learn so much about a subject I previously knew little about."

It is super cool to see the pieces of art we discuss in person however were not taught how to analyze art. I feel like it was a lot of me figuring out how to do things or asking my writing tutor mostly.",
                "yes!",
                "I would recommend this course if you are prepared to struggle with difficult ideas relating to Blackness and gender. I often felt intellectually out-of-depth, but Professor Ekpo is so generous with her time and ideas and is always around to meet for office hours to discuss the course content further. All of the art was great!",
