This is absolutely the best class I have taken at Yale, hands down. I found myself so fascinated by the material every week, and really looking forward to the lectures and readings. This content will definitely stay with you throughout your life irrespective of what field you are in (I'm an Applied Math major). The class teaches you so much about how ideas develop within historical contexts and the big ideas that have shaped our world. It gave me a much better perspective to understand the world today -- why we see certain forms of politics, how we've gotten to 21st century thought, etc. Definitely take it!!",

                "As someone without any real background in philosophy, this course is an amazing first pass at modern European philosophical thought. The goal of the course was not to interrogate the philosophical ideas themselves but to explore what these major thinkers believed and how that shaped politics, society, and other thinkers. The course gives you a working knowledge of and vocabulary for modern philosophy. It exposes you to a number of different ideas about the world and how the western line of questioning has changed over the past ~230 years.",

I gained skills in synthesizing information from different thinkers, reading and analyzing often difficult texts, and putting the ideas and arguments of various thinkers in conversation with each other. Some important insights from the course were that thinkers do not have control over ideas once they are released, and that intellectual history tends to involve changes in the questions that people ask moreso than the reaching of ultimate answers.",

This course introduced me to such a wide array of thinkers, their philosophies and the historical context around them, topics that I had never been exposed to before. The course allowed me to think about the philosophies of different thinkers not independently from one another, but to rather see how the ideas of one thinker bleed into the ideas of others. I was able to discern the connections between the different philosophies and the way in which our movement through history showed us how the ideas of the past influenced the ideas of the future. This course allowed me to read through seminal papers in modern European intellectual history, and gave me an insight into some of the most influential texts of the 19th and 20th centuries.",

                "Professor Shore's lectures are very engaging, well-referenced, and cohesive. The course taught me so much and it has definitely changed the way I think.",
                "A little more guidance for section would be nice. We had to write 6 short reading responses over the semester for section (which I appreciated because it forced me to do the readings more closely), but it did feel like our time was really unstructured and I have no idea what everybody else talked about in section",
                "This was a fantastic course! No weaknesses, though I wish there was more inclusion of British philosophers.",
                "Strengths: lectures are INCREDIBLE and explain confusing philosophical concepts so, so well. The assignments (midterm, paper, final) all helped deepen my understanding of the course, fantastic array of thinkers and just overall a life-changing course\r\nweaknesses: section discussions were pretty dead but probably due to virtual format",
                "Strengths:\r\nInteresting topic, leads to interesting conversations with friends\r\nUsually good lectures\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nConfusing blend between history and philosophy \r\nSo many thinkers\/ideas were thrown into the course (but I should've known there wouldn't be as much depth because it's a survey course)",
                "I liked the audio recordings, but some of the ones recorded outside were hard to understand. I also liked looking at the thinkers from a historical perspective, but would have appreciated more comparisons between them in lecture.",
                "I enjoyed the pre-recorded lectures and regularly attended the Q&A sessions. I think the Q&A's could be more lively, since usually there are only 5 people or so that are actively asking questions in the chat.",
                "A strength is that the lectures were very interesting and clear. They perfectly completed the readings.",
                "My favourite class. Professor Shore is such an eloquent, clear lecturer and explains the concepts so well. It is almost as if she is telling you really well written stories every week. She does a phenomenal job of not only explaining the different philosophers, but really putting them in context with each other so that you are able to compare and contrast different ideas. I think that's the real value add of this course -- viewing ideas in context rather than in a vacuum. Professor Shore make the content so compelling, it really makes you want to know more. I have spent too much time going down Wikipedia wormholes after searching for something related to the class. The exams are fair, the midterm essay has fun prompts, and there really isn't much work outside of that other than readings. My TA was really great about giving me constant, and detailed feedback. \r\nWeaknesses -- maybe I would modify the section format somehow. We would discuss two thinkers every week but 50 minutes of section was never enough to discuss both of them and we would always end up rushing through discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore was an incredibly engaging lecturer -- her teaching style has a special kind of charm that draws you in and makes you want to learn. I also had a great TF who made the overall experience even better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I loved the Q&A sessions, but I wish Professor Shore could have talked less about the personal anecdotes of each philosopher and more about their ideas. The midterm felt slightly rushed because we only had 50 minutes to write an in-class essay on a complicated philosophical topic. It was 20% of our grade, which was a lot considering how short of an essay it was. I also wish there had been more guidance on writing the term paper -- it would have been helpful for TF's to make their expectations clear and maybe run one or two writing workshops. Personally speaking, I was familiar with writing history papers as well as philosophy papers, but not the two combined. Writing good intellectual history papers requires skills of its own kind, and I would have appreciated more guidance on that.",
                "Professor Shore is amazing, super engaging, and very kind and understanding. Her lectures are fascinating although they tend to run over the given 50 minutes. She brings in a number of interesting anecdotes, asides, and quotes that really spice up the material. She is effortlessly brilliant and can convey complex things in a really comprehensible way. The lectures are recorded in a way that you should be able to listen while going on a walk or staring out the window. You aren't expected to know hard facts other than a few key dateseverything else is just ideas, which I really liked. As for weaknesses, perhaps including some annotations in the really hard texts (ex. Derrida) to provide guidance while reading would be nice. Also, trying to keep to the 50 minutes.",
                "An amazing overview of the major European intellectual thinkers from Enlightenment on. Professor Shore gives really engaging lectures and is great about weaving overarching themes throughout the material. She heavily focuses Eastern European thinkers but as that is her area of expertise, it's merited.",
                "Strengths: Prof Shore is very passionate about the subject and has a very engaging way of speaking. I always enjoyed listening to her lectures. The readings are generally not overwhelming and the grading scheme is pretty kind. \r\nWeaknesses: discussion section over Zoom is kind of a mixed bag. Also maybe this is just me, but I felt that sometimes Prof Shore got a little repetitive during lecture and although I always left with a strong impression of two or three aspects of each philosopher, I sometimes wished for just a little more familiarity with the nuances of their thinking. But this is a very minor complaint, I think it's just a personal preference and a thing of degree.",
                "I think you just can't expect this course to give you an in-depth understanding of any particular period or idea, but the lectures were amazing at painting a picture of the context in which all of these philosophers emerged. Discussion sections could be tough when it was not a week that the TF was familiar with, but I really enjoyed listening to the lectures even if I didn't always fully comprehend the readings.",
                "The lecture content was good. Illustrated important issues well. It does focus on eastern European intellectuals, especially in the later parts of the course, which was interesting, but perhaps somewhat more specialized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses was section. They were not run well.",
                "The sections were run exceptionally well, and all the lectures were available for students to follow along with online. The availability and simplicity of accessing the course material was a major strength.",

The lectures are some of the best I have been to, and the course is told like a story which made it much easier to follow. I loved the very different kinds of ideas we encountered, from feminism to Communism to existentialism, and I think the course managed to relate and tie them together extremely well.\r\n\r\nIt would have been interesting if we could have discussed present-day thought and ideas and what philosophers\/historians are thinking about at the moment.",
                "Strengths --> incredible incredible lectures from Professor Shore. Great reading list and syllabus. Incredible overall!",
                "One strength of this course was the very engaging way that information was presented in lectures, which made the key ideas of thinkers clear and accessible before we dove into their writings, which were often very dense. Another strength was the coherent structure of the class, where the connections between the different thinkers and intellectual currents we studied was very clear and seemed to naturally follow from one class to the next. The smaller discussion sections were also well organized, and really helped to reinforce the lessons of the lecture as well as help further our understandings of different texts. A potential weakness in the course is a lack of flexibility in the subjects studied, which is understandable given its status as a survey class. Still, I think that incorporating a greater degree of student choice and initiative in the ideas, thinkers, and texts studied and discussed could be beneficial to learning.",
                "The strength is the breath of material covered. The weakness is that, because of the breadth, there is very little time spent understanding and analyzing each philosopher's perspective.",
                "This has been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I do not have a lot to say about things that could improve the learning experience within it, as I think that the course was very well structured to facilitate student learning. I believe that the live Q&A sessions were an amazing addition to the course and I think that they helped bolster the concepts that were covered in lecture. As I mention further down in the evaluation, I think that providing some more specificity and directionality through the handouts may help students be better prepared for the exams.",
                "I think the main strength of this course lie in its comprehensive overview of the topic. Professor Shore covers all the main pillars of European intellectual history from the Enlightenment to late 20th century postmodernism. What the course lacks in depth it certainly makes up for in breadth, and it provides a launching pad to dive further into any one of the topics, many of which are covered in depth by other Yale courses. As a first-year, I appreciated the survey structure of the course. I think one of the main weaknesses of the course is that I struggled to set many of the thinkers into historical context, and to see practical examples of their often abstract philosophy.",
                "Professor Shore was one of the best lecturers Ive had at Yale. No weaknesses",
                "Amazing course!",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore is a great lecturer and she makes dense material accessible. The theorists we look at are also pretty interesting - good to know for any major.\r\nWeaknesses: This is probably the result of the virtual format, but almost every lecture went overtime. Because lectures were recorded, this was not a super big deal, but we also were required to attend twice a week Q&A sessions during the time at which this class was scheduled. I also wish we could have spent more time on each theorist \/ intellectual movement.",
                "It's format was the best of all the online courses I had.",

                "audio lectures were awesome.",
                "Audio-only lectures were great. Asynchronous classes made it easy to slip through the cracks. If I couldn't make it to one of the synchronous discussions during the usual meeting time, I was worried I would miss out on crucial information.",
                "I think the format of the course was well-adapted to virtual learning.",
                "I believe this course adapted very well to the circumstances. I found the live Q&A sessions to be particularly useful and interesting.",
                "The virtual seminar\/discussion format could definitely be improved. In class most student would have their cameras off which clearly had a negative effect on professor shore's confidence in her ability to teach. Despite this, she still provided engaging commentary and answered all questions to their fullest extent.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were great so that we could listen to them on our time and pause them while taking notes. Professor Shore was also super considerate about how much screen time students are having and made the lectures audio only -- highly appreciated!",
                "Pre-recorded lectures were very nicethe ability to listen to them while on a walk was also pretty sweet. I thought the Q&A sessions were incredibly helpful. I went to most of them, but especially for the lectures I was confused about. This helped engagement and created a space where students could and should share questions.",
                "flipped class is a strong format for this class.",
                "The recorded lectures were a helpful adjustment that helped with the COVID learning curve. I think the midterm and final essays were a little confusing to navigate especially since they were due within a specific deadline, and it would've been more helpful to offer these as take-home exams with a few days to complete rather than a few hours at most.",
                "I think the recorded lecture format worked just fine for me. I never attended the in-person (I guess office hours, but also lecture) portion. It seems like a good idea to have that but I just didn't quite have the time to devote to it.",
                "Because Prof. Shore is such an engaging lecturer, I really enjoyed listening to them recorded because it was like a cool podcast. I think the discussion sections were less engaging because sometimes I didn't feel like I had enough of an understanding to fully get the readings. I do wish I had attended more of the synchronous q&a sessions, which probably would have helped.",
                "The handouts and the lecture were good. Sometimes the audio was hard to make out, and so quieter recording environments and better equipment would be a plus.",
                "I think this course did a great job! I really felt comfortable as a student amidst the pandemic to be equipped to succeed.",
                "Recorded lectures were nice to have b4 the live ones.",
                "During COVID, Professor Shore chose to deliver lectures as audio-only, with a live Q&A session for every class. At first, I was worried the recorded lectures wouldn't be very engaging, but Professor Shore is a very dynamic lecturer and I seldom found myself losing focus. I didn't attend the live Q&A very frequently, because it was fairly early in the morning for me, but when I did I found it helpful.",
                "The class did not change any practices during covid, which worked for me because I had the opportunity to be on campus this semester. I worry other students may have had a tough time given the workload of the class remained unchanged.",
                "Besides making classes and discussion sections virtual, the biggest change in course practices due to the pandemic was making lectures pre-recorded, and turning the live lecture class times into a sort of open office hours to ask questions about the lecture and readings. This change was helpful because it allowed for more flexibility with when and where one listened to lectures. It also meant that more information could be gained by attending the optional live virtual lectures and asking further questions. One downside was that the optional virtual lectures had more limited involvement by students, and occasionally overlapped with material already gained from the pre-recorded lectures. I think that the live virtual lectures could be improved by making them slightly more structured. A greater use of virtual technology such as screen sharing could also help enhance and supplement information gained from recorded lectures.",
                "I found lectures to be difficult to follow just because they were only recorded as audio files and lasted an hour usually. I think it would be maybe easier to follow if the lectures were broken up or if there were slides to accompany.",
                "As part of the adaptations instated for COVID-19, the course offered both a live Q&A session in the nominal class time and prerecorded audio lectures. Even though I loved the content of the prerecorded lectures and I found them to be extremely interesting, intriguing and engaging, I thought that it would be amazing to be able to get to see that lecture delivered live. Potentially having the lectures be delivered live by professor Shore and then upload a recording of the lectures on the Media Library could have also been an option. I personally thought that professor Shore was an amazing lecturer and I would have loved to have seen her lecture happen live rather than for it to be pre-recorded. Having said that, I think that the live sessions she held were actually very helpful in gaining further insight into the material.",
                "Professor Shore said that she traditionally lectures without slideshows\/visuals, so the podcast style lectures did not feel that different than what the class would have been like in-person. If anything, the asynchronous podcasts with the synchronous Q&A's allowed for greater opportunity to engage with the material. I think if Professor Shore could have recorded herself giving the lecture (rather than just audio), it may have felt more like an in-person experience.",
                "Having the lectures prerecorded made things very flexible for us. It meant we could listen to them whenever we wanted, allowing us to get ahead or catch up when necessary",
                "I didnt think the Q&A during class time was that necessary. Also I would love for lectures to also have a visual component (they were audio recorded)",

                "A must-take. Professor Shore's lectures are amazing--I look forward to new material all semester long.",
                "Yes! It really had me thinking about how I view the world and my place in it. It also counted for my major, which was nice. The lectures are really fun to listen to and Prof does a great job of tying them all together so you can really think about the various philosophers we discussed in dialogue with one another. Was also great because it isn't related to anything else I studied so getting to do something refreshing every week during online learning (when time is a blur and life feels pointless) was really nice",
                "Yes! This may be my favorite course at Yale!",
                "YES ABSOLUTELY!!! This is possibly my favorite course I've taken at Yale, and it has been a literally life-changing experience. Professor Shore breaks down the most important philosophical movements and thinkers of the last 150 years in a way literally nobody else could possibly do. Even after the first two weeks, I found myself seeing contemporary events and my work in other courses in a whole new light, and by the end of the course, I truly feel that I see the world in a different way now that I better understand the philosophical currents that shaped our past and present. Beyond the material, the course was very well organized as well. Expectations for all assignments were clear and the recorded audio lectures were great. Professor Shore clearly cares for her students. Although the philosophical ideas can be challenging (not really even challenging, more like deeply engaging), she helps guide you along, and the overall workload is very modest (readings, in-class midterm, 200-3600 word paper with both creative and traditional prompt options, and a final).  \r\nJust an incredible course overall, TAKE IT!!!",
                "Yes - this is information most people should know. You'll always hear about Hegel, Marx, totalitarianism, etc. We're living in the aftermath of these thinkers\/historical events. It's nice knowing the background to words you hear sometimes.",
                "Yes I would. The thinkers we learned about in this class had an outsized impact on history and I believe everyone should learn about them.",
                "Yes, most definitely. An amazing course and I learned so much valuable information that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Definitely my favourite class at Yale. I found myself so fascinated by the material every week, and really looking forward to the lectures and readings. This content will definitely stay with you throughout your life irrespective of what field you are in (I'm an Applied Math major). The class teaches you so much about how ideas develop within historical contexts and the big ideas that have shaped our world. It gave me a much better perspective to understand the world today -- why we see certain forms of politics, how we've gotten to 21st century thought, etc. Definitely take it!!",
                "Yes! You'll learn so much about western intellectual history and develop an appreciation for the beauty of ideas. I decided to major in history (intellectual history track) because of this class. The workload was manageable. Readings can be dense and difficult (especially Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology) but they were super interesting and we didn't have many pages to read each week. This is a great foundational course for anyone interested in majoring in something humanities-related. In high school I did a lot of philosophy and intellectual history so I was initially a little hesitant when signing up for this course, but I learned SO MUCH and do not regret taking it at all! Professor Shore is such a gem. It was honestly one of the best experiences of my college career so far, despite being completely virtual in a pandemic. \r\n\r\nBe aware that this is a course on the HISTORY of ideas in the continental tradition. It's not really about who's right and who's wrong but more about tracing the development of ideas. If you're looking for a more \"brain-in-the-jar\" experience you might want to shop some of the analytical philosophy courses offered by the PHIL department (like Shelly Kagan's Introduction to Ethics).",
                "Yes! Professor Shore is amazing! The material is so interesting and the lectures are engaging, funny, and full of stories. It was very well organized and the format was super flexible, which made a huge difference with covid.",
                "Definitely, this class is pretty good. You get to learn a lot about the philosophers in a low-pressure environment.",
                "This was a great class and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has the time to keep up with the reading assignments and responses each week. Professor Shore is a great lecturer and each subject is so interesting that you'll really enjoy coming to class.",
                "Yeah, I enjoyed it. I've never been one of those people like \"I MUST take a philosophy course!\" and I wasn't super passionate about it, but I still found it interesting and a nice way to pass the time. The exam and essay questions are really interesting--probably the most enjoyable exams I've ever taken. Some of the readings were fun. For a low-stress humanities course, very good option.",
                "I honestly wish I took this so much earlier at Yale because all of these ideas come up in so many other humanities classes. It is so important to understand how they were situated in history.",
                "I would. As a senior who had never read philosophical works in any form, it was a bit of an adjustment, going from reading more standard historical texts to reading Hegel and Husserl. That being said, Professor Shore does an amazing job of summing up each thinker we read in her recorded lectures, and discussing the thinkers in section every week helped us all understand a bit better.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, especially for prospective history or philosophy majors. It provides a deep insight into the interconnected currents of thought that defined Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, contextualizing not only our current situation but also the historical events that led to it.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Shore is a phenomenal lecturer who presents the material with clarity and passion. This was probably my favorite class at Yale.",
                "Great survey course, much better than intro philosophy sequence, although it covers somewhat different themes.",
                "Absolutely! Everyone should have a working knowledge of Intellectual History.",
                "Yes! Excellent coverage of philosophic topics",
                "Yes, definitely. I think it is a good intro course to European philosophy, probably more fun than the typical ancient civ \/ Greek phil class.",
                "Yes! You will learn so much. I find myself reading news and sometimes relating it to some of the ideas we covered in the course; this clear relation to the real world is a big reason to take the course if you're not a history\/philosophy major. It also forms a very different way of looking at history that you may have learned in other classes, and I think it is a really valuable one. You should definitely take this class!",
                "Yes. If you are interested in intellectual history, you must take this course as soon as you can.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in intellectual history, and looking for a survey class which offers a look at some of the most important figures and ideas that arose in Europe (but which have had a great impact on thought around the world). The thinkers and ideas looked at will definitely be recurring throughout one's academic career, especially in the social sciences or humanities, and this is an engaging and fun way of delving into them and the key questions that are at their core. Students should expect excellent lectures which approach subjects from several angles and provide them with a narrative and broader context. The content of the course isn't just philosophy, but it also isn't just history in the way that we often think of it. Although historical context is included, much of the course involves following ideas and their various expressions and shifts through different movements and thinkers. As an overview, the course doesn't provide an in-depth look at any one topic, but gives a good foundation for further inquiry. If students enter the class and approach all ideas\/thinkers with an open mind, they will be ready to make many connections between the ideas they encounter in the course and those found elsewhere at Yale and in everyday life.",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students that are largely unfamiliar with European philosophy.",
                "Absolutely! This has been one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. When I was reading through past evaluations for this course many students described it as the course that helped them experience what they expected Yale to be all about. Having taken the course myself, I can say that it certainly delivered on that idea. The course was absolutely informative and offered a completely new insight into philosophers and theories for me, a person in the STEM field. It was an absolutely terrific introduction into some of the most seminal thinkers of modern European history and it allowed me to understand how some of the most fundamental ideas in Europe came to be and came to have the influence that they have. The readings were also catering towards that idea and really complemented the lectures. This class ends being a merger between philosophy and history, looking at the development of ideas through time rather than looking purely at the historical context within which ideas were born. Professor Shore is absolutely fantastic, and delivers some of the most intriguing and engaging lectures I have experienced at Yale.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. This really felt like a quintessential \"Yale\" class, and Marci Shore is truly an expert on the topic. So many of these thinkers have influenced countless other disciplines and fields of study, and I think I leave the course with really important and valuable knowledge that I will be able to apply in other humanities\/social science courses, even outside of philosophy. I especially enjoyed this course as a first-year, and would recommend other first-years take it. Because it's a survey\/lecture course, it's a manageable way to begin with the history department, and it provides a broad overview of many topics that you can explore in greater depth down the line.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to others. I really gained a lot of knowledge about the subject, and Marci Shore is an excellent lecturer. Youll take away many insights about European intellectual history and how it connects to various movements and currents in the past century especially",
                "Id 100% recommend this course!",
                "YES!! TAKE IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT",
                "Absolutely. Very accessible for those new to philosophy, with the opportunity to go further in depth based on interest.",
                "Yes, many of the thinkers we look at have influenced all fields of academia. Professor Shore is kind and knowledgable. She and my TA were always trying to make the content relatable and relevant to this day and age, which made a subject that could be tedious pretty interesting.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Absolutely. This is a must take in my opinion and changes your worldview.",
                "Wonderful course that teaches modern European Intellectual History. Every fancy thinker you've heard of but never learned about it here, from Heidegger and Kant to Bergson and Havel. If you're fresh out of DS, this is a great place to start learning about the canon outside of the DS curriculum, and if you're generally interested in continental philosophy paired with an excellent survey of European history, this is the course for you.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. Very interesting ideas, and great lecturer.",
                "Yes, I recommend it. The course exposes you to a huge variety of information, with interesting lectures and a reasonable workload.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who feels that they lack understanding of the big historical waves of the last few centuries (enlightenment, communism, modernity, everything lol)"
