The concepts are relatively abstract and it is not a \"typical\" chemistry class that one can easily obtain answers from a textbook from. Thus, it really taught me how to put concepts together and express my answer cohesively.",

                "Because of Professor Mayer's structuring of this class, I felt like I came away with a really comprehensive conceptual chemistry foundation that has already proved to be valuable during the beginning of my research into chemistry opportunities and applications. This class provides an unique perspective towards basic chemistry because of Mayer's insistence on using quantum mechanics, orgo, MO theory, a few reactions and mechanisms, and solids rather than a continuation of the relatively formulaic and separate subtopics that I explored in high school chemistry classes, and I really appreciated and enjoyed this approach because it allowed for the professor to reference specific applications of the content and allowed the students to develop an richer and more realistic understanding of uncertainty and inter-field connections in chemistry. Beyond how the class was structured and taught, we had to complete weekly problem sets that were manageable but challenged our understanding enough that I developed a good habit of taking advantage of the peer tutors and TF sessions. In a similar way, it was extremely helpful and rewarding to work with other students and use review sessions and other class resources in preparation for tests. Overall, I feel a lot more capable of understanding basic chemistry and I'm really happy with the type of foundation that this class works to set.",

The course connected every topic in chemistry and science to real-life scenarios and current events, which really highlighted the importance of chemistry and the sciences.",
                "By taking this class, I did learn a great deal of information about chemistry, and it was very much all new for me even though I took AP Chem in high school because it is very much conceptually based and really no math. The topics discussed are of greater intellect so I was able to expand my thinking and knowledge of previous learning about chemistry. This course definitely taught me a lot about chemistry and gave me insight into thinking about further studies of science.",

The course took deep dives into the chemical phenomena associated with these topics and expanded far beyond a normal Gen Chem curriculum in its discussion of these phenomena. Personally, my main takeaway from this class was that many tenets of chemistry, as a subject, can be explained using the countless number of trends contained within the Periodic Table. Another main takeaway that I took from this class is that at an atomic level, orbital theory and an understanding of quantum mechanics is essential to explaining even the most simple chemical phenomena that we take for granted (e.g. chemical bond formation). Besides the knowledge contained within the class, the weekly problem sets caused me to learn how to schedule time to work on homework assignments throughout the week and utilize resources contained within the class that many classes at Yale also have available to students.",
                "I learnt how to think about Chemistry in a different way. The course was not based on memorisation, but rather on applying what we learnt in the class to moe complicated problems. I learnt how to do long psets, and how to ask for help whenever I need it. I learnt how to take tests that are completely different from tests back in high course was super challenging, but it taught to change my way of thinking when approaching questions.",

I found the solids unit intuitive and interesting, but struggled with the organic synthesis unit, as I'm not very good at following instructions in the correct order.",

We studied quantum mechanics, organic synthesis, transition metals, and solids, and there was so much overlap between them when you searched hard enough. This course also helped me think critically to solve the questions because there were no computations. Overall, I have a better and more thorough understanding of chemical sciences.",

I have also discovered that it is incredibly difficult for professors and teaching assistants to be able to discern what the student wants to get out of a question if the student asks a question that doesn't first demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the overarching topic being questioned.

                "Weaknesses:\r\n- complicated content\r\n- due to remote learning, experiments and demonstrations were significantly limited\r\n\r\nStrength\r\n- a lot of support particularly from TFs\r\n- the professor was very open to feedback, questions and discussion with students on any matter particularly for accomdations\r\n- interactive TFs",
                "Professor Mayer's kindness and understanding is a real highlight in what otherwise would be a pretty relentless and discouraging class. The exams were incredibly difficult and sometimes felt arbitrary in terms of the content that was on the exam (i.e. there would be 3 questions on a topic that didn't seem to be emphasized in class and an error in the first part of a question would significantly lower your score on the rest of the question even if you got all those parts right). However, Professor Mayer was extremely receptive to feedback and offered many options for improvement in the class as well as a clear explanation for why he wrote assessments as he did.",
                "The strengths of the course are having resources. Since the class is a bit larger the teaching team is rather large and there are many avenues to which you can reach out and ask for help (which is almost a requirement in this class, you will NOT know everything that is being taught).",
                "The strengths were that the TFs and Professor Mayer were very very keen to help. I received a ton of support from everyone within the course. I also liked that everything was very clearly laid our on where I could find information on Canvas. The recordings were always posted on an orderly manner.",
                "There should be a little more time devoted to reviewing concepts that we should know as background information. Maybe the peer tutors or TFs could hold sessions where they review background material so that it will be easier to understand for people with not as strong of a background.",
                "The strengths of this course were the accessibility of peer tutors, professor, and TFs and their review sessions. Generally, my email correspondences with any instructor\/tutor were well-received and timely.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course lie in the fact that it is extremely difficult to stay engaged with remote learning (not to any fault to the instructors). Moreover, I felt like the course material was rushed at the end of the year, especially after Thanksgiving break, and I didn't feel as prepared for the final as I thought.",
                "Strengths: The peer tutors are the best thing this class has to offer. They are incredibly kind and helpful and will more often than not be able to explain things in a way that makes sense. The psets and sapling homework were also very helpful. They definitely drove lecture points home. The sample midterms offer good practice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The 4 midterms plus a final were not very fun. I felt like midterm season never really ended for this class as we would have a test about every 2 weeks. It was definitely stressful when coupled with other classes. Sometimes the class did feel a bit all over the place. I am a visual learner so the lecture figures slides helped in that I could see the diagrams, but sometimes it was hard to engage\/take notes because I just did not know what he wanted us to take away from the slides.",
                "Strengths- Well-organized, pacing was good, many support systems (TFs, peer tutors, Professor Mayer). Professor Mayer is very responsive to student's comments. Weaknesses- Not many, this course requires a lot of studying though.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mayer was a really grounded and engaging instructor! His lectures were concise, the structure and content of the class was great, and I really appreciated the professor's philosophy towards teaching this class. Homework and tests were challenging but manageable, discussion sections and breakout rooms provided a nice opportunity to get to know and work with other students, and peer tutors and TFs were generally helpful. Overall, great course and great professor.\r\nWeaknesses: A few of the TFs and peer tutors were more helpful than others, which I suppose is partially a preference thing, but at the same time, my discussion sections weren't always super helpful relative to reaching out to or working with other TFs or peer tutors during review sessions.",
                "Strengths: I think the topics of this course are very very interesting, and there are super cool connections that Prof. Mayer makes in problem sets and in lecture figures. I also believe that the course was well designed for virtual learning and collaboration between students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the course information is sometimes a little too beyond our pay-grade, and Prof. Mayer doesn't do the best job of making a distinction between what we should know and what is just \"icing on the cake,\" so to say.",
                "Strength was that there was alot of time for questions and student concerns. A weakness was that sometimes the lecutres were too slow paced so that parts of the material were not completely covered in depth.",
                "This course came with a ton of support from many different people, including the professor who was always very open to answering questions and gave us many opportunities to have one-on-one conversations with him. Also, the problem sets were formulated in a way that prompted us to think and reinforce the concepts we learn in lecture very well. I think the only thing that could be improved is for the lectures to be taken in a slower approach, more carefully explaining the basic concepts in lecture and leaving the concepts that connect the basics for us to figure out through the problem sets on our own time.",
                "The strength of this course is the great learning that you will do. Although the topics are intellectually difficult to understand, looking back, I do like how I learned newer material and now feel pretty comfortable with the past units. There are many more weaknesses however with this course. First of all, having it be online just made learning so much harder. If we were in person and in lecture, I think every person in the class would have done better, and it is so hard to pay attention to Prof Mayers lecture online because there is minimal student participation and he goes very fast. The workload isn't too too bad, but the weekly Problem Sets usually have questions about random material or info that we hadn't even covered yet which made that frustrating. Also, having this on top of the Sapling seemed useless, and the Sapling and Problem Set questions were usually unrelated. Also, there were 4 midterms this year, which is a lot, and they are extremely challenging. Most questions on the exams were very skewed from the questions in class, and even if you studied all the material, there is a great chance you would have no idea how to answer a question. The questions were also confusing in the way that you literally couldn't decide whether you were supposed to draw something of writing something, and the professor really didn't seem to care. Even after numerous errors and obvious confusion by the class, the professor still did the same things on each following test which seemed very unfair.",
                "I really enjoyed how many resources we had with the course. There were many peer tutors and teaching fellows, and the professor was very engaged with his students. I also liked having both ximera and problem sets, because the ximera provided immediate feedback on my answers which helped with the problem sets (which more resembled exams). However, I feel that it was difficult to grasp onto the concepts of quantum mechanics right at the start of the course. I feel like I may have better understood quantum mechanics if it was taught later in the course.",
                "You learn a lot from this class, not only about chemistry but science as a whole. If you are interested in chemistry, this is the perfect course. Leaving each lecture, I would be in awe about how interesting chemistry can be and how useful it is in our world. Since you learn so much, the course does go quite fast and Professor Mayer can sometimes get behind if there are too many questions per lecture. However, Professor Mayer is also very reasonable and will not test you under-prepared.",
                "This course, in my opinion, was not very well structured or conducive to learning. Lectures themselves were often dull, full of tangents, and explanations didn't really make sense. Further, the overall structure of the course felt not very focused or like the topics really connected to each other. Better organization and optimization of class time as well as an increased focus on the material and optimal ways to explain\/demonstrate topics would improve this course.",
                "The main strength of this course is that it is entirely conceptual so more complex concepts can be learned relatively easily.  However, because the topics covered are complex, the amount of practice needed to understand them is greater, but that's an inherent tradeoff of the course and not anything that can really be improved.",
                "Professor mayor was a huge strength in this course. He was always calm and collected in class, and insured that everyone had fun learning the material he presented. He would often coordinate to have recorded demonstrations of labs he would typically do in person to be sure that even in this virtual format, we were never left questioning the material from lecture.",
                "One of the  strengths is that the connections between different units is really emphasized, so you get a very comprehensive understanding of chemistry. One of the weaknesses is that you move through material really fast and sometimes topics aren't covered in lecture thoroughly, so you have to do a lot of learning outside of class.",
                "Strengths: The course had many resources available to the students - peer tutors, the teaching fellows, and the professor himself. The large number of peer tutors (and subsequently, peer tutoring sessions) were extremely helpful for those who needed help on the problem sets or had questions about the class, in general. Another part of the class that I would consider a strength was the qualitative consideration of chemistry without a quantitative emphasis. It's not an angle that a typical college chemistry course would seem to take, but I think it was useful in ensuring that the students developed an intuition for chemistry instead of just learning how to plug-and-chug mathematical equations. \r\nWeaknesses: The class did not have many weaknesses. I believe that the class\/instructor suffered a bit from moving to an online format, and that some of the material was not covered exhaustively in some topics. However, the instructor was aware when this occurred and took it into account when preparing midterms and exams. Besides this, I believe the most glaring weakness was the inclusion of nuclear chemistry in the curriculum. In hindsight, I'm not sure what role it played in the scope of the class. I believe nuclear chemistry would be best either omitted in order to focus on the other topic areas or covered more in-depth than it was in this iteration of the class.",
                "Strengths- a lot of support from the peer tutors, the TAs, and the professor. I loved that they have multiple review sessions before exams. The course is not based on memorisation. If you go to the peer tutors, its easy to do the psets. You learn A TON and the goal is to make you think about chemistry in a new way\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes you have no idea what to do in order to improve, even if you study for days, you still might be missing a lot; it takes a lot to learn how to think about the material in the way that Prof. Mayer wants you to; the material was very condensed and it moved super quickly, but maybe thats because of the COVID semester",
                "I feel that the course was very strong in its access to resources. Beyond the professor, there were several TFs and Peer tutors who made it easy to ask questions and have concepts clarified.",
                "The material seemed to be different than what I thought it was going to be. I had hoped it would give me a deeper understanding of chemistry but I often left lectures very confused.",
                "I found the numerous resources provided to us incredibly helpful.",
                "I thought the weakness was the repetitiveness of the class and the Sapling was annoying and not very helpful. The strength was the pace of the class.",
                "Strengths are discussion sections and the content of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the Prof. Mayer's lectures are a little scattershot and there isn't always a great expectation of what one needs to know for the exams.",
                "The breakout rooms worked well and the support given outside of class (office hours, peer tutors etc) were very helpful. However, lectures were not very engaging, and the sapling homework rarely matched up with the lecture topics. In addition, after essentially self-teaching sapling topics, it was disheartening to see that the material would not show up on exams, or that the topics did not go in enough depth to be of use. Much of the homework felt like busy work.",
                "The course teaches you a LOT. It definitely challenges you a lot more than high school chemistry classes, as to be expected. At times it was a bit overwhelming with so many new topics coming at you.",
                "Strengths - Professor Mayer is very passionate about teaching and chemistry. TF Linda is absolutely amazing at explaining concepts. Having all the lectures recorded SAVED me this semester because I have no idea how I would have survived if I couldnt go back and watch the lectures. The PEER TUTORS. Cannot emphasize enough how helpful they were. \r\nWeaknesses - the workload was QUITE heavy. The psets were really long and studying for the exam took such a long time and you could study for a long time and still get a really bad grade. It felt like you could never put in enough work, which was really demoralizing. And the class average for some of the exams was VERY low.",
                "Strengths: An abundance of study resources, including peer tutors and TFs. Weaknesses: The lectures tend to be a little dry, and they're not always laid out in the most approachable way. Sometimes the professor (Mayer, in my case) jumps quickly from talking about big-picture connections to very specific technical details in the material. This can catch you off guard. For me, having the lecture recordings was a life-saver, as I could rewatch any parts of lecture that I had missed the first time around.",
                "The peer tutors, TFs, and Professor Mayer were all very helpful and gave us lots of opportunities to ask questions and review concepts we didn't understand. The biggest weakness was that the lectures weren't super engaging over zoom.",
                "I have no general notes for the improvement of the course.  I thought there were ample learning resources, the material was well-covered, and the course was well-adapted to the online format.",
                "I think the way the class was set up was really nice, our professor gave us good information that could be kind of confusing at times but attending the peer tutor sessions helped clarify things and learn them to a greater extent. The only thing I did not really enjoy about this class was the four midterms that we had to do because it was a little overwhelming, especially with a midterm only a week before our final.",
                "Strengths: lots of support offered by peer tutors and TFs; instructor was understanding of student needs\r\nWeaknesses: for the first two tests, new material that would be on the test was covered on the day of the exam--a little stressful esp. for those who did not have free time later in the day to review the material.",
                "The course is very thorough. There are many units that cover seemingly disconnected topics, but as you go further into the year, the overlap seems more and more clear. Professor Mayer is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about chemistry. However, the course is taught in a very unorganized manner. To take notes and review for our four midterms, I could barely refer to the syllabus for guidance; I rewatched some lectures, attended peer tutor and TF sessions, took more notes in discussion sections, attended his office hours, and sometimes I was still confused. There is so much material that is covered in this course.",
                "Sometimes Professor Mayer would get sidetracked or not fully explain the slides; 2 of the 4 TFs were FAR better than the other two. (They were better at explaining concepts and answering questions). The Peer Tutors were outstanding.",
                "A strength is that there really isn't any prior experience needed to learn the material in this course. A weakness is that I don't really feel like I learned a lot of chemistry in this course, rather I learned very specific things in the field of chemistry that don't really seem like something that should be taught in a general chemistry course.",
                "This course teaches a lot about chemistry, but it is also pretty difficult and requires a lot of work.",
                "The course covered a wide range of topics which was a strength as well as having numerous opportunities\/review sessions to engage with professors and TFs as well as better learn the information presented.",
                "When there isnt proper closure to a lecture it feels like we just listened to an elderly  man ramble about teaching stoichiometry to Congress for 50 minutes. That is a weakness. The strength is that the class is organized very well. I like the lesson order and plan.",
                "Strengths - tests concepts and understanding instead of memorization\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes unclear instruction on what to focus on for each test, and test material was very different from lecture\/pset material. I and most of my classmates could not have succeeded in this class without regular help from peer tutors who had experience with the professor and class.",
                "Strengths: Amazing support system with Tfs\/Peer Tutors\/professor \r\nWeaknesses: The files in Canvas are very hard to navigate",
                "The material felt very strange at times, but the office hours, peer tutors, and teaching fellows were a massive help. The problem sets also do a great job of taking you through the course material and reinforcing certain concepts.",
                "This course manages to cover very complicated subjects of chemistry in one semester without being too overwhelming. At the same time, though, I felt like there was a lot of information that would have nicely explained the gaps in content.",
                "This course was very interesting. I did like the content. However, I am concerned it did not provide the right step into organic chemistry which I will be taking next. I probably should have taken chem 161, not because I did poorly in this class, but because I feel the chem 161 content is more useful. however, I am still glad I took this class because I still think a lot of what we learned is applicable.",
                "Strengths: nice teacher \r\nWeakness: i did not do well because it was too much content, too little time.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and most of the concepts I learned in it were interesting. There were times, however, that I felt that some concepts that were very important were not stressed well enough in lecture."

The online format of course made it more difficult for me to concentrate, especially in back-to-back classes, but that wasn't the fault of this class at all. There were more than enough office hours to clear up confusion.",
                "The quality of video demonstrations could be improved",
                "The virtual peer tutor office hours are a godsend. Having them at different times almost everyday of the week made it easy to join when you had an hour and needed help with chemistry. I don't know how Peer Tutor office hours were conducted before the pandemic but whatever work was done to adapt them to a virtual format was seamless.",
                "The breakout rooms were a huge success I think.",
                "I think this course really did well in adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic. The lectures were always recorded and uploaded in the timely manner, the canvas page had clear subsections, and all the TFs and Professor Mayer himself always responded to emails in a timely manner.",
                "I think that Prof. Mayer and the peer tutors and teaching fellows made themselves available for questions and were very helpful in their office hours that they held outside of class times. I also think recording all of the review sessions was very helpful. The fact that the lectures were recorded was also very helpful.",
                "I would think that the weekly Zoom review sessions set up by the peer tutors and the review sessions before each midterm were extremely helpful. I find it very difficult to participate in class, especially in a remote setting, so having more personalized sessions helped me ask the questions I had.",
                "The breakout rooms were nice in getting certain concepts across.",

                "The virtual lecture format went really smoothly - I never really felt like I wasn't engaged because of the Zoom system. The breakout rooms were good, except sometimes they weren't the most active or helpful thing depending on the people in your group and their willingness to engage virtually. Zoom proctored tests seemed to work about as well as reasonably possible, but I'm not exactly convinced that the system is seamless. Virtual discussion sections worked great. The submission for problem sets and tests was also pretty easy and user-friendly, which was nice.",
                "I think the most successful feature was the breakout rooms with practice questions that allowed students to develop interpersonal skills along with chemistry skills. I can't really think of anything negative about this course, because this was honestly the most well-planned course in terms of COVID learning that I took this semester.",
                "Breakout rooms were utilized in order to promote smaller groups and interaction. Annotate features through zoom were very helpful in engaging each indiviaul student to respond.",
                "Every single virtual lecture and discussion was conducted very well. The lectures were engaging, the discussion sections were great at clarification of lecture topics, and the peer tutors were amazing at giving us advice on how to study for the class. Even though these were all in a virtual format, I think that we were still effectively able to use these resources.",
                "I don't think that the course could've really been designed better or more adapted to an online environment since it was generally just a lecture, but the fact that it was online just made it really difficult to learn. The breakrooms were good for student participation, but honestly seemed useless for the class, and ended up in the lecture being rushed. The tests were online because of COVID, and the professors and TFs did a pretty good job of making the process easy and fair.",
                "The zoom review sessions were very successful, and I like how all meetings were recorded. I could rewatch lectures and rewatch review sessions, which were very useful for studying for the exams and final.",
                "I liked how the lectures were designed so asynchronous students were not at a disadvantage. It was a lot less stressful, but still offered the same quality of teaching. This made this class one of my favorites this semester.",
                "Nothing was changed for this course except the fact that all lectures and discussion sections were online via zoom. These lectures we not very engaging. Finding a way to make lectures more engaging and more streamlined for the online format would improve this course.",
                "It was really helpful that the lectures, review sessions, and even some of the office hours were recorded. It would make studying easier, and it would give me a lot of flexibility in my schedule (especially for evenings with lots of homework or extracurriculars). I also really liked that our breakout rooms were consistent throughout the semester. It allowed us to just dive straight into the material rather than awkwardly try to get to know each other every time we were put in rooms.",
                "I cannot think of a way that this course could be improved aside from meeting in person. Im extremely grateful for the hard work of the entire teaching team to make the semester possible even with the coronavirus.",

                "I believe the transition of discussion sections and peer tutoring sessions to a virtual format went well, and in some instances, were more convenient as a virtual tenet of the class. I believe the inclusion of breakout rooms within lecture was also successful. However, the breakout rooms could be improved with some small adjustments. I think that the breakout room could function well with a \"warm-up\" in the beginning of lecture so as to not disturb the flow of lecture. I also found that the breakout room took away a lot of time from lecture, so I believe a better balance could be found by shortening the time allotted for the breakout room.",
                "I think that the material should be more spread out of some should be removed, because there was too much and not enough time to review and make sure that you get the concepts.\r\n\r\nI liked the zoom office hours and peer tutoring. It was super organised and allowed to ask all of your questions very peacefully (i imagine that going to peer tutoring in person is much more hectic)",
                "I feel that Professor Mayer handled the adjustment to COVID very well. Although we sometimes had diffiulty with breakout rooms in class, they were not so much that they impeded the quality of the course.",

                "The breakout rooms after lecture were very successful. However, the lectures themselves would frequently leave questions till after class and were not covered very well.",
                "Succeeded - recorded lectures. Sometimes the zoom fatigue hit or i was just too tired and I didnt feel like going to lecture, but lectures were recorded which was helpful and helpful for studying. Also having the exam review sessions recorded was a plus. \r\n\r\nI think because of the virtual format, it was hard for Professor Mayer to know when we were struggling to understand a concept, which manifested in poor exam grades. I heard that in past years the average went up after each exam, but that was not the case for our class. I feel like the class was harder since it was virtual.",
                "The recorded lectures were great, as well as the recordings of the peer tutor and TF review sessions.",
                "Having lectures and my discussion section virtually went smoothly, but Gradescope was often difficult to use when submitting an assignment or midterm.",
                "The practice of recording review sessions was extremely helpful, as it allowed me to watch sessions that I missed.  The method of administering exams was also very well done.  I don't know how many breakout rooms there were during lecture, but it felt like my group was visited by an instructor less often that I might have expected.  That wasn't a major problem though, as all answers were covered back in the main lecture.",

                "The lectures being live was great. We went into breakout rooms often to interact with other students and the TAs. That was always helpful. however, it being a lecture on the computer, a lot of the demonstrations that would have been done in class were done through the computer. Therefore, sometimes it was harder to understand things such as 3D shapes of electron\/molecular orbitals and things like that.",
                "I greatly appreciated that almost all of the material (recorded lectures, slides, etc) was posted on Canvas in a very organized manner, which made it much more accessible.  Additionally, I thought the large volume of live virtual discussion (review Zoom sessions, various peer tutoring hours, etc.) were very helpful in providing an interactive aspect to the class.",
                "Lectures were not helpful because it was like watching an hour long video of a professor slow talking.",
                "I think that the class should be reorganized for online school because professor Mayer was often unable to cover all of the material he wanted to. I think that professor Mayer and the TF's did not realize that everything takes a longer time in online class than in in-person classes. Asking a question takes much longer and going into groups and working on a problem takes longer. The breakout rooms always felt rushed."

                "Yes, but not during COVID. There are quite a few fascinating parts of chemistry you wouldn't learn in a normal chemistry course. But they are quite difficult to wrap your head around, especially in the beginning, so I wouldn't try to take it online. If chemistry interests you, take it!",
                "Yes, the content was genuienly interesting",
                "I would recommend the course based on the breadth of the content you'll learn but discourage taking the course based on the inordinate level of studying required. This course was extremely challenging and it requires serious investment to succeed. If you aren't interested in Chemistry prior to the course or you have a rigorous schedule I would recommend taking CHEM 163. The assessments were difficult and tamed down my enthusiasm for chemistry but I also learned a lot in the class.",
                "Yes, I recommend this course for those who has a good understanding in chemistry and are looking for a challenge. The effort you put into the class is really important, but you'll learn a lot. There are many resources available such as peer tutoring, TFs, and the professor's office hours. If you take advantage of these opportunities to ask question and actively engage in the class, CHEM 163 is doable.",
                "Yes, I would, if you are comfortable with the AP chemistry background, this course will stretch you and make you think about chemistry in different ways. It's all very interesting stuff but you obviously have to like chemistry first.",
                "Yes, but only if one is truly interested in Chemistry or is ready to put in more work. This class took up a lot of mine time in comparison to other classes and the workload was very challenging. I would only recommend to those with a high level of interest. If one is looking more to fulfill a requirement, then I would think the regular general chemistry class is a better fit.",
                "Unless you really like chemistry, I would not recommend this course.",
                "Yes, the topics covered were pretty interesting even if they were difficult",
                "I would recommend this course to students that are passionate about chemistry and are genuinely interested in it. I would not recommend this course to anyone looking for an \"easy credit.\"",
                "If you have taken AP Chem or something similar then this course is nice in that it goes one step beyond what you already know. It is difficult to grasp certain concepts but working through the psets, going to peer tutors, etc should help you along.",
                "Yes, if you would like to explore more topics that are usually not taught in general chemistry. If you need a refresher, I would suggest 161 since this course introduces a lot of new material.",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend and have already recommended this course because of how we approached chemistry conceptually and because of the content that Mayer uses to develop our foundation. I really loved the arc of the class, moving from exploring periodic trends through quantum mechanics to orgo, synthesis, and mechanisms to transition metals chemistry to solids and material science. Professor Mayer is a really great instructor and the peer tutors and TFs are super helpful resources that make the class really manageable. The content and work is challenging but I found it super rewarding and, again, manageable. Also, perhaps this is an individual experience, but I thought that CHEM 163 was a really great class for me after talking to and living with peers in 161 and freshman orgo - especially compared to freshman orgo, which sounded like it was largely self-taught or relentless, a stark contrast to this class which felt reasonably challenging and comprehensive but totally within reach, especially if you took advantage of the multitude of opportunities to better develop your understanding of the content like practice resources, so many weekly peer tutoring sessions, and pre-midterm review sessions. I really enjoyed Mayer's 163 and totally feel like I made the right choice.",
                "Absolutely! Please do not be afraid of the intellectual challenges along with the low grades you may receive. It is all relative, and the depth of knowledge coming from Prof. Mayer is unparalleled.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. Teaching and layout of the course promoted a fundamental understanding of chemistry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Although it is frustrating at first with the extremely complex concepts and the workload, the learning that goes on is something that you will appreciate by the end of the course.",
                "This course was not totally terrible, but looking at the situation, I myself would NOT RECOMMEND this course to other people. Maybe if you are really a go-getter, and feel like you want an extreme challenge then sure, but if you arent planning to major in Chem and don't feel the need for intense intellectual gain then no. Looking back, the material that we learned was interesting and some still stick with me, but during the course, it was a struggle to keep up with the information and to study for tests. Also, some of the exams were very unfair, and they were not written well at all. I would study weeks prior and devoted about 75% of my time a week in advance to studying for these exams, but they rarely paid off. It is frustrating when you put the time in to do good, but the exams are structured in a way that getting a great grade is almost impossible. One great thing about the class though is the number of resources they give you to understand the material, which is a lot, however, it seems like even with all of this help, it is still so hard to do good. Also, choosing this class over Chem 165 is pointless. I could've done much better in Chem 165 and it probably would've saved me from the insane amount of stress, anxiety, and tears that were drained for me by taking 163. Most of my friends were flying by w great colors in 165, and my biggest regret of this semester is taking 163 instead of 165. They put me into this class since I did well in AP Chem my sophomore year of highschool, yet I felt completely unprepared to take this class. If you really want a challenge and feel confident in Chem then sure, take the course, but I advise people who are less confident to AVOID TAKING THE CLASS.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student passionate about chemistry and very confident about their general chemistry skills. The course gives a good introduction to organic chemistry. However, the course does require a rather sufficient background in general chemistry and a willingness to accept concepts that cannot necessarily be visualized (ie quantum mechanics).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any students that is interested in chemistry. It truly made me love the subject even more and has made me reconsider my future. You will come out of the course prepared for numerous future courses if you plan to major in chemistry.",
                "No. I'm a STEM major and really loved chemistry in high school but really did not like this course. The lectures were not well organized or structured, and the professor often went on tangents that wasted time and made it so often lectures got cut off mid-concept because class time was up and didn't cover all the material they were supposed to cover. No clear feedback was given on homework or tests. Having a midterm during reading week was not ideal, making it so the last midterm and the final were basically back to back. This course is not worth it, just take regular general chemistry or first year organic chemistry, at least then the labs will line up and make sense.",
                "Yes yes yes! There were plenty of times I was frustrated with the course, but I am so glad I took it. I learned so much, even (or especially) when it was hard. At first, I was a little bit scared out of the idea of being a chemistry major, but upon some reflection, I'm not as scared by that idea anymore. I'm looking forward to seeing how I like CHEM 167!",
                "If you want a different approach to the world, then you should definitely take this class.  Because it is entirely theoretical, mathematics skills (other than algebra) really aren't needed, but if heavy conceptual topics are difficult for you then I would probably avoid this sequence.",
                "I have recommended this course to several friends. Coming into the class, I had only taken sophomore level chemistry at my high school. I was worried that I would be in over my head, but my teaching fellow, Grace, Professor Mayer, and the entire teaching team along with my peers helped me understand the concepts they were presented in class. The concepts were also extremely interesting and nothing like a traditional Gen Chem class. I cant recommend this class enough!",
                "It depends. I think if you really like chemistry and have a good background in it, then you'll probably enjoy this course. However, if you don't have a good background in chemistry, or are mainly just looking to fill a prerequesite, then this may not be the course for you because it is challenging and time-consuming. However, Professor Mayer is great and really understanding. This is also a really rewarding course, in terms of the knowledge that you'll gain from it. Besides how comfortable you are with chemistry, the main deciding factor between taking this course or taking 161 is really how much time and effort you're willing to put in.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who took AP\/IB chemistry in high school and has demonstrated a level of knowledge to advance past regular Gen Chem. I believe that this course provides an intellectual challenge that fosters the development of critical thinking skills that are lacking within our generation while simultaneously acting as a proficient gateway course in the transition from high school STEM courses to college-level STEM courses. On top of that, I believe that the topics discussed in this class (organic chemistry in particular) will be useful in building a knowledge base for various other college STEM courses.",
                "If they feel ready for it. This course is very time consuming and the student must take it upon themself to learn and understand most of the material since the class moves at a very quick pase.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is not easy at all and there it a ton of work that requires hours and days. The tests are also super difficult and cover advanced material. However, I have never felt so proud before. I took a three and a half hour exam and wrote 18 pages! This is insane. I am proud of all the effort I have shown and that I stuck to the end. I learnt so so much and got to interact with the amazing peer tutors and the ta. I used to think that maybe I should have taken 161, because I really was struggling, but in the end I was super happy with 163. It was an amazing course and Prof. Mayer really cares about his students. He was super accommodating. Just keep in mind that this is a hard course that requires a lot of work, dedication, and a new way of thinking. Forget about high school chem and enjoy this course. No matter how many points you get, you learn a ton!",
                "No. This is because I do not feel like the class was taught very well. The professor was very willing to answer all of our questions and take our feedback but personally, his method of explaining concepts was difficult for me to understand.",
                "I would recommend the course only if the student wanted a challenge and was willing to put in the effort; but, I truly believe that I learned a lot from the course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it.",
                "Yes, it really helped me grow as a chemist and a student, but it is a significant challenge. If you're serious about your education, this is a great course to take at Yale.",
                "I would, it is a good general chemistry course even with its shortcomings.",
                "If you are really into chemistry or want a little exposure to organic and other advanced topics before taking more advanced chem classes, then I would. But if you just need intro chem to check off a box, then I would probably would just stick with the non-advanced version.",
                "No. This class workload was unnecessarily high and the course was unnecessarily difficult. I understand that Professor Mayer is super passionate about chemistry, but sometimes he didnt realize that it was all a bit excessive. Love him though - hes very sweet and you can tell he cares about his studentsI hear the curve for the final grades is generous. I would recommend this class to someone who was really passionate about chemistry and doesnt mind spending hours trying to understand the subject.",
                "Yes, the course forces you to think outside of the box and apply concepts in different ways that aren't covered in class that much. It was difficult, but it was rewarding to take the class.",
                "Yes, it's really not too bad. As someone who was good at chemistry in HS but not -that- good, I felt challenged (and sometimes frustrated) but I think I managed to learn a good bit of material.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have a strong background in chemistry and you're willing to put in the work to do well. It's not impossible to do well in the class, but if you're rusty on some of the basic concepts you might be better off taking 161. If you do take it, make sure to attend the peer tutor review sessions!!",
                "Yes!  It is a difficult class, but so very rewarding when a concept is finally in your hands!",
                "I think I would certainly recommend it as an intro chemistry course, because the real-world application that it brings in is interesting, and the pace works well.  The introduction to organic chem seems like it would be particularly useful if I take further chemistry courses in the future.  However, even with the outside applications, this is still a very technical course, and it seems difficult to bring the technical knowledge into casual everyday life, so I don't think I would recommend it to someone who isn't already planning on taking chemistry.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to another student because I felt it was very enriching and gave a really good foundation for the organic chemistry class that I will have to take next year.",
                "Yes, but a strong background in general chemistry must be combined with a lot of hours put into mastery the specific content and types of questions covered in this class (there isn't much review of general chemistry).",
                "I would recommend this course if you have a strong background in chemistry, a desire to learn, and if you're a hard worker. This course was very challenging, but it was very fulfilling. We went really in-depth on various topics, so there was at least one section that everyone really liked. Also, throughout the entire course, there weren't any calculations and even the formulas we studied we only used conceptually; so if you prefer to learn and understand concepts without worrying about math, I also would recommend this course for you. Be warned: it is a lot of work, but finishing the course feels extremely fulfilling.",
                "Yes! if you're interested in learning the more theoretical parts of chemistry rather than doing a ton of calculations.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student, but only a student who is OK with taking a theoretical and not mathematical approach to chemistry.",
                "I would not recommend this course, I would recommend people just take Chem 161 instead.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interesting in learning chemistry, especially a broad range of topics, but probably only one with a lot of knowledge of chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the information in class was very useful and presented in a way that the students were able to learn. Although at times topics were challenging, the class have ample opportunites through discussion section and review sessions before exams to learn the information.",
                "Meh, probably, but I really feel that it should just be taken by first years.",
                "Yes, for those with a strong understanding from AP Chemistry in high school.",
                "Yes. If you feel confident about your knowledge of high school chemistry but do not want to jump straight into organic, this is the perfect course. While it is considered \"general chemistry\", what we cover goes both deeper and wider than what is covered in the typical AP Chemistry course. The coursework is manageable and facilitates learning in a productive way.",
                "Yes! Prof. Mayer is great and really tries to teach the material in fun and interesting ways that also showcase real-life applications.",
                "Yes. I do think this course was very interesting and the content can be very helpful for future courses. However, it is a very difficult course with a big course load and lots of studying required.",
                "No. I did not like it. Topics were irrelevant from each other.",
                "I would recommend it if they have a passion for chemistry and the time and effort to study it. It's a difficult, yet rewarding class."
