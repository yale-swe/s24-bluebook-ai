                "The lecture format is in a podcast format, which is fascinating to listen to, but it is definitely on a rather unorganized side, and it is hard to follow sometimes. If you have no background in Chinese history, it is very tough to follow in the first half o the class.",
                "I really liked the format of the course. I enjoyed that there were six different topics that we focused on throughout the course, allowing us to learn about a breadth of different areas. The lecture format accompanied by discussion sections was engaging.",
                "It was a good survey course for understanding China with some historical perspective. The fact that the course covered several units and fields from history to politics, to literature, to technology, made it difficult to re-adjust and apply feedback from previous assignments.",
                "Strengths: section and the guest speakers really helped the course. The section afforded us the opportunity to really dig deeper into the humanistic side of US-China relations, while the guest speakers offered a contemporary view with some of the world's leaders in the field (I particularly loved the last unit with the technological speakers and reporters!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were extremely unengaging. I know this was partially due to technical difficulties, but not only were lectures not recorded as the course staff said they would be, but even attending them live wasn't helpful. Professor Tsu's slides only had like a handful of pictures, and the rest was a monologue of analysis. Providing more interactive activities or more dynamic presentations would have made this class much better -- I didn't get much out of the lectures at all outside of section and the readings. \r\n\r\nThe readings also were rather uneven. Assigning 300-400 page books at the end of the semester was a difficult way to engage with the material. It would have been helpful to assign a more reasonable, 80-100 page reading load each week, instead of just dumping it on students.",
                "I enjoyed all the guest speakers - wish there was more question time at the end",
                "Overall, I did not find the readings and lecture to be very related. The assignments could be done without attending lecture. Discussion Section was a great place to discuss the different concepts, which I loved to do."

                "China in Six Keys (EALL 256)  part of the 2023 DeVane Lectures program  was a powerful, important and topical class taught by Yales Dr. Jing Tsu. For those not familiar, the DeVane Lectures program opens up Yale classrooms to non-Yale affiliated New Haven residents at no cost  and as a result, our class was often filled with as many adult and continuing education learners as there were Yale students. That said, the courses discussion sections are exclusively for credit-earning students. \r\n\r\nChina in Six Keys ambitiously tackles six contemporary topics (ranging from Chinas ambitions in the Arctic to an examination of the artistic work and life journey of artist Ai Weiwei) about modern China and examines them all contemporaneously as well as in deeper historical context. Against the backdrop of those topics, Dr. Tsu focuses on how China has historically adapted, assimilated, rejected and integrated with a world system that has been largely shaped by the West. Each of the individual topics offer opportunities for students to think deeply about and engage with original source material. Dr. Tsu makes clear that her goal is to draw lessons from the past to help students better understand the drivers behind the choices China and the West will make in the present and future  what those choices might mean. The course easily achieves and surpasses her goal.\r\n\r\nClass mechanics are straight-forward; weekly lectures and discussion sections. Grading is entirely based on class attendance, discussion section participation and six (relatively short, approximately 600-to-750-word essays  graded on a check/check plus basis) on each of the topics the course covers. While there are suggested prompts for each of the papers, they are by design open-ended and invite students to voice their own ideas, interpretations and connections with the material/subjects.   \r\n\r\nWhile I really valued and enjoyed the lectures, I ***loved*** the smaller, more intimate discussion sections. I was incredibly fortunate to have Melodie Liu TF our section - and she was phenomenal. Melodie brought her deep domain expertise, backed by thoughtful and strong classroom moderator skills to each session - always facilitating meaningful discussions; always with a positive, encouraging approach. Beyond the actual sessions, the feedback she provided on each and every paper I submitted was reflective of the extraordinary time and care she invested reviewing our work. Her comments and questions about my essays were insightful and helpful. Reading her feedback on each assignment inspired me to think even more deeply about the themes and topics we were covering; and often motivated me to go back and spend more time with the original source material. \r\n\r\nBecause it was part of the DeVane Lecture series, Im not sure if/when this course might be offered again. That said, if you have an interest in better understanding China, its role in the world as well as the historical drivers behind current economic, social and political trends within Modern China and how those might effect the global world order, China in Six Keys is a course you cant afford to miss.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The topics we learned about were engaging and the class was designed to facilitate student learning.",
                "Maybe. If you're looking for a gut and are interested in US-China relations, then this is a good course for you, especially if this is your first introduction to a humanities class. For more advanced majors or students in their humanities coursework, though, you won't get much out of this. You might get a gem in section though which salvages this class. I would see which guest speakers are going to come and if you're interested in them.",
                "Yes - I think Yale and the USA more generally has a strong anti-China rhetoric and this class really allowed me to see China as China and not an Americanised version of China",
