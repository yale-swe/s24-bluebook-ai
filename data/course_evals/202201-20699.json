                "I learnt about the purpose and practice of translation. The final project gave me a chance to experiment with literary translation, while the more critical seminars helped me engage with the critical thought surrounding the genre.",
                "This course helped my translation skills SO much, this mixture of theory and practical workshopping is ideal and it helps to situate your translation within a history of translation theory, while also giving you lots of time to workshop your own translation and improve your editing skills by workshopping others in the class. My prose writing also improved so much through the short assignments each week at the beginning of the semester. Prof. Cole teaches you to be a punchy, concise writer across lots of different types of writing. This class is great for anyone who wants to be a better writer, translator, and editor.",
                "Obviously translation skills, but also fundamental new perspectives in reading and writing, new ways of engaging with a material and not just understanding but experiencing the texture of language",
                "So much. \r\n\r\nGained appreciation for translation as a discipline, a list of several wonderful essayists (on translation, but also on literature more broadly), tools\/language for discussing words and sentences in more precise detail. Leaving this class, I have a better understanding of what makes or breaks good poetry, how words ought to be in tension with one another, the slippery nature of parts of speech.",
                "Broader + deeper understanding of translation from a historical and theoretical perspective; lots of practice in translation; extensive workshops in which we gave one another feedback that (I think) greatly improved our translations",
                "This course was a phenomenal introduction to be the theory and practice of literary translation. By taking the course, I learned about the schools of thought that have historically existed in the practice of translation and more recently in translation studies, and the practices they endorsed in translation. The course affirmed the importance of translation as an art and a science, and studying the way people have talked about translation informed my thinking about a variety of communication and thought problems today. Professor Cole's curriculum provides a broad overview of the history of translation in the Western world, and he keeps things engaging in the classroom throughout the semester.",
                "How to translate, how to read, how to listen",
                "I learned how to deconstruct and proselytize love: how to identify what, exactly, it is that grips me about a text, and how to go about bringing that thing over in a translation. In the process, I became a better writer and a more empathetic reader. I also gained a general understanding of the various theories and dogmas of literary translation as they have developed over time and as they exist in the present day.",

                "The class was structured in an excellent way to facilitate class discussions around certain critical readings. It certainly was not like other creative writing classes that I have taken; I would say that the class is more heavy on criticism. One small logistical improvement could be de-listing it as a creative writing course, which would give majors the flexibility to take the class without it counting towards 1 of 2 creative writing credits. Other non-creative writing courses sometimes have a far greater creative writing component and far smaller critical component than this class did.",
                "The strength of this course is its teaching and the level of engagement from everyone in the class. You really become a little translation community where everyone becomes obsessed by each others work and the various theorists we read. It is such a supportive environment and I always felt comfortable sharing my thoughts in class and trying out new things in my translation. The short assignments at the beginning of the semester are a lot of work but they are helpful to really throw you in the deep end and make sure that you have a strong foundation before you work on your longer project at the end of the semester.",
                "Strength: everything. Professor Cole and Spencer. My classmates. The way Professor Cole provides guidance on readings and makes sure everyone is engaged during the discussion - making sure that the discussion doesn't stay in one place but by the end of the class we are transported to a new, fascinating place. The workshops. I can't say enough about how much joy it is every Wednesday and Thursday to read everyone's work. The assignments. This is not the typical \"reading response\" type of assignment but the type that will really open up your senses and cognitive faculties to the text at hand and general principles in translation. \r\nWeakness: it's too short. I wish this could be a year-long course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Cole, the depth\/breadth of readings, the mix of theory and application, the warm and collaborative environment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement: require students to consult with Professor Cole or Spencers about their project before the semester starts. I think I wouldve gotten even more out of this wonderful class if I had a project in mind before our first meeting.",
                "Strengths: So many! The readings were fascinating and the balance between discussion of sources and actually practicing translation was perfect; discussions always felt lively and engaging and included a variety of voices; I'm really proud of what I ended up producing in the class and was extremely impressed by everyone else's translations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally the weekly assignments at the beginning (though helpful) felt overwhelming in light of the heavy reading",
                "All strengths, no weaknesses. Extremely engaging course that demands a lot of students but promises immense satisfaction to those who dive into the material and the work. Well-organized, well-structured, and well-taught.",
                "Professor Cole and Spencer are very involved and care deeply about your learning.",
                "The strengths of this course are innumerable. The most significant among them is Professor Cole. His extreme generosity of time and spirit and his emotional attachment to language and translation made the work we did feel not like an academic obligation, but a sacred one. He empowered us to make the choices we felt were best in our translations and then worked, meticulously, to help us succeed in fulfilling those choices. That combination of faith and investment meant a lot. Another significant strength of this course is the class, itself: a community of people who are all excited about the same thing, but going about it in many different ways and with many different languages and texts. Seeing my classmates engage with translation via our weekly workshops taught me as much about the process as our readings and as my own work. And I got the chance to read some incredible things from around the world.",
                "strengths - exposure to lots of exciting and thought-provoking ideas about translation and art, workshopping classmates pieces was super fun, translating your own work was super gratifying and prof and ta gave encouraging\/helpful feedback"

                "Yes, it is taught by an excellent professor and it is a really exciting field. Because it was an application-based class, everyone in the class was very committed, which greatly enhanced my learning experience. You should definitely apply to take it.",
                "Yes, 100%. This is one of those unmissable Yale classes. If you have a translation project in mind youll be supported every step of the way and youll come out of the class with a substantial body of work, Ill keep in contact with Prof. Cole, Spencer, and everyone else from the class for a long time to come. Long live translation!",
                "Definitely. I would argue that everyone, even non-literature\/english majors, should take this class. Translation is so much more about converting text from one language to another. It provides an essential opportunity for you to examine yourself as a writer, as a human being who lives constantly under the crushing weight of history, and how you reconcile with this weight to establish your own identity.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!!!! Particularly if you arent a comp lit major. \r\n \r\nI cannot say enough good things about this course. Its balanced, accessible, focused. Professor Cole is a gem, Spencer was a lovely and dedicated TA, and the other students were insightful and welcoming. The assignments, the atmosphere, the attitude  all exceeding expectations. \r\n\r\nThe readings were consistently hitting the mark as far as quality and concision. No rambling word soup from Professor Coles class. And we actually talked about them! Instead of pretending like they didnt exist when we got together for discussion! The homework exercises were tough, but also useful and I think necessary to deepen our understanding of what translation feels like. \r\n\r\nThere is constant opportunity for feedback and Professor Cole takes the time to give very detailed comments. Hes always available for a Zoom or a chat, even though hes got a zillion other things going on. \r\n\r\nAgain, could go on. This was my favorite class this semester and certainly ranks top five of all the classes Ive taken at Yale. Highly recommend, particularly if youre from an unrelated major and looking to get outside of your comfort zone.",
                "I could not recommend this course more highly; workload was very high, but I always found the readings quite enjoyable and much of the pressure to work so hard came from my own desire to take advantage of the opportunity to be in a classroom where I was getting frequent high-level feedback from peers, Spencer, and Professor Cole. This class was the best I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Absolutely! Both Professor Cole and Spencer were really involved and available to help students. I learned so much and worked really hard. May be one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Cole assembles a diverse assortment of students whose backgrounds spanned interests, languages, and perspectives. Our classroom grew to feel like a community, and the experience of learning, then applying, translation principles, is one that should not be missed in your time at Yale. One of the best courses I've ever taken, and a really, really enriching experience.",
                "Yes, I found a love for translation that I will carry with me my whole life.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. You will gain a fervor for language that will enliven your life, and you will do so with a group of uniquely talented people. The workload is relatively high, but everything is doable, and a lot of it won't really feel like work. My classmates and I all had varying amounts of experience with literature, language knowledge, and writing. If you're interested in taking the class but worried about your level of exposure to one of those things or something else, you should definitely reach out to Professor Cole (I did, and I'm very happy about it). Or just go ahead and apply... take the leap into the ever-shifting ocean of music and theory and emotion that is literary translation! As Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote, via Stephen Mitchell (or as Stephen Mitchell once wrote, via Rainer Maria Rilke, or as Mitchell and Rilke once wrote together, or as ...): \"here there is no place \/ that does not see you. You must change your life.\"",
                "yes - this course was not only a great way to explore translation in a welcoming environment, but was also really helpful in improving ones writing, editing, and critiquing skills. the class dynamic was fun and supportive and every workshop felt fresh and exciting - i always looked forward to coming to class"
