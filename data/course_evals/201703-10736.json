    "I learned basic graphics concepts. How to apply linear algebra to use OpenGL and draw nice curves. How to use 3D geometry to make cool things in a ray-traced scene. Plenty of theoretically interesting concepts like how light refracts and how eyes work, and also practical considerations like how to make collision detection fast. Useful if you want to make a computer program with good\/fast graphics, including games or just animations.",

    "Material is good, and I appreciate how the slides are posted for each class. Assignments are cool.\r\nIt needs to be moved to a later time, so students who can't wake up at 9 can still attend. Exams need to be shorter so they can be reasonably finished in time.",
    "9AM is rough.",
    "The problem sets were pretty difficult and it was hard to get help (since there was no TA for the class). Most of them were pretty interesting.\r\nClass teaching style could get a little dull sometimes since it was just powerpoint slides."
