                "Strength is Eva's teaching. She did a good job in making lectures clear and engaging, and in office hours always makes sure that everyone is understanding the material. The exams are also fair in terms of content. The weakness though, is the lecture econ class curve and also the TFs. All of the TFs were teaching differently (some doing more preparation material for exams while others went over mathematical theories) and the sections were really not engaging at all.",
                "There is the same Lagrangian method used over and over again, and not much focus on maybe gaining economic insight?",
                "This course was very easy and boring. We spent too much time doing the same things over and over again.",
                "Strengths  very clear lecture slides. great professor\r\nWeaknesses  the material is super hard and not relevant to most career paths. Wouldn't have taken if it wasn't a major requirement.",
                "I loved this course! Everything was perfect. No weaknesses at all!",
                "Strengths: this class was quite intuitive and all of the concepts and methods presented made sense. The concepts were quite grounded in reality and many real-world examples were used to demonstrate them.",
                "It is a great class because of the professor,however, just very boring and unnecessary material.",
                "Strengths: professor Chalioti is a good lecturer and clearly cares about her students. She communicated the concepts fairly clearly. Psets grades on effort which lessened the stress of having to complete the assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weakness of all lectures, but when things get confusing you cant really pause and ask whats going on.",
                "A strength would be the strong support from Professor Chalioti and the TFs as they offer many office hours. A weakness would be the theoretical nature of the materials could leave some wondering how to apply the concepts in the real world, where some given information are not easily obtained. However, many theoretical concepts are fascinating on their own.",
                "One incredibly bothersome and negative weakness was that the course was not recorded and that no past recordings existed for review. Especially during a pandemic, despite having had returned to in-person classes, it is of necessity and baseline consideration for large lectures to be recorded.",
                "strengths\r\n- straightforward content\r\n- sections that prepared you for the problem sets\r\n- no surprises on the exams\r\n- in-class review sessions\r\n- straightforward slides\r\n- pset solutions posted\r\n- practice material posted\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- it'd be great to get some practice tests to help prepare for the midterm and final",
                "The TFs are really helpful and I feel like the tests are really fair.",
                "Strengths: homework assignments help understand the material. \r\nWeaknesses: the course is terribly organized and offers almost no practical skills or knowledge. Most of the class consists of the professor solving long equations on the board, and the topics vary wildly.",
                "Structured curriculum is a big strength. Weakness is how boring the material is. Exams were too easy, making the terrible SD of the curve. Just two small stupid mistakes take your grade down by one letter grade.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Chalioti was a fantastic teacher! She took the complicated economic concepts and made them a lot simpler to understand, and threw in actual real-world connections to what we were learning. The course was also very well-organized and all the problem sets/exams were relatively straightforward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing too major! I think the one thing that could be improved is the opportunity for some math review sessions during the semester (maybe some algebra practice), but I don't think that's entirely necessary.",
                "The only weakness of this course were the annoying athletes and people that would talk over Eva in lecture. Give Eva all the resources she needs and this class is perfect. Maybe harder questions, looking at MIT and Stanford intermediate economics papers, I was not even able to solve many of their questions.",
                "Take this class with Eva she makes it much more engaging! Big strength was that she broke up the lecture with small, three minute breaks to discuss real world applications of the material. This were good moments to reset because you did not need to take notes.",
                "Professor Chalioti was reasonable and passionate about the course material",
                "I wish this course was taught in smaller sections rather than one large lecture. I also wish that problem sets were graded not for completion.",
                "I think discussion sections were extremely helpful and the office hours were key to helping answer any questions I had.",
                "Strengths: Eva really cares about the success of her students. She tried to make otherwise dry material interesting for non-econ majors.\r\nWeaknesses: The class is difficult -- the math is hard and the concepts are difficult.",
                "Strengths: Eva's blackboard problem-solving is super necessary in understanding how to do computations. I also felt so cared for in this course. Eva is so kind and invested in your personal development, and she really does her best as one professor in a sea of hundreds of students to make sure everyone understands. \r\nWeaknesses: Section problems often took too long, and as someone who had a section right after the one for this class, I'd often have to miss the tail end. Sometimes I got confused because what we did on the blackboard was minorly different than what the slies had, and I definitely preferred the active problem-solving on the blackboard. I did not like the fact that we didn't have practice exams for the midterm or final. It stressed me out a lot for the midterm, and I completed all the practice materials and psets again to compensate for my nerves.",

                "The course was very repetitive and slow-progressing at the beginning, but after the first midterm, it starting to move quite fast - we covered much more material on the second half of the semester than on the first half.",
                "Prof Chalioti was great, and sections were really helpful for learning how to apply the material from lecture to the problem sets. Problem sets were always reasonable and never took more than 5 hours. The midterm and final were probably a bit too easy  with the economics department curve, the difference between an A and A- becomes so minute that it can come down to silly mistakes, not actual differences in understanding.",
                "I felt there was some disconnect between the material covered in class and what was asked on the weekly problem sets. All of the problem sets were based of the application of the material, while much of the lectures were anecdotal studies and describing situations, which was interesting to learn about but not reflected on problem sets or exams. A strength of this course was the availability of Eva and the TFs and helpfulness in office hours, which really helped develop my understanding especially as I worked through the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: excellent and passionate professor and TFs, helpful office hours",
                "Strengths: very well-organized, structured course; abundance of practice and supplementary materials to help with concepts; midterm and final exams were very fair/straightforward (basically an easier version of problem sets); course content and material was interesting (although, largely a review of introductory microeconomics), and real-world applications with technology, innovation, and other ideas made it highly engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course would have benefitted from exploring a broader range of topics in microeconomics, aside from just the fundamentals; additionally, many of the lectures did not delve into as much theory or actual concepts and knowledge as one might have hoped (at times, it was just the same math problems reiterated over and over again).",
                "Oftentimes the concepts are explained very thoroughly in class, the math is explained through and through by Professor Chalioti, and though this can be a good thing, it can also get quite repetitive. She is an extremely organized professor and has a very step-by-step approach of doing things.",
                "in class lecture is kind of confusing.",
                "Strengths- Eva was awesome and probably the best econ lecture I've had so far. She was funny and understanding about the difficulty of some of the material but she always did her best to help us understand it. \r\n\r\nweakness- long lectures and tedious problem sets. But I suppose that's the only way to hold a large class like this.",
                "The course feels more akin to a math course than an econ course. The lectures include economic theory, but much of this knowledge has already been taught in the introductory course and is not tested at all in this course.",
                "Eva is a great professor, but the main weakness of this class is the material covered, it is just absurdly boring and unmotivated",
                "Strengths: the class was very fair. The concepts taught in class were very similar to the one on the homework and there were no surprises on the exams. \r\nWeaknesses: There was not a lot of new information compared to ECON 115, which made it a bit boring.",
                "Weaknesses: the material of the course is simply not all that engaging (essentially just applying the same mathematical tool to a variety of topics in economics). Strengths: Professor Chalioti is incredibly kind, cares about her students, and did her best to make lecture enjoyable which I really appreciated.",
                "This class is extremely well organized and designed to help students learn everything very effectively. Instructor is always so prepared for the lectures and helps students to the fullest. There is a lot of time like Prof or TA office hours where you can reinforce what was taught in the lecture.",
                "I really appreciated how fair I felt like the course was. There were so many office hours and chances to get help. The PSETs and discussion sections prepared you well for the test. The one thing I wished was different was that there were no course recordings. It was stressful to get sick and then have to catch up on lectures without the recording.",
                "Strengths are great teaching and preparation. Weaknesses are not enough practice tests for midterm and final.",
                "Strengths are the application of concepts to real world examples in both the lecture and in the podcast assignments, also the level of support that was available at all times. The course could offer more material in preparation for midterms such as providing examples of older midterms.",
                "Strengths: super well-taught, the lecture is engaging despite being very large, TFs and professor are very available in terms of answering questions and helping students outside of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the comments on our problem sets are little sparse - more feedback could be helpful.",
                "The course was excellent in every way possible!",
                "The lecture is very fast-paced but clear and systematic. The discussion section was even more rigorous but offered a good opportunity to practice what has been taught in previous lectures. Considering the large number of people in this course, I believe this is already the best arrangement.\r\nWeekly problem set is a plus. It makes sure that every student can have extensive and intensive practice for all the relevant topic covered in lectures.",
                "Strengths - Eva is amazing. Passionate, professional, and a great professor. Takes relatively boring material and tries to make it exciting. She is also very good about showing steps and walking through problems. The class is relatively low stress when it comes to PSETS, and the only grading is really from tests. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Your grade in the class is basically only one midterm and the final, so that's kind of stressful. It's very pedantic and minute material, so it can be a little hard to extrapolate to real world problems/ questions. No old exams/ practice exams/ psets to work from, so limited material.",
                "This course does a pretty good job with its lesson plan. I think there are definitely moments that could use some added explanation, but I think others could probably do a better job of explaining what they are. My main gripe: spend less time doing algebra on the board! We're college students--we know how to multiply both sides of an equation to cancel out a constant. There was a lot of time wasted on doing mundane calculations on the board.",
                "Strengths: Eva is an amazing lecturer, she teaches well and you can tell she understands what shes doing. Exams are fair and she makes sure we have a lot of practice material in addition to problem sets. Weaknesses: In terms of the course itself, nothing. But if you dont like math/calc this wont be the most fun class.",
                "The strengths of the course are mainly the organization/structure of the class and the fairness of the exams. All the course materials are easy to access and the lectures, problem set solutions, and other practice material all offer good explanations and helped me learn the material. Also, the midterm and final exams were very fair and there were no surprises, which offers the incentive that if you know and understand the material covered in lecture, discussion section, additional practice, and the problem sets, you will be fine on the exams. One weakness of the course is that the lectures were typically pretty dry, but that's because the content is very much about crunching the numbers to get different economic trends, so it's not incredibly exciting.",
                "I think that this course could try to focus on topics not covered in intro micro a little more - a fair bit of the course felt repretetive",
                "Well organized, good prof, too large",
                "Eva is a very good professor and explains concepts very thoroughly. A couple psets got a bit tedious in terms of long algebra/calc problems.",
                "the layouts of the lectures were all good, you had to be there to understand better",
                "Lectures good primer for later in depth learning in problem sets and discussion sections.",
                "Very organized and amazing course. Would prefer more theory",
                "The class was taught as well as it probably could be for a rather uninteresting subject. The class did feel a bit disjointed at time since there seemed to lack a standard notation for everything, which made studying and learning the material rather difficult.",
                "Very well taught!",
                "The course is math heavy and hence I loved it!",
                "The psets were very long",
                "I really liked the professor and the straight forward nature of it.",
                "Great for effort based psets",
                "The course was taught well and I found it very engaging. The exams were very fair and not too difficult but with the curve it made mistakes more significant than understanding in my opinion.",
                "lecture felt like it was too prolonged. the strong curve based on distribution, while probably necessary, strongly incentivized students to undermine others and a sense of lack of security prevailed throughout",
                "Strengths: content is very well-organized and there are lots of resources to make sure you understand the material. No weaknesses!",
                "There were so many strengths: the psets and plethora of practice materials provided thorough practice for all content covered and the content covered in lecture was well-reflected on the exam as well. Professor Chalioti kept emphasizing that there wouldn't be surprises, and there truly weren't. This is a very fair course, you get out what you put in and it is taught very well. Sometimes there were a lot of slides in lecture, so some other activities to break it up could have been nice, but otherwise it was fine.",
                "Really liked how efficient the classes were. However she went pretty quick through hard stuff and really slow through easy stuff",
                "Prof Evangelia is the best econ professor at Yale and makes the intro/intermediate prerequisite courses interesting",
                "Strength was practice material , weakness was lecture slides",
                "Strengths: It is a well-structured and approachable course. The course does not really introduce new concepts beyond intro micro. I wouldve loved to have learned new concepts or old concepts in more depth, but we really only did harder examples of stuff wed already did in intro micro.",
                "The course really is a repetition of intro micro with more math. At the beginning of the course, learning about maximization and decomposing income and substitution effects, the course really did feel like an enhancement of my understanding of the concepts.  As it went on, however, the course became more a repeat of intro micro with a couple of relatively simple additions. The monopoly, oligopoly, risk, and game theory sections were very similar to intro, with the additions of first movers, repeated games, and insurance (mathematically), not particularly involved concepts. In some cases, such as exchange economies (and with production), the math tended to outstrip the theory, and establishing the parameters of the markets were not clear (such as how to understand two people in a market who own two firms but everyone acts as a price taker and consumer/firm decisions operate completely independent of each other).",
                "I believe this class was taught very well. It was very fast-paced at times, but I understand that it was necessary for the amount of content covered.",
                "Strengths-fair exams \r\nWeakness-dull at times, lecture not very useful",
                "Strengths: organized structure and helpful TFs\r\nWeakness: sometimes I cant connect all the materials/ content together",
                "Strengths  my professor was INCREDIBLE! \r\nWeaknesses  Discussion times conflicted a lot with my practice times.",
                "Very well taught and organized.",
                "Strengths are professor, weaknesses are could have been more math preparation",
                "Recorded lectures and more availability of old exams/practice material for exam preparation would have been very helpful.",
                "Strengths ... Eva and all of the teaching fellows were always helpful in office hours and such! And Psets helped lead up to exams. Also the exams were super fair which I appreciated! There were never surprises or unnecessarily difficult questions. \r\nWeaknesses...sometimes the class lectures themselves felt like we jumped around from one class to the next. Or Eva would explain in detail one area or type of question, but skim over another section and explain it less in a way that felt less uniform. \r\nthis is neither strength nor weakness per se but its SUPER math heavy! I love math which made me like the course, but if you hate math...don't take this class! \r\nOverall it was a good class! Hard (especially pre midterm), but good!",
                "This class was very strong in its ability to teach material.",
                "There was plenty of help all around such as office hours and discussion sections. The lectures tended to focus on the math slightly too much as I saw the actual calculations as trivial and repetitive after the first month. Also, there was little incentive to succeed on the problem sets given that everyone seemed to receive a 10/10 regardless of effort. This caused the midterm and final to be extra stressful as they were your only opportunity to stand out. The grading and curving were extremely fair though which did help with this.",
                "I thought the course was very well taught and organized. Office hours were always readily available, and it was fairly easy to see the connections across topics.",
                "It was really good! Professor Chalioti was great as were the TFs",
                "This course felt like crunching a lot of math equations, with little insight into their real-world applications.",
                "Some times psets were very long.",
                "The course is very organized and office hours were very helpful, the slides were also very well-organized. The class time felt a bit too short sometimes",
                "The course was rather straightforward -- if you attend lectures, go to office hours and collaborate with your peers, you have a strong chance of demonstrating understanding on the exams. I liked the extra podcast activities and the real-life applications introduced during lectures. No weaknesses to note at this time.",
                "Loved Professor and TAs! I would make some of the discussion sections about interesting ideas not covered in class or research, that would be fun!",
                "Professor Chalioti ensured that the course was extremely well organized and standardized across all sections.",
                "Strengths: The units of the course were well-connected to each other. Each lecture began with an explanation of the topic's relevance/real-world application.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the problems on the homework were difficult to even approach. Sometimes during lecture or section, there was so much math that it was hard to remember/decipher the purpose behind solving for or plugging in certain values.",
                "The lectures can get long and repetitive. I also felt that discussion section wasn't amazing, and we spent a good amount of time on questions that were not  pertinent."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite course that I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yea probably if you need it to whack out prereqs for a major but it really wasn't that fun and definitely my least favorite class I took this semester",
                "No, only if you need it as a major requirement. Even then, maybe consider switching majors.",
                "Yes. Also if youre an Econ major, you have to take it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to those who need it for their majors. If someone wants to take higher-level economics courses, this class may offer a strong foundation.",
                "yes, it's an essential course for thinking about how we ought to balance the interests of consumers and firms with larger questions of equity",
                "Only if required",
                "I definitely would! It's a requirement for most majors (so you probably don't have much choice) but there is so much help available that the class really isn't that bad if you put the time and effort in. I highly recommend going to office hours and peer tutoring sessions, because that is where I was able to solidify my understanding of the concepts and figure out the minute details. The class generally has them every day of the week, so you should be able to find one that fits your schedule. Also, if you took AP Micro in high school and are considering placing out of Econ 115 (like I did), I would definitely recommend you do it since the class reviews most of the concepts briefly! The hardest part of the course is the math aspect (in my opinion), so I would recommend freshening up on derivatives and practicing algebra before taking it. Otherwise, definitely recommend!",
                "Yes, definitely. Course expectations are laid out extremely clearly and there is an overabundance of materials/solutions papers that greatly facilitate learning. Eva is definitely a strength as well.",
                "Definitely if it is required for your major, take it with this professor.",
                "I would only recommend this to an economics major",
                "Yes, you probably have to take this.",
                "Yes! You might be looking at this course if you need it for your major or if you've previously taken ECON 110/115. I would strongly recommend it! it gives some mathematical richness to what you've previously learned. That way, even if you get confused, you can always figure it out mathematically and get to the right place. Eva's also a huge plus, so take it with her if you can. The course is super well organized. Also, there are assigned textbook sections and I only read them when I was really conceptually confused, not regularly. The course is manageable in terms of workload (if you go to peer tutor office hours, you're set), and it's a gratifying one to finish. You just feel so accomplished. As I'm writing this, I wish I could experience this class again. It was so lovely.",
                "Only for the major",
                "I'd mostly recommend this only to Econ majors (well, you gotta do it anyway) because I don't see why you would want to go beyond Intro Microeconomics if you're not an Econ major. But, if you're not an Econ major and still want deeper insight into microeconomic theories with more math, by all means go for it.",
                "I would recommend this course to people interested in economics, as it is a good transition to some higher level and more challenging concepts.",
                "If you're looking at this course, you probably have to take it. But yes.",
                "Definitely recommend this course to all econ majors (even though it's a requirement of the major), so anyone interested in developing a background in microeconomics, specifically.",
                "Yes, it covers a lot of useful economics territory and can be a very enjoyable class if you keep yourself engaged. Go to office hours",
                "Yes! Highly manageable workload, straightforward and fair exams, and overall, engaging material and content. Professor and TFs are all very kind, and the course is very well-structured for student learning and success.",
                "This is a prerequisite -- if you've taken ECON 115 before, the content and ideas are the same, just now done with calculus and mathematics -- it's not super engaging, but you can tell that Professor Chalioti cares about her students and genuinely cares about the material.",
                "If you're taking this class it's probably because you have to. Which is fair, it is hard but as long as you understand math you will be fine.",
                "If you are majoring in econ or really interested in economics on the level of firms then yes. If not then maybe find a different lecture that is more engaging.",
                "Would only recommend this course if it is required for your major.",
                "Only if econ major, Eva is a good professor and I enjoyed her teaching. The material, however, is just so soul crushing that it's hard to recommend this course to anyone. I learned very little beyond applying calculus to the models already covered in intro micro",
                "You can jump right into this class without ECON 115. Overall its a well taught and very fair class.",
                "Assuming that it's necessary for your major I think it's a perfectly fine way of completing such a requirement. If you're looking to get a better understanding of economics, I think there are probably better ways of doing so.",
                "Absolutely - very useful for Econ majors, especially those who don't necessarily feel prepared mathematically for Microeconomic Theory.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to students in economics (required) but also to those students interested in the mathematical component of econ. There is a lot of Lagrange calculations and technical calculations but if you enjoy the math aspect, it will be an engaging and fun class to take.",
                "If you can take it with Professor Chalioti, yes! The class is a requirement for many majors and can seem formidable at first, but Professor Chalioti makes the content understandable and attainable. I honestly learned a lot and felt like she gave many real-world applications outside of mathematics.",
                "Yes, required for economics major but also great in depth learning.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in economics or looking to major in economics. It is a great course to delve deeper into microeconomics and decide whether economics is something he/she wants to pursue further.",

                "Yes, if you like math. Lots of math.",

                "Yes, it's hard, but it's not impossible. I had no math background and managed to survive, so it's not the end of the world. Biggest pro tip, literally just go to Eva's office hours. You will get EVERYTHING you need. \r\n\r\nI took this class for EP&E. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have taken it. And while I'm not crazy about the material, and it was a lot of stress, at the end of the day I did enjoy my time and the professor, and feel like I did a job well done and feel personally fulfilled by the course, regardless of my grade.",
                "Yes. As long as they have some basic comfort with calculus, they will understand what is going on.",
                "Yes, especially if its with Eva Chalioti! For a core course like this, I think a good professor who is engaging in lecture makes all the difference. For econ majors this is required so if you have the choice, take it with her. If you dont like math/calc though, this wont be extremely fun. The content spread was similar to my Intro Micro course, but more in depth with pretty much only calculus",
                "I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in Econ",
                "I would probably recommend this course only if it's required for a major. The class is mainly applying more complicated math to some of the concepts covered in the intro micro class.",
                "Yes, but it is fairly difficult material - make sure you are up to the challange",
                "Yes, but if interested in Econ",
                "Yes--its a very interesting class, and Eva is great.",
                "if youre an econ major its required, if you arent i wouldnt take it",

                "Yes. Even if you arent an ECON major, but good at math, do take it.",
                "Yes! I think the assessments reflect what we've learned in class.",
                "yes learned a lot",
                "I would only recommend if previous economics courses were taken",
                "Yes, especially if you need it for your major, but it is also a very interesting way of applying math to real world scenarios.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are an econ-related major. I thought it was much better taught and more interesting than ECON 115. Everyone says this class is the worst class in the econ major, and that is what I heard to coming into the class, but it really isn't that bad.  Just have a study group.",
                "Yes if youre interested in Econ. No if you dont like Econ.",
                "Yes, great course and great professor",
                "If youve taken intro micro and understood it well, you probably wont learn much more in this course. However, if you havent taken intro micro, this class would be worth taking.",
                "I would recommend to someone who needs it for a requirement. That is not to say it is a bad course. I liked the material covered and the income/substitution decomposition was very interesting. If you want to go further into microeconomics, take it. However, if the course does not fulfill any kind of requirement for you, I think it is not so much an improvement over the intro micro course that I would recommend taking it for the interest alone.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you can take basic derivatives (numerical exponents, ln, product/quotient rule, and 1-step chain rule with those things) you will be absolutely fine. If you understand the basic theory behind derivation, you'll be even better. The first couple weeks of the class teaches some basic matrices rules, which I did not know (I had never worked with them before) but they teach you what you need and after about 2-3 weeks, they pretty much go away and the rest of the class is the above stuff. Everything will be easier if you understand how derivation relates to functions (such as the mathematical meaning of concave up/down) and how that relates to consumer/firm preferences.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend ECON 121 to another student. Professor Chalioti truly is an amazing professor who cares about her students, and she presents the content in a way that is conducive to learning. Plenty of practice materials are provided, and the TF's are also very quick to answer questions on the Ed Discussion forum.",
                "Take it if its required. If not, no",
                "Yes, very good professor and very organized class. More fun to learn microeconomic.",
                "Yes  I loved my professor and would recommend that anyone take her classes.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it is a prerequisite and the professor is so sweet and so helpful.",
                "Yes -- if interested in Econ and like math! I took this class cause I was going to be a Global Affairs major, and I like math! This class is SUPER math heavy so if you're down for some math and you like econ, take it! But if you don't like math / have no reason to take this class, it's a lot of work and math.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as it gives a more logical understanding of microeconomics.",
                "There is a lot to learn in this course, however there is little incentive to actual focus and pay attention. If you are interested or need it, you should take the class, if not you are likely to lose focus and not get a lot out of it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody trying to build more on the econ knowledge learned in intro micro. Even for people who many not enjoy calculations very much, the course was definitely organized to help students really understand all steps of solving problems.",
                "Its a requirement for my major but Id recommend it to anyone whos more interested in learning about microeconomics more in depth!",
                "Only take this course if it is required. If anything, taking it may decrease your interest in economics.",

                "Yes I would recommend this to anyone interested in microeconomics, especially if Eva is teaching",
                "It's a fine class to take but I wouldn't strongly recommend it unless you need it for your major's requirements.",
                "I would! However, I would say if you are not majoring in economics, you may prefer a class that is more real life focused. This is largely theoretical (also Professor does bring in real life concepts!)",
                "You probably have to take this as an econ major. No other reason to take it --  even though Professor Chalioti does as good of a job as possible making the content engaging.",
                "Only if it is a major requirement",
                "If you need to take it for your major, say Econ or or EP&E, it clearly has a point. I don't think its worthless or anything, understanding the calculus behind some economic theory is important. If you don't need it for a major or you aren't taking it as a prerequisite for a cooler class, then find a better class among your limited classes at Yale."
