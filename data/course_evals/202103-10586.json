                "How to think about biological systems and gained an intuition on modeling them. Learned a lot of different modeling techniques to apply to biochemical networks (in particular, protein binding and cooperativity), gene networks, and enzymatic systems.",
                "We learned about the dynamics of simple biological systems like ligand binding to receptor, gene expression under the control of positive or negative feedback (or feedforward), an introduction to stochasticity and noise in gene expression, and the dynamics of enzymatic activity and substrate cycles. The big themes were how to distill systems to simple mathematical models, how to analyze a system's steady-state behavior, and how decisions can be made at the cellular or molecular level.\r\n\r\nI gained a basic level of competence in MATLAB, but I'm not sure how applicable it would be to other areas. For the most part the coding was very simple (plotting based on equations we derived on paper, or having the program numerically integrate an ODE for us).",
                "I gained a good understanding of how to model basic biological processes.",
                "I have learned a lot from the course. From the very start where I could barely recall all the numerical concepts and equations or graphs I once learned about in my previous biochem courses to the end where I can match different equations or approximations to the right context. I also learned a lot about Matlab. Although I cannot say I am an expert now, considering that I have started from scratch, I still think the course is inspiring as a programming start. It is also impressive to learn about the application beyond the simple equations, such as the decision making circuits and synthetic biology and toggle switch and stem cell.",
                "I acquired a deep understanding of the biological mechanisms that are present in living organisms, as well as the clear methodology of reducing complicated circuits and systems into sets of equations that can easily be analyzed. Thus, not only did my understanding of molecular biology greatly increase, but in addition I learned how to apply the tools from mathematics and physics to the study.  I also learned how to code in Matlab as a means of analyzing these systems of equations and patterns in molecular biology.",
                "I learned about how biological systems create ON/OFF switches, basic MATLAB coding, and how to derive mathematical equations based on biological processes."

                "Strengths: I thought the material was rigorous and taught well. The TAs were very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the problem at least in my class was that the majority of students were very very experienced in the subjects already and the material came very easy while for a minority of us less experienced students it was a constant struggle. And because of this I think the TAs assumed that everyone always got the material. I also think there should be a gen chem prereq. I've taken up to orgo so I was fine but I'd imagine you'd be lost without gen chem knowledge.",
                "I thought the mix of assignment types (quick in-class exercises, quick out-of-class exercises, and more involved problem sets) was useful. The paper presentations were also interesting for seeing how the topics we discuss at a basic level can be extended to more sophisticated systems or backed up by empirical data.\r\n\r\nI did feel like the topic selection was a little repetitive (how can this type of system generate a switchlike response, what happens when we incorporate feedback, etc.). Then again, I think that did reinforce how we can translate very different biological processes into remarkably similar mathematical models. Another weakness I felt was that occasionally the assumptions we were supposed to make on problem sets weren't very clear, and there was really no way to know without asking a TA about it.",
                "The class was taught poorly. The professors went way too quickly. MATLAB was barely covered.",
                "It needs to be much better organized with assigned readings every week.",
                "The original notes from the instructors were really helpful. There could be more insights for the papers from the teachers as well. \r\n\r\nThere could be more matlab coaching and additional resources. The homework answers could include some rationales.",
                "I really enjoyed this course because it was always engaging and explored new ideas every class while always building up the ideas from the previous classes. I appreciated the in-class discussions and coding sessions because they not only allowed us to explore the concepts covered in lecture, but also allowed us to talk with each other, which is an experience I did not have last year due to Covid.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of weaknesses at the present time.",
                "The course focused a great deal about how to go from some kind of biological process to equations and graphs, which is extremely helpful for interpreting and understanding biology research. I thought it was lacking in the instruction of MATLAB and could have benefitted from teaching the program in greater depth."

                "Maybe. If you're really interested in biochemistry and have a mind for quantitative reasoning, then I think you'd really enjoy this class! If you didn't like biochem or don't have a knack for math, you may struggle in this course. I was part of the latter group, but I still feel like I learned a lot even though it probably won't be really applicable to my field of study.",
                "I'd recommend it if you're looking for a pretty relaxed introduction to modeling. From a biological perspective, it's sort of interesting but won't teach you much that you don't already know. However, the quantitative approach is certainly not emphasized in most other classes, so that will probably be new to you. If you have any modeling experience, the second semester might be more appropriate.",
                "I would not. This class was incredibly boring, and the professors were not very clear when explaining concepts.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. Very insightful as a quantitative approach to view biological problems. The material was not that hard. Teachers and TAs are approachable.",
                "I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested STEM, whether they are interested in biology, chemistry, physics, or mathematics. This class pulls on information and tools from all these general disciplines, and teaches the students to combine them in cool ways to understand how life works. Initially it may seem daunting, but the course is straightforward, and it is possible to quickly get up to speed with the information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in my experience, there was a lot of camaraderie in the class, and we had weekly, self-organized, problem-set solving sessions which were really nice because we had fun working on the questions together. :)",
                "This course is a great followup to MATH116, but I would strongly recommend against taking it unless you have a strong interest in math and how it relates to biology."
