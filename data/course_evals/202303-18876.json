            "comments": [
                "A weakness is that Phys 170 and 180 are combined, making it so students come to lab with varying levels of knowledge of the topics. The timed pre-class quizzes sometimes led to unnecessary  pressure. Due to the nature of the labs and the type of analysis done, I felt that I learned more about LoggerPro than topics in physics. \r\n\r\nA strength is that the lab allows you to understand that equations can only take you so far and we must account for being in an environment that is not isolated.",
                "The lab practical was unfair. It combines ideas we worked on all semester without us having adequate practice putting these ideas together.",
                "Strengths: none\r\nWeaknesses: Physics is one of if not the most interesting STEM subject for a broader audience. Somehow, this course manages to reduce some of the coolest topics in physics to computer-generated data and squash curiosity. The vibes in the class are also really bad, which seems to be a product of people's boredom during the lab session. The fact that basically your entire grade is determined by the final practical exam (which included many questions for which we are not well prepared) also created a stress-inducing as opposed to a curiosity-inducing course.",
                "its fine. grading is easy. labs are mostly easy. it just kind of sucks because it's 3 hours long and quite boring.",
                "How it could be improved: optional videos to explain some of the actual physics behind the labs to help us prep for the practical, as most people in the class are in physics 170 or haven't gotten to that part of 180 yet.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Lab reports only being one page forced me to summarize what I'd learned in a clear and concise manner, which was both satisfying and edifying. \r\n- Most labs were structured well and I felt like I understood what I was supposed to be learning\r\n- Quizzes before each lab helped me understand the main concepts of physics\r\n- Rotating lab partners each week forced me to work with new people each time, so I was able to meet more people in the class, which was nice. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Some of the labs, such as the 2nd one on error calculation, were a bit confusing and seemed pointless.",
                "The course lacks a clear rubric so you are operating based on previous feedback but that is not helpful for the first couple assignments so the class is a leap of faith that is not well designed. However, the class is well-spaced and they do a good job of introducing concepts and guiding you through the labs.",
                "One strength of this course is the well organized schedule and well-prepared lab procedures. It is clear that it has been continuously improved over time. Honestly I think that the lab reports should be more academic, the one page reflection and notebook is fine, but this class could be a good opportunity to teach students how to format a proper lab report, introducing them to data analysis software such as OriginPro or even just Excel.",
                "Strengths: handouts are incredibly thorough, labs build on each other, good support from TAs, enriched class concepts\r\nWeaknesses: seems like lab practical is devised to flatten out the distribution of grades, practical was more about assessing mental toughness than applying physics",
                "I think the biggest weakness of this course is the Lab Practical. I felt great about this lab as I was able to understand the concepts and how they applied to my physics lecture -- which was not something I experienced before with previous pre-med labs -- but the lab practical was extremely difficult. Although I understood concepts throughout the semester, having questions in the lab practical about stuff we had never done before, or been prepared for, was discouraging. I think having the class be simply based on lab reports like many other labs, or the lab practicals being based on previous labs with a few things changed would be great.",
                "Lots of conceptual stuff. Lab reports were stressful.",
                "Strengths: TA was very supportive and kind in class. I think there was more than enough material online to support each laboratory.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For someone taking PHYS170, it's a bit disheartening to take a physics lab that is so unrelated to what we are learning. It does not support the lecture learning environment at all.",
                "the class didn't teach me anything. It just created an environment where everyone had to rely on the TF to complete work.",
                "The course was overall taught and explained quite well, especially considering it does not align with physics170 but with 180, however the gyroscopes lab was still quite difficult, and the different vector quantities could be better explained so that rotational motions are better understood.",
                "Strengths - The lab reports were generally fair and not too tedious. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The actual labs were pretty monotonous and tedious. They were not very engaging and often lasted a long time. Some labs were unnecessarily long or arduous.",
                "the course is structured very well and not too difficult. the lpe (final lab practical exam) is a little hard to prepare for, but it's helpful that it's open notes",
                "I felt like a lot of the course was throwing new information at us in lengthy manuals and expecting us to grasp it very quickly in order to perform well, especially since we do not learn much of the content of the lab in Physics170. It was also extremely disappointing to have worked so hard the entire semester and have a near perfect grade average only to do poorly on the lab practical (due to a variety of reasons- not only being burnt out but also having technical difficulties and feeling rushed) and have it tank my grade",
                "I believe some of the labs were more helpful than others. TAs and teaching instuctors were always around to help us and answer any questions! I also appreciated the 2 practice lab practical exams that we had.",
                "The strength was the workload as it was perfect for the amount of credits. Not too overwhelming. However, a weakness is the Lab Examination as it puts unnecessary pressure near finals week. I think increasing the value of the quizzes would allow for more labs and less stress.",
                "Strengths: Chill environment. Very well organized. Feels the most like a 0.5 credit class out of all the lab classes I've taken so far. You come in for lab, do your work, and then write a report. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lab is poorly synchronized with the lecture, which makes it difficult to comprehend the scientific basis of the lab. This makes it difficult to write the report.",
                "Strengths: lab reports are pretty reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: have to take a final exam, a lot of the labs are computer-based which I found boring",
                "Strengths: learned a lot about the basic principles of physics experimentation with many themes of studying uncertainty, determining bias, why experiments are designed in certain ways\r\nWeaknesses: at least two of the labs had us learn concepts that were not taught in the corresponding PHYS 170 nor 180, making them feel unnecessarily complicated -- particularly the gyroscope lab.",
                "The labs are well structured and the informal lab reports make it much less stressful than other labs. Still, some labs are much more difficult and will end up taking more time out of your schedule than planned. The final exam can also be quite stressful and unpredictable!",
                "The LPE is worth a lot and seems unnecessary, the test went beyond what we had been practicing in Lab. The prelab quiz and write up are easy to complete.",
                "Strengths: Lab handouts tell you everything you need to know for that week's lab. TA's are helpful to answer questions and assigning lab partners to help navigate the lab steps was very helpful. Helpful feedback on lab reports. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too involved for an intro physics. I don't know for PHYS 170, but this lab didn't follow the curriculum in the same order as was presented in PHYS 180. This made it confusing, as we'd have to perform experiments on topics we had not learned yet in lecture. Making this lab course more synchronous with the lecture would ensure a smoother learning experience.",
                "Strengths: Our TA was fabulousshe was so helpful and kind! The physics lab instructors were also clearly passionate about the lab. Weaknesses: the torque lab was so difficult and exhausting. We didn't learn any of the material relevant for the lab in physics lecture, so the expectations felt completely out of touch with what we actually knew. Also, the LPE is unnecessarily stressful.",
                "Strengths: I think that the lab handouts were very detailed in explaining the concepts and procedures and helped with my understanding of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't really like the one page summaries that we would have to do with each lab notebook since it felt like I was mostly just repeating what I had said in my lab notebook and got docked random points on it since it wasn't very well-explained what had to be included in the write-up. I would have rather just had to answer some conceptual questions like other lab courses do.",
                "Grading of lab reports by only your TA is unfair, as different TAs grade incredibly differently. Grading of lab reports should be standardized (i.e., every TA is given the same rubric), or lab reports should be randomly graded by different TAs.",
                "Strengths: TFs, preceptor and professors, lab notes. Weaknesses: lack of preparation for Lab Practical Exam",
                "Strengths: my TF was great! He was there to support us and very responsive\r\nWeakness: There was not much overlap with what was learned in PHYS 170 which made it difficult to learn these new concepts and apply them well to labs",
                "The course is well-structured and easy to follow. Labs are usually straightforward, and the TF is always available to help if necessary.",
                "I don't know if the skills we practiced will be useful in physics, but as a biophysics and biochem major I just can't see myself ever doing anything related to those activities ever again. Either change the class or stop requiring biology majors to take it.",
                "Strengths included the way that the labs built upon one another in terms of lab techniques and physics concepts. What could be improved includes a final lab report instead of a final lab practical exam. This is because the lab does not take into consideration the fact that there are students taking different physics lecture courses and not all of them have learned the same concepts.",
                "The inclusion of the lab practical in this course significantly detracts from the overall learning experience. It is my belief that this component should be reconsidered and potentially removed. Throughout the semester, we collaborate with partners during lab sessions, fostering a collaborative learning environment. However, the transition to a solo, high-stakes, timed assessment creates unnecessary stress and unfair conditions for students.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lab practical constitutes 25 percent of the overall grade only amplifies the pressure on students. Even for those well-acquainted with the material, the stressful nature of the timed assessment poses challenges that can hinder performance. The elevated stakes in this format do not align with the collaborative and supportive atmosphere that characterizes the rest of the course.\r\n\r\nIn light of these concerns, I am compelled to explore alternative options, such as switching to MB&B 121L lab, which appears to offer a more enjoyable and conducive learning experience. I believe that a reassessment of the lab practical component would contribute positively to the overall quality of the course and alleviate undue stress on students.",
                "I loved the structure of this course! The only thing I would change was the topics on the practical. It felt like the first problem on the practical exam was combined topics of what weve done but never done entirely like that. This made it so hard to figure out and took up a lot of time.",
                "Strengths: The course had a good workload and was very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lab practical was difficult. Even though we had two practice rounds, the actual one felt harder than both practices. It would be better if the actual practical is the same skill level as the practice.",
                "The weakness is the lab practical because I studied and thought I was ready based on the previous lab practical practice rounds but the actual one was a lot harder and I ran out of time.",
                "Strengths - reasonably low workload, teach concepts hands on",
                "It was well paced",
                "The class was pretty easy, but the lab report mark schemes were occasionally a little silly. Otherwise, it was a low effort class that I only thought about every Tuesday. It may have been easier because I took 200/201 the year before.",
                "It was well-structured with about the same amount of work every week, which is very reasonable for a lab. The entire team is lovely and wants to help you succeed, which is great. A weakness would be the gyroscope lab, which was just confusing for everyone and uncharacteristically chaotic. In general, lab reports were graded quickly, which was helpful.",
                "Most people take this course as a requirement and they make it nice for you so you dont have to write a lab report every week. Not my favorite class but could be much worse",
                "horrible class with horrible lab practical",
                "The failure of this course to stay relevant to the current topics in lectures made students feel as though they were taking two separate credits. If students were taking physics in the life sciences, they should be taking a laboratory course that aligns adequately. The practical exam aspect of the course is unfair to students as it does not test material that students would be familiar with, and does not reflect one's overall performance at all in the course. the rubrics being unavailable to students made each grading of our assignments spontaneous and guaranteed; what someone could get marks off for in one assignment would not get them marks off in another.",
                "The main strength of the course was my TA. She was knowledgeable and to the point. The lab professors also clearly loved what they were doing, and they made the lab days more entertaining. No real weaknesses. It's just a basic physics lab, so not particularly engaging. The lab reports were fair, but some of the grading can be finicky.",
                "Strengths: lab reports were straightforward and easy, thankfully.\r\nWeakness: 1) I do not feel like I was prepared appropriately for the LPE despite going to office hours + speaking with professor + looking at my past LPEs. I am not sure how I could have improved in this regard. It would be helpful to have a list of things too . It would also help to either a) be able to take the answer key home or b) have structured time with a TF/professor after the LPEs to understand what just happened! Because it was not clear to me at all. 2) Labs G and H were very difficult to follow, even with my reviewing them extensively before lab. Lab H can be improved by simply having more time ahead of the lab to review how to make those force diagrams. All students should get an email the week of each lab about reminders for each lab and tips and tricks, since not all TFs teach the same and it would be nice to have standardized communication throughout the week.",
                "The TAs were great! The lab reports felt quite manageable. Sometimes the lab handouts were confusing to follow, and the lab practical exam was incredibly stressful which I think defeated the purpose of it.",
                "This lab is so tedious and did not really teach much of value.",
                "The concepts from this lab were mainly from Physics 180 and I am taking Physics 170 so there were concepts that were difficult to understand in just a 4 hour lab, and I don't think that should have been tested. The fact that Physics 170 students don't learn about torque in depth puts us at a disadvantage, and this made the class stressful. The practical exam was extremely hard for that reason and I think we could have been better prepared by a comprehensive review of all the topics we learned over the semester.",
                "Pre-lab setup is solid, labs are well designed and challenging in a good way. One issue is equity across sections- for example if your TF is more detailed or not.",
                "I believe that myself and a lot of other people thought that some of the labs were too long. Even when working quickly, there were times where people struggled to finish within 3 hours. That being said, most of the material was very interesting, and as someone who finds many concepts in physics to be fascinating, I enjoyed relating lab content to the topics covered in my physics class (PHYS 180).",
                "The lab summaries and quizzes were all fair. However, for the amount of time and effort that they took and how that was the biggest chunk of the course, it was not fair that the final lab practical exam had a bigger weight in regards to grade and could completely change your grade if you didn't do that well on it.",
                "The strengths were the post-lab assignments. It could be improved if the content of the labs was in line with what we learned in lecture.",
                "Strength: the TFs! They were very helpful, especially when the labs were confusing\r\nWeakness: the LPEs. A complete waste of time and will literally drag your grade down even if you had an A the entire semester. Also, the quizzes werent that great.",
                "the final practical lab exam should be removed. It was stress inducing and frustrating being tested by ourselves at the end of the year when all the experiments we did together every week, but were expected to complete the practical alone. Also, in the case of many of my peers and I, we had 95% the entire year and because of the practical our grades were bumped down since the class isn't curved it brought us down by 1-2 letter grades which is unfair and does not represent the work of the entire semester that we put in.",
                "Strengths: Organization; to prepare for the lab, we had to read the weekly lab handouts and take quizzes beforehand, which were relatively easy. The lab reports are one page only. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab handouts contained a surplus of information that highlighted how labs were conducted in the past, etc. and I found that to be completely unnecessary. In addition, the equations presented in the lab handouts were sometimes difficult to follow and the instructions regarding LoggerPro were not always specific enough, meaning that much of the lab was sometimes spent on troubleshooting the software and not the content of the physics lab itself. Oftentimes, I'd leave the lab feeling like I still had no idea what the point of the steps in the lab handout was about.",
                "The course would improve if it were more aligned to enhance what we learn in physics class. It would also improve if less emphasis were placed on the final exam. I liked how the TAs were down to earth and relaxed, while still holding the students accountable. it is definitely the best lab course Ive taken at Yale so far.",
                "Strengths: none, because the class was pointless. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the entire course. It was entirely too much work, I genuinely did not understand a single thing that was happening in the class, and the lab practical was HEINOUS.",
                "My weakness was calculating the mathmatical components of the lab; having a limited background of the topic before, it was difficult to understand some mathematical concepts. My strength was working with others and forming logical conclusions within the experiment.",
                "The LPE --and labs in general-- could have more very specific instructions. If there is any room for guessing then a simple assignment becomes needlessly complicated.",
                "The final lab practical was a bit harder than I expected. There are no other weaknesses.",
                "This course was very well organized. It nicely complemented the content in the PHYS 180 course, and the lab handouts were very thorough to facilitate student learning. The students also receive helpful feedback on each lab report. I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "This lab course was so stupid. The only redeeming quality was my TF. I didnt even do bad in the course, I just think its kinda a (complete?) waste of time",
                "I thought this was a good lab class! The head professor and the TFs are all great. I think it could be helpful if there were office hours to ask questions and help clarify concepts on some of the more complex labs.",
                "This course runs ahead of Physics 180 which made explaining the labs in lab reports very hard. As someone with no background, I could not explain what I was seeing at all and concepts were always completely new to me upon doing the lab. This lab could be improved by aligning more with Phys 180.",
                "Strengths: Lab reports follow each experiment and offer students the opportunity to reflect on the procedure, evaluating potential sources of systematic error that are supported by the results obtained, and challenges students to apply material to their own experiences. For the most part experiments were manageable in length, and instructions (provided in handouts and by TFs) adequately explained the procedure. Additionally, practice exams for the lab practical exam were really helpful. (I think this was a new addition to the course). I feel the best (and really the only effective) way, apart from active engagement in the course throughout the semester, is to prepare for these exams by practicing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Concepts dont always line up with what students are learning in the their physics lecture course (especially for PHYS 170 students  students hadnt touched on rotational motion when this concept was demonstrated in lab), and sometimes these concepts couldnt be adequately understood (within a reasonable amount of time) from the resources provided by the lab course. I also would have appreciated shorter experiments that offer students more opportunities to make decisions about design and procedure (perhaps providing students with questions and allowing them to mess around with the procedure to appropriately address the question).",
                "My TA was very helpful and nice. However, the main weakness was the lack of practical exam given that I do not think it fairly tests learning.",
                "Strengths: labs are fairly easy and don't require too much preparation. Post lab assignments require minimal work\r\nWeaknesses: labs were sometimes unnecessarily long and wasted a lot of time",
                "There are no real problems with this course except for the final exam. The entire semester is ok, but the LPE at the end is incredibly stressful. It doesn't really make any sense as an assessment as it's not at all like how you do labs for the entire semester - what's the point of not being able to perform labs where you can work together and ask questions? Is that not what you do in real science? \r\n\r\nRegardless, it ends up coming down almost to how well you can use logger pro and find uncertainties, which I don't think is a fair assessment of our learning. No other lab course has an ending assessment like this, so why does this one need it? I was more nervous for the LPE than for any other final exam. It needs to be adjusted to gotten rid of.",
                "The labs themselves aren't super connected to what we're learning in class, and it wasn't always clear what we were supposed to be learning from them.",
                "Strengths: a reasonable amount of work assigned\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Lab Practical Exam at the end had an very substantial negative impact on my grade and I think it's because I didn't have a good grasp on a few topics that we went over in lab. Maybe those  few topics (e.g., torque) could be covered a bit more in lab (e.g., having more labs on them).",
                "Weakness - The lab practical that was worth 25% of our grade and tested us on the later material of the class that was more difficult. The structure of the lab reports (an unnecessarily detailed lab notebook and a one page addendum). Ones grade on the lab report really depended on ones TA; I saw my friends putting in less work, less detail, and similar answers yet they received better grades.\r\n\r\nStrengths - The lab is only 3 hours, which is an improvement from 4 hour chemistry labs.",
                "Strengths: thorough lab packets, straightforward quizzes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistencies in grading across sections, very difficult Lab Practical Exam, limited interactions with course staff, no office hours, time-consuming lab notebook and report",
                "Weaknesses: If you are coming in with the expectation to learn physics, you will be disappointed. This class is filled with premed students who care much more about their grade than what they learn from the labs, and its not even their fault because the class seems designed to facilitate this. Points are rewarded less so for demonstrating an understanding of physics and more so for an ability to follow directions like writing your name and pointlessly clicking buttons on a video on LoggerPro. Grading differs wildly from TA to TA, with some being especially lenient and others adhering to the rubric to a fault. Pray you get a good TA, but remember to feel sorry for them as well. Ive independently heard stories from multiple physics grad students describing TAing this class as the worst experience of their graduate career. \r\nStrengths: you will form camaraderie with everyone over not wanting to be in the class and trying to leave as soon as possible."

                "Yes, it's a very good, chill lab, where you get comfortable with doing a lab.",
                "This is a good lab course. It is not too much work when it comes to a lab. It is a little weird because the rubric is hidden so you have to hope you are doing stuff right until you get feedback.",
                "Yes. If for nothing else than gaining a familiarity with uncertainty analysis. Even if you don't plan to do physics, but want to do other lab work, this familiarity is incredibly helpful.",
                "Yes, just do some meditations before and after the practical",
                "For a requirement, PHYS 165L is a fine laboratory class. It actually meets the 0.5 credit mark unlike many other intro STEM labs.",
                "no. unless it's required.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they are Pre-Med or need it for a requirement.",
                "it's a requirement for most",
                "Honestly no, not unless they really love physics and already have some experience with the content. Having had little prior experience, a lot of topics felt new since we didn't learn them in lecture, so I was constantly trying to keep up. The lab videos were far too many in quantity to be helpful for preparation, and I spent a lot of time on the reports because it was always unclear what the expectation was since there was not really a rubric to follow. Additionally, the labs were always too long for the allotted time so we were often rushing to finish within the time period which made lab generally stressful",
                "I would! I think it is a good addition to take along with the introductory physics class. Probably less so though if you are taking PHYS 170.",
                "Yes I would!",
                "Yes. If you need a physics lab, it's a relatively painless option that will not give you many headaches or stresses.",
                "no",
                "Yes, it was interesting. If you like physics, or think you might, take the lab. There are a number of novel and cool experiments you do in the lab that you may enjoy.",

That being said, I had taken physics the year before and had finished learning all the content necessary for succeeding in labs, but some of my peers in 170/171 struggled with some labs since they hadn't covered the material yet in their class.",
                "Yes, the class is very straightforward!",
                "Yes, it does not have a high workload and is relatively interesting.",
                "Only take this course if you need it for your major or for a pre-med requirement.",
                "No. Take MB&B 121L and 124L instead!",

                "No, as nothing particular about this class is advantageous for students enrolled in physics for the life sciences or general physics. This mostly lies in the instability of the rubrics and the practical exam.",
                "I wouldn't go out of my way to take this class. It's a fair lab course, but I can't imagine taking this if you're not a STEM major or pre-med/considering pre-med.",
                "If you need it",
                "Yes! Definitely a good lab to take.",
                "No, but if you're considering this course, you probably have to take it. The workload is very low, and the expectations are clear, but the lack of intellectual challenge was soul-crushing. No one in the room wants to be there.",

                "I would recommend it if they are already familiar with complex physics principles. I took 170 at the same time as this lab and much of the content did not overlap which made the lab hard for me.",
                "No, unless you have to.",
                "if you are not engineering and taking this lab as a premed there are other more fair and less stressful physics labs you can take.",

                "NO! My 1.5 credit language course that meets everyday was MUCH less work than this worthless class. I learned no tangible skills from the class, spent half the semester wondering when my stuff was going to be graded, and genuinely felt clueless the entire lab. You have to take the class? Welp, sorry. You've got to endure it. THIS IS A 0.5 CREDIT CLASS! START ACTING LIKE IT! It is absolutely ridiculous that I am spending as many hours as I am in a class that doesn't matter and is literally half the number of credits as my other classes. I spent hours on the assignments, and I quite literally could not tell you a single thing that I learned from the class. The professors (except for Dr. G, he is the best) were absent, condescending, or just generally unhelpful. The lab practical was entirely unfair. And my grade in the class was just fine (I got an A-), so I'm not complaining because I got a bad grade. I am complaining because classes like these are weeding students out of STEM. It burns us out and makes us feel defeated. Stop teaching lab courses as if we are going to become physicists. Most of us aren't! Start giving us real applications to things. I would love to see how I can see physics in the real world rather than proving how to find some arbitrary constants or values of things that I genuinely have no idea what they are. A prelab, a prelab quiz, a 4 hour lab, and a write up each week...the time commitment damn near rivaled a part-time job. If this class was a full 1 credit, I'd be complaining a whole lot less. I'm just so sick of Yale not treating their STEM students fairly or actually listening to us when we say our professors are not designing courses with their student audience and workload in mind.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course since I learned a lot and improved my data-taking skills and analytical observational skills.",
                "Yes, it is a nice pairing to whichever physics course you should be taking. Also easy to follow if the current physics course teachings don't match up with lab teachings.",
                "Yes! Concurrently with PHYS 170.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if you are taking a physics class at the same time. This course nicely complements your work in another introductory physics class, but it would not be as helpful as a student's sole physics class.",
                "No. Only take if necessary",
                "Yes",
                "It's a good companion lab to the physics lecture. I think it's helpful to take them together.",

                "Unless you are required to take it (for your major or perhaps pre-med) I wouldnt recommend this course. It is useful to see the physical concepts applied, but the work, for the most part, feels pretty tedious (as is the case with most intro labs). However, if you do have to take it, the course is completely manageable. The part I most enjoyed about this course was expanding upon the material covered in lab reports (applications are fun).",
                "Only if you have to take it",
