   "comments": [
    "This course developed my skills in physics (especially mechanics) in a mathematically intensive way. By doing this, the breadth of topics and problems we were able to address was much broader than any advanced physics course in high school.",
    "True to its title, 260 gave me an intensive understanding of foundation physics and introduced me to mathematical models (including elements of linear algebra and multi-variable calculus) in context. Discussions connecting simple harmonic motion to planetary and atomic motion, as well as special relativity, were especially fascinating and far more useful than I would have expected from previous less-intensive courses.\r\n\r\n(Also the standard model of physics is self-contradictory)",
    "Through Physics 260, I learned a lot of mathematical techniques, such as representing acceleration in polar form and using the gradient and curl operators. More generally, I learned how to tackle a broader class of physics problems and a new way of thinking through mechanics. I have also developed the insight that literally anything can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator.",
    "The main skill I learned was how to draw connections between various formulae and concepts that are not readily evident. I have gained a very strong base in mechanics during this course.",
    "I honestly don't feel I learned much in this course beyond what I knew from high school physics. The curriculum is similar to AP Physics C mechanics, only harder and with more complex calculus. At the end of the year, we briefly touched on oscillators and relativity, but this was largely short and not terribly in depth.",
    "I learned about mechanics (kinematics, momentum, work and energy, circular motion, central force problems, simple harmonic oscillators) and special relativity.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of Newtonian mechanics and special relativity by taking this course. The course helped solidify my understanding of energy conservation, momentum conservation, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillation. The course gave me a strong introduction to special relativity as well.",
    "I learned the general framework of solving physics problems, specifically, 1. Differential equations can be solved by simply writing down the answer and 2. You can just ignore quantities if you deem them \"very small\". All jokes aside, I became better at problem solving, learned some more about classical mechanics, and learned a whole lot more about special relativity. Excited for 261!",
    "I think I got a lot better at applying real world situations to mathematical equations through this class. Although only general relativity was completely new to me, we dug a lot deeper into other topics. I think I got a lot better at employing techniques I already knew, and got a much stronger core knowledge of the subject that will help me in more advanced topics next term.",
    "Got a deeper understanding of mechanics and relativity compared to what I knew in high school.",
    "The course reinforced a lot of my previous work in physics, and it was good to cover everything again from scratch since physics is best taught with repetition and exposure to lots of problems in different settings. I learned to approach physics more rigorously with vector calculus and its treatment of mechanics and special relativity.",
    "I learned angular motion, special relativity and oscillators. My physics problem solving skills greatly increased.",
    "The course gave a good overview of classical mechanics and special relativity.",
    "I refreshed my basic understanding of mechanical physics, and supplemented it with knowledge of more intricate problem solving techniques in that area.",
    "A higher understanding of mathematical approaches to physical problem solving, and greater knowledge of the physical world; feel like this opened up a lot of intellectual doors for thinking about the universe and how mechanics works",
    "New material, such as damped harmonic motion, special relativity",
    "Basic understanding of special relativity",
    "Mechanics",
    "classical mechanics in 3d without lagrangian.",
    "Mechanics and special relativity with more complex math than AP physics",
    "I am better at physics problems now. Also this is my second run through of special relativity: with 3 more I might really begin to understand it. I feel like I have a better understanding of how I should think in Physics.",
    "Learned about topics in mechanics, how to find solutions by guessing them (a tried and true method throughout history) and them proving it afterwards. Lots of insight into mass flow, gyroscopes, relativity.",
    "Better problem solving skills and a deeper understanding of mechanics, along with new topics such as relativity",
    "I learned more advanced classical mechanics than was covered at the AP level, and I also learned special relativity.",
    "I gained even more wonder for physics, and learned about a lot of higher applications of the basic info I learned in high school .",
    "This course develops physics problem-solving ability and goes over derivations of physics concepts and formulas which were gone over in previous physics classes, but perhaps not in as great detail.",
    "I gained a different perspective on classical mechanics by approaching it with vector calculus. I learned much more about physics than I expected I would.",
    "I learned a lot of new skills in Physics, specifically in damped harmonic oscillation and in circular motion.  I learned new techniques for solving problems discussed in my high school AP Physics Class.",
    "I learned how to apply intensive vector ideas to my previous knowledge in Newtonian physics. Additionally I learned the basics of harmonic oscillators and special relativity.",
    "Review of classical physics, effective potential, oscillatory motion, special relativity",
    "I learned more about mechanics and special relativity, particularly in the context of typical physics textbook problems. I also learned more about what it's like to be a physics major from our peer tutors.",
    "I took both AP Physics C: Mechanics and E+M in high school and did well in them but this class was still tough for me and involved a lot more calculus then I was used to. This course helped me develop more advanced physics skills and a much more challenging learning environment.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of classical mechanics and a bit about special relativity."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class did a very good job of teaching mechanics and special relativity in an academically stimulating manner. The homework was challenging and thought provoking, but there was always guidance from the professor and peer mentors when needed. Also, the professor clearly has a great understanding of the material in this course and beyond, which was inspirational.\r\n\r\nThere were some weaknesses however. Although intensive, this is still an introductory class, so many of the topics are very similar to topics from an AP Physics course. While this is largely unavoidable since mechanics is mechanics, the class sometimes felt very slow because of this.",
    "Many of the strengths stem from the instructor (elaborated below). Others include the clarity of the textbook, pacing, and flexibility of exams.\r\nThe organization of the course (particularly at the beginning of the semester) was difficult to follow, especially since many of us were unfamiliar with the mathematical models used.",
    "Strengths: The physics presented is a strong overview of mechanics and special relativity. It helps students learn where certain approximations are made and why, as well as how to derive many of the equations we were simply handed in earlier years of physics. The class was presented in an interesting and engaging manner, with Professor Girvin often giving demonstrations of mechanics concepts, especially with the rotation unit.\r\nWeaknesses: The sequencing of lectures, especially in the beginning of the year, was rather confusing. Additionally, the presentation of the Lorentz Transformation as a rotation matrix in hyperbolic space was, while interesting, confusing, and it did not help me understand what a Lorentz Transformation really was. Also, in trying to use analogies for mechanics problems, Professor Girvin would often give examples in quantum physics, which would not actually elucidate the concept.",
    "This class does give a strong overview of mechanics, and I feel that I have significantly benefited from taking it. However, the beginning of the class was very intense and rather unclear. Immediately starting with polar coordinates and circular motion along with derivations was an intense way to start the class and was very intimidating. Also, it would have been nice to see more examples of problems in class rather than just derivations which are not necessary on the first order to complete problems. (Granted, the derivations are necessary to obtain a deeper understanding of the material and I am not advocating for the abolishment of the derivations, but perhaps 60% derivation to 40% application would have been more conducive to learning than the 90% derivation to 10% application that we had.)",
    "Strength: Academic Rigor, Collaborative Environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Confusing lectures, disconnect between lecture\/Psets\/exams",
    "The lectures were very theoretical (derivations) but well organized. The problem sets were short but difficult (mostly textbook problems). I wish there were more practice problems and that we covered more sections of the book.",
    "Strengths: The course reviews basic Newtonian mechanics (acceleration, energy, momentum) very well. Professor Girvin did a great job of explaining the physical concepts that should stick in our heads. He went over many examples from the textbook, and explained them much more clearly than the book itself did. The homework was just the right amount of challenging, and it became enlightening at times. The tests were fair.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is a poor resource. Many examples in the textbook seem to pull mathematical expressions out of thin air without explaining what each mathematical term physically means or why it is there. This is especially true in the relativity chapters. It was difficult to learn anything from the book, even if I read a section five times over very slowly, reread it the next day, etc. Kleppner and Kolenkow are evidently terrible at explaining physics to beginners.\r\nThe course could be improved if a different textbook was used. That different textbook should offer in-depth conceptual explanations of the math behind the physics.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Girvin. He gives us good understanding of where ideas in physics come from both mathematically and physically. He gives good example problems in class. And he gives great problem sets to work through. His lectures are both informative and entertaining. It was always my favorite lecture to attend.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is really a fault of my own. To really get as much as I need from this course I should go to more office hours, peer tutoring and section. I almost wish the sections were mandatory. Right now they are not and as a result I never go. Although truly it is my fault for not putting in the initiative, I wish the office hour schedule and section hours were a bit clearer. Somehow I could not figure out their schedule.",
    "Instructor does not always explain topics that well in class and you may need to read textbook to understand material better, he could use better notation to make it easy to copy down and also explain computations better.",
    "The course was strongest in its breadth and depth of subjects covered - I felt like we covered all of mechanics and relativity adequately, and it was a good introduction to physics to set up even more complex analyses of the subjects in later courses. It did feel slightly weak in its overly rigorous derivations at times, and it felt like students got caught up in mindlessly copying down the algebra in class without much reward. The problem sets sometimes felt like they were not set up properly by class lectures, and we were often reliant on the one help sessions the Sunday night before the homework was due.",
    "It expanded knowledge of physics to interesting applications and taught how to solve problems in interesting ways. It skimmed over difficult topics unnecessarily increasing the difficulty.",
    "This course covers a wide range of topics very poorly. The lectures rarely if ever help understand the homework and far less so the exams. More concrete discussion of the underlying physics behind obscure example questions would be much more useful than the seemingly random derivations and problems discussed in lecture.",
    "Lectures sometimes seemed a bit disorganized and hard to draw clear, focused ideas from. The problem sets were challenging and a lot of help was available. A lot of topics were covered.",
    "Good access to opportunities to help students: peer tutoring, office hours, etc.\r\nImprovements: Better organization of material so the students have a chance to absorb the material",
    "It is very slow, and repeats prerequisite material heavily.",
    "strengths: very rigorous. spent a lot of time on derivations.\r\nweaknesses: rather slow paced lectures: did not cover everything on the text.",
    "Strength: Some interesting material, approachable professor \r\nWeaknesses: the lecture material didnt align with the homework or the exams. The way the material was presented was not straightforward making it unnecessarily confusing.",
    "The lessons need more structure and better planning.",
    "The lectures were interesting, but often I felt I was confused by the end of them, even though the homework barely relied on what we learned in class. I think Professor Girvin was very available for help, but sometimes his help would make me more confused. Overall, though, the class was really fun and I learned quite a bit of physics.",
    "Very fast paced course, which was tough at times. However, I did learn a lot simply by the immersion. Perhaps more examples in class similar to exam and homework problems could improve the course. Professor Girvin was fantastic though, very amiable, knowledgeable, and a good guy.",
    "The strengths of the class include a good textbook, a reasonable amount of homework, and clear expectations for what is on the test. This class could be improved by the instructor using more standard notation and covering more material so that students do not feel as if the class is moving too slowly.",
    "Strengths: engaging, fun, cool topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
    "The course material is very interesting, and the students taking the class are all passionate about the subject as it is the intensive introductory class. However, there are several weaknesses with the course that impede learning. The professor did not make very clear what the structure of the course would be like. As a result, it took a while to contextualize what was being taught in class. A common thread between students was a feeling that classes were mostly a desperate effort to understand what was going on for 75 minutes. In the end, it became clear that we were roughly going through the textbook chapter by chapter. The explanations in the book were much clearer that those provided in class, and were more suited to the problem sets, which were typically directly out of the book. If the structure of the course material was made more clear in the beginning, this would not have been an issue.",
    "Lectures can be difficult to follow, which makes the problems sets difficult to figure out, but the textbook is very helpful.",
    "This course was very challenging, primarily because the course material is so complex.  Thus it was really hard for me to understand lectures, and I had to do a lot of learning out of the textbook by myself.  It could be improved with more resources to help understand the course material.",
    "The strengths of this class were the fun lectures and interesting topics covered. The weaknesses included somewhat confusing lectures, problem sets that didnt give a full understanding of the material, and difficult exams. The course could be improved by doing more examples during class and using the problem sets to get a more effective understanding of material and better preparation for exams.",
    "Strengths: manageable workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are not that exciting and sometimes boring",
    "The course strengths lie in the level of engagement it presents students. The acedemic challenge always made the class interesting and encouraged me to learn more. The difficulties I had with the course were primarily with certain aspects of lecture. Especially early on, there seemed to be an assumed knowledge, especially of differential equations that not everyone had. Additionally, the lectures were primarily proof-based early on, which was not the sort of question we were tested on or doing for homework.",
    "Lesson plans were rather confusing and I found it tough to maintain attention through many of the lessons. The class could be improved from more organization and correlation to the textbook.",
    "One strength was the peer tutoring p-set sessions - I really enjoyed working with my classmates and peer tutors on the homework problems. I enjoyed office hours as well - although sometimes we would spend a lot of time on one problem, the smaller environment was nice to have. Class time was ok; it may be difficult to find another way to teach a physics class beside reading from pre-written notes. In an ideal world, there could be more interaction in class, say if the professor asked more questions for students to answer (esp. since it's not a huge lecture course). Also, ideally the homework and class material could align a little more closely.",
    "The strengths of this course include the support. We had two peer tutors with peer tutoring hours every Sunday night and those hours were helpful in getting the psets done not just because the peer tutors were there, but also a lot of other students and we all helped each other get the assignments done. Another strength of the course is the reasonable workload\/psets\/exams. I didn't spend that much time on psets (usually just Sundays) and the exams were not too bad. A weakness of this course is the difficulty of the material covered in lecture. Many people, including myself, didn't fully understand what the professor was doing in class but still did fine on psets and tests.",
    "It's a great course; Girvin is a great lecturer and teacher and really makes class fun. It would be nice to have section on a more regular basis, but there were always people there to help if we had questions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. It does a great job of encompassing a lot of prerequisite material for people interested in taking higher level classes or pursuing physics as a major. Students who are mathematically inclined should also take this class if they have a physics background from high school.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student assuming that they are willing to learn much of the material outside of class, especially preparing for notational and mathematical structures prior to enrolling.",
    "This course is a strong overview of physics only comprehensible is the student has seen calculus-based physics before. I would recommend this course to anyone who likes physics and has taken physics before. Professor Girvin is very engaging during class and makes the class interesting.",
    "If one very much enjoys physics AND has had formal - not just self-studied - previous experience in calculus-based physics, I would suggest taking this course. This course picks apart physical interactions at their most basic level and examines them intensely. If that sound like something you would enjoy, I would recommend this course. Physics 1 and\/or 2 AP are NOT adequate preparation for this course! (That said, that was my preparation before this course, and in retrospect I would make the decision to take this course over 200 again.)",
    "I would not. I do not think it prepares you any better than Physics 200 will, and if you are at all uncertain about your Physics ability coming into Yale, you are better off taking 200.",
    "Yes! It's amazing with Professor Girvin, and I learned about how to generalize many different kinds of mechanics questions and then solve them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if that student has taken at least one advanced high school physics course on Newtonian mechanics; this course would be far too challenging for anyone who has never taken a physics course before. The first third of the semester is a review of basic Newtonian mechanics (key word REVIEW; anyone taking this course should already have a grasp on the basics). The next third focuses on the more challenging concepts of work and angular momentum; this part is doable even if your grasp on the concepts is initially weak, as mine was. The final third of the course focuses on harmonic oscillators and special relativity; you are not expected to have been exposed to these before. The homework is challenging but enlightening. The tests are challenging but fair. The textbook is basically useless if you are trying to learn from it, but Professor Girvin does a great job of explaining concepts where the book fails. It is a good idea to read the book before lecture to get an idea of what is coming, particularly for relativity, but most if not all of the actual learning takes place in class.",
    "This is a weird course, because it appeals to a very specific group of people. I think most in the class (myself included) would have been better off taking 200. Do not be allured by the fact that 260 is 60 points higher than 200, as I so foolishly was. The subject matter is very similar, and 200 is probably going to be less confusing. That said, those who have a very solid physics background, as I do not, and are more interested in the mathematical side of physics will probably enjoy it more.",
    "If you are going to do physics, this class is by far the best way to do it. Physics is hard to teach and obviously Professor Girvin is not just a good researcher but also a great teacher.",
    "Only if you have interest in physics or want to major in physics - if you are doing engineering or something like that it may be too much\/too hard and also not always that useful.",
    "Would recommend to students of strong math\/physics background as suggested by the course description. Having experience in multivariable calculus and competition math\/physics certainly helped, and it's hard to imagine how much students would struggle without this experience. Lectures didn't always feel rewarding to attend though, since it was tenuously related to problem sets and exam material, which is what the course was graded on.",
    "I think we covered too many topics with too broad of discriptions causing a superficial understanding of topics without going into great detail. The course could improve by slowing down and not covering as many topics.",
    "Not unless you want to have a difficult time not learning physics. The 180 and 200 sequence seems far more useful to facilitate newcomers to physics, and those with enough experience to take 260 should just skip ahead to 401 or 410.",
    "If you need a physics class, would probably recommend this; really felt challenged and felt like I learned a lot more than I did in high school physics, which I here some of the lower-level intro physics courses are like.",
    "Yes. Challenging to students with a physics background, and you will learn a lot for an introductory course.",
    "Yes, if they have not taken AP physics C",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to take an intro to physics class and who has already taken calculus and calculus based physics before, otherwise this class may be too much.",
    "yes if you are a physics major who has not done enough olympiad physics in high school; go to 410 if otherwise. also yes for anyone who wants some general mechanics with rigour",
    "Not unless you are really interested in physics and motivated to spend time teaching it to yourself.",
    "Hell yes. I love it.",
    "Yes. Although it is difficult, I learned a great deal. Moreover, the community the grew and bonded over PSET problems has become a big part of my friendgroup, and I looked forward to seeing them every work. We worked, learned, and succeeded together, as it should be.",
    "Yes, its a very good introduction course",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the instructor is very friendly and the workload is certainly reasonable.",
    "Yes! A great first course in physics!",
    "I am mixed on this. If the student has taken calculus-based physics before, and has a strong grasp on physics already, then this course may be a good first physics class at Yale. However, with this background, it may be possible to go directly into a higher-level course in the department. For a student without this background, this class would be very difficult due to the level of the course materials and the difficulties with the structure of the course and the way material is presented. I feel as though I have finished this semester without having substantially improved my understanding of physics, which is regretful given the level of work which I have put into the course.",
    "This course is fun if your passionate about physics and willing to work hard to learn independently, but a pain if you view physics as a chore",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who feels very comfortable with physics as a whole.  It is a real challenge, and students who aren't as comfortable should definitely take 200 instead.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a very strong background in physics who are interested in the most intensive introductory course. They should really enjoy the theory of physics and covering topics at a fairly theoretical level. If you want a more applied class or do not have strong physics knowledge, I would not recommend this class.",
    "Yes, especially for those interested in pursuing physics further.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if they know they are going to major in physics. For someone who isnt, it is certainly a challenge that one has to consider the value of. It is a fun course and one that will help you think in mechanics.",
    "For potential physics majors - I'd recommend it, it certainly isn't impossible. I don't think it's too much harder than 200 so you might as well take it. It helps to have an AP physics C background just because you'll have more intuition, but not all students have that. Co-taking Math 230 or 120 is perfect. 120 is probably more relevant to the class, but if you're into math and want to take 230 it's worth it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it is a pretty intellectually challenging course but the workload is very reasonable. The teacher, Dr. Girvin, is not bad and the class definitely has a collaborative environment to it. It's a great course if you've already taken both AP Physics C courses\/tests and did well in them and want to explore physics at a higher level.",
    "Yes, but only if you actually like physics - it's really rewarding, but it's also a lot of work."
