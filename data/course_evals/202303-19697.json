Everything feels a bit rushed, especially at the end of the semester. And it is like cramming instead of real studying. We don't have enough time to master the vocabulary and grammar for each lesson. At the end of the semester, I feel like I've already forgot most of the vocabulary learnt in Lessons 3 and 4. I'm not sure how it could be improved other than slowing down the pace (maybe 5 lessons for the semester instead of 6?).",

                "YES!!!!!! I learned so much in this class that I never thought I could learn in such a short amount of time. This course really gets you to learn such advanced concepts thoroughly, but in such a short amount of time without feeling too stressed about it either. This was genuinely my favorite class during the fall semester and I was always excited to attend!!!",
                "You have to be motivated because the workload is intense. The daily homework and meeting every day for class takes up a lot of time and personally I had to spend 1-2 hours per day of studying to keep up in the class. If you are very passionate about learning Japanese, I would recommend it."
