                "I loved this class! I significantly improved my Spanish speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills in this course. I also learned a lot about relevant global topics and themes in Spanish, which was exciting and engaging. The course was organized in a way to encourage participation and interaction in Spanish in a comfortable setting.",
                "I gained experience speaking in Spanish while learning aspects of latin American culture. I was able to express my opinions more clearly in Spanish and had the opportunity to speak the language almost everyday in a casual setting with my peers. I also gained a wider vocabulary because we would be discussing a wide range of topics.",
                "I'm not sure if they modify the course every year, but overall, we explored current and past developments in unique cultures and societies. There were a lot of philosophical topics, and I think this class is a great way to take a step back and widen your perspective on the complex world around you. There is a lot of free thought in this class, and trying to express your ideas in another language makes them so much more meaningful. You truly recognize the value of language, and I think there are certain insights gained in this course that are completely personalized, but I guarantee that they will give you an interesting and educated perspective on the many nexuses present in our growing world.",
                "I improved my fluency in speaking, writing, and comprehending in Spanish. I also greatly improved my vocabulary. While I learned fewer new things in grammar, I started to become more consistently grammatically accurate in my speaking and writing. I also had very interesting and insightful conversations about topics like the long-term effects of colonialism, the effects of technology on our modern lives, and cinematographic techniques. Overall the depth and complexity of the topics we discussed required me to be able to articulate much more complex ideas in Spanish, which was a helpful challenge in my speaking and composition, especially in contrast to the very casual\/conversational Spanish that had been asked of me in the past.",
                "Reading\/reading comprehension skills, conversational language skills, writing\/analytical writing skills",
                "I learned how to discuss cultural and social movements and analyze art, films, and literature in Spanish. I also learned how to write about complex ideas in Spanish.",
                "My vocabulary greatly increased and I am now more confident in circumlocating and speaking about topics off-the-cuff.",
                "I greatly developed my speaking, listening, and fluency in Spanish through this course. I also gained a lot of valuable insight into the Spanish speaking world and contemporary problems.",
                "How to speak and write intelligently about art, social issues, and indigenous cultures in Spanish.",
                "Speaking, writing, cultural awareness, discussing current events and issues",
                "Beyond the conversational practice, there was a lot of film and media analysis in this class. I learned about Latin American art and film, especially that related to colonization.",

            "comments": [
                "This is a very strong course- It was discussion and culture based which made the content and class time very engaging. This course is important because it makes you develop strong speaking skills as you have to respond to the professor and your classmates as if youre having a regular conversation; most of the time, you dont have time to craft a response by writing it which is very beneficial. The main weakness of this class is the lack of writing. I think writing is very important to speaking a language, and though we had a few assignments that included writing, I think it wouldve been helpful to have more.",
                "This course was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken! Profesora Tordin was phenomenal, and her organization of the class was well-thought-out and executed. From visiting the art museum, to watching Spanish movies, to art projects, to in-class discussions  I deeply enjoyed all aspects of this class and looked forward to it each day. I have no improvements to suggest in this course.",
                "A strength of this course was that it wasn't too focused on teaching us grammar, and rather letting us speak ourselves, gradually improving and gaining confidence. What I didn't like about this course was that I felt that the topics we were covering were too large and nuanced. It is hard to offer a cohesive take on capitalism or racism when our speech is limited. Also, when we learned about latin American culture, I sometimes felt that we were focusing on really heavy topics of suffering and discrimination, when I, as a Mexican student, wanted us to learn about the richness of the culture and the good parts of latin American life. Also, when we spoke in Spanish and made mistakes, our professor never corrected us. I think she did this because she wanted to create a safe environment, which I really appreciate as speaking in an other language can be intimidating. However, I would've like some feedback on my errors made so that I could have corrected myself, because there were times where I just didn't remember what word or what tense was appropriate in a given situation. Also, I wish I would've known at the beginning of the semester that this was an experimental Spanish L4 class, because I'm not sure if I would have decided to enroll in it over a more traditional course.",
                "Strengths: There are plenty of opportunities to exercise and develop your Spanish-speaking abilities and the class allows you to apply your Spanish knowledge rather than simply memorizing tables of conjugations and vocabulary. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "This course really excels at improving fluency, composition, and comprehension. I'd say the one weakness in the course is how grammar is taught. For me it was much more valuable to practice speaking and listening over re-learning the same grammar I'd been taught in past classes, but it might have been helpful if the grammar instruction was slightly more formal. The professor's strategy was to correct our grammatical errors as we spoke either by correcting us verbally or by writing the correct form on the blackboard. This worked fairly well, but it might be even more helpful if there were a brief, more formalized review of some of the mistakes that were made during the course of the class at the end of each period or something like that. As it was, even though we were being corrected, it would be easy to make the same kind of error repeatedly. This, however, was minor, as like I said, fluency was more important to me and I definitely improved in that respect.",
                "Strengths: engaging material\/content, exposed us to a lot of higher level readings\/topics that pushed our language comprehension skills, allowed us a lot of creativity for projects, writing assignments, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think I learned as much vocab\/grammar as I have in previous Spanish courses",
                "The main strength of this course was the focus on learning more Spanish through culture, art, and discussions. I always knew going to class that we would be having an interesting and engaging conversation. A weakness of this course was the lack of assignments because when we did have an exam or essay it mattered so much such it was the only one or one out of two.",
                "Strengths: This course was brilliant. We interacted with interesting artistic materials and analyzed them in a completely new way. The seminar style accelerated my learning and forced me to learn how to speak and write well\r\n\r\nWeakness: Truly, the only weakness I can think of is the lack of formal grammar education. More most people in the class it was not necessary. However, the few times the professor tried to introduce subjects, I wish it was in a more methodical, \"traditional\" homework style. Perhaps this can be a small homework thing. You do not need to take up class time for this.",
                "There were a lot of strengths of this course. The discussion based classes peaked my interest in the language and engaged me more with the material.",
                "I think the course was incredibly interactive. It was centered around classroom discussions, allowing us to practice our Spanish and directly engage with the material of the class. We also visited the Yale art gallery, performed short plays in Spanish, created artistic interpretations, etc. All of this allowed us to learn Spanish in a way that was extremely intellectually fulfilling.",
                "A big strength of the class is its emphasis on discussion. Not only did it help me improve my speaking, but also broadened my perspective on many social and political topics as I felt like I learned a lot by listening to my peers. A weakness is that the class does not spend much time reviewing grammar, as I think it would have helped the fluidity of our conversations and writing.",
                "strengths: Giseli was a super engaged and enthusiastic teacher. The material was way more interesting than in any other spanish course I've taken, and it was easy to care about the discussions in class.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I would have liked some vocabulary practice as a supplement to the topics we were learning, but besides that it was a really well designed course!",
                "There were no weaknesses to this course at all. I understand that this is a pilot course based primarily on readings and discussion, but I am so glad I took it. I not only emerged with better speaking, comprehension, and listening skills, but also left with many new friends."

                "I would. I know that my class was a tester class and other L4 classes focused more on grammar, but Im really happy that I was placed into this class. At this point in my spanish education, learning how to speak about culture and everyday issues is more helpful than going over grammar.",
                "Absolutely, I have and will continue to recommend this course to students! Profesora Tordin is one of my favorite teachers, and she has inspired me to pursue a Spanish Certificate and take additional Spanish classes.",
                "Yes, if they like the style of learning Spanish that I have described above.",
                "Yes, especially with Tordin. Under Tordin, the class is discussion-based, and while this may seem daunting at first, you quickly recognize that you're in a classroom with other students that haven't completely mastered their Spanish either. The discussions are very helpful in not only learning Spanish but also in developing your speaking abilities. The students in my class (taught by Tordin) seemed much more satisfied with their progress and engagement with Spanish than in other L4 Spanish classes, but I think that, regardless, you'll be learning Spanish by applying it to thoughtful discussions surrounding important social and cultural phenomena of the modern world and in history. However, you are expected to have a good grasp of all Spanish grammar and conjugations before entering this class, so take that into consideration when choosing which level of Spanish you want to start with.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Giseli is a thoughtful, understanding, and attentive professor who knows each of her students very well and is attentive to what they individually need to improve on as students. The class was also far more engaging than past Spanish classes I've taken, because rather than doing rote memorization of grammar and vocabulary we engaged with really complex topics (e.g. technology, colonialism, climate change, art, feminism) completely in Spanish and were expected to bring nuanced contributions to the conversations on these topics in Spanish. This exercised a kind of Spanish that was often more academic than the Spanish I'd been asked to use in the past, and greatly improved my ability to speak off the cuff in Spanish. At this point in my study of Spanish this is far more valuable than rote memorization, as well as far more interesting, and I'd highly recommend the class to anyone who wants to learn Spanish while also valuing their time spent in class.",
                "Yes I would, I think it is a great class for anyone who enjoys learning Spanish through a more hands-on manner - reading, watching movies, etc instead of using a textbook. And, as I write in #10, Giseli was a great instructor and made the experience even better.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed the way it was taught and the material we covered.",
                "Wholeheartedly, yes. I did not belong in L4 Spanish (I simply didn't have the skills) but I still loved this course. Not only did my Spanish improve greatly, I actually learned new ideas, forging new intellectual paths on an array of academic levels. The course was extremely well organized and it was so satisfying to talk about large issues in Spanish.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. The class was very different and refreshing compared to the Spanish classes I took in previous years. The work can get repetitive and tedious at times, but the material is interesting.",
                "Yes! If you're looking for an experiential, cultural language course, this is a great one! Giseli is a wonderful teacher who obviously cares a ton about the course material and her students. I highly recommend this class!",
                "Yes! The small class size makes it feel like a seminar, and you aren't pressured to memorize all the small grammar and vocabulary details. All discussions have a wide scope of ideas to talk about, and everyone is included in them."
