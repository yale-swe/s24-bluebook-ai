    "The essays we read were terrific; I wish we spent a bit more focus dissecting the writing style of the author. We spent lots of time discussing content.",

    "Yes! English 120 is a great class and everyone should take it. If you're seriously concerned about keeping a high GPA (for whatever reason), then consider taking it Credit\/D."
