   "comments": [
    "Following history through just a military perspective was really engaging for me and provided interest in history I did not really have before.",
    "Good first history class to take at Yale. Lots of reading that helped me develop those skills as well as essay writing",
    "Learned an overall sweep of European military history, except that now I would call it much more a history of military technology and the power of economics.",
    "A survey-level understanding of European financial, economic, technological, and military history; a frame of reference for other classes; a lot of miscellaneous details about individual weapons, courtesy of Max Boot.",
    "Professor Kennedy really stressed the ability to read and interpret data sets accurately. He would often show tables recording the size of countries' militaries, the size of the air force or naval force, and military expenses, and wanted us to be able to figure out when figures were inflated or the causes of spikes.",
    "A firm foundation in the great power politics and how the west came to dominate the world. Not a class about military tactics and battles, but the broad rise and interactions of different powers.",
    "The ability to analyze large time periods.",
    "I learned more about Europe",
    "Knowledge: Trends and changes in military history from 1500 to present.\r\n\r\nSkills: Looking at historical events from a holistic perspective.\r\n\r\nInsights: Complexities of both preparing for, during, and after a war.",
    "I learned about the economic, diplomatic, and military history of the West and how the military impacted and was impacted by factors like finance, industrialization, and more. The class is a good intro course to a large period of history and goes into far more than just a series of battles. The class makes you think about underlying causes and currents of history.",
    "I was able to better understand the economic, political, and military trends that characterize the different periods from the 1500s to the present-day.",
    "Honestly, I barely learned anything.",
    "I frankly did not learn much from this class as I covered most of the material in prior courses, but i have enormous respect for Professor Kenendy and think it is worthwhile to take any class with him. The reading was really interesting for the most part, although heavy.",
    "I learned how to take notes more efficiently, as there was a lot of information to process, all of which would be impossible to write down. I also learned the value of brute memorization, flashcards, and extended periods of studying during \"Reading Week.\" From the class itself, I learned a lot about the evolution of our world since the dawn of the \"European Miracle\".",
    "I learned much more about the role sea power and air power have played in the rise of global superpowers.",
    "I learned to connect historical events to each other in a coherent way that helps me to fully understand that history wasn't just about the massive earthquake like events but also the smaller, unnoticed tremors.",
    "Such a great course. I have a much stronger grasp on the major trends in warfare throughout modern history, and know so many more facts as a result of taking this course.",
    "Learned why the West got the upper hand in the last 500 years, how changes in governance and finance influenced the changes in war, the causes of major wars (Napoleonic, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, etc.), why some sides won while others lost, technological changes in warmaking, etc. etc.",
    "I learned a lot about the West's position circa 1500, how it rose from that time during the age of sail to be a global commerce power, how the economics of warfare impacted the outcome of major Western and global conflicts, and how we are seeing the West's hegemony fall in modern times.  Truly, I learned a lot about the behind-the-scenes of warfare that I never knew, and I really enjoyed examining why military powers rise and fall.",
    "Great Credit\/D if you just want an interesting lecture. Kennedy is an interesting speaker and his books are extremely well done, even though the reading list only provides supportive opinions, and no perspectives contradictory to his own.",
    "I learned so much more about the interaction between the economy and military from 1500-2000. My NROTC section also covered US warfighting tactics from 1775-12000.",
    "A basic understanding of the history of Europe through the context of political and military conflicts. This was a great course overall, especially if you are a history major.",
    "I learnt some very interesting broader concepts of what has gone on in the West since 1500 and how that has shaped society today.",
    "How to pander to one's teaching assistant's desires.",
    "This class helped improve my ability to make a historical argument using historical evidence. I did not take AP European History in high school and so along with a scintillating explanation of military history, I also found the class to be a great introduction to European history since 1500.",
    "We covered military history of the West from 1500-present. In many ways this felt like more of a European history class.",
    "Knowledge and insight of the development of more advanced militaries that correlated with the advancement of nations.",
    "An extensive review of the military history of the west since 1500",
    "How to do a lot of readings in a short period of time.",
    "Pretty cool course although definitely a survey course. Super broad. You learn the most from the readings.",
    "I gained great insight into the history of the modern world from a military perspective. The course does a great job of rounding out the normal history education that most students experience.",
    "Broad overview of European\/American military history since 1500. Will be somewhat repetitive\/boring at points for anyone with a solid understanding of European and American political history but the course also emphasizes technology and strategy, which is interesting to learn about.",
    "Good survey course if you're interested in Military History of the West.",
    "A better understanding of how the West came to dominate world politics as well as a deeper understanding of the relationship between military affairs, society, and world history.",
    "I learned the broad sweep of western history from 1500 onward from a military perspective. I practiced critical reading skills and critical discussion skills through the sections and examinations.",
    "I learned an enormous amount of information. I learned lots of specifics about major powers that I did not know prior to taking the class.",
    "I developed the insight of how closely linked military history is to political, economic, and even social history.",
    "You learn about the Military History of the West, and how it relates to the rise and fall of the great powers (incidentally also the name of the book this course is centered on). You learn a lot of grand strategy -- how technology impacts warfare and great powerhood, the relation between economics, military, and great powerhood, etc. Prof Kennedy is a legend, and the chance to listen to him twice a week is not to be missed!",
    "Really enjoyable course - Professor Kennedy did a phenomenal job going through different military developments and contextualizing them within a broader historical scope. It went far beyond simply military events and touched on a bunch of different facets leading to society as we know it nowadays, and the origins of modern conflicts.",
    "Learned a great overview of military history covering broad themes.",
    "A strong understanding of military history of the west.",
    "Survey of military history since 1500.",
    "Learned mostly about major wars and developments in their handling.",
    "Gained an in depth knowledge of the factors that contributed to the military history of mostly Europe, and how multiple factors allowed European states to come to power.",
    "A very in depth knowledge of the economic and political relations of the European nations and the technological developments in Europe from 1500 to modern day",
    "I learned a lot about the broad sweep of military history and the rise and fall of great powers.",
    "I developed some crucial insights for considering warfare and war economics. The focus of the course on the causes and implications of modern warfare have enabled to consider concepts such as the \"home front\" and the nature of warfare with greater precision and accuracy.",
    "This was a great survey course not just about military history but also just world history.",
    "This course helped me understand the context of modern warfare.",
    "Expounded on military history for Europe",
    "I learned about the military history of the West and how they apply to modern day military ventures.",
    "Surveyed the vast era of history and focused on the military aspect of it.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of European and American political and economic history since about 1500, viewed through the lens of military happenings, and a somewhat more fine-grained understanding of developments in military strategy, tactics, and technology over the same period.",
    "A basic overview of some military trends of the wes",
    "In depth history of the evolution of militaries throughout the West.",
    "I gained a good overview of military history.",
    "Before this class I knew next to nothing about European history and this class taught me so much about that. It teaches more than can be learned by reading online because Professor Kennedy and section leaders stress the importance and impact of certain things rather than just having to memorize them. This class showed me not only what happened, but why things happened, and how they can be applied to politics and militaries today. 10\/10 would recommend with Kennedy fosho",
    "I gained a better understanding for not only how wars were fought, but also how they were funded and constructed.",
    "Grew an enjoyment for reading.",
    "I learned a lot about the timeline of advancements in military technology from the 1500s to the present day.",
    "An understanding of general themes throughout the time period.",
    "Military history in europe from 1500 to post-ww2 age, with an emphasis on the economic, political, and geographical considerations related to waging war.",
    "My ability to understand themes over long periods of time",
    "This class offers an excellent survey of European history and politics. This is primarily a class about the history of politics of Western Europe, not precisely the entirety of military history. However, it supplements very well prior study of Europe and the West.",
    "I learned a lot of new information about the world since 1500."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good improve the lectures by being a bit more engaging for students perhaps by varying the ways they are given.",
    "In all honesty I took this course to be an easier class on my schedule, but this became my favorite course I have ever taken at Yale. I love professor Kennedy's lectures (he is a gem), I was lucky and had an amazing TF, and the material was engaging in that it connects to so many other histories.",
    "STRENGTHS: emphasis on connections between military, economic, and technological developments. Strong sense of thematic continuity & recognition of genuine changes.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I know it's military history of the West, but I think it's shortsighted to spend the 18th & 19th centuries talking about intra-European conflicts and financial developments and technological innovations while treating colonialism as a side story. Obviously Britain had a better tax system than France, but it's weird to spend so much time meditating on superior tax structures without integrating how colonial powers took wealth from their colonies into that same discussion. It's weird to spend so much time talking about technological innovation spurred by intra-European competition without noting that colonial powers used much older means of violence in their colonies, like dogs were used to sow terror in the Caribbean. All these things are intensely relevant to the military history of the West: they just happen not to physically take place in the West as it's imagined by this course, and that imaginary is vaguely defined anyway, given the United States' sudden entrance after the Civil War. I know the course is necessarily limited, and that's okay. I just think it needs to spend more time explaining its conception of the West, especially when the US arrives, in order to more clearly set expectations.",
    "I found the material fantastic and very interesting. It focuses on the big ideas, which is not for everyone. Lectures focus on big trends and are very low on actual material or information, so you have to do the readings to be able to write about what's going on.",
    "It was hard to know what to study for the midterm and finals because nothing was incredibly stressed besides very broad ideas.",
    "Paul Kennedy is a great lecturer and very insightful. Andy Hogan the TA was very awesome they both made learning fun.",
    "Strengths: good topic. Weakness: too broad, no specificity, easy to blow off.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kennedy is a legend. And the TAs did a wonderful job of making the material approachable and synthesizing information across lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
    "The course material is very interesting with an emphasis on more recent history. The readings are useful and related to the material covered in class and section and are not too cumbersome to read. The exams are straightforward and test your engagement with the themes of the course; if you pay attention and engage with the lectures, you will be prepared. One weakness is that at least in the early lectures we cover such a large period of history and such large topics that the connection can sometimes be easy to lose sight of.",
    "I think the content of the course is very interesting, however, as a course marketed as one that gives students an introduction to military history, it often makes assumptions that students already have a strong understanding of the material. Both in lecture and in a lot of the classes, names and specific battles are mentioned with the assumption that students would be able to follow which is not always the case. I think the class could be improved, by potentially speaking briefly about the basic causes, significance, and players before talking about the more general trends that way students are able to better follow both in lecture and in readings. For example, important events such as the French Revolution or Nagasaki and Hiroshima are simply mentioned, a picture is shown, and the class moves on after 1-2 minutes. While these are two more well-known examples, there are often many events and specific battles that are handled in the same way that don't allow you to absorb the material as fully. Overall, I think the lectures could be better structured so that more than just pictures of ships and charts are included. Having dates, participants, causes, outcomes, and\/or significance would all help in allowing a student to follow.",
    "The course is VERY disorganized. Professor Kennedy lectures in such a way that it is very hard to take away anything besides general ideas from his lectures, and if you don't have a good TA who is able to go over the specific things you need to know, then it's hard to learn much at all. It just doesn't work for a history course to have powerpoints with only images and minimal text. It would be SO much easier to follow if there was even a little text in terms of dates\/important terms, people, events etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is WAY too much reading. If this was a senior seminar I took willing to do a lot of reading and work, it would still be too much to get through. For a lecture course, it is just an impossible amount.",
    "Paul Kennedy is the best lecturer I've encountered at Yale. He is unbelievably interesting and is phenomenal at explaining the material clearly. In addition, I thought the readings for this course were very good, but sometimes too long. Finally, while I had a fantastic TA, others who have taken the course were very dissatisfied with their TA's, mostly due to the varying degrees of rigor with which the TA's ran their section and assigned grades.",
    "This was a great class! The only weakness was the disparity of grades across TA's. Same quality exam answers were given a various range of grades according to each TA's grading style, creating an unfair overall grading scheme.",
    "Strengths: Kennedy knows a lot about military history, in particular giving a structural, economic perspective on war. The two guest lecturers he got were also really really good.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seems like there's more reading than necessary. A lot of them overlap. Also, the course is the definition of a survey course, with some wars, even the World Wars, being glossed over really quickly.",
    "The strengths of this course are the fantastically selected readings and the ever engaging subjects of the evolution of land, air, and sea power.  A weakness of this course might be its (at times) disproportionate focus on naval power, as well as the fact that the final is worth a whopping 60% of the grade.  Overall though, the lectures and readings are fabulous.",
    "The schedule could have been finalized further in advance. I would often do the readings only to find the topics for the week had completely changed a day before lecture.",
    "Fascinating material from a terrific lecturer. The assigned readings are definitely too long but almost no one actually does them.",
    "The class was very large so it is sometimes difficult to have consistent grading across all of the different sections led by different TFs. I also feel like these discussion sections were where most  meaningful conclusions from the class were drawn and because they were so different, it was difficult to standardize the material learned in class. Otherwise, Professor Kennedy's lectures were always very engaging.",
    "Entertaining lectures - you feel like you are going to watch a movie, and come out with some fascinating anecdotes about the past. You also come out feeling like you haven't learnt anything concrete and that you have no idea what could possibly be on a test.",
    "Strengths: Over-arching view of military matters from 1500 until now, Kennedy is an amazing instructor and super knowledgable guy, readings are interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really, although some of the readings are somewhat unrelated to material taught in class.",
    "Excellent course. Change nothing.",
    "Professor Kennedy's lecturing style is the greatest strength of this class. His candor and demeanor make this class one of Yale's most can't-miss lectures. The course takes a 30,000-foot view of western history since 1500, which is both what makes the class so cool but also its weakness. It's a great survey of the history of the west, but it is almost so broad that it is hard to really dig into any of the topics. The reading is also too long in comparison of what is tested on. It's hard to figure out which readings are important and which are not. Still, this is one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "The strengths of this class lie in stringing together and developing themes from a large swath of history. The primary weakness of this class lies in the readings become too vast and specific to be able to discuss and engage with the material effectively.",
    "I felt that the quality of the course depended on the discussion section which depended on the TF and the student's knowledge of the readings. Personally, I learned a lot from my TF (Colonel McCarthy) and found the readings interesting. The lectures themselves were a bit dry with but provided an overarching concept of the materials and picked out interesting and critical details.",
    "The professor the teaching fellows and the course material are all huge strengths",
    "Great course.",
    "I understand that the course must be really broad in order to cover all of the material. Big ideas are important, but it would also be good to focus on some specific topics and talk about them rather than spend the whole time talking about really big ideas or listing off battles\/wars. Having a thesis for each lecture and backing it with specifics could help.",
    "The course is a great didactic lecture experience. No recommendations to improving it.",
    "Strengths: a pretty easy class, great 5th class, not too much work but still fairly interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: can get a bit repetitive for anyone knowledgeable about history. Low engagement from students can sometimes make section drag.",
    "A weakness is that, because it is a survey course, you don't go into great detail about anything because there simply isn't time.",
    "This is a great course with great content, but it seemed that Paul Kennedy sometimes avoided bringing his truly deep and nuanced understanding of the subject to class. I wish that we had gone a little more in depth in this class.",
    "I would say that this course is strong in that Professor Kennedy is able to cover the thematic elements and the sense of where we begin and end each segment through his lectures. At times, Professor Kennedy's lectures do not explicitly summarize how that change takes place. Fortunately, I had an excellent TA who was able to go over some of the nitty gitty and answer some clarifying questions about the mechanics of the change that we covered in class.",
    "strengths - all of the readings contain a lot of good info\r\nweaknesses - the lectures were a little dry at times",
    "It was an excellently taught course, with a great section. I have no complaints! One suggestion would be to include some essays as well like most History courses do -- I kind of felt like I didn't get to adequately demonstrate the depth and breadth of knowledge I had gotten from doing all the readings for this class in section and in the exams.",
    "Professor Kennedy is a huge asset to the class, I always enjoyed going to lecture and listening to him. I think one improvement that can be made is more transparency in the grading. Since the grade is almost entirely based off one midterm and the final, it would be nice to know going in exactly what is expected of students. I didn't feel as though I really knew what was expected of a good answer.",
    "Strength was Professor Kennedy as a lecturer and weakness was the vast discrepancy in the quality and grading of TAs.",
    "Fantastic lectures and interesting readings.",
    "Readings were really interesting, but often repetitive so it seemed like they were not all necessary. Maybe cut down the reading load a bit to make it more digestable. Also, a few times, we were notified very last-minute of reading changes which made it harder to keep up with the readings.",
    "Course is interesting and a broad survey.",
    "Strengths - I learned  lot about military history and European history and now have a solid base knowledge of it \r\nWeaknesses - There was a ton of information and it was very hard to organize it",
    "There was a lot of information to learn through not very engaging lectures or readings",
    "I was very engaged with the lectures. The instructor took a thematic approach that I think could have been strengthened with case studies or specific details during lecture. The readings were diverse and interesting.",
    "Professor Kennedy is a superb scholar of military history and was a terrific professor. His ability to quantify history provided a unique, intriguing view of warfare. While his lectures may have been boring at times, given the nature of certain aspects of warfare, his insights were profound and important.",
    "I thought this was a well taught class. There is a lot of material to cover (especially on the final exam), but if you are interested in history it will be an interesting course.",
    "This course is nice because you can be as involved as you want to be.",
    "Track the readings better (lectures did not really touch on them)",
    "Very interesting class. Professor Kennedy is a fun guy.",
    "Lectures can be a bit tedious, and there are too many readings.",
    "I don't think that this class went over specific events enough",
    "The strengths are Kennedy and the weaknesses are the TA system.",
    "Strengths: gave good overview of history of the period \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: way too broad, rushed through topics, didn't have enough lecture time allocated to the late 1900s\/early 2000s, way too much reading",
    "This class really doesn't force you to do anything other than show up for the exams and contribute something in section every week, which is fine if you're motivated to do the work\/reading, but it's very easy to fall behind. I think the midterm could have tested students on more than one topic of their choosing, and it was pretty easy to figure out which questions\/topics were likely to be on the midterm. If this class had two midterms or something in between the midterm and the final, it would force us to keep up a little more and really stay on top of the readings and the lecture material. This is a great class that a lot of people don't take seriously. I originally took it because it looked like it could be interesting and mainly because it looked easy, but now I'm strongly considering becoming a history major. Professor Kennedy is the major strength of the class because of all the knowledge and charm he brings to the table and I hope he is able to teach it for many more years to come. Definitely try to take any class with him as he'll probably be able to make it interesting because of everything he knows and his appreciation for it.",
    "This course does a good job of presenting material that encapsulates the whole topic and idea of the course as a whole.",
    "I thought this was very much a survey class that covered a large span of time and didn't really look into any one event with detail. This makes it tough for the exams because there is a lot to know, but it is interesting information at the same time.",
    "The assigned readings were way too long to do them all, but not all necessary for tests. Prof Kennedy's lectures were interesting, but his slides were rarely helpful.",
    "Weaknesses are the amounts of readings, including ones that were redundant. Strengths are the lectures, sections, and course material.",
    "The strengths of the class certainly start with lectures. Professor Kennedy always lead interesting and engaging classes. Sometimes the slides used and the study material for exams was slightly vague however.",
    "The class was very interesting but could incorporate more from the readings.",
    "The grading for this course for the midterm was VERY variable depending TA with seemingly no continuity in what TAs required. This was once again apparent in the review session when the TAs presented the overall requirements for essays, but then when asked individually TAs changed requirements. Additionally the review session was not only poor but basically useless, giving no more information then a highschool history class about 'how to write a 5 paragraph essay'. The review session did not go over ANY major themes or topic of the course."

    "Great gut, the readings are interesting but not all are necessary",

    "this is a great class, even for non history majors! there is only a midterm and a final, which is great but also means you have to study pretty well for the exams. but the exams are pretty easy to do well on! professor kennedy is AWESOME and such a good story teller. 10\/10 recommend this class!!",
    "YES. Take this class. Professor Kennedy is a gem and amazing and I actually loved going to lectures. The material is engaging and I think it is applicable to so many other history classes, it works as  a great basis of military knowledge to take into other history classes if you choose to take more.",
    "Sure, if you know what you're getting into. You'll be given a big picture that's nonetheless incomplete, and some of those incompletenesses seem startlingly unintentional on the part of the instructors. It's definitely a rewarding experience, but you have to take other classes to fill in the gaps.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is very interesting, not too work intensive, and you'll leave this course feeling as though you've learned a lot. As a STEM major who doesn't have much interest in the military, I still really enjoyed this course and feel as though my understanding of European history has been greatly strengthened. Also, Professor Kennedy is an AMAZING lecturer. You don't feel like you're in a class - it's like he's telling you an interesting and engaging story every lecture.",
    "Great course to get a firm foundation in the great power politics and how the west came to dominate the world. Not a class about military tactics and battles, but the broad rise and interactions of different powers.",
    "I would because I think it is interesting only if you are under the understanding that the class goes very in depth with military technologies.",
    "Yes. Paul Kennedy is the bomb. No pun intended.",
    "Look, you're taking this because you want an easy fifth course. Fair enough. But you won't be satisfied. It's not worth the grade. You attend Yaleseize the university by the horns. Don't waste these shortest, gladdest years of life on anything but the best. You've been warned.",
    "Yes. Unquestionably, this has been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in Western economic, political, and military history. You will be well served to take a class with Professor Kennedy. And if you're looking for a course that's fascinating while not being too stressful, this is a good candidate. The topics are not stale and the class is a good introduction to a vast period of time.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to students who are looking to gain a basic understanding of the developments in war since the 1500s. With that said, I think it is better suited for students who have a background in history (e.g. AP World History) in order to fully take advantage of the course. Although its known as a gut class, depending on your TA, you may actually have to do all the readings in which case there is a significant amount of work unless you split up readings with a group of friends.",
    "yes",
    "No, I would not. I took it Credit\/D, but even so it was not worth it to me. I do not feel I am actually coming away having learned anything new at all. I don't even feel like I have a basic grasp of the past 500 years of geopolitical or military history.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Even if history isn't a student's intended major (take myself as an example), it's still very interesting to study the growth and change of the world. I especially enjoyed the military component of this course over other generic history classes.",
    "For those who want a general knowledge of the rise of superpowers and how the sea and air power had helped determine a country's standing, this course is for you.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any aspiring history students curious to learn about how our modern world developed from the dust of previous civilizations.",
    "A must-take course. Definitely not a gut, given the sheer volume of material you are expected to know, but Paul Kennedy is among the best lecturers at this school. Your grade is pretty dependent on who your TA is, so this would make for a great course to take Credit-D, or if you don't care about taking a minor hit to your GPA.",
    "Professor Kennedy was a great lecturer and kept the classes usually very interesting, making it easy to stay engaged. The midterm and final were not tests to get students on random pieces of facts, but instead were ways to allow for a broader thinking about class topics. Highly recommend to other students of all majors, as it is very interesting and Professor Kennedy was great!",
    "If you like grand strategy, wars, military technology, or Western history, this is a good foundational course to take. There are a lot of readings but you don't really need to do all of them to do well. Overall a very chill but simultaneously quite interesting. Professor Kennedy is very witty and enjoyable in lecture, although he can talk pretty slowly, which may be a problem for some students.",
    "Yes, I would indeed recommend this course to another student.  I think it is one of those classic Yale courses that everyone whose remotely interested in big historical trends and ideas should take.  The class switches off from being focused on the details and specific inventions to covering the large themes of why the West was able to dominate the global sphere for 500 years, and I think those big themes are really important for anyone interested in history or diplomacy since the early modern period.",
    "Absolutely you should get an A if you study a lot for the final and midterm and the material is just so interesting!",
    "Take this class, especially if you are interested in history. It is one of the better ones I have taken at Yale so far. The material is all very interesting and Professor Kennedy is an amazing lecturer.",
    "Take this course if you don't wish to do any work, or if you love Military History and do wish to do the work - either way grading is arbitrary by TF, I hear some give all As and some have give 20% of the section Cs.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! Good fun, and pretty simple.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to another student. Lecture is a 50-minute joy ride led by Professor Kennedy. I find it incredible that students would skip this lecture, as Professor Kennedy is a treat. This class has a reputation for being a gut, but beware. You cannot get through this class without doing a decent amount of the reading, but it is still one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you like reading about this stuff, then this is your class.",
    "Yes, you will learn so much, although that depends on how much you read and your TF",
    "This is a great course, must take",
    "Very interesting course with a great professor.",
    "Yes. Good course but very broad, so I would do the readings if you want to learn some material.",
    "Take this course! The lectures are fantastic. There is a lot of reading, but only reading Professor Kennedy's book is more than enough to get a good grasp on the content of the course. It is a great class to take if you're looking for something fun and manageable.",
    "I would recommend to anyone looking for an easy humanities credit or a 5th class.",
    "If you're actually interested in the course topic I would say take it. There are a lot of readings and seemingly-random battles, people, etc. so memorize, so it's hard to take this course passively.",
    "This is a classic course and the story Paul Kennedy tells is one that you are unlikely to get anywhere else. I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in studying the grand narrative of the west's rise to power.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning the broad scope of western history from 1500 to the present day. I went in with relatively little historical background (no AP Euro, etc.) and you're definitely able to establish a very good knowledge base throughout the semester. There is a lot of reading assigned, but it is possible to do very well on the exams while only doing some of it. Professor Kennedy is excellent, and his TAs range from good to outstanding, from what I've heard. Awesome professor, awesome class.",
    "I would, but I would make sure the student is aware how important the midterm and final are for determining their overall grade. If they could not handle that stress then I would recommend that they don't take the course.",
    "Yes, it is a quintessential Yale history class.",
    "This is a great course to take. It is quite easy, and section can be quite fun so long as you have a nice TF. Kennedy is a legend, so take it just to hear him talk. If you were ever interested in grand strategy, i.e. why countries rise and fall, or in how warfare evolved over the years, take this course.",
    "For sure! Not a whole ton of work, but a bunch of interesting material taught by an awesome professor. Great 5th or 6th class.",
    "Only if you are prepared to potentially get a TA that will have sole control over your grade.",
    "Yes - it's Paul Kennedy, c'mon.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have any interest in history, especially military history. You'll get in a lot of good reading that almost feels like reading for pleasure because you really aren't asked to do any work for this class besides two very easy exams.",
    "Yes, but as a fourth or fifth course.  Attending lecture is not necessary, nor are the readings.  It is helpful if you have a good TF, though, which I did.  This course is a survey, and you can get as much as you put in. The grading isn't particularly easy. Midterm is one essay question.",
    "I would recommend only if you are interested in the course material because if you aren't then the class will become a burden to you.",
    "Maybe; if you are willing to work hard, you will learn a lot",
    "I gained a lot of value from this course. I learned about technological, power-political, military, internal-political, and economic changes and how they have affected warfare and society. However, a student majoring in history may prefer to select a course that focuses more on specific historical events rather than themes and broad changes.",
    "One of Yale's must-take classes. Professor Kennedy is the sweetest old man and so incredibly knowledgeable about military history. One of the best classes I have ever taken.",
    "Yes!",
    "If a student had a particular interest in military history or Western European History, I would recommend this class to them. The class is also very useful and supplemental if taken with Professor John Merriman's European Civilization 1648-1945. They are great friends and allude to each others' work frequently.",
    "Really enjoyed the class, interesting material and Kennedy is a legend.",
    "Yes absolutely! Professor Kennedy is a wonderful lecturer and very interesting to listen to. I think this is a class everyone should take at Yale because it really gets into world history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "This class has the lowest workload of any I've ever taken at Yale. It's just a midterm and final and section. You get out what you put in, which is nice because it adds flexibility to your schedule.",
    "Yes great fifth course",
    "Definitely! A very interesting way to get a humanities credit! And if you are an ROTC student, you have to take it!",
    "Well it is a great course to learn about, but the way it is taught really strays away from the content able to be taken from this course.",
    "This is a fairly good, somewhat boilerplate history course that will give you a solid overview of European and American political and economic history since about 1500, viewed through the lens of military happenings, and a somewhat more fine-grained understanding of developments in military strategy, tactics, and technology over the same period. Don't take it if you're looking for a scintillating narrative of battles and military adventures, though.",
    "Good for filling distributional requirements. I'd also especially recommend it for anyone with an interest in military history, as the name suggests.",
    "I would not. I think that those interested in western\/military history could learn more in other courses",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in military history. Professor Kennedy does a great job at tying everything together so that you have a thorough understanding of the development and utilization of militaries in the West.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class, not too hard and not a lot of work as it is now, but it's also really interesting and allows you to study the material as much as you really want to. Professor Kennedy is amazing and knows so much it's amazing. Definitely take this class while he's still around just for the experience. He really makes you question things and leaves it up to you how much you want to take away from this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and it is certainly a great history class, with an amazing professor.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a very good recap of European history and how the military of each country developed, but it is a very broad course.",
    "Take it! The professor is incredible and the history is really interesting as well.",
    "would recommend for any student interested in european history",
    "Yes. It was an enjoyable class that I felt a learned a lot from and greatly improved my understanding of recent western history.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is considering history or a humanities subject for a major. The reading is engaging and so are the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class. Every lecture was very interesting.",
    "I would caution another student from taking this course unless they specifically knew the TA teaching it. I found the course - which I was really excited to take - was ruined by poor teaching in section, bad feedback and unfair grading."
