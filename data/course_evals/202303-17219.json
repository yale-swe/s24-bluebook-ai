I also gained an understanding of how to code with SuperCollider, and how to use common programming techniques like data structures and loops for musical purposes.",
                "The course was overwhelmingly negative. It lacked relevance to AI and composition, focusing solely on using Supercollider for simple algorithm application to MIDI files or manually entered notes. Unless one intends to pursue a PhD in this narrow field, the course is essentially useless. The entire semester's learning, barring forced practice in Supercollider coding, is less informative than a few YouTube videos. In summary, the course offers nothing beyond coding in Supercollider and some trivial anecdotes.",

I practiced tackling long, complex, open-ended, creative Psets, which is an underappreciated skill in computer science and problem-solving generally. CS psets at Yale are often neat, orderly, hard, with a clear correct answer and limited creative requirements, and this class uniquely deviates from this overdone paradigm. There is no \"right\" way to do the Psets, only a set of requirements that you have to check off--and the rest if up to you.",

This class uses the SuperCollider language for assignments and projects, a common programming language for computer music."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Scott is super knowledgeable, we are exposed to some cool composers and music, class is pretty open ended to be shaped towards your interest, SuperCollider, while confusing, is really powerful so it's good to get some experience using it \r\nCons: I almost wish the class was more geared to composers rather than computer scientists - what we were learning was really cool but the musical applications felt a bit superficial compared to what is possible with these rich systems we were learning about",
                "This course was a little difficult to relate to as the content is very niche and non-intuitive.",
                "Strengths: Classes are interesting and varied. Some days will be group work, other days will be lectures, and if you're lucky, sometimes half a lecture will just be Scott playing Minecraft! Talking about how the game uses features like random systematic generation, and how those features can be applied to music composition, of course. Scott is a very knowledgable and engaging professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is the only course I've taken at Yale that doesn't really use Canvas. Instead, we use Scott's Notion. It's clear that he has put a LOT of time into developing and organizing his Notion, and that it offers certain features that Canvas doesn't, which make the integration of code, video, and sound snippets possible in a way that Canvas couldn't replicate. That said, it's also clear that his Notion has gotten unwieldy, and his tendency to \"save as\" led to repeated problems where links or forms were out of date. The learning curve for understanding which things were due when was steep and unnecessarily stressful. To compensate for this, Scott had a generous lateness policy, but overall I think the Notion either needs a major overhaul, or this class should just try to make the best of using Canvas so students don't need to learn an entirely new system just to perform the meta operations of being a student in the class (like figuring out what the homework is and when it's due and how to submit it).",
                "A strength of this course is its assignment-based format  each of the assignments, coupled with a blog post, allows you to dabble in a different area of computer music each time that builds atop the last. Another strength is the lectures, which are some of the most interesting that I've had for a computer science course at Yale. Moreover, the differing lecture formats is a strength, as it keeps you engaged with the material.",
                "The course's only merit is, Scott showed some responsiveness by canceling one assignment after feedback, although the workload remained excessive. Scott's enthusiasm and ease in presenting topics were notable, yet his interest often seemed singular within the classroom, particularly outside of initial classes and one discussing video game scores and sound effects. A significant drawback was the strict attendance and punctuality policy, demanding high focus in every session. Scott's insistence on traditional note-taking methods, prohibiting mobile phones and requiring paper, aimed to ensure engagement but primarily served to enforce attention. These aspects significantly influenced the final grades.",
                "very interactive",
                "Strengths: freedom and flexibility in projects\r\nWeaknesses: During class Prof. Petersen would go on tangents and I would struggle to follow along.",
                "The main weakness of the course is SuperCollider itself. SuperCollider is the best software out there for algorithmic composition, yet it's not a very good one. The documentation is mediocre and confusing at times; the error reporting is terrible and opaque; the syntax is annoying; and (though this is not very relevant for 95% of the course, sans the final project) a lot of packages are deprecated. As a result, there is a steep learning curve to being able to program in this language.\r\n\r\nScott is also an idiosyncratic professor who may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally think he's awesome and will be taking 432 with him next semester.",
                "The blog notion format is a great way for students to interact and work off of eachother given blog posts and formats to learn strategies for future projects.",
                "Lectures are enjoyable and there is time for open discussions during class as well. Plenty of materials and code examples are given, and Prof. Petersen and Nicole were always happy to help. This course's main deliverables are projects, which I believe suit this class well. Each main topic and composition idea gets its own project, and the final project allows you to combine a number of smaller components to create a more elaborate music generator. I had no complaints with this class' structure."

Since the topics can a bit in the weeds sometimes, I can imagine someone who isn't especially interested in the material getting frustrated, but to someone who would like to learn more about computer music for their own compositions or general curiosity, I think it's a great class. It's definitely, like many music classes, a \"you get what you put in type class\" as the psets can be quite superficial if you don't want to make them cool for the sake of doing so.",

Show up for lecture, do the homework, and you'll get the benefit of the whacky fun lecture experience without the pain of learning SuperCollider. HOWEVER, if you've never programmed in SuperCollider, and maybe you're not super confident in your ability to pick up a new language / IDE, then I'd look for another course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking for a non-traditional programming elective, or for a student with interests in both music and programming.",
                "Absolutely not, I would never recommend this course to anyone. Despite my initial enthusiasm and diligent completion of every assignment and blog, dedicating most of my time and energy this semester, the course has been a profound disappointment. My interest in music led me here, but the knowledge gained left me pessimistic. The course felt like a return to a strictly managed high school class, with oppressive attendance and classroom rules creating a stifling atmosphere. Scott's relaxed and humorous teaching style couldn't alleviate the overall oppressive feeling. In conclusion, unless you possess immense resilience, absolute interest, and exceptional focus, do not take this course. And if you do have these qualities, better to invest them in a more worthwhile course.",

                "I think it's an entertaining computer science course that uses a language you might struggle to learn, but is rewarding to conquer.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to computer science students who play or compose music. This course gives you an opportunity to write elaborate systems to generate music in a project-based setting. I have been fascinated by the intersection of math and music, and this class and its companion CPSC 432 allow for the exploration of that crossing. This course also invites interesting conversations around creativity and artificial intelligence, and the acceptance of computer-generated music in popular culture."
