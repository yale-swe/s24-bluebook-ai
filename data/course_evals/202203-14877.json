                "I appreciated all of the choices\/options we had concerning work this semester. Being able to miss a blog post, skip the last essay, and do a creative final all help to alleviate the stress of being a student. Further, I think that the syllabus was very well crafted, and I was always impressed by the way that our readings perfectly matched the films and interacted with each other. The movie selection was excellent, a mix of traditional, experimental, and hilarious. Perhaps the only thing I would change about this class is assigning less readings. I think it could be more valuable to engage intently with a few rather than many. This might be where two meetings a week could be beneficial!",
                "Our instructor possesses a great ability to spark engagement within the classroom. He is fully researched in the subject matter and shows encouragement to those who may not fully grasp concepts relating to matters such as course reading (critical theory based texts, etc)",
                "Strengths: Structuring the course around specific weekly films, and using those films to situate us in a time and historical circumstances for discussion and learning. The film choices, as well as reading choices, always felt informative and relevant. Professor Forster's encouragement of in-class discussion generated and directed by the class also created a healthy environment that fostered exploration of ideas. Having students present readings and generate questions regarding the film was a unique but especially interesting and useful approach to class discussion. \r\nWeaknesses: the once-a-week meeting times. This class really feels like it needs some kind of additional check in and discussion time, as it often seemed like people's ideas were only just beginning to, or in the middle of, percolating at class time, and were often changed by new information gleaned in class. And then we would move right on to the next film. Also, though this might be too much work, having some kind of preface or short description of the significance of the readings (ie, \"this is Bill Gunn's response to a critic, published in X year, and it's been selected for your reading this week because it shows Gunn, in his own words, giving insight into racial dynamics in film at the time\") might help contextualize them. Sometimes I would be doing the readings and feel quite adrift as to their overall significance, or find myself spending time trying to determine their genre."

At the same time, the content is engaging and perhaps \"niche\" enough to where it is not a repeat of any intro film course. The workload is manageable and you are talking about subjects and producing work that is really enjoyable to do and watch.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to sharpen their viewing skills, writing skills, and ability to facilitate discussion around film and especially Black film.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, both because black cinema feels like an under-recognized category of academic learning overall, but also because the readings and discussions really did shift and develop my thinking, and gave me new academic lenses to think about race, aesthetics, and representation in film."
