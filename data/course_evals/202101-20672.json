There were no major weaknesses of this course.",

Due to the combination of workbook activities, emails with pen-pals, in-class discussions, exams, and group projects, we were able to practice our reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. The course was also extremely well organized and facilitated student learning. The only weakness was that the workload sometimes felt unnecessarily excessive."

Because of the heavy audio compression of zoom I believe more time could have been spent focusing on pronunciation, as it is often difficult to pick up over video call."

It was an excellent way to continue learning German as a continuation to the L1 course, and it fostered active participation from students in the course. The course is also small enough in order for each student to be able to participate multiple times in a single class.",

The course requires a lot of work, but that is true of any language and the course is well structured to allow students to succeed."
