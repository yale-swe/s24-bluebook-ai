    "Yes, super easy and interesting!",
    "Yes. Very interesting!",
    "Absolutely, everything was great",
    "Absolutely. Professor Baskin-Sommers makes it clear beyond any professor in my experience thus far at Yale that she is there to help you learn, not just memorize facts. She will answer any question, even if you feel like you should know it by then, or if it has been asked before. There are no dumb questions, and her non-judgemental teaching style facilitates better absorption of the engaging yet complex materials.",
    "Yes. Extremely interesting and more relevant than it would appear."
