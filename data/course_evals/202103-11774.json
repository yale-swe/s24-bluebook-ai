                "I learned how to real world math. Really important things like calculating mortgage payments, loan/investment calculations, and more.",

I loved this class and it was the perfect level of intellectual challenge, and I enjoyed exercising a different part of my brain than what I use for my major.",

For most of my academic career, I have struggled with word problems and being able to convert paragraphs into mathematical equations using critical thinking.

However, this also means that sometimes the pace of the class can be pretty slow. She also provides very helpful worksheets with practice problems and encourages collaboration with peers, which is great.",
                "One strength was definitely the level of work--I feel like it was just enough to keep students really engaged and up to speed but never overwhelming!",
                "Strengths: Really accessible content, really helpful professor. I liked having videos to watch ahead of time and going through assignments in groups/partners during class",
                "The strengths the the course were its excellent professor Rachel and structure. Rachel is extremely kind and great at helping us master material we are scared to even look at at the beginning of a given class session. The class was very well structured to be challenging but not overwhelming, and the structure was adjusted based on how quick/slowly the students picked up different material, which I really appreciated. The group work time in class was also very helpful both for giving us one on one time to ask the Rachel questions and also time to work through problems with each other and form study groups that extended outside of class. The only weakness for me was that we spent our last class still learning new material for the final and I would have loved for that last day to be review.",

                "very helpful professor",
                "Strengths: Prof. Diethorn is a huge strength of this course. She uploads videos you can watch before each class with a quiz (that you can retake several times) that are really helpful. In class, she basically runs through the video material again, answers questions, and then allows you to work on practice problems in groups. She was super accessible in office hours. We also had a ULA who ran office hours once a week. She was really helpful when working on PSETs. Weakness: None.",

                "This course is designed in a way that students who follow the material should be able to do well on the exams. I liked the structuring of traditional exams instead of the midterm and then final (despite the fact that we did have a final) because it allowed for the content to be broken up into more digestible forms. I think that the final wasn't necessarily super helpful and took away from our final unit.",
                "This course was very organized and the material was very helpful. I was able to learn about the different topics through different assignments that were given throughout the week. The instructor was very helpful and very engaging. I did not see any weaknesses with this course.",

I'm not a math person by any means, but the kind and supportive energy created by my professor and peers helped me gain a new confidence.",

While I was surprised by how traditional this course format felt (and how close it was to a high school style math class) it ended up being not so difficult to follow and enjoyable.",
