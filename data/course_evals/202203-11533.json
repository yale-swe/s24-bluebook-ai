                "Taking this course expands your knowledge on the definition and perception of voice. It goes beyond physiological aspect of voice. Voice is found in music, in silence, in dance, and more. The projects and papers that were required for the course has helped me improve drastically in my writing while learning to utilize other forms of technology and software.",
                "I developed a new ability to tackle complex readings with challenging concepts and more importantly being able to utilize these complex topics in a persuasive written piece.",

                "I enjoyed learning about the different components of a voice as well looking in depth of something we take for granted every single day. A voice can be composed of many different things with different meaning and sounds. It can be spoken, acted out, expressed, and even be silent. We were able to compartmentalize and expand upon what makes a voice throughout the semester which I enjoyed! A voice is what you make of it and as long as your able to communicate in any sort of way it is a voice which is what we found ultimately through the corse. A voice  is what makes us human and connects us all. It makes us more expressive and unique creatures beacuse we can find a voice in everything.",

                "Absolutely, though it tackles a very specific topic (voices) the instructor was passionate about it and showed how in depth one can take such a specific topic",

This makes for a great course to get a great grade as long as you put time and effort into the readings, papers, and engaging in the class material.",
