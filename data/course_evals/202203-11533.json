Voice is found in music, in silence, in dance, and more. The projects and papers that were required for the course has helped me improve drastically in my writing while learning to utilize other forms of technology and software.",

A voice can be composed of many different things with different meaning and sounds. It can be spoken, acted out, expressed, and even be silent. We were able to compartmentalize and expand upon what makes a voice throughout the semester which I enjoyed! A voice is what you make of it and as long as your able to communicate in any sort of way it is a voice which is what we found ultimately through the corse. A voice  is what makes us human and connects us all. It makes us more expressive and unique creatures beacuse we can find a voice in everything.",

This makes for a great course to get a great grade as long as you put time and effort into the readings, papers, and engaging in the class material.",
