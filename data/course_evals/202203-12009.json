Additionally, I confirmed my desire to pursue a career in research and made a meaningful contribution to my mentors research project. I also developed strong connections with my professor and research mentor for which I am extremely grateful.",

I got to engage with real scientists doing real, novel research instead of repeating labs which is often done in other science classes.  I received a lot of mentorship from both my professor and my project mentors, and I got to work at my own pace but also produce something meaningful.",

                "The strengths of this course are the structure and opportunity to participate in research in the Yale Peabody Museum collections. The first part of the course was dedicated to learning about the museum, the importance of collections, the curation process, and how scientific research combats public ignorance. This was a great way to start the research experience for those who have never been involved in research. Also, we spent a day catching insects in a meadow and took a half-day field trip to Horse Island, both of which were fantastic! These were great bonding experiences for the students in the seminar and made the first few weeks of the course fun and engaging. We also were visited by several superstar researchers that came to talk about their work. I found these presentations very inspiring and helpful in discovering my own research passions. For the bulk of the course, each student worked independently. I wish there was a weekly check-in that was designed to encourage discussion among the students. For example, the period in which we were writing project proposals could have been done in groups to allow for feedback and collaboration. Although we were working on vastly different projects, the process is similar and I would have benefited from a group-based experience. I also wish that the final presentations could have been longer than five minutes since it was quite difficult to condense the semesters work into such a short time frame. Also, giving a five-minute presentation to a room of accomplished mentors and the class was a bit scary and was one of the hardest oral presentations I have ever done. I also wish that there was an opportunity to share our work with the rest of the Yale science community, such as a symposium or newsletter.",

                "I absolutely would. This was the course that offered the most real-world application.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student that wants to be involved with research. Note that this course is NOT a gut science course; it is a very heavy research endeavor, meaning that you are responsible for completing an entirely independent research project: researching the field, designing the experiment, collecting the data, analyzing the results, writing the paper, and presenting your findings. However, it is perfect if that is what you desire from a first-year seminar. Keep in mind that there is an expert research mentor to guide you through the process and you are not expected to have any background experience on the project. The lab meetings were very helpful in creating more connections among the students since, for the most part, everyone worked individually. I recommend reviewing the list of available projects very carefully and setting up meetings with the mentors to see if you are a good fit for the project and the lab environment. I set up several meetings to evaluate fit, which made it obvious which project I believed was right for me. Different mentors have different approaches to research and thus, the projects produce varying results. Some students had very few results to show while others had an ample amount. Set some goals of what you want and expect from your mentor and project so you are satisfied with the work you end up doing. Either way, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of what it means to be a scientific researcherboth the ups and the downs. In general, if you are searching for a way into the world of the Yale Peabody Museum, this course is perfect for you. Like most things in life, the more you put in, the more you get out. If you are willing to dedicate ample time to your project, you will find this course greatly rewarding.",
                "Yes!  You get to choose your own science project and your own level of engagement with it.  If you want a gut science class, this could be the right place.  If you want to truly explore ecological research, this is ALSO the right place.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student interested in getting involved in research early on in their undergrad career. I would recommend this course both to students who have had prior research experience and those who have not.",
                "Most definitely! It was an incredible class that taught me about working in a lab and completing research. I made many useful connections and developed new skills. Its an incredible class!",
