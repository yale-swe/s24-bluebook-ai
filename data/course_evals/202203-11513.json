                "This course was very insightful. I was able to develop my research and overall writing skills by taking this class. Discussions were good and I will be returning to the material given throughout the semester because it was very informative.",
                "This class really opened my eyes to the whole world of gender and sexuality. I was fascinated by the different people we learned about and the texts we read. This class definitely helped me become a better writer.",
                "I learned a lot about writing at the college level, as well as thinking deeper in the connections that I make whether inside or outside of writing.",
                "This course was fundamental in my improvement as a writer. Not only did I learn how to more efficiently develop an argument, but also how to articulate complex thoughts while maintaining the structural integrity of said argument.",
                "I improved my close-reading skills, developed a better sense of what constitutes a strong claim and how to defend it soundly, and was introduced to several of the foundational texts/ideas of queer/trans/gender studies.",
                "As a first-year, the most critical skill one must learn is the art of writing. That, andddd critical thinking. I achieved both in this course. My professor, Professor Huber, was vital in my progression of better writing and analyzing society on a deeper level. I came into Yale knowing that I was a good writer in high school. I wouldn't say I was the best writer, however, I was confident in my writing skill. Writing my first essay, I realized how much I needed to improve in. My professor left many comments that stung a little but ultimately helped me get over my ego and get better at writing. By the end of the course, I greatly improved in my writing and critical thinking more than ever before. Writing that first college essay is daunting, but after a semester of ENGL 114 taught by a really good professor (Professor Huber in my case), it gets way easier.",
                "I learned how to effectively analyze how books and films can be in conversation with each other, in the field of Gender Studies, and how to effectively contribute to scholarly conversations through my essays."

                "The strengths would be the material. The weaknesses would be class discussions. The discussions should be more fluid and open and that could be achieved by giving a prompt maybe surrounding pop culture that relates to the topic, then letting students go about to discuss and comment.",
                "I really liked the small size of the course and I think it helped me engage more and participate every class. I think a small improvement could be more prefacing of the texts in class because many times I would have to read them multiple times for understanding.",
                "The prompts were complex but straightforward, so writing was not especially difficult to start. A lot of feedback was also given for each assignment, which I appreciated. The style of the class also lends itself well to deep discussions, which was an important part of learning. However, I had small difficulty learning because the course structure was so different from what I was used to (not necessarily a weakness, just something I had to adjust to).",
                "Strengths: Samuel Huber \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the fast-paced nature of an ENGLISH 114 course",
                "I really appreciated how discussions were organized  Sam gave helpful verbal synopses of what we were reading and asked important guiding questions. I also thought the pace of the class was good for quickly improving our writing, although it was sometimes tiring to keep up with.",
                "Strengths: It's mostly first-years in ENGL 114 classes, which helps socially and also puts everyone on equal footing. You can also choose the topic that you want to work on over the semester and you are guided step by step on how to write a college essay and also write better.\r\nWeaknesses: Because ENGL 114 is a cluster of classes with different professors and different topics, your topic and professor will highly impact on how much you improve and enjoy your course. Choose a good topic and professor (feel out the vibe during add-drop), and you'll be good!",
                "I didnt see any notable weaknesses in this course. It had many strengths, however, including the time we had to complete each paper, the structure of the weekly seminars, and the workshops we did with our papers."

                "Absolutely. This course offers a way to improve writing, reading, and thinking skills while also allowing students to learn more about and be critical of constructs like gender. The course covers many topics related to gender that I found incredibly important, and the course was overall very fulfilling.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone. This was by far my most intellectually stimulating and rewarding class this semester. Each seminar never failed to be both thought-provoking and insightful. Sam Huber is one of the most wonderful professors Ive ever had.",
                "Yes! I think the class environment was very warm and welcoming, and I learned a lot about writing and the class's subject matter.",
                "I would definitely recommend! If you want to improve your writing to be confident enough writing a college essay (in any topic to be honest), your first year is an excellent time to do it. I loved my topic, class, and professor's teaching style, and this was by far my most enjoyable class this semester.",
