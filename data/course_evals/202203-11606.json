I practiced my research and writing skills, as well as my \r\n\r\nInsights: I developed a new perspective on museums and more nuanced opinions about how art and artifacts can or should be colected and displayed.",

                "Strengths: Field trip to DC was a highlight of my semester! The class was extremely inter-disciplinary (both in the content and make-up of the group), fascinating and important content that made for passionate intellectual discussions. The assignments were great fun because they offered an opportunity to do research on site at the YUAG and in DC, as well as research in literature for the final paper. Student presentations were always interesting with discussion questions and case studies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of feedback on papers, and the grading felt arbitrary. We did not get to see the professor \"teach\" much, since most of class was student-led presentations and discussion.",
                "Strengths - Amazing reading materials. The seminar is set to have thoughtful discussions on the reading materials. Also encouraged public speaking and presentations were also incorporated into this course. \r\nWeaknesses - Hard for every student to speak up, not a very approachable setting to communicate your thoughts. Seemed like you would get a better grade if you didn't speak at all for some.",
                "Strengths: weekly presentations and readings, writing assignments. Enlightening and fun field trip to D.C!\r\nWeaknesses: for a writing credit, I would have liked more feedback on my writing. More clarity on how to get feedback from professor Rizvi (or more written feedback on returned papers) would have been helpful, as opposed to just a grade (even if that grade was good). \r\nWeaknesses: more of a gender balance in the class for more diverse perspectives and critiques."

                "Yes. I think it's important for people in museum-related fields to engage critically with the museum as an institution, and this course is the way to do it. Sometimes the discussions can feel a bit repetitive--because it's really difficult to find solutions to the problem of the Museum, and we often end up saying, \"Museums are problematic, and we aren't sure what to do.\" The writing assignments were not very taxing and helped us apply themes from class to specific examples. I loved the DC field trip! It was so interesting to approach museums as a critic when I'd only been there as a tourist.",
                "YES! The class is uniquely inter-disciplinary and offers something for everyone to think about and to expand their perspective. The class is worth it for the intellectual discussions that are enriched by the fact that thee content is hugely relevant in current society, so you will inevitably feel strong feelings. If you are not convinced yet, the field trip and professor Rizvi are reason enough to take the class.",
                "I didn't realize how important museum design is for city making, culture forming, and power structure until I took this class. Fun field trip to study museums in person. Definitely worthwhile if you are an architecture or arts related student, probably not if you aren't."
