However, the greatest weakness of this course is the lack of feedback given on the deliverables, including a proposal, midterm report, presentation, and final report.",

However, I think it would have been helpful to find ways to check in with the other researchers in the class and see what kind of research they were doing. I really enjoyed the student project sessions, and I wish I had the opportunity to engage with other student projects throughout the entire semester."
