Students are only required to submit a 1 page proposal, 5 page midterm report, and 5-10 page final report. The course could be improved by providing feedback on these deliverables, however.",
                "Your experience is very dependent on the group youre doing research in and your specific project. However, it might be helpful to have a sort of office hours for the final presentation where students could receive feedback on their draft slides and learn techniques for effective scientific presentation. Especially in science, I think there a few basic things that people can do that really elevate the quality and clarity of any presentation, and it would help immensely to have some sort of formal session on how to present your research",
