                "I learned about the history of certain screen cultures commonly found in East Asia and the importance of tracing back the origins. I also improved in writing papers that emphasize class readings and making specific arguments.",

                "Strengths- By far the most interesting class I've taken at Yale\r\nWeaknesses- Very open-ended prompts for all the papers- possible a strength though?",
                "Strength: wide range of materials and theories covered\r\nWeakness: every student comes with their own interests and consumption in East Asian screen content. I feel like there could be more dialogue to unpack our experience and feelings when watching the films and TV shows. It might be more fun if it is a small seminar with more focused topics.",
                "Strengths: Very well organized with clearly communicated expectations, good balance between lecture and student discussion, readings were specifically discussed in weekly lectures, and assignments were beneficial towards our learning. Lectures were great at providing a general history of time periods in which specific films were created so we could understand the social and political context. I appreciated the variety in films we watched--most of the films were very engaging and directly related to the weekly readings.  Lastly, I really liked how the memorandums and paper topics were left open ended so that we could explore the topics we found most interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was sometimes not very approachable for someone like myself who did not grow up in an East Asian household. Sometimes it was assumed we had prior background information of a TV show or band, or we were asked to do a discussion post about East Asian media we consumed as a child. Next time it may be good to offer an alternative discussion prompt for those who are having their first exposure to East Asian media in this class.",
                "Strengths included a vibrant and diversified curriculum, with a lot of material drawn from films, TV, articles, essays, music videos, and more. \r\nWeakness was that the guidelines for the essays and projects were at times elusive. It would have been nice to be able to read example essays. Sometimes the objective of the assignments wasn't clear until after it was graded and we received our score.",
                "Strengths are the great lectures and very fair assignment structure. Weaknesses are the extended discussion class sections.",
                "Strengths: The material is entertaining and informational.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it's information overload so it's not clear what to focus on. There's an obvious advantage to those who know more about East Asian screen culture, but it should be emphasized more that a background in East Asian screen culture is necessary for completing assignments.",
                "strengths: very engaging, really enjoyed the room for student participation and discussion during classes\r\nweaknesses: sometimes lecture classes would get a little too detailed and hard to follow, pace was a bit too fast to take in everything at once",
                "The strengths include the support from the professor and the TFs, the comfortable and safe environment created during each class that made it easier to share my thoughts and opinions, and the valuable feedback provided by my TF.",
                "It the lecture one day and discussion the second day format worked well for me. It was quite enjoyable",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content, professor was very passionate and well-informed on topic, professor was very open to feedback and would make changes based on feedback, interesting assignments that allowed students to pursue research areas that interested them the most, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were not as interesting as others",
                "The strengths are the course's format and the balance between lecture and student interaction, as well as the presentation of interesting topics. The weaknesses are readings can sometimes be uninteresting and heavy on intellectual jargon. Additionally, there were times when the feedback on assignments was lackluster and grading was not explained well."

The course is well designed to increase your understanding of East Asian society as a whole (socially, politically, etc) by analyzing a wide variety of media portrayals across three main countries. Professor Li and the TA's were super approachable and great at providing timely feedback for each assignment. Great way to get your first exposure to many different kinds of East Asian media!",
