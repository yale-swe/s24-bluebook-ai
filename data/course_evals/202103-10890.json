                "Once again, I think this half of the course was very strong. I do think the lectures move a bit fast, but overall the problem sets were very reasonable and reinforced what we learned during class.",
                "I don't think there is much to improve at all.",

And I like her reviewing last lecture at the beginning of each lecture. \r\nAlthough the lecture doesn't give enough information, which is reasonable considering QM is something difficultI - I really hope Sharon can open another lecture to talk about QM in depth",
                "Great prof",
                "This course is very organized and exciting. The lecture notes are made available, are extremely clear, and add value. Prof. Hammes-Schiffer had one of her graduate students come and give computational demos to the class which made the math and theory more exciting and intuitive. The problem sets were also not too long, but gave necessary practice with key topics. A weakness of the course was that the most complex material was backloaded. We spent the first half of the term going over model problems that most students had seen before, and then did Hartree-Fock theory, CI, Coupled-Cluster, and DFT in about two weeks. I would have loved to get more into the modern quantum mechanical toolkit.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- provided most mathematical background\r\n- emphasis on both physical and mathematical interpretations of concepts\r\n- many example problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- none",
                "The class notes were well written and closely aligned with the textbook, which was a great reference for further study. I enjoyed the paper assignment and would be interested in learning a little more about applications in class. I think one weakness was the way the problem sets were assigned. In this second half of the semester, the problems certainly got more conceptually challenging compared to the math-heavy problem sets in the first half. I would rewrite the longer homework problems to be \"guided\" in such a way that provides hints, assumptions, or even a starting point for some parts. I think this would make learning the material a little easier and be of more benefit to the students. Also, I think similar to the first half of the semester, the second half should have its own math review file that goes over the main linear algebra concepts used (eigenvalues, matrix multiplication, diagonalization, etc).",
                "The strengths and weaknesses of this course are very similar to those of the first half of the semester: it was great to have slides available before each class, in-class problems, and weekly assignments that weren't graded extremely harshly. Sharon and Mathew were very nice and helpful! It could be interesting to include a brief example of applications of the material at the end of each class, but we got to investigate this on our own in the paper assignment toward the end of the semester!"
