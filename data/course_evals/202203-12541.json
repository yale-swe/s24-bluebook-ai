I think that this course was a very in-depth introduction to chemical biology, in that it covered most of its prominent areas of research. I think that I really developed an appreciation for the combination of chemistry and biology in a way that is totally different than biochemistry this course is definitely more focused on the chemistry aspect of the interface between the two. It was, don't get me wrong, extremely challenging, and at times overwhelming, but it was pretty fulfilling at the end.",
                "Lots of chem bio techniques! After taking the course I feel very prepared to discuss chem bio techniques at a high level and be able to design my own experiments",
                "I learned about new techniques in chemical biology that can be applied for therapeutics and drug discovery. I also learned how to evaluate a paper and the techniques employed to answer the research question.",
                "I learned a lot of modern chemical biology techniques used across many labs and learned to think in the context of experimental design.",
                "I learned many current techniques and strategies in chemical biology, as well as gained more experience with reading papers in this field.",
                "Reading chemical biology papers\r\nLearning about common chemical biology methods",
                "This course was incredibly useful in developing knowledge about foundational techniques and experiments used in modern chemical biology as well as examining the experimental design and scientific intentions of modern research in the field. I think it delved equally deeply in all of these topics and truly appreciated its balance of detail and general information.",
                "Before taking this class I knew little about chemical biology, and what I did know was very surface level. We learned a lot not only about concepts in chemical biology, but also techniques and methods for isolation and analysis of proteins, etc. I'm really glad we discussed real-world applications like this.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I think the topics covered by CHEM 419 are its greatest strength, and you'll learn a great deal about chemical biology. The lectures are very well put together, and the materials presented, as well as supplemental materials, are all on Canvas for studying which is nice. I think that the smaller class size is also a nice bonus, since it allows for more facile question-asking during lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: This class is extremely fast paced, and it can often feel very overwhelming, especially if you do not have much experience in the field. Additionally, the quizzes are fairly difficult, with pretty low averages across the board. I also think that the class maybe covered a bit too much for the semester, and getting rid of some of the last lectures (i.e. glycoRNA) and dedicating it to review of bigger course concepts would be more appropriate. It was challenging, but I would say the pros outweigh the cons.",
                "At times I wish we had gone more in depth on some of the material (eg going through the copper click catalytic cycle in class) but overall was a very engaging course. I appreciated the quizzes because they tested our understanding throughout the half-semester instead of waiting for the end. Prof Malaker was very open to questions and feedback from the students",
                "Strengths: New and exciting techniques, Dr. Malaker is very open and easy to communicate with\r\nWeaknesses: Short period of time to learn the techniques due to it being a half semester course",
                "Strengths are the amount of relevant concepts and techniques that is surveyed. The instructor is also very knowledgeable. The grading breakdown is also quite nice and I would encourage the instructor to maintain the same weight on quizzes, presentations, discussions, and problem sets. Would like to see more practice problems available for future students and to structure the content to make it feel less memorizing and more conceptual on the chemical level. This class felt definitely a bit more like a biology class and needing to memorize a significant amount of lecture slides as the primary study method as opposed to working through a lot of practice problems and learning how to problem solve using chemical intuition.",
                "This course was very thorough, detailed, and highly applicable to my future work in research. However, it also moves way too fast since it is only a half-semester course.",
                "This class does a great job of exposing you to main principle in chemical biology as well as some of the major literature in the field. It is a reasonable class in terms of workload.",
                "Strengths: lots of content, so you definitely come out learning a lot\r\nWeaknesses: hard to follow since there is so much content sometimes",
                "The course does well to lay a groundwork and show how the groundwork can be applied to incredibly relevant questions. The course has a well-balanced course load and I never felt too overwhelmed or under-stimulated. Things were new and exciting and well-paced.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the course covers a lot of ground but it wasn't insurmountable and, while it definitely was a lot at times, everything was manageable. I can't really think of any helpful ways to improve the course. Having the lectures posted beforehand, available for annotation, true to the tested material, and all the live meetings recorded was incredibly useful and I genuinely think every class should be taught this way.",
                "If I were to change/improve one thing, it would be the work-load for the course. For example, there were weeks where we would have a problem set, followed by a quiz, followed by a discussion post, and towards the end of the semester this included preparation for our presentations and exam. I think I would have learned/studied a little bit better if I could turn all of my focus onto fewer things. For a regular semester course this would have been okay, but within six weeks and in addition to two other classes it did become a lot at times.",
                "The curriculum was well-structured and the discussion papers were great for preparing for the week's material."

                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, but with some caveats. I was required to take it for my major, so there was not much avoiding it, but overall, I wouldn't regret taking it even if I didn't have to. You should most definitely be prepared to be thrown into some pretty dense lectures almost instantly when you start the course, and also be prepared to receive some pretty low grades on quizzes and such. It's essential that you find someone or a group of people to study with, as it's really a good way to dive into the subject. Rewrite your notes, and try not to be overwhelmed too much when you show up as an undergraduate student, and most of the class is graduate students  everyone is pretty unfamiliar with chemical biology to start with! Try your best to stay on top of assignments, and definitely get to know Prof. Malaker!",
                "Yes! You have to stay engaged throughout because the course moves at a fast pace but you will learn lots of chem bio and will feel confident as a scientist at the end of it!",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in the interface between chemistry and biology.",
                "Yes! The topics covered are absolutely essential for chemical biology students looking to enter the field. In particular, proximity labeling, click chemistry, and PROTACs felt especially relevant. Topics such as ABPP, Directed evolution, and Bump and Hole were also very relevant and interesting, but I think one could be omitted to give more time to others",
                "Absolutely, this is an amazing course for any undergrad interested in learning more about research methods in proteomics and drug discovery.",
                "You have to put a lot of work into this class but if you do, it'll be one of the most rewarding classes a chem-major or even any STEM major can take. You truly come away learning things it would have been difficult to know before unless you were involved in chemical biology research. You become very proficient with reading chemical biology papers and end up truly loving the subject.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone interested in chemical biology and understanding how the field is relevant to modern research should take the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! I'm not in the chemical biology division, but this class was still really interesting and can also be applied to my field, especially when making molecules that may have biological activity.",
                "I would only recommend this class if they were on a chemistry or biology class."
