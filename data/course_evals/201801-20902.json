   "comments": [
    "I really liked the amount of discussion we had and all the peer evaluations. We also had multiple chances for revision, which was nice. I wish we had gotten a rubric for grading straight away, and not after the first couple of papers.",
    "The course is very strong in that it has a small class size of under ten students, and engages the class in interesting dialogue consistently.",
    "I personally believe the ENGL 114 group of courses can be wildly improved. I didn't enjoy my time in ENGL 114 because it felt as if I was constantly being asked to do do something while being graded on something else. The course expectations really aren't clear, and by that, I mean that ENGL 114 teachers, in general, have a difficult time explaining many of the prompts that kids have to write on, which means that kids use their first draft messing up completely and then use their second draft as a first draft.  It makes all the writing to be done much harder than it actually has to be. I also feel as if the various topics distinguish the classes in all the wrong ways. It's promoted as a general style writing class, but the style really does differ by topic. For instance: this class is theory-based, but we were being lectured on how to write a regular persuasive paper. Then when that was done, we would be graded on a theory based paper. It was pretty frustrating to have to mold to a certain style of writing without being properly instructed on the style in question, and I know I am not the only student in the only class to feel this way.",
    "More class time would be a benefit"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially someone interested in anything to do with religion.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is relevant in everyone's life, and religion will always be something that the world grapples with.",
    "I would recommend this class for students to learn how to write a college essay! It was so helpful in this aspect. I would warn them that the class is biased against religion.",
    "If you have to take an English course, and you can't possibly take anything else, then take it. But if you're eyeing another option then I would encourage you to shop that class first. ENGL 114 was not that great in my opinion, and I was constantly complaining about the course while I took it, so if you would enjoy another English class then go for that one first.",
    "Absolutely, this course had the most engaging discussion of any Ive taken"
