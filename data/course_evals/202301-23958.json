                "Strengths - workshops were always helpful and the class community was wonderful. BJJ is also a great instructor who offered a lot of advice, so it was very easy to learn from each other's work. Weaknesses - I do wish we had the chance to read plays outside of student work, or at least had more reading recommendations.",
                "Strengths: Not too difficult, fun assignments, collaborative work environment, great Prof",
                "Weaknesses: I wish we had three plays workshopped and not two. \r\n\r\nStrengths: workshops are amazing! great class.",
                "I just loved this course. Hearing other peoples plays and getting to workshop my own was so inspiring and the positivity was fantastic.",
                "Having a strict deadline to write two short length plays was really helpful for me as a writer who struggles without the pressure of the deadline. I wish however that this class spent more time on actually teaching the basics of playwriting. Instead it felt like we were thrown in the deep end. Teaching moments from the professor would only come during feedback students' works.",
                "Strengths - BJJ! It was such an honor and blessing to learn from him. He is so down-to-earth, funny, encouraging, and insightful. He has a way of dropping little nuggets of wisdom about writing and playmaking that are genuinely transformative. I also appreciated the ability to just write whatever we wanted for our two plays. The shortform nature of the plays also made it so we could get through more plays faster and try new things. Weaknesses - I wish we had more stuff to do when we were not up for workshop, perhaps reading a play or two or shorter exercises to be completed on our own.",
                "This course gave students so much writing and analysis practice, given that we spent our time writing short-form plays and analyzing each other's work. I only wish that we had perhaps read and analyze some famous plays to see examples of people who mastered certain skills and give us more exposure about ways in which we could tell stories."

                "ABSOLUTELY!! BJJ is hilarious, insightful, engaged, and incredibly smart. He's a great teacher who pays a lot of attention and has a GIANT amount of experience to share. Go to office hours. Workload was easy and class was a blast.",
                "Absolutely. The professor is amazing and funny and you learn so much from him and your peers.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a course to just give them the time to write. However if you are someone looking to be taught the techniques and skills of playwriting this may not be the most useful course.",
                "10000000000%. If you get into this class, you MUST take it. BJJ is truly the best. His class and office hours have been the highlight of my semester. I've definitely grown as a playwright and writer, and BJJ offers incredible advice! I also loved my classmates, and the workshops were so helpful and encouraging. I also loved BJJ's weekly check-ins, where we got to go around and share what we watched or listened to recently. They were a great way to warm up the group and also showed how the things we watch can influence our writing, even if we don't realize it. I also really enjoyed the short play structure. Not only were we able to get through plays faster, we were able to try new things out and experiment. Even if someone wrote something that seemed to be a longer play, the act of even writing a little bit of it was so helpful, and it was very encouraging to just have something written down and see that progress unfold. I genuinely looked forward to this class every week, and I will absolutely miss it. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was so much fun, but also it's so important to consistently write to keep working the muscle, which can be hard given the normal workload of classes, but this class forces you to take time to write, think, and research, which I loved."
