                "Strengths: not too harsh on the homework, labs are interesting, lecture content is good \r\nWeaknesses: lecture material was taught at a fast pace",
                "This course was very well taught, however, the workload was extremely high since we met twice a week for lecture and once for lab. Having a pset due every other week was helpful, but it was still overwhelming. The lab should be offered as an extra half a credit, as done with physics, chem and other courses.",
                "The course's workload was never overwhelming, and Professor Panda was very open to student input when it came to extending deadlines or offering more accessible lab hours. A weakness of the course would be the lack of homework or lab solutions. For the most part I had to turn to outside resources to test how well I was understanding the material.",
                "The course gives a solid introduction to circuit design principles. The main weakness for this course is it takes very long to receive feedback on past psets and labs.",
                "Strengths: the content is organized in a logical manner.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were slow at times; labs sometimes felt repetitive (but this will probably be better in-person with actual hands-on circuit building instead of simulations).",
                "I thought this course was exciting and engaging throughout the first half, but by the end I'd lost interest in the subject. The assignments were extremely tedious - both the labs and psets sometimes felt more punitive than enriching.",
                "I felt that the course was a bit inconsistent with its practices. For example, the course started off strong by having a solid outline of what we were going to be learning, but as we reached the later parts of the course, there was less structure and seeking outside resources was almost required. The textbook is a bit hard to navigate and being given sections to read was helpful for the first few weeks.\r\nI enjoyed how the assignments provide opportunities to use what we learned in class to create circuits/machines that has actual function, such as parity checkers and up counters.",
                "The course was well-taught and the labs were a greate addition to the course material. The material was engaging and had many applications for future classes.",
                "As much as we students dont want more homework, this course could really benefit from pre-lab assignments. So many labs had to be extended this semester, and I feel like it prevented the staff from doing something that they really wanted to do, which was the processor design assignment.",
                "Not much room for engagement",
                "she is a very good professor who will take time to thoroughly explain things to you. Labs were kind of messy and tedious",

Grades also took a very long time to receive, so it was sometimes hard to tell how well you were understanding the material."
