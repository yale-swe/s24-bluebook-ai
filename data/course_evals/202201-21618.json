Every class we discussed an interesting topic and I felt like there was never a dull moment. The weekly reading response helped students engage in the content and form their thoughts before class. The other big assignments we did, ranging from creating a Draft Prcis to just pure brainstorming allowed for low-stakes idea generation for the final project that really helped when it came to actually starting the final project. Additionally, the final project was open-ended, allowing you to create any medium that interests you was really cool. Overall, not only was the content SUPER interesting but the class was organized in a manner that facilitated learning and discussion.",

Also I felt that assignments were overly structured  for our final paper, we had to do a brainstorming sheet, comparison exemplars (analyzing pieces of same genre) and draft all with extremely detailed instructions/requirements we had to fulfill that I feel took away from the creative process"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Courses like this are hard to find at Yale, and I'm glad that it was offered this semester. The content we discussed such as Algorithmic Bias, Data Privacy, and Echo Chambers, was all interesting. Regardless of your major, if you have an interest in technology and our interactions in everyday life you should take this course. The seminar format allows you to hear other people's thoughts and form new opinions. It was really interesting to hear everyone's opinion on tech ethics in today's society and how it applies to tech companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, etc. This class is also really good for CS Majors who are looking to work in big tech. The topics we discussed in this class are definitely applicable to their future. I really hope this course is offered again in the future!",
                "Yes absolutely. It's important to learn about how technology can go awry and how we can combat that.",
