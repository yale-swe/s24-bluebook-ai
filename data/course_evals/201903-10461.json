    "I came into this class with a strong AP Bio background so quite honestly, this class was 95% review. It was a nice class to take as a first year because it wasn't as stressful as some of my other classes since I already knew the material. You'll brush up on your knowledge of proteins, DNA, lipids, carbs, etc.",
    "DNA production",
    "This course taught some helpful basic science skills associated with learning how to read scientific papers and begin to think like a scientist. The course also was focused solely on teaching introductory biochemistry, so focused on introductory stuff on macromolecules and protein function. As a result, this course is much more about thinking like a scientist rather than solely about the content.",
    "I learned about basic biophysics and biochemistry.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of biology",
    "Overview of basic biochem and biophysics.",
    "I developed my knowledge of introductory biology to some extent and better learned how to read scientific content and study for science courses.",
    "I learned more about biochem and biophysics. I learned a lot about HIV which was really cool.",
    "I feel that I did not learn anything (content wise) more than I did in my AP Biology class. However, I do think that I benefited from reading research papers and practicing that skill.",
    "I learned a lot of the basics of biochemistry and how to apply the concepts I have learned in my chemistry courses to biology. I also learned new techniques for approaching primary scientific papers as well as how to apply facts to more theoretical applications.",
    "I learned the basics to biochemistry and biophysics, most interestingly about plasmid and genomic technology, as well as how to read and analyze scientific papers.",
    "Having tested out of Biology 101 but not 102, I decided to still take the class in case I would miss out on any important skills necessary for the next class in sequence. While I did not learn any broad concepts in this class, there are many details that I did learn such as how specific information was discovered by reading scientific papers (that were very nicely annotated) or having specific examples of concepts be shown off such as the HIV virus being extensively explained in the last two lectures.",
    "This class gives a basic overview of biochemistry and biophysics",
    "Not a lot, most of this material was covered in my high school AP Biology class. However, it was helpful to get some practice reading research papers.",
    "I gained an understanding of DNA replication, protein production and structure, and how to to read scientific papers.",
    "I developed knowledge of basic biochemistry and biophysics, including thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular biology. The four major macromolecules of life were explored, along with the basic chemical forces that hold them together. Additionally, the basis for life in DNA was thoroughly explored. Finally, an application of all of the course content was conducted on the HIV virus, giving students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they learned into a real-world context. I also learned how to read and discuss primary-source scientific papers.",
    "I learned a lot about basic biology. As someone who had never taken AP Biology, this was a lot of cool information in just 6-7 weeks, but it was definitely a manageable amount of work.",
    "I feel as though I learned a decent amount of information taking this course. I now have some knowledge in how proteins and amino acids work. I also understand DNA and different biological processes.",
    "Learned about the chemical components in biology and how they function.",
    "Decline to answer",
    "I learned helpful strategies for reading research papers. I never really had the opportunity to read research papers in high school, so BIOL 101 provided a nice and smooth introduction that challenged my comprehension skills without being too hard.",
    "I learned a lot about the mechanics of life, with a particularly strong understanding of protein, DNA, and RNA function.",
    "Basic principles of biochem and biophysics.",
    "I had never taken biology since my freshman year of high school, and I took this course on a whim to see what it was like. The class was excellent and really opened my eyes to some of the most interesting things I have ever learned in science. I especially enjoyed how the discussion of HIV at the end of the course allowed us to read primary research papers and actually understand problems and discoveries at the forefront of modern science.",
    "This course developed essential biology knowledge at the molecular level surrounding the four macromolecules that constitute all living things. It also similarly began to cultivate students' abilities to read, comprehend, and discuss primary scientific research reports.",
    "I learned fundamental concepts in biophysics and biochemistry and a little bit about how to read primary research papers",
    "I learned how to prepare for quizzes and tests that are more rigorous than that of high school.",
    "I gained knowledge of basic biochemical and biophysical principles and learned how to synthesize this new information to extrapolate information from a given unknown situation.",
    "The fundamentals of biology. We spent most of the time focusing on the building blocks of biological functions (proteins, DNA, RNA, enzymes, etc). We learned in a way to promote scientific thinking (understanding the concepts not just being able to recite terms).",
    "Basic biology principles",
    "Compared to previous science classes, this course took a much more in depth dive into biology. While we covered topics I was familiar with, the amount we delved into these topics changed drastically. I learned how to read a scientific journal, participate in a journal club, and gained a much deeper insight into how what I learn in class is being used to change the world.",
    "How to read scientific articles.",
    "The class covers the basic macromolecules of biology and I learned some of the biology fundamentals.",
    "Biochemistry and biophysics, the construction of different types of biological molecules",
    "Key principles of biochemistry and biophysics such as how enzymes work, types of proteins, kinetics, etc.",
    "I feel that I gained a solid foundation of biochemistry and biophysics and also learned how to effectively glean information in a large lecture.",
    "I learned how to think in an application based way and not memorize information.",
    "I learned the basics of biology.",
    "This course helped me hone in my scientific writing skills, which requires both knowledge and precision.",
    "I feel that I got a very good introduction to the basic mechanics of biological processes. From this course I gained some practical knowledge that I could apply to a lab setting, experience analyzing biological scholarship, and a knowledge base which will benefit me in future biology courses.",
    "I learned concepts that I had studied during AP Biology in high school, but in much more detail than I did then. I also gained a lot of insight into the chemistry and physics side of biology, which I used to find intimidating but now see is less confusing than I had expected.",
    "A good amount of the concepts from this course was a review for me, but there was plenty of content that I learned for the first time. I learned how to better answer biology questions (I still struggle but have improved). More specifically, this course has forced me to be more careful with my words when I respond to questions.",
    "Knowledge of how chemistry and physics principles manifest themselves in and govern biological systems",
    "I learned how to think critically about biology and apply concepts to an actual lab experience.",
    "Knowledge: chemical interactions and how they shape practically everything \r\nSkills: reading a scientific paper",
    "Critical thinking skills as applied to biology \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to read academic bio papers",
    "I learned the basics of Biochemistry and Biophysics. Developed solid understanding of the genetic code and how DNA, RNA, proteins connect. Also learned a decent amount about techniques, good class!",
    "I learned how to apply concepts, visualize molecules and work quicker during a timed test.",
    "I understood, in more detail, the chemical basis for why major processes in biology happen as well as garnered some initial experience in reading and analyzing scientific literature.",
    "I developed a lens I could use to understand biological concepts through the perspective of biochemistry. I saw this mostly in the first few lectures where we learned about the four forces of biochemistry; I had previous knowledge about most of the topics the class covered but learning about them again with causality in mind was very helpful in understanding them and connecting them together. I also developed ways to ask questions about biology through the focus on appropriate terminology and why processes occur, not just the fact that they occur.",
    "Learned a good amount of biochemistry.",
    "The basic of biophysics and biochemistry.",
    "I gained a rigorous foundation for the study of higher-level biology. The course is entitled \"biochemistry and biophysics,\" but there was not enough physics or chemistry (especially). However, the approach to biology was beneficial in its tendency to ask what could happen if something went wrong in a biological process. I learned that my biology foundation was definitely not up to par with the others.",
    "I learned about the importance chemistry and physics in forming core components of biology and really helpful skills in reading scientific papers.",
    "I learned how to properly read and analyze scientific papers. I also learned many new and interesting biology concepts, especially in regards to DNA, RNA, and protein structure.",
    "Critical thinking skills were developed by not solely testing us on remembering facts, but applying them to future problems.",
    "Just general biology",
    "basic understanding of key biological concepts",
    "I learned about the basics of biochemistry and biophysics, which extended what I had learned in high school biology. Reading and discussing research papers was also helpful, particularly in analyzing various the figures\/results that might appear in such papers.",
    "I learned how to analyze a scientific paper and how to think critically about biophysics.",
    "Basic Biochemistry and Biophysics, along with strategies for reading and understanding scientific papers.",
    "By taking this course, I have acquired a preferred method of studying. This course allowed me to realize that it is important to keep up with lectures on a weekly or even daily basis through the weekly quizzes. When studying for the final exam, I felt a lot more prepared and less stressed as a result of having studied so often throughout the course for the quizzes.",
    "Basic biology knowledge",
    "I guess I learned more about general biochemistry and a little bit about reading papers as well.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of biology and got experience reading scientific papers",
    "I learned about the basics of biochemistry and started building the skills of reading a research paper.",
    "One main skill I learned was how to approach reading a scientific article. I think the journal articles were helpful in acting as an introduction into the world of scientific academia. Another skill that I developed was how to take notes effectively and efficiently. Since there was so much overall information, it became necessary to figure out what information was more important that others.",
    "This course teaches students the basics of biochemistry and biophysics: very basic chemistry, macromolecular structure, biological catalysis, enzyme functions, DNA transcription to RNA, RNA translation to protein, recombinant DNA technology, genomics, and all of the applications thereof in developing treatments for HIV and AIDS. The courses helps students develop critical thinking skills; students learn to make sense of the information presented rather than just memorizing it. Also, the course teaches students to read research papers, in preparation to do research of their own.",
    "I learned to read scientific papers",
    "I learned how to apply concepts rather than just merely memorizing and regurgitating information. I also learned the basics of how to write research papers and their significance.",
    "I learned about biology",
    "general biochem\/biophysics",
    "I learned about covalent and non covalent interactions and their role in macromolecule construction and function.",
    "Basic biology, from molecule up to complex structure",
    "I learned some specific and applicable examples of topics that are usually only abstracted in introductory biology. I also learned about new biotechnology.",
    "An introduction to the fundamental components of biophysics.",
    "I developed knowledge about basic macromolecules in biology, such as DNA and proteins. From there, I was able to develop skills to integrate these concepts to real life, such as biotechnology or how to explain a certain phenomenon. I learned how to problem solve and apply the key principles of biology to understand more complicated material.",
    "I learned biology foundations",
    "I developed the skill of applying Biochemistry studies to everyday problems in order to explain them and propose solutions. I learned how each of the aspects in Biochemistry can be connected to each other. I also learned how to look towards a research paper or project and understand the information given in a group setting using the things that I have learned.",
    "This course developed not only further knowledge on subjects taught in AP Bio, but also time management skills and how to study for college-level exams.",
    "I learned a lot about both biology and learning how to adequately study and prepare for an exam that tested conceptual knowledge (vs factual).",
    "I had a decent experience in AP Biology, and I think most of the same principals were examined in the class, but more in depth. There were certainly many moments in the class when I was challenged to take the  overarching concepts and apply them to a larger picture.",
    "I gained an understanding of the chemistry involved in living organisms and gained insight about how living things create proteins from their DNA.",
    "I developed insight into the chemistry and physical processes that allow for biological phenomena. I also gained insight into the importance of control experiments and adequate scientific journal setup and discussion.",
    "I learned a lot about how cells work and how scientists research genes and cells.",
    "I gained a more in depth understanding of biophysics and biochemistry, especially because I had no chemistry experience before this class. I also learned important tools to study for the weekly quizzes, and adapted to a different way of teaching than I was used to.",
    "This course required applying concepts with below-average memorization. This was useful because you learn how to gain a deeper understanding of the basics, which allows you to answer tougher questions more easily than just superficial memorization.",
    "I developed my ability to approach biology concepts from a more molecular level. While I had been previously exposed to nearly all of the concepts that we covered, after taking the course, I feel I am better able to explain the mechanisms behind the concepts.",
    "basic bio (but nothing I didn't learn in AP bio), how to read a research paper kinda",
    "I learned the basics of the biophysics and biochemistry, while I also expanded my knowledge of previous biological material. From DNA replication to Non-Covalent bonding, I learned about how a range of topics works. Rather than just memorizing terms, I began to understand how things work in biology and the world around us.",
    "A deeper understanding of fundamental biology; understanding the fundamental processes at a fuller level, in scope to the entire process at hand.",
    "I appreciated this course because I developed an analytical intuition for biochemistry. In high school, I was able to describe biological processes and properties, but now I can take that knowledge and apply it to examples and problems I may not have seen before."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Amount of help offered to students\r\nWeaknesses: Amount of time given for quizzes",
    "Most of the work was pretty straightforward but there are a few questions on the p-sets that very few people would figure out on their own so there ended up being huge groups of people at the peer tutoring sessions...it's fine to collaborate but it's difficult when you were never taught a concept that you need to answer a homework question. It is also unfortunate that they don't let more people test out because it is really hard to be engaged with this class when so much is review. I know they administer a placement test but it is hard for someone to recall info in great detail that they may have learned two years ago in high school and I think it would be more beneficial for students who are passionate about bio to be able to start off in Biol 103 and simply review the concepts they previously learned in high school on their own time.",
    "Some of the time spent on specific topics was mismatched where harder topics was covered briefly with a lot of information and easier topics such as a paper review, we spent a lot of time on which could of been used to tackle the harder material.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it eases you into the topics and things with being a scientist. However, throughout the lecture series, I was left longing for more information and things to fill my interests. While it was very beneficial to have a class that started from the very beginning, I wish some of the topics and ideas were discussed in their full depth and perhaps applied more throughout instead of during the end. For example, we talked about recombinant DNA expression separately from purification, but it would have been cool to talk about these more specifically and we didn't talk about how we have to think about the vector we use or more complex vector systems). While we did talk about HIV, I think it would have been cool if we got a chance to apply the concepts ourselves and think about how we have all these tools and information, but how can we solve problems we are interested in? It felt like we analyzed the papers, which was awesome and very cool, but the content almost felt like a separate thing to know and didn't feel as relevant as it could have been. My long comment could probably be summarized by a wish there was more depth of talking about how biological\/proteins systems work  even if not all of it will be used (it just something interesting to know). But overall, the course was really interesting and these are just nitpicky things that come to personal preference.",
    "Michael Koelle is pretty dope and explains things well",
    "strengths- covers a lot of material\r\nweakness- too fast for those without a strong biology background, harsh homework grading",
    "Strength- the course is relatively well organized. It is very helpful to have a course coordinator in a class as large as bio101. \r\nWeekensses- weekly quizzes are not particularly helpful, especially when they are only tangentially related to anything we learned in class and never reviewed. In theory, the quizzes and homeworks were supposed to teach us to apply what we learned in class but the class felt so completely disconnected from what we learned in class and asked us to understand concepts on our own that were not even addressed in lecture. I'm sure if you were a student  had experience working in a lab or writing scientific articles,  this was easy for you but it seems presumptuous to assume that was the case for everyone. There were multiple times that Professor Koelle said \"ignore parts xyz, you don't need to understand it to understand the point\" and while I'm sure it seemed obvious to him ( a person who has a PhD in biochemistry), this is a difficult way to learn if you are coming from a background of only having taken basic high school biology.",
    "The course content seemed fine and appropriate for the course as titled, but the instruction was lacking. Lectures were usually just read off of the slides and the lecturer was not very engaging.",
    "I think having more practice materials might be nice. It was really hard to study for quizzes and tests because it was hard to know what might be on them.",
    "I think the course is very well organized. I knew what was due and when it was due from the beginning of the term. It was really helpful to know in advance what was expected of me and how I was expected to demonstrate that knowledge. To improve this course, I think it would be helpful to have resources that explain the concepts in different ways. Additionally, it was difficult when concepts were only introduced in the homework and we were expected to learn them while we were using them for the first time.",
    "Strength to this course is the organization of lecture material and study guides as well as questions\/activities during class to test material synthesis. It could be improved, however, by adding more feedback to graded assignments such as homework and making sections more rigorous.",
    "Very surface level - some important concepts are skipped. Also, not enough in the way of scientific experiments, scientists, and the history of how the discoveries came about, as well as the social and medicinal implications of the concepts.",
    "Weaknesses: Sometimes things weren't explained very well or at all in lecture\r\nStrength: Quizzes were challenging so by the time the final came, I felt prepared",
    "The course does a good job of breaking up such a large lecture into small sections so you can bounce ideas off your peers and learn from collaboration. I also really enjoyed having access to study guides and lecture slides on Canvas.\r\n\r\nI did not like the set up of the auditorium for class. I understand that it is the most practical way to teach 200 students, however, I wish it was easier ot meet people to form study groups or even just to make friends.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the concepts are clearly delineated and students know what they do and do not need to know. The biggest weakness is the grading. The quizzes are graded unnecessarily harshly, often taking points off just because a single word wasn't mentioned even if the answer is correct and explains the concept well and thus demonstrates understanding. Additionally, the homework isn't necessarily intuitive based off the course content and can be quite challenging.",
    "I think the lecturer goes a little too fast through the slides for anyone to take notes directly onto notebook paper. Printing out lecture slides for every class is also not economical or cheap. Maybe lectures could move slightly slower through slides, or printed slides could be provided?",
    "I do not like how the lecture was run, so I believe that was a weakness. Professor Koelle's way of teaching did not agree with me. I felt like the information taught in the course did not stick in my head and it was kind of hard to ask for help.",
    "This course was very well run.",
    "Decline to answer",
    "One strength of this course was the availability of the lectures on the Canvas website. I think printing them out and annotating them during lecture helped me a lot with understanding the concepts and engaging with the class. However, a weakness I found was that the professor was unwilling to answer questions. He seemed rude to anyone who rose their hand during his lecture, and he forced students to wait until the very end to ask questions (which wasn't helpful in most cases). Also, the discussion sections did not reinforce questions as much as I would've liked them to. I think it would've been more helpful if the discussion sections were more Q&A than group activities, because the group activities didn't really go in depth into the concepts that were really confusing in class.",
    "Professor Koelle was a strength. He was very engaging and explained concepts in a very precise manner. I thought some of the quizzes could be based more on applications of concepts rather than regurgitation of knowledge.",
    "I honestly thought this was a really well designed course. Great learning material. I ever once used the textbook so we might not need to buy that.",
    "All students have the option to write their quizzes with either pen or pencil; pen allows you to have a teaching assistant regrade it if you desire, but pencil is recommended. That was extremely frustrating, especially when a teaching assistant other than my discussion section leader would grade our quizzes and take off points for seemingly no reason (my discussion section leader confirmed that there was nothing incorrect in my answer at all). Just because I did the quiz in pencil, I wasn't able to get these lost points back, which was a little frustrating.",
    "This course does well to apply knowledge to real concepts such as applying cellular processes at the molecular level to real scenarios and showcasing research that applies these concepts such as research on developing a drug for HIV. On the other hand, the course does not give much incentive to actually do textbook readings unlike Biology 102 which requires students to do the readings in order to complete assignments due before each lecture. While we are college students that should have our own initiative to do readings for classes, being an introductory course makes Bio101 a good place to help cultivate student initiative to do tasks such as readings before lectures. Some students, especially first-years, may have yet to develop such a skill, so some incentive to do the reading assignments would potentially be more ideal.",
    "The weekly quizzes are good to make sure you reviewing lecture material every week, but it does result in a good amount of studying every week. Professor Koelle is a pretty good lecturer and I liked his lectures and they were very informative.",
    "The timed weekly quizzes can be really stressful but there are a lot of measures for evaluation other than the final which is great.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the BIOL 101 module because I felt like I learned so much new information within such a short frame of time. My one major problem with the course was the disconnect between the attitude taken by the teaching team towards learning in the course versus grading in the course. Professor Koelle put on a big show about how the course would encourage students to think and \"become scientists,\" but when it came time to grade our homework, quizzes, and exams, the teaching staff did not keep this same mentality. Graded activities were worded so poorly that at times I, or my fellow classmates, couldn't even figure out what the question was. Points were deducted for not using certain phrases even if they had been used previously within the correct context or if the concept had been described in all but the \"vocabulary words.\" This style of grading is extremely disheartening and frustrating as a student to encounter because I feel like I could not fully demonstrate the knowledge I had gained in a meaningful way.",
    "Strengths: smoothly run and course content was very organized, engaging professor and TA, great peer tutors, you get a drop in each grading category \r\nWeaknesses: unnecessarily picky grading (you will get docked if you understand the concept but dont include a specific phrasing or key word)",
    "The lectures are very interesting and information well taught. The quizzes fee pretty high stakes as there arent many but thats seemingly unavoidable given the length of the course",
    "It felt very self motivated at times which proved to be difficult for me",
    "This course was incredibly frustrating to take because it was possible to understand all of the material and still do poorly on the assignments. The Teaching Scholars were not particularly helpful and sometimes even made things more confusing. The grading standards seemed unnecessarily specific and didn't contribute at all to my learning the material - it just made the course more stressful and in all, it was really disappointing to have to spend so much time memorizing the lecture slides and picking over specific wording instead of really learning.",
    "The lectures can be tough to sit through and I often felt like the homework and quizzes would have been much more manageable if it was taught in a smaller setting. However, this is obviously a difficult problem and besides that I thought the class was very well taught.",
    "I thought the lectures were extremely beneficial and well prepared. However, I think the enrichment sections could be more structured. Instead of just going over the content covered in lecture again, it would be helpful to learn or evaluate the material in a different way.",
    "I think the material covered was basic biology. I like the format of weekly quizzes to keep us on track. The lectures were fine. They went kind of fast, but I reviewed the lecture slides later.",
    "The slides were not very clear or well organized. At times, the \"professor challenges the class\" segment took too much time away from the actual lecture. The phrasing of questions on quizzes and exams were more confusing than they needed to be.",
    "A weakness of the course was that the lectures feel very long and often drag on which can make them a little boring. A strength of the course was that it didnt test too much unnecessary information without detracting from the challenging nature of the class.",
    "I think the lectures could be more interesting and clearer.",
    "They claim this course is designed as an intro bio course, but it very clearly is so much more difficult for those who came from under funded public schools, or those who just did not take bio, or those who were weaker in prior biology knowledge. Some people are basically retaking this course. I did not know it was normal for some students to be \"bored\" in class as the professor stated, while others struggled with the class, did all the readings, went and paid attention to lectures, did homework on time, went to peer tutoring. At the same time some students felt it was a course they could put little energy into and still get an A.",
    "The course was fast-paced and work-intensive. However, the instructor and TFs were helpful.",
    "There needs to be a faster return rate on homework and assignments so we can learn from mistakes before taking a test.",
    "The course could be improved by allowing for more engagement between students and the teacher or students and the teaching fellows.",
    "Lectures are interesting and certainly worth attending, and my only issue is that sometimes we did not complete the lecture slides. This tended to\r\nbe because students gave a number of non-beneficial questions or answers, leading us to spend too much time on Q&A or segments like Professor challenges the class. Assessments are an appropriate difficulty and the questions themselves are all meant to be answerable. Grading is almost always reasonable, and the homework, although of a difficulty higher than any of the assessments, is nice as a capstone for the previous weeks material, and requires thoughtful effort. Auxiliary sessions like discussion, peer tutoring, and Enrichment were all very helpful for my review and made me feel more confident in my mastery of the topics going into a quiz.",
    "I really liked how the lecture slides were posted online and also found the homework and discussion sections to both be very helpful in my understanding of the material. However, I found the reading to be a bit daunting and the textbook to go into much further detail than the information that we were required to know for the class.",
    "The course offers many resources to succeed. However, not being able to get homework\/quiz feedback quickly made it harder for me to study.",
    "Lecture was actually quite interesting and Professor Koelle kept it so by regularly including professor challenges the class questions",
    "I think grading should be done on more of a do you understand the content basis rather than simply looking for the repetition of exact phrases from lecture.",
    "Strengths: very comprehensive review of biochem, provides a solid foundation, a lot of information assimilated very quickly. \r\nWeaknesses: too much is left unexplained.",
    "Faster feedback on homework would help us study",
    "Strengths - very organized, lectures posted before hand, amazing peer tutors, great reviews\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - doesn't foster as much collaboration as I'd like, but the sections were great",
    "I loved this course but maybe the quizzes could have gone on for longer.",
    "This course was especially strong in its high level of organization and in all of the resources it offers students to succeed. I especially found Piazza helpful in being able to ask questions at any time. It helped me develop skills in learning to ask questions when I dont understand something and how to ask them so someone can fully understand them. The regular peer tutoring sessions were also very helpful in reviewing and making sure I knew what I should specifically study.",
    "Lectures got a little boring. Can be improved by having lectures recorded.",
    "The professor is great and really engaging. Weakness would be how rushed everything is.",
    "This course provides a strong foundation for a student entering any biological field. Since it is challenging, many people will have to work together to succeed. \r\n     The grading was difficult to figure out (I never figured it out). Though the course is \"designed to be accessible to students with varying backgrounds in biology,\" that disparity was very apparent. Furthermore, when students ask to be in enrichment, if they have a logical reason, there should be a way for them to get help. For example, I applied and did not get a spot in enrichment at the beginning of the term. Two weeks later, I get an invitation to join after doing poorly on the first two quizzes. I knew my preparation was inadequate, yet I still didn't get a spot until my grade was severely affected. This illustrates my last point in that there should be more than one introductory biology course. The other two major sciences (and many other STEM departments) have multiple introductory courses so that students can enroll in the course that they feel prepared for. However, since there is only one biology course and it is (definitely) scaled upward (i.e. made to target the more advanced student), those with a weaker background in biology are put at a disadvantage from the start. This setup may be more favorable to the professors and the university, but it is supposed to be most favorable to the STUDENT.",
    "The Peer Tutors were extremely helpful, and I liked how the class was not pure memorization but actually enforced practical application of concepts.",
    "The course is very detailed and covers a lot of material. However, the lecture format can be a little tedious\/boring at times.",
    "I think they could have explained the basic concepts more and not assumed we all took AP Biology. Also, the remedial class could have bee made available to more people because I was denied placement in it.",
    "The weaknesses are that it is a lecture and that it suffers due to information overload. It is good because it has tons of sources to learn from outsiude of class",
    "I disliked the quiz format. I feel that it placed way too much stress throughout the course. I was more worried each lecture about the upcoming quizzes than actually absorbing the material",
    "The course was quite well organized, with weekly quizzes that weren't too stressful but ensured that I retained information over the course of the class, and the format of lectures, with key concepts and study guides on Canvas, was also useful. Nothing in particular needs to be improved, I think.",
    "The in-class quizzes were a strength of this course, as they helped prepare us for the format of the final exam. The discussion section, although generally a good idea, ended up being somewhat pointless as the TF was inexperienced.",
    "The strengths of this course include the weekly quizzes and discussion section activities. The homework also clarified any confusion. This course could be improved by making the actual lecture a little more exciting and interactive.",
    "The lecture is too long and the professor spent too much time on trying to engage the students rather than explaining the concepts.",
    "I'd say the strengths of the course is that it is critical to other biology knowledge and therefore very foundational and basic, but it's presented in an interesting way which makes it interesting to learn.\r\nOn the other hand, the lecture is thoroughly uninteresting, and the exams look for exceedingly arbitrary and specific phrases. I would recommend, although this would probably be quite difficult, breaking up the main lecture into purely section based learning like many of the intro math courses are taught. Another recommendation would be to have the placement exam be more representative of the content, but that could just be me being salty.",
    "The course was organized really really well. Sometimes, the material wasn't explained as clearly as it shouldve been.",
    "While I understood why we had weekly quizzes Wednesday, I thought that it added extra stress during the week, especially how it was timed to 15 min.",
    "Strengths: The course thoroughly covers the basics of biochemistry and biophysics. The course has enrichment options available for students who are either underprepared or overprepared for the course. If a student has never been exposed to the material before, he or she can enroll in Enrichment 1 for extra review. If a student already knows everything, he or she can read the more advanced materials available in Enrichment 2.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses Directly Related to the Course: None. This course has something for everybody.\r\n\r\nWeakness Indirectly Related to the Course: The biology placement exams are rigged. I remember answering all questions on the placement exam perfectly, and yet I was not allowed to place out of BIOL 101. So I had to waste my time taking this course when I could have been taking Chemical Biology instead, just because I didn't place out, and this course is a prerequisite for chemical biology. I already knew all of the material presented in this course 4 years before I took it, and I just sat there bored in lecture, as the same material was presented to me for the THIRD time in my life. When I turned in my final exam, which I did very well on, I knew I could have taken it 3 months earlier and still performed just as well. So whoever is in charge of determining who passes the placement exams, listen up: You are wasting students' time. Time that they can never get back. Not only are you delaying students' educational opportunities for higher level biochemistry courses, but you are delaying their development as researchers. If a student clearly shows that he or she understands the basics of biochemistry on the placement exam, let him or her place out of the course so he or she can access more advanced material sooner. You took my time away from me; don't take more students' time away.",
    "It could be more cohesive",
    "A strength of the course was that the homework assignments effectively complemented what we learned in lecture. A weakness was that we could have covered more lecture material in discussion sections.",
    "The material was good, but the instructor was very boring. Overall the class was very doable.",
    "very accessible help and willing TF\/professor\/peer tutors",
    "A strength is that the professors encourage the students, but honestly they do not prepare you for the quizzes each week. The professor seems to skim, leave out, or briefly explain information that is critical for learning the content. The professor also said not to read the textbook but many of the answers from the quizzes could only be learned from the textbook and not the lecture itself. There were not enough practice sessions. The peer tutors were amazing though they really saved the class.",
    "Too much focus on terms rather than concepts",
    "Strengths - good examples, engaging lectures, lots of opportunities to ask questions. Discussion sections are helpful and interesting. Interesting engagements with primary sources and diseases.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - if you have taken AP Biology, the pace is a bit slow. Much of the content covered in this class is also covered in a good AP Bio class, although this class does provide some solid new perspectives into concepts.",
    "It is quite well organized and I appreciated the creative homework assignments.",
    "The strengths of this course included the general environment of this course. I really liked how the emphasis was on learning the material, and everyone was collaborative. Furthermore, I liked how concepts were stressed over memorizing facts. Professor Koelle, the TFs, and the peer tutors all took the time to explain concepts. The \"professor challenges the class\" question also always had me thinking about how to understand the concepts on a deeper level. My only suggestion for the course is the quizzes, which I felt sometimes were graded based on wording. But, at the same time, I thought this class was generally fair and the comments were always helpful and true.",
    "i think it's a lot easier for people who have taken AP bio, so it could be made a little better at explaining the basics. but it's strong because of the resources it has available if you haven't taken bio before, like enrichment",
    "I would like to improve my ability to keep up with the reading. I found that the lectures were very engaging and taught me a lot. One thing that could be done to improve the course is to make the quizzes online before or after class to give a student time to answer correctly and to the best of their ability.",
    "Lectures went along very well with slides and the information was clear. I wish discussion sections had been a bit more involving.",
    "I think that sometimes lectures felt rushed and topics were not sufficiently reviewed in time for a test. I think that the peer tutoring however was really strong and helped to make up for this.",
    "I think that the discussion sections and peer tutoring were really great to practice and really nail down the concepts. I think that sometimes it can be hard to get a certain level of engagement in a large lecture style class, but I felt like the discussion sections and peer tutoring remedied that.",
    "It is very difficult to take this course if you have not previously had AP Biology. It seems as if the instructors don't quite understand how hard it is to catch up if you are lagging behind, and if you were not previously familiar with much of the terminology. In order to catch up it requires an extreme amount of time (depending on your course load of course), and I felt I simply could not devote myself to the course without sacrificing my own mental health or grades in other classes. That being said, I believe the resources to succeed in this class are available if you have the time. I did not have the time.",
    "The lecture aspect of this course was a weakness, though it is understandable that it could not be avoided. However, that did make it more difficult to engage and follow what was going on in lectures, and I had to try to do almost all of my learning outside of class time. Nonetheless, the availability of teaching fellows and peer tutor hours was very helpful.",
    "The lectures are interesting and the teaching staff is engaging. However, I'm not a fan of how homeworks or assessments are graded - although the questions are clear, the grading criteria are arbitrarily subjective. Often, points will be issued only based on the presence of certain words in answers, even if the question may be fully answered without using those words. Additionally, many of the grading criteria expected students to make strong generalizations about things that were only covered to a limited extent in class, generalizations which are often untrue if more advanced knowledge is considered.",
    "I think going over the quizzes in perhaps a little more time\/depth would help students understand why they got certain points off and how they can further improve. The strengths were that the lectures were efficient in delivering all of the necessary information and the discussion sections helped cement this information.",
    "This class had great discussion sections and I after the first quiz, I felt prepared for the content and testing.",
    "The way the homework was structured was at times very frustrating. My comments were often along the lines of \"too brief or seems rushed,\" but the instructions also made it clear that there was a hard limit on the number of sentences permitted and that answers should be very concise. Since the questions at times could be interpreted to have a few meanings, it was difficult to determine which answer to provide, even if the student had a good grasp of the material. \r\n\r\nI found that the discussion sections were very helpful for clarifying what aspects of the material should be the focus of each week, since the powerpoints were sometimes unclear on exactly what was most important.",
    "strengths - professor Koelle is a decent lecturer, he is good at explaining things and getting through the material even though he is very condescending at times, sections were good at explaining things, I actually appreciated the weekly quizzes because they kept me on top of studying so it wasn't a ton at the end\r\nweaknesses - the homeworks were ridiculous, they would say over and over again to be concise and not say too much but then the answer key had a literal essay written and you would get points off for not explaining enough. I fell asleep pretty much every lecture, but that is also because I had seen pretty much all of the info in AP bio.",
    "I believe the weekly quizzes are not an accurate representation of one's mastery of the material, so I think changing them entirely or partially will help student's engagement. However, the class worked quickly and the flow of the material was a strength, as all the topics branched from each other and provided a smooth transition.",
    "Strengths include material covered in the course and the fairness of the quizzes. Weaknesses include the lack of well-developed homework assignments; the assignments themselves didn't feel engaging enough. To elaborate, in my opinion, the best homework assignments were the ones at the end of the course (i.e. the take a research article and then digest it and eloquently summarize it through answering some questions).",
    "One week point of discussion section is that it seemed to have its own curriculum didn't run completely tangentially with the course and only emphasized points that the instructors felt needed to be reemphasized. I think a better approach would be to review both Monday and Wednesday's lectures, in brief, answer any and all questions about any of the material covered, and then pose questions that force one to apply what was learned. The current system has us focusing on one aspect of a lot of material that is covered and information can fall between the cracks from week to week.   \r\n\r\nOne aspect of the course that was good was that all the information we learned was vital. There were very few tangents that distracted us with superfluous information and lectures were presented in a clear, logical, and concise manner. There was also ample time for questions and class engagement with \"Professor challenges the class.\"\r\n\r\nOne other aspect that should be looked into is the grading system. I understand there are a lot of papers to grade, but many students including myself felt that graders focused so much on looking for key terms in an explanation, that they failed to see a concept\/answer was nonetheless adequately explained and\/or rationalized."

   "comments": [
    "Since it is required for bio majors, yes, but I felt less joy learning biology in this class",
    "If you are a bio major and have to take this course, then you don't really have an option. If you are someone who doesn't have any bio background and wants to learn about bio, I think this would be a very hard class. I can't imagine not having my AP Bio background and trying to take this class because the concepts are simply talked about in lecture and then you do the p-sets and take quizzes and it is fast paced and not very engaging.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in DNA replication or the BIOL sequence",
    "I would if they are interested in science, but mainly because it is a requirement and because it introduces the basics of biochemistry very well. But in being an introductory course, it will breeze over some interesting phenomena and processes.",
    "Sure, you learn a lot",
    "i would only recommend this course if the student has taken AP biology",
    "Most people take this course because it is a requirement for a major\/pre-med. If you just have a genuine interest in biology, try to take something else. (unfortunately, many of the interesting bio classes at yale require you to have completed the bio sequence)",
    "I would recommend the course if I heard it were improved.",
    "If you are interested in biology it is a must. Definitely a large workload, but otherwise okay.",
    "I would recommend this course as a decent introduction to biochemistry, but not if the student has already learned about the subject in AP biology. It is much less in depth than the AP course and does not cover significant new material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I love biology, but I haven't formally studied it since my freshman year of high school. This course did a great job of tackling interesting and cutting edge biology while still being attainable to students at many different levels.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only as required -- not particularly intellectually interesting or challenging, except for the genomics and biotechnology lectures.",
    "Whether you have taken Biology before or not, this is a necessary course for any more advanced biology classes and very well explains the basic concepts and sets you on track for your future STEM career.",
    "Yeah, if you need it as a prereq or major req or just need to refresh your biological knowledge ahead of future bio courses.",
    "It's a fine class, but not something I would recommend taking unless you have to.",
    "It's a prerequisite for basically every biology-related major. It's definitely not a bad course, so I would recommend taking it on sequence.",
    "I would recommend it as it is informative and not overwhelming. It is a fairly simple introductory bio course.",
    "Yes, I would if you need to take the BIO sequence. Otherwise, if you're interested in biology, it's manageable but may not be the most enjoyable science credit to take since there is a lot of associated work.",
    "Yes, if theyre considering pre-med.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only because I think Professor Hartman is a good resource and her enrichment sessions really helped me. Also this course is a prerequisite for pre-medicinal students and students planning to major in MCDB or MBB.",
    "yes.",
    "Decline to answer",
    "If it's required for you to take this class, then there's no other choice. However, even if it's not, I would recommend this class if you're interested in a basic understanding of biology. This class does a good job of laying the groundwork for other biology classes at Yale, even if the professor himself doesn't do a good job of promoting a positive learning environment.",
    "Yes, I feel that I truly walked away learning the material.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in biochemistry and biophysics, this class goes into those topics in great details and you will leave knowing a lot more than before.",
    "Yeah, It was interesting, even to people who might not be taking it as a pre req which most people likely are.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The concepts that we talked about were extremely interesting (at least to me, having very little prior preparation in biology), and the workload was totally doable. Professor Koelle is an excellent lecturer, and his intelligence is evident every time he explains a new topic.",
    "Do not take this unless it is a requirement",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course because it allows you to dip into biology for just one term in order to test out the subject. It teaches essential biology knowledge without being a semester long commitment, which makes it good for those unsure if they would be interested in biology.",
    "If you are interested in biology and\/or want to premed\/BME, you basically have to take this course and it's a pretty good course. I learned a good amount even though I took AP bio in high school. As a potential BME major, I found the content pretty interesting.",
    "If you like biology, this will most likely be a good class for you.",
    "If the student were interested in biology or the life sciences, yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "THE QUIZZES ARE NOT QUIZZES. TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. The quizzes are 15 minutes, but they are counted as 9% of your grade each. That is SIGNIFICANT. TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. If you mess up, ASK WHY!!!!!! This course is short--once you get behind in your grade you can't come back.",
    "Yes. I think it does a good job teaching the basics of biology which are important for everyone to know and understand",
    "Not unless mandatory",
    "No, I would not. If you have placed out of this course do not take it (you most likely won't learn anything new).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The information is fascinating and the teacher was great.",
    "Yes, I thought this served as an excellent pre-rec for any biology major.",
    "I think most people are taking the class for their major requirement or premed requirement, so I would recommend it to them.",
    "Yes especially if they are premed or a Biology major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are considering learning more about biology.",
    "Yes. Need it for bio majors, and the Professor was good.",
    "No, not unless it is a requirement for their major or track. It is much too intensive and harshly graded to take for the sheer pleasure of learning.",
    "I would and have recommended this course to students both interested and uninterested in STEM. As Prof. Koelle asserted in the final lecture, Biochemistry and Biophysics are a basic science, and were I not interested in medicine I would still have enjoyed this course, as I felt that I genuinely gained a better understanding of several aspects of myself in the exploration of topics such as protein folding, enzymes, inhibitors, and viruses.",
    "Yes, I would. I was interested in biology already and found that the course only increased my interest in the material. I thought that the material was taught in an exciting but also accessible manner, so I was able to improve upon my knowledge of the material without feeling overly intimidated or confused while doing so.",
    "I would recommend it if the student has an interest in biology. Otherwise, this course will not be as enjoyable. I had a slightly harder time getting engaged in the course, but I learned a lot about biology and myself. I made the mistake of underestimating the amount of content we would be covering, so my performance was rather inconsistent. If you do decide tot are this course, do not assume it will be easy. It requires its own attention.",
    "Yes, for STEM majors. Important to see how scientific fields overlap and the basic knowledge is needed to be built upon",
    "Yes, I feel like I learned a lot and can carry this knowledge on to more in depth courses.",
    "Absolutely, it is a wonderful foundational basis for biochem. It is also comprehensive.",
    "Absolutely. Great course, great professor, learned lots",
    "Yes! Very engaging, learn what you need to in a fun way, learn how to read scientific papers.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is considering pursuing biology in the future; it is a cohesive introduction to some of the most important underlying principles and processes of the subject.",
    "Pretty good course to get an idea of future bio classes.",
    "Yes. You need it for a bio major or the premed track.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would caution him\/her to be prepared for more than meets the eye. However, this is not going to really influence him\/her because most students take this course for their major or for post-university education (graduate school, medical school, etc.).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone pursuing a science major. It explains a lot of important fundamental concepts and starts to teach skills that are necessary in higher level science courses.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but all pre-meds have to take this class. I don't think it should be taught in a one quarter system.",
    "Only if you need it",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise it is not a class that I would really recommend.",
    "Biology 101 was a pleasant and informative introduction to the bio sequence, so I would recommend it to any student who's interested in biology or needs the bio sequence as a prerequisite.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to any other student interested in taking a science class and learning an introduction to important biological concepts. Although the course was a lot of work for someone who had little to no background in biology, it was very rewarding towards the end of the half of the semester.",
    "No. The lecture is not structured well.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it as a fun class or a science class for non-majors, but the information is necessary for future courses in biology, so I guess there's that.",
    "Yes, it's necessary for pre-med and not that bad of a course.",
    "Yes, it is a good intro to the biology sequence and seems like a good foundation for more science (especially life science) at Yale",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. As an introductory course, I think that Bio 101 helped me prepare better and develop basic study skills.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures are very clear and well-organized. There are enrichment readings available for students who feel underprepared or overprepared. The homework is quick and easy. The tests are quick and easy. This course was the easiest course I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes because it teaches basic biology",
    "If a student wants to gain a good foundation in biology, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, the class wasn't bad, and it should not be a deterrent from going into a major like EVST or something.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to someone else unless they needed it as a prerequisite. It is a very stressful and poorly taught class and is probably not the best introduction to STEM or biology.",
    "If you plan on doing something bio-related in the future, this is a pre-req, so there's not much choice. If you're looking to learn biology for the first time, though, I would recommend this class - it has a good pace that's fast without being overwhelming if you've never seen the material before, and there's always a lot of support if you ever need it.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned so much about basic biology. Even though I have taken biology classes before, this class helped solidify what I knew and challenged me to think more deeply. I still learned new material, and I believe I will be using what I have learned in future classes.",
    "I mean you have to take it so",
    "I would recommend a student this course if they are interested in the Biology field as it is a prerequisite for many majors and is an interesting class.",
    "Yes, I think it was a really interesting course and I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "This is a good course to solidify some basic overarching ideas. Obviously, some people are taking the class just to fill the requirement, but I think that it is entirely possible to get a lot out of this course. If you put effort into getting something out of the course, then you will.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from taking this class, and the material was very interesting.",
    "Yes I would because regardless of any flaws, it provided very important background information that was also interesting in and of itself.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is comfortable with the subject of biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course helps develop basic biology skills, including reading scientific papers, and refreshes on the main themes of biology taught in high school.",
    "It was a great experience getting an introduction to biology. There was not much pressure on memorization, which freed up energy for truly learning the basic concepts and tenants of biology that will help us as students progressing through the sequence and other science courses.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have not taken a sufficiently difficult high school biology course. However, I feel the placement test and the course did not exactly line up--for me, the learning curve in this case was figuring out how to answer questions in this course, not acquiring very much new information. I feel I could have passed the final based on prior knowledge without taking the course if I had known the correct way to approach questions. I do not mean to say this new way of thinking is not very valuable for my education, but I do not think the course was necessary to acquire it.",
    "It's a requirement, so it doesn't really matter",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they need the requirement for pre-med or another STEM major. It is definitely interesting, but the workload and time commitment may be a lot for someone's schedule. This course was definitely a priority of mine throughout the first half-semester.",
    "Yes if they want a great way to enter the vast field of biology; a nice summary of the introductory topics found in biology, while also gaining some crucial skills necessary to further one's career in biology.",
    "I would recommend this if it required or if you really care about the subject. The course is not bad, just a little slow and some of the information seems unnecessary. If you intend to take further biology courses, then yes, absolutely take this course and it will be helpful. If this is the only bio course you plan on taking, I would suggest that you reconsider your plans.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it gives a good foundation on the biology necessary to understand some of the new innovations coming through today."
