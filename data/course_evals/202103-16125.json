I learned how to easily develop and articulate a conversation with a lower level of Spanish proficiency. We also learned about different Spanish-speaking countries and did research to find more about them throughout the year. Through each lesson, there was a purpose that was connected to how to use Spanish in our day-to-day life.",

                "Overall, I really liked how this course was done and I really liked my professor, Professor Asensio. I think it goes pretty fast but it is manageable.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the units that are taught because all the vocabulary and lesson plans are relevant to how we would need to use Spanish in the real world. Another strength would be the amount of speaking, writing and listening is balanced and developed in the course because it trains the student to solely focus their brain on learning the language."
