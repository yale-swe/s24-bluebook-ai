I learned how to easily develop and articulate a conversation with a lower level of Spanish proficiency.

Through each lesson, there was a purpose that was connected to how to use Spanish in our day-to-day life.",

Another strength would be the amount of speaking, writing and listening is balanced and developed in the course because it trains the student to solely focus their brain on learning the language."
