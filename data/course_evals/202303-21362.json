You'll learn a lot!\r\nWeaknesses -- none really, although the final project can be a little difficult since it requires you to engage with very high-level sociogenomics research that can be hard to understand.",
                "The instructor was a great strength to the course as her interest and enthusiasm for both, the content and teaching, really came through. It also really helped that it was a smaller class size which enabled free conversation and insightful discussions. The assignments were also a great way for checking our learning at each level of the class. The independent coding at the beginning of the class, especially in PLINK was a little tricky but I was able to catch up after some time. It would also be helpful if the class was recorded, in case we were unable to attend a class and wanted to catch up after. Overall, it was a great class, I learned so much from it and the instructor was incredible."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class - to both students from Yale college as well as graduate students. The field has wide ranging implications and could be of interest to individuals studying policy, sociology, public health, genomics, chronic diseases, law, etc. Every student will have a lot to learn from this nascent and upcoming field."
