                "The strength was the in-class activities, which were always varied and interesting. Janice had a distinct plan and activities for each class, which was amazing, because we had class every weekday. I thought one weakness were the projects/presentations, which could've been a little more interesting.",
                "This course excels at giving you everything you need to know to succeed in the language. I spent a lot of time outside of class watching videos/films/shows in German and reading in German and chatting with people at German events (essentially just immersion) and I found myself immediately using new vocabulary (because it was so common and useful) and the grammar I learned quickly explained new structures I frequently encountered. The textbook isn't great though imo; I would have liked more opportunities to actually drill the grammar and the textbook exercises didn't help me all that much. Also if you have a good understanding of the language (not in terms of writing just actual comprehension) the A1 Nico's Weg videos will feel very tedious.",
                "I think that the Quizlets are a big strength in the class because we are made to drill vocabulary over and over on our own time so that we are still learning it but not within class time, since classes are pretty short. I think more emphasis on grammar and verbs and declensions would have been helpful because I never felt like I really had a good grasp on it. Some of that was because I wasn't putting in the time to study it outside of class, but I would have appreciated class time with it. We had a boot camp at the end which was helpful but I would have liked to learn more about grammar earlier.",
                "I really enjoyed this class - especially taking it with Janice. It made every morning an engaging and exciting one."

                "Overall yes I would recommend it to a student who was self-motivated to learn German. You will get out of this course what you put into it.",
                "I've not taken any other language classes at Yale but I've taken two years of Latin (with two different teachers) and eight years of Spanish (with five different teachers) and this is by far the best language course I've ever taken. The pace was VERY fast so do keep that in mind, but if you're interested and invested in learning German as I was it will not be an issue. It really does cover everything you need to know to understand basic German, but you have to put in the work to make sure you understand/remember everything that was taught to you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! They should be warned that the workload is very intense, however. I appreciated that there was leniency regarding turning things in on time, but if I got behind, sometimes I would have to do nearly 10 assignments in a row and it could take 7 hours. It often felt like busy work just for the sake of doing it, and not something that stimulated learning. But I enjoyed the class very much."
