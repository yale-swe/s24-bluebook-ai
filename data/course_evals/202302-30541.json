It was fantastic to be able to piece together folklore, religion, and history into every art piece we were analyzing I also learned how to analyze films through weekly response papers and how to improve my writing.",

                "I liked all of the visits we had in being able to experience artwork in person and being able to go to different churches and cathedrals. I also liked how the class was spread out in terms of watching films, analyzing them, and visits. However, some of the visits did get exhausting at points because were constantly traveling. This was especially the case towards the end of the program when people were feeling ill due to the heat and there weren't enough accommodations to help them be able to miss out on visits. I also wish that this class was more seminar style because most of the time it was Professor Marcus talking and us answering her questions. I really wanted to be able to have in-class discussions and hear everyone else's thoughts, but it was mostly us just answering questions and Professor Marcus talking for the rest of the time.",
                "The course could have more in class discussions of art and more paced out class trips.  The course also needs to have more accessibility worked in, what with the excessive heat, stairs, and long distances to walk.",
                "Confusing trajectory",
                "the strengths were that it was very engaging and we learned something new everyday, the weaknesses were that it could've been more student led and discussion based."

                "I would recommend it if they want a better sense of appreciating Italian and Tuscan culture when studying abroad, but I would take this with a grain of salt because there are inaccuracies in this course. Professor Marcus would sometimes confuse saints together, give biblical inaccuracies, or sometimes give u films and materials that truly don't represent Tuscan identity.",
                "i would definitely reccomed this course, even if taken outside of Italy, learning about all of this stuff was very fascinating.",
                "I think that this course was an important aspect of the study abroad program and provided important cultural context for the experience. Most of the class was interesting to me and the workload never felt too overwhelming. However, it did sometimes feel like the topics we were focusing on did not feel like the most important things to focus on."
