                "I learned a variety of strategies to approach a variety of situations. I built up a knowledge of methods to strategies game solutions.",
                "Through taking ECON 159, I was able to learn important and real-world applications of game theory principles to better approach negotiation and strategy. We learned concepts such as backward induction, prisoners' dilemma, imperfect information, and infinitely repeated games.",
                "Strategic thinking, the basics of game theory, being rational in our actions, how to calculate making good decisions, the outcomes of calculating our decisions, how different starting points and rules impact outcomes in games, and so much more. The class gives you a great idea of how you can look into the future and work backwards to take the most intelligent steps (backwards inductions). We also came to better understand why our \"payoffs\" (aka what a certain outcome means\/is worth to us) are important when we make choices - as well as others' payoffs. At the end of the day, I felt like I learned too much to list! I loved it.",
                "I learned how to train my intuition to understand strategic situations more effectively.",
                "this course will boost your thinking and logic skills SO MUCH. it taught me how to receive information and order it concisely and then form a logical reasoning process. also, i understood many phenomena better, thanks to the wide range of fields our game were applied to (politics and elections, tennis games, investments, education...)",
                "This class stretches you to think logically and strategically. It doesnt emphasize advanced math (although there is some single-variable calc), but broadly emphasizes how to think strategically. Its useful to understand how firms and individuals make decisions.",

Beyond that, learned a lot about how to think via backward induction to try to logic through \"if he does this and I do that, then what will they do, so how should I preempt that.\" Super interesting. Also, how to gain intuition and then go about proving it.",
                "This course was an incredible introduction to the topics and applications of game theory, from simple Nash Equilibrium to backwards induction to auction theory. Basic econ intuition is helpful but not required for a deep understanding of the content.",

It is cool to solve some of the games (specifically at the end of the course) and realize you are analyzing the real world to a surprising degree.",

I also developed problem solving skills that help me go beyond mere (false) intuitions, such as guessing-and-checking then generalizing the results, or considering the anticipated changes of others' behavior before changing one's own.",

While the math was relatively simple, I appreciated the complexity of some of the questions and how we were taught to be patient and address subgames or try out different numbers to slowly get to an answer.

                "I very much disliked how the midterm was designed so that we would not finish, especially since game theory is a subject that benefits from careful critical thinking, and the professors could have made a rule that no one could leave until the exam period ended. \r\nAlso, I wish section expectations had been clearer. I thought TAs merely went over the psets, whereas it turned out that in later sections they began reviewing lecture material.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic, engaging lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of psets but they dont take a ton of time, sections",
                "Wish I had more time to spend on the PSETs, but the class was great.",
                "I would like some more examples to have been given to bridge theory with actual numbers. The games used as examples in class kept it engaging.",
                "I enjoyed taking this course as the course, despite it being a large lecture, was made very interactive by the professors. The material was presented effectively by the two professors.",
                "The curriculum of the course relates to real life and often includes humor, which is great. The problem sets were challenging but manageable and certainly worthwhile. The lecture was super engaging. The professors and TA's were approachable and easily accessible. The midterm was reasonable as well. The curve is perfect. I think sometimes terminology itself gets confusing - the concepts will make sense, but when we give a concept a term (ie. SPE), I would get lost not knowing what the words meant. Maybe they could've drilled those more. Besides that, I loved how interactive and fun this class was. I wish they hadn't left the midterms to pick up all the way at SOM.",
                "Great class, great lecture",
                "Professor Polak is super entertaining, Professor Deb explains things clearly, and playing games in class is engaging",
                "strength: professor Polak! there's a reason why he's taught this course for years, he is incredible smart and funny and engaging. the course is huge and yet you always feel engaged--it's one of those classes where you definitely want to go in person! The games are super fun and they make you understand the material very well. Weakness: the midterm was unnecessarily time crunches. They said they designed it so that we wouldn't finish it so that people would not stand up and leave during the exam but 1) why then not the same rule for the final? and 2) what's the point of having us not stress out with people leaving if we stress out more about not being able to do our best on the exam? For that reason, I don't think the midterm was a good metric. Also, it would make a lot more sense--as a lot of my friends agreed on--if they graded the psets (where you can get help and have more time) more harshly and the exams less harshly since you have way less time and can do it alone. most people get 10\/10 on their psets so basically it doesn't really affect your grade on the curve that much and I think the effort on the psets should be counted more.",
                "Strengths: not too heavy workload (Psets are manageable); good TFs and Professors, interesting games presented during lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I attended section regularly, but it was usually just going over the Pset. I feel it could be more collaborative if the Pset solutions were posted in advance, so we could discuss the hardest parts of the problems with the TF. Also, I think Psets could be worth more if they were graded more like exams, making the overall grade less dependent on exam performance.",
                "Strengths: lectures (especially by Polak) are super engaging. Lots of opportunities to \"play\" the games. Even more fun if you're sitting next to a friend to compare. Learning objectives are very clearly laid out at the start, and the important takeaways are very obviously emphasized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not that there's any fix to this, but sometimes, by necessity, we had to do some math and proofs, which were a little less fun, but definitely a little less fun. Also some of the lectures (more often the ones taught by Deb) were a little less fun.",
                "Lectures were quite engaging because you were often participating in a game, but the major takeaways were not organized very well to help connect between different topics. You understood each game in isolation, but it was harder to bring the class together.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were easy to follow, and Deb and Polak did an incredible job at building up from simple intuition (or the contradiction thereof) to a more complex model that accurately describes behavior in competitive situations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been helpful to have the solutions to the problem sets posted for us to check answers, especially during exam time. Also, sections could have been better served as a time to review tricky martial from the week and work on practice problems as opposed to simply reviewing parts of the problem set that were submitted hours before (such that students didn't yet know where their answers were wrong)",
                "Strengths: Prof Polak and Pro Deb are super great lecturers, they explain everything so clearly and classes are interactive with small games and polls. The TA team is also very helpful with psets and explaining concepts. \r\nWeakness: it's not an easy class, in this semester only 1\/6 ppl get As, 1\/3 get A-s, so you'll likely be putting a lot of effort into this class if you want to do well.",
                "Strengths - Lectures are fantastic, very fun to attend and very well taught. You are very well prepared for exams and problem sets from lectures. \r\n\r\nWeakness - this is a great class!",
                "Strengths: Classes were very engaging. Ben Polak's lectures were stellar. \r\nWeaknesses: At times, problem sets were not challenging enough. It would have been fun to be asked to solve new games during the problem sets rather than replicating games we already solved in class with different numbers.",
                "This course was incredible. The lectures were fantastic and the course content is very interesting, though difficult.",
                "Strengths: This course built upon itself very well, and provided a solid progression wherein someone with only cursory knowledge of course concepts could solve complex, multilayered problems by the end. The conclusions that the games reach are applicable outside of game theory itself, and seeks to provide insightful social commentary. The professors are clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, and this shows both during the engaging demonstrations they hold in lectures and the flipped classroom sessions they hold every week for one problem on the pset. \r\nWeaknesses: Although office hours are generally helpful, they are only held in short 55 minute blocks, which are inadequate for truly understanding the solutions of the pset. In addition, the midterm and final are weighted highly and psets comparatively too little, which makes the former rather stressful to deal with.",
                "The rotation of professors was a bit unorthodox - thankfully there wasn't a disparity between Professor Polak and Professor Deb. I learned just as well from either of them. \r\n\r\nStrengths - plenty of help sessions, weekly PSET problem walk-throughs, great lecturers who, even though they've been teaching the same class for decades, still are enthusiastic about the material.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Huge class. Probably should have been in Marsh.",
                "The course is a good introduction to game theory. There is generally a lot of redundancy across the economics introduction classes: intro micro, intermediate micro, game theory. I think the department could better organize them to prevent overlap or eliminate requirements. Cournot competition, for example, appears over and over in basic form.",
                "Strengths: It's exciting to come to class. We play games and have fun. The P-sets are challenging and interesting but not excessively long or tedious. Also, both instructors are amazing, especially Ben! But Joyee too she's great. Weaknesses: Idk I can't really think of any. Tbh Hmm, maybe I don't think the course NEEDS the mathematical complexity it sometimes has..",
                "This is the best Economics course I've taken at Yale. The content is really interesting and the problem sets can actually be fun to do. There's lots of help available to students to do well in the class, including professors and TAs going over questions on the problem set before it's due. Also optional discussion sections after assignments are due to review the problem sets. The Professors are extremely funny and engaging (Polak is a gem at Yale). The class is extremely well structured and taught. No weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the professors. However, a weakness is that it sometimes becomes a memorization class in terms of knowing all the games. I think it would be helpful if we didnt have to memorize all the games for the exams. I also think discussion sections where we revisit concepts would be helpful.",
                "I believe that the course was very engaging for a lecture course as Professor Polak and Deb would always be involving the class in example games through volunteers or Poll Everywhere. I do wish that the answers to problem sets were posted and that sections went beyond simply going over the week's problem set.",
                "The course was formatted very well, it didnt move too fast or too slow and there was many office hours and opportunities to engage with the material outside of the course.",
                "Could be improved by posting solutions to problem sets after theyre due. I was frustrated by how high-value the exams are and how low stakes the problem sets were. I would have preferred slightly more harshly graded problem sets to 1) encourage learning throughout the semester and 2) take some stress of the shoulders of students who understand the material but arent the best\/fastest test takers",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak and Professor Deb are both great instructors. Weaknesses: there are no solutions to the problem sets so it's hard to learn from them. Sections would cover that week's problem sets but oftentimes, the tf wouldn't be able to finish going through the entire pset.",
                "The lectures were really engaging, and the games and practical applications discussed in class really helped make the material easier to understand",
                "strength: topic is super fun \r\nweakness: exam doesn't really align with what we learn in Psets. format is unpredictable",
                "Very well structured course overall. TA feedback on problem sets was a little vague and unhelpful at times but definitely understandable given the number of students in the class.",
                "i think ben is absolutely fantastic. whenever he was the instructor i knew that it would be a great class and that i would be able to understand the concepts. unfortunately whenever professor deb was instructing, those were always my weakest subjects, as she doesnt do a terrific job of explaining the material, and using examples that are useful. professor polak has a great understanding for which parts of a concept a novice would find confusing and going in depth on those aspects, professor deb not so much and it showed, especially since for some reason they gave professor deb some of the particularly hard concepts to teach. i would also suggest that we get more in depth comments on our psets, for me they usually were a sentence long, if there at all which wasnt very useful for studying for the exams.",
                "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Polak is a huge strength. No weaknesses",
                "Ben Polak is an amazing lecturer and a strength of this course. The material, slides, and exam prep materials are extremely well organized. I also just liked the content! The PSets were quite hards, though.",
                "The course itself with lectures and recordings was very well conducted and highly engaging. I believe that the sections, which were conducted to review PSETS, were less helpful than expected.",
                "The content of the class was very well taught and engaging. I can't think of any suggestions for improvement off the top of my head.",
                "make sections reviewing the material rather than just giving pset answers -- often the TA's explained it very poorly",
                "Strength: engaging classes that are recorded\r\nWeakness: not enough practice problems",
                "The professors and tas were great, and the information was presented in a clear, organized fashion. In terms of weaknesses, I wish more practice was provided for students. I sometimes felt like I wanted practice besides the problem sets, and even when I asked tas if they have any more resources, there wasnt really much offered. I think offering optional practice problems here and there would have helped me significantly.",
                "This was a fantastic course. I always looked forward to attending lectures; I especially enjoyed playing live games. The problem sets and exams allowed me to apply class material to interesting, real-world games.",
                "This course is so good! Professor Deb and Polak are amazing lecturers and classes are so fun and engaging. Sometimes we dont have time to go through entire PSETS in section though so I wish we had access to PSET answers if we go to section.",
                "The lectures were very clear and engaging, the weekly flipped classes were extremely helpful and the problem sets were challenging but (mostly) not impossible. Not being able to drop 1 problem set was probably the classes biggest weakness.",
                "Strengths: well taught, covers lots of complex topics, games in class, improves your logical skills\r\nWeaknesses: easy to fall behind if you dont attend class so make sure you do that\/watch the recording",
                "polak > deb imo",
                "Amazing",
                "Very engaging class, no issues",
                "I wish the feedback for psets was clearer.",
                "This is a great course with two very engaging professors.",
                "Strengths: Professors Polak and Deb are both amazing and I cannot recommend them highly enough. The weekly problem sets are manageable, fun, and help you learn the material. Weaknesses: The TA team is half good, half bad look for Tim Hersey and David Bishop! Also, the notorious intro econ departmental curve lol",
                "Strengths: Bens lectures (HUGE strength)\r\nWeaknesses: Joyees lectures, problem sets that are too difficult",
                "Amazing course, only thing I would have liked is answers to problem sets.",
                "Strength: great lectures who are great at what they do, and some amazing TAs\r\nWeaknesses: this class is interesting, but if you are not interested in delving deeper into game theory, you will be putting in a lot of work for almost no reward. Its not a very fulfilling class if you are not already interesting in the topic (ie dont take this just because the idea of game theory sound fun and you want an engaging elective)",
                "The strengths of this course would probably be the professors in this course, they are what kept students coming to lecture. Having activities and different games in class made the class go by and the material stick in my brain better; the lectures being recorded also helped as well to review material. No weaknesses for me, it was a great class.",
                "Professor Polak is definitely an advantage to the course; he is very engaged in teaching and makes the lectures well worth attending. The games are a great way to give practical examples of the concepts we are learning in class, and makes the large lecture feel interactive. Overall, the content and the way it is delivered makes this class well worth taking.",
                "Strengths: Well thought-out and structured, as most intro econ courses are, with fun and engaging games and plenty of support if you wanted it.\r\nWeaknesses: Answers to p-sets should be posted online during reading week",
                "great course very engaging",
                "This was a phenomenal course. Well organized and engagingly taught. A good amount of material. I would have appreciated a few suggestions for further exploration at the end of the coursee.g. relevant books, other equilibria we didn't get to cover, etc. I do plan to take the \"Applications\" half-course in the future.",
                "Could use more practice exams before the final. Not getting an answer key for the psets made them not very useful when it came to studying. They went over them during the discussion section but it would have been nice to have an official answer key. The comments on the psets were general, not helpful and also very hard to access.",
                "The problem sets and exams were a lot harder than the contents in the course but the professors did a good job of breaking down the basics.",
                "The course was very very interesting! It was very engaging, well structured, and well taught. I really enjoyed it!",
                "Strength: strong lecturers and clearly structured psets\r\nWeakness: the pset submission system is weird, and I cant see clear feedback on the pset itself",
                "Strengths: Benjamin was really, really engaging, lectures were always fun and content was super interesting.",
                "The instructors and TFs are very passionate about game theory, which makes it much more engaging. The content of the actual course is very difficult to understand for many. I do feel that the lecture material was much easier than the psets, so office hours participation is much needed for psets. The exams are also very difficult. Polak makes lecture very enjoyable however.",
                "The lectures are fun and engaging. Perhaps one weakness is that I didnt find the discussion sections where we reviewed the Psets very useful.",
                "The class was very engaging and interesting but difficult.",
                "The content does tend to be quite difficult so staying on top of each topic and the relevant questions is often tricky. Maybe a method of having review sessions during the term, rather than just before exams, would be great",
                "Great course. No further comment",
                "There's a lot of support on the PSETS and exams, especially with the flipped classroom and office hours.",
                "Instructors were awesome. Polak and Deb know how to teach and class is genuinely enjoyable and interesting (at the very least, the first halves are). Look forward to playing games in class!",
                "Strengths: QR credit, interesting, good level of challenge (if youre a logical thinker), not too much work.\r\nWeaknesses: in reality, only applicable in specific situations",
                "Very understanding professors who are capable of making a lecture engaging. They make game theory make sense.",
                "The support was accessible but not proactive",
                "This course was very well organized. Despite being a lecture, it gave students lots of opportunities for individual or small-group learning, through weekly discussion sections and flipped classrooms, as well as frequent review sessions.",
                "Strengths: Definitely lectures. There was a lot of content, made evidently clear when we were revising for the final. However, when looking over the notes I remembered a lot of the information quickly, I'm sure because they were taught very well. I appreciated the transitions between the 'boring' definitions and important conceptions, and their clear distinction from the applications and different games. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Structure of PSets and Sections. Much of this was my fault, but I also felt discouraged to put in ample time in the psets as everyone was getting almost-full \/ full marks just for completing the problem set. Additionally, as one of the solutions was always clearly on the flipped classroom, everyone I knew would wait until the recording was posted to do the pset, which meant we all spent little time crammed on a Wednesday night, which didn't help to retain the skills and information. Sections then just went over the answers we had already seen \/ just done, whereas I think it may be better to cover concepts from lecture instead."

                "Yes definitely. Game theory is so cool and helps you understand how individuals interact, but also how large corporations or countries interact.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about strategizing for a variety of fields. It is not an easy course for those with no background in it, but it is definitely worth it if you are interested in the material.",
                "Yes! The applications of game theory are really meaningful to learn, and I had a wonderful time in the course.",
                "I'd recommend this course. Profs and TA's are great (\/there for you), concepts are fascinating, and class is fun and interactive. Show up, go to office hours, sit in the front, and participate. It's worth the energy. Class teaches you how to think strategically in a wide variety of situations. Everyone should learn to think this way. The ideas are applied to real life. I had a great time. Workload is manageable - psets are challenging but thought-provoking and get easier throughout the semester. If you're willing to be engaged, you will be! I enjoyed it.",
                "Yes. Professor Polak is excellent.",
                "yes. useful in life and just a great class",
                "take it with Ben Polak! he makes the course, and especially for a subject like game theory, he makes the whole difference. It's a very very intellectually challenging class but it's fun and rewarding. The time you have to devote to the class is not that much but when you do work on it it's very intense. also, i had to study so much for the final to build the intuition.",
                "Yes, but only if really interested in understanding the material. The course can really creep up on you in difficulty  it starts quite easy, but the last couple weeks of content were some of the hardest weeks for me. Also, the Psets dont take very long, but the exams are tough.",
                "Absolutely. Probably my favorite course I've taken at Yale. Just an absolute blast with super interesting material.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any student that is interested in game theory, decision making, business, or politics! Despite being a lecture, this course was one of the most engaging courses I've taken at Yale, with Deb and Polak making each course feel like a personal masterclass in the basics of game theory.",
                "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. They really taught me an entirely new framework to analyze the world.",
                "YES! It helped me understand what people take into consideration when they are making choices. The class is super engaging, and the things I learned are going to be applicable as I move forward.",
                "Absolutely!! If you are not an econ student, do not be swayed!! This is a fantastic course which has really good lessons both related and unrelated to economics. You want to take a class with Ben Polak and Joyee Deb in your time at Yale ! They are great",
                "One of the most fun classes I have taken at Yale. As long as Ben Polak is teaching it I would certainly recommend taking this course.",
                "Yes, 100 percent. It is a challenge, but it is very rewarding and the content is fascinating and relevant to real life. The course is unique in that the kinds of questions asked are easily understood by people who have never taken the course, but the strategies you learn to approach them will change the way you think about these problems.",
                "Yes! This course has provided a whole dimension for me through which to view the world, both in economics and beyond. The live games played in class make the concepts highly digestible and applicable. It is very rewarding to work through problems and arrive at breakthrough conclusions, although it should be noted that this process takes a lot of time and is often not intuitive (i.e the learning curve is rather steep).",
                "Absolutely. I'm a STEM guy, but took this class because of Professor Polak and Deb. Their commitment to teaching is evident, and the material is interesting and applicable to many fields.",
                "I would not choose to take this class over another class you are interested in unless it is a requirement. If you are good at logic puzzles, you will get this class no problem. If you are not, it will be more challenging, but still doable. I took it as my sixth class, the only time I have taken six classes at Yale, and probably the only time I will. It was manageable.",
                "I cannot recommend this class more. It might be challenging for people without a STEM\/econ background, but I think anyone who is even the least bit capable of math would benefit from taking this course. It taught me how to think and analyze situations in a logical way that is applicable far beyond economics, and the way the class was taught was incredible. Every lecture was engaging and taught me something new about the world. Probably the best class I've taken so far at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! We are always playing games in real life -- breaking it down and building a really precise tool kit of how to analyze strategic actions is incredibly valuable.",
                "Yes please take this course. The best ECON course I've taken at Yale. I didn't enjoy Micro\/Macro, but I stuck with ECON because of game theory. This course is truly a gem at Yale.",
                "yes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to people with strong quantitative skills.",
                "Polak is awesome.",
                "Yes, the course is super interesting and I believe that it is one of the best to take for economic majors as an elective.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in playing some interesting games and has some capacity for logical thinking.",
                "Definitely, but not lightly. Its fun but challenging",
                "Yes! I think it's still a great learning opportunity even though it's hard and challenging.",
                "Yes! I really loved this course. I found the lectures very engaging, and the material was really interesting to me.",
                "yes but might have to c\/d\/f, the mode of thinking required in this course is not for everyone",
                "Yes. Game theory gave me a completely new set of tools for understanding economics and competition. The lectures were engaging and easy to follow and the problem sets were challenging and prepared me effectively for the midterm and final.",
                "If professor polak is teaching the class absolutely. hes hilarious, and really teaches very well. i took this course just for a pre req for a major i now am not even going to do anymore and this course is not useful for my new major, but i actually had such a good time with this class. the material is difficult, but again i think i had so much fun because professor polak really made game theory a fun and engaging topic. i wouldnt say i was the best at it, but i wouldnt mind taking another game theory course if i could just be taught by ben.",
                "Absolutely- changed the way I think about problems.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about so much! I felt super engaged in this course, it has a nice curve, and it was fun.",
                "Very much so! You will have to really focus and think hard to work through some of the problems, but the course's structure and support is well suited to helping you through that process.",
                "Yes, the course is incredibly well taught (if Polak & Deb are still the instructors). The material is engaging but not overwhelming, and there is not a ton of work. Great class all around.",
                "Yes. Whole heartedly. Despite not going to class often (159 lectures are rather slow in my opinion), the material is very engaging and applicable. Probably one of the best econ classes at Yale. This made me genuinely interested in exploring game theory further.",
                "Yes, the course will stimulate anyone's problem-solving mind and is very applicable to the real-world.",
                "yes - great professors",
                "Yes, especially if they enjoy logical puzzles or games.",
                "Yes I would. Game theory can be applied to many things besides economics, and has many important lessons relevant to numerous fields. Ive learned to adopt new thinking and reasoning patterns after taking this class, and think many would benefit from taking it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another studentit was highly engaging and well-organized.",
                "Take this class! Esp if youre an econ major. Its more difficult if you dont have a high intuition for puzzles, but you will still learn a ton. Its basically applied micro but more interesting!",
                "Yes, even as a non-econ major, it has changed the way that I approach many situations in my life. A lot of the lessons from game theory are very transferrable to other disciplines, so from a material standpoint, I think that the class is useful. It does require some effort and the class is not a gut, but if you're willing to put in the work, I think that the class if worth it.",
                "Yes if you want to activate the problem solving side of your brain\/improve your logical reasoning, its worthwhile, though it is a bit more econ oriented",
                "YES!!!",
                "I would recommend this class to a student",
                "Yes, it is an amazing course that will change how you think about a variety of topics.",
                "Yes!! This course gave so much fundamental knowledge and was genuinely really interesting.",
                "Yes it is an interesting econ elective and was also made entertaining by the great professors.",
                "Yes. This is a great course for anyone who wants an intro to game theory. The professors are incredibly engaging and have clearly mastered not just the material but how to teach it as well.",
                "Yes I totally would",
                "If you have a passing interest in economics or even just really like problem solving, this is a great course! You learn a lot of different ways to solve and understand problems, often in realistic contexts. The lectures are well-taught and engaging, and also recorded for added flexibility. Plus, you get to play games in class!",
                "Yes! Ben Polak is too amazing to pass up on. Do not miss taking this class.",
                "Yes I would, Ben Polak is amazing.",
                "not if you are looking for an fun engaging elective. Only take this if you are actually interested in putting in the work to solve games and are okay with being utterly confused at the end of every lecture",
                "I would recommend this course for any student, it teaches skills that can be applied in various aspects of your life not revolving around school or work. Not to mention that the professors in this course keep you engaged and make the content fun to learn.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very logic-based, so it is accessible to anyone in any field to take. The class is fair and the teaching is incredible, which makes it worthwhile. Highly recommend to anyone interested in economics, or just curious about how to make decisions.",
                "Yes, but be ready to do math and logic.",
                "I would totally recommend this course to anyone who has a passing interest in game theory and related economics topics. Its a lot of fun to play games in class and challenge your intuitions.",
                "yes very much so, really interesting and practical",
                "Definitely!",
                "Absolutely. One of the most important classes I have taken, with lots of cross-disciplinary and real-world relevance.",
                "Yes especially if you like games",
                "Only if you are an economics major",
                "Yes! It is a very interesting class and you learn a lot, and workload is not too high. It is definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken so far at Yale.",
                "Yes definitely treasure Ben Polak and Joyee Deb",
                "Absolutely - you must take it with Ben!",
                "Yes, especially if you would like a. survey of behavioral economics through games. Sometimes it can be difficult to grasp, but rely on office hours.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone. The required skills to enter the course are little to none, and the subject matter is fascinating. The lectures were delivered in a way that was extremely engaging and clearly showed the experience of the lecturer.",
                "Yes, it is a very intellectually stimulating course.",
                "Yes! Amazing professors but the content is tough.",
                "Yes I highly recommend this course if you want practical, applicable skills and knowledge about decision making that builds onto other subjects and areas of interest.",
                "Take it!! You learn more about the world, strategy, and rock paper scissors. Thumbs up.",
                "Probably. For me, it was a QR credit that involved the kind of logical thinking I enjoy. The p-sets felt like puzzles, and I enjoyed that. Its great if this kind of stuff naturally makes sense to you. However, despite game theory trying to be about lots of different kinds of practical applications, there are in reality a limited number of situations where knowledge from this class would be useful. But if you just want an interesting exploration of logical decision-making and\/or want a QR credit and dont care about it being super practical, go for it!",
                "I absolutely would recommend game theory to other students. It was fun intellectually stimulating, and relatively easy to understand!",
                "Yes! Loved it. It could be easy. I just didnt give it the time it deserved. Go to office hours",
                "Yes! This is a great course that both covers a lot of subject matter and is suitable for beginners.",
                "Yes, 100%. It is very accessible, and while you do need to put in the work to learn the concepts and do well in the class, I think it is an amazingly taught class covering very interesting subject matter and one that you can use even outside a major in economics \/ EP&E etc. It is such a shame that my schedule doesn't allow me to take the follow-on course - I would do so in a heartbeat."
