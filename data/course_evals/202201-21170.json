I would have liked to do more with the Narayan exercise book.",

If you have a hard time being motivated to do work if the content isnt directly related to your interests, youll struggle in this course just like I did lmao. Unless we were doing something that was connected to my thesis, I had a hard time being able to keep up with assignments. There were a lot of assignments and it wasnt always clear why some of them were assigned or which were the most important. I think the course would benefit from us being able to engage more with each others work as well."
