    "I have studied some statistics course by myself, so this course helps me learn data analysis in a more systematic way than before. The combination of computer programming and data analysis is the surprise that I encounter in the course. Thus, the statistical thinking with the aid of computer programming is the most significant skills that I have developed.",

    "I developed my programming skills as I went into this course thinking it was more of a math class, but then realized I had to learn a little programming as well.  I learned many new ways to display data; I was familiar with basic charts such as pie graphs, bar charts, scatterplots, and histograms, but learned about new graphs such as mosaic plots, color gradient scatterplots, and bar charts.",

The course also taught me to master the art of coding (R-Code) which is something I did not expect to come across in a statistics course.

   "comments": [
    "The aid of R programming in the course helps us understand the way in which we can do data analysis effectively. \r\nIn this course, even though I have studied statistics before, some of the problems are still difficult for me to deal with, so I sometimes have a hard time thinking about the questions. I think the difficulty of the course could be adjusted to be more consistent.\r\nIn addition, the office hours of my instructor are usually conflicted with my other courses, so it could possibly be coordinated with other course time although it is difficult.",
    "this course is good.\r\nthe improvement might be the black board writing",
    "Strength:Active and energetic instructor\r\nWeakness:not yet",
    "-The course has an extensive coverage of data analysis for an introductory class. I really loved everything about it.",
    "The book was written by the teacher so it's very convenient for us to check something in the book if we miss them in the class.\r\nThe assignments and the schedule was very well-organized",
    "I think that we could have spent more time learning about inference, but I do realize that this was a summer class that had to be compacted into 5 weeks.",
    "The course was a very good overview. The could be more insight into the mathematical side, but that would be feasible on a larger time frame.",
    "Its a lot of knowledge and maybe we should use more time explaining r studio for beginners like me",
    "Due to time constraints, R language learning time is relatively small.",
    "It had good structure and progressed logically.",
    "strengths: the organization of the course is excellent - It is not too fast or too slow, so that I can have enough time to fully absorb the knowledge. \r\nthe instructors and teaching assistants are very helpful\r\nthe course involves appropriate amount of assignments and quizzes, which motivates me to review the lesson and has positive impact on my study.",
    "Strength: A lot of topic specific tasks, level of difficulty enhances cooperation reaching beyond students' college affiliation, structured class content enables easier learning & understanding (\"the big picture diagram\"), daily classes let the coursework be split into more doable chunks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not every student is familiar with nor talented in coding which makes them face difficulties whilst doing the assigned homework (coding the answers into R-Studio).\r\n\r\nImprovements: More in-class support by the professor's assistants could be provided, slightly shifting the focus away from coding onto data science's usage in different professions and applying the theory to even more diverse examples"

   "comments": [
    "I will strongly recommend this course. The course is quite different and more challenging than other similar statistics courses, because it involves programming that we have never used before and it is more flexible. The final project involves independent research that is quite interesting and challenging, which is another advantage.",
    "yes",
    "Yes.Very clear introduction of statistics, especially for those without experience of data science",
    "I would recommend this course to my fellow students because it would give them the foundation to statistics and data analysis.",
    "Definitely. The workload is moderate and the instructor and TAs are very nice.",
    "Although I am a high school student and don't really have other courses to compare this to besides the one other class I took, I would recommend this course to another student as I learned a lot and it was a good introduction to data sciences.",
    "Yes, I believe this course help you understand the reality in which you stand. A reality, where infornation analysis drives all major enterprises.",
    "Yes",
    "It is a very good introductory course in statistics. Through this course, we will lay a good foundation for further study of advanced statistical analysis.",
    "Yes, it provided a good introduction to the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course, because I really enjoy the whole process of taking this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to another student. It is imperative to have studied the content of this course before pursuing any career involved with data analysis and its corresponding predictions (to infer smth.) The course itself also made a lot of fun, was entertaining and taught me R-coding. Something I otherwise wouldn't have learned any time soon."
