    "I can read and understand poetry way better now, and feel more oriented in the \"cannon\". My interpretive\/reading skills are a lot better, as are my writing abilities.",
    "Close reading of poetry, some knowledge of the \"canonical\" poets that the English dept. deems important, how to write an analytical English paper",
    "I learned about the history of English poetry, as well as a new format of essay writing.",
    "I learned to approach poetry with ease and a light touch. Additionally, I developed a toolbox for discussing the craft and broke free of a formulaic understanding of essay writing.",
    "I learned how to become a more careful reader of poetry.",
    "I learned how to think deeply about poetry, improving my ability to see different interpretations of a single poem and that every interpretation should have evidence to support it. I also developed the ability to notice common themes between various poets and poems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one fewer paper would have been nice, but I certainly benefitted from writing a lot. I also wish we could have read more, but the course was already packed with poetry; it was only the semester's length that limited us.",
    "Strong: reading and writing assignments were very engaging, and felt relevant to daily life\r\nWeak: syllabus organization (It would be much more interesting to organize the readings by theme rather than by poet), class discussions (lots of lecturing from professor)",
    "The survey format of the course is a strength. I found the lack of in-class discussion between students to be a weakness.",
    "A major strength is the two-poet approach to units within the course, which allows for illuminating and often surprising comparisons. Another high point is the intimacy of the class, a trait which enables honest and incisive commentary. A final pro is Leslie Brisman ('nuff said).",
    "The biggest weakness of this class was one that plagues the English department at Yale. Yale as an institution was created for the benefit of white people, and the English major is incredibly dominated by white voices and perspectives, to the point where it is uncomfortable to be a student of color in seminar classes. Though the content of this and other English classes has been changing to include more diverse authors, the make up and culture of the classroom has not changed with it. Going to this class made me exasperated and upset, especially when having to discuss works by authors with whom I share an identity about subjects that are specific to our community, and the professor was not able to address this in any sensitive manner.\r\nI felt that the class was structured well, with an average workload, but I did not find it engaging at all.",
    "The main strength of this course was Mr. Brisman. He always facilitates such insightful, engaging discussions in classes and asks extremely thoughtful questions that push discussion forward in a way that is very student-driven and exciting.",
    "English 126 with Professor Brisman was a wonderful course. I especially love how Professor Brisman did not write grades on our papers. This helped me focus deeply on his comments in a way I do not think I would have been able to had I been given an immediate grade. I also like how this method emphasizes learning over grades, the latter of which feel comparatively unimportant anyway. The one suggestion I might have would be to change the syllabus around such that we do not read two poets at the same time. I liked being able to focus solely on Wordsworth or Pope rather than having to split my focus between Yeats and Eliot, since we read their poetry simultaneously. I understand that the intention behind having us read two poets at the same time was likely to encourage comparison, but I think the comparison could still be performed in written assignments. This is just a personal preference, but I thought I would mention it in case others feel the same way.",
    "Course readings, class discussions, and essays foster deep thinking about the connection of poets' personal lives to their work, the application of one poem's theme to other scenarios, and the meaning of a poem as a whole. Essays allow students to explore themes and problems that interest them and encourage students to consider multiple solutions.\r\n\r\nWhile being able to choose our own essay prompt allowed for creativity, it would have been helpful to have more guidance for our essay structure and\/or general guiding questions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as an intro to reading and writing about poetry.",
    "Yes, especially if you are at all interested in a) reading or writing poetry or b) feeling the grand, defining emotional and psychological challenges of human existence",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student with an interest in the history of English poetry.",
    "Yes. This course is eye-opening in several regards, not least of which is the premium it places on attentiveness to the small things which make all the difference in writing. As a survey course it gives students a decent basis for understanding historical periods of poetry and discrete approaches to form; as a course on craft it is a crash course on the literary critical essay. And Mr. Brisman is amazing.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class to another queer student or student of color.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Mr. Brisman is an incredible instructor and I believe any student, regardless of major, would benefit from taking this course with him. He teaches you how to think about poetry with great openness and insight, and I believe not only my writing but my thinking has improved leaps and bounds over the course of the semester. He guides discussion with great insights and direction, while always allowing the students' ideas to lead the way as we discussed poems. The selection of poets and poems covered was also delightful. He was very intentional in choosing the poets he did, and I feel that I walked away from the course with a much fuller understanding of these poets, their influences and ideas, and poetry in general.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 126 with Professor Brisman to another student. Each class was like a wonderful spectacle, and I learned more in this course than I have from any other course I have taken at Yale. Professor Brisman is a magnificent teacher who cares very deeply about his students. His course taught me to be a much more careful reader of poetry.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are familiar with Romantic poetry or literature. Some questions posed during class were difficult to understand. It was not made clear what the expectations were for essay and in-class analysis of poems."
