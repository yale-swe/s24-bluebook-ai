I was introduced to derivatives, logarithms, and limits during this course.  These three were definitely the most challenging, but necessary.  Through the end of the semester group project, I learned exactly how math applies to the real world."

However, the pre-class discoveries I found to be cumbersome and not helpful with learning anything before the start of class -- it just felt like an assignment that needed to be finished on top of problem sets and concept checks.",
                "Very detailed in talking about material but course might move too slow",
                "The course is well taught and the ULAs are extremely helpful. I would say the only weakness is the room that it was taught in was extremely large and made it tough to focus at times.",
                "The amount of TA office hours offered to us.",
                "could have gotten the class more involved. Felt like there was a lot of self learning. wish we were learning in a classroom instead of a lecture hall",
                "This course can be improved by really focus on teaching people how to understand the work versus just completing it.",
                "It was not necessarily a problem for myself, but I know a lot of my classmates struggled with the speed of this course.  I understand this is college level work.",
                "Strengths: Bobby is a very good teacher and the TAs are very helpful. Also the material is realistic and has purpose.\r\nWeaknesses: The workshops didnt relate to the material sometimes.",
                "Great class",
                "I think a weakness of the course was additional help for struggling students was not offered until a couple of weeks before the 2nd midterm.  I also think recordings of lectures would be helpful for students especially if struggling with the speed of the class or simply if in need of a quick live recap of a concept.  I also think some class time reserved for a homework problem or the introduction of a topic might be helpful."

While doing that however I would make sure to disclose the amount of time this course demands especially if unfamiliar with mathematics or simply if math is not a strong suit.  I would also recommend Professor Bobby, but give the student a heads up that any communication with Bobby should be done at least a week in advance with in-class follow-ups."
