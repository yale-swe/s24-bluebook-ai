Through the end of the semester group project, I learned exactly how math applies to the real world."

However, the pre-class discoveries I found to be cumbersome and not helpful with learning anything before the start of class -- it just felt like an assignment that needed to be finished on top of problem sets and concept checks.",

                "Great class",
                "I think a weakness of the course was additional help for struggling students was not offered until a couple of weeks before the 2nd midterm.  I also think recordings of lectures would be helpful for students especially if struggling with the speed of the class or simply if in need of a quick live recap of a concept.  I also think some class time reserved for a homework problem or the introduction of a topic might be helpful."

While doing that however I would make sure to disclose the amount of time this course demands especially if unfamiliar with mathematics or simply if math is not a strong suit.  I would also recommend Professor Bobby, but give the student a heads up that any communication with Bobby should be done at least a week in advance with in-class follow-ups."
