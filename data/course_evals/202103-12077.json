                "I learned how to prepare a fresco panel, paint a fresco panel, learned basic woodshop skills (how to use all the saws), egg tempera painting, and also got better at watercolor. I also learned some traditional painting techniques (color theory, hatching\/cross-hatching, etc.), as well as tips for how to conserve or restore an old painting that accumulated wear\/damage over the years. This class also taught me (as a STEM major) how to think creatively, approach art critically, and also how to get inspiration from the world around me.",

                "Strenghts\r\n- some very cool practical skills I wouldn't have learned anywhere else, like how to make frescos\r\n- a pretty chill class near the end\r\n- professor is nice and means well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- professor talks a lot with very little of it being relevant to painting\r\n- did not actually learn the basics of painting. just learned about painting and random stuff, but I don't think I got a whole lot better at painting\r\n- the assignments were disorganized and unclear and the spacing of the work was really off at first",
                "Strengths: low stress, fun assignments (ex. paint a memory), small class size, diversity of painting techniques, beginners welcome\r\nWeaknesses: some long readings\/responses, sometimes water based paint can be very frustrating to work with, crits would take 2+ days, professors powerpoint presentations were often very long and unengaging",
                "The weakness is the class did not have much time. By the time tutorials were done, it was almost time to leave and the limited time of the class was definitely an obstacle. No fault of the teacher or TF btw.",
                "This course allows you to use materials which you are unlikely to have access to in any other college art class. Because of the learning curve in getting used to these materials, the pace and syllabus of the course changed frequently.",
                "This course was amazing. I think the organization of the class was a little rough around the edges since it was the professor's first time teaching at Yale, and he had to adapt a 5+ hour studio course into 2 hour class periods, so the syllabus was pretty ambitious initially. But I think as the semester went on, the schedule got ironed out, and the workload was a lot more reasonable. I think as a result of this adjustment, we spent too much time on fresco, and didn't have enough time for oil paint at the end of the class, although I still found the time we spent on fresco enjoyable, even if it dragged on for a bit. Also, because of Oscar's laid-back and understanding nature, it felt like we were figuring things out together, rather than him imposing an unreasonable schedule on us.",
                "I wish we had gotten to oil, and i also felt the pacing for the first half of the course was a bit slow. I wish we had gotten through fresco faster.\r\n\r\nHowever i really appreciate how much I learned about materiality in this course, much more than other art courses ive taken. Oscar was really intentional with that.",
                "More structure and less homework would have allowed us to move onto the oil unit, which might have been my favorite unit and I wish we got there."

Additionally, this course is best suited for students looking to learn and explore painting, rather than producing beautiful final products. The professor goes deeply into materials and political history, so you must be willing to read and discuss writing as well as painting.",
                "Yes, I think this class is a chance to flex your creative and critical muscles",
                "Yes, but it depends what you want to get out of the course. If you want a rigorous foundation art class, this is not for you. If you have a strong background in art and want to explore new materials, or if you have no experience, this class will have greater flexibility to accommodate you.",
                "yes, but know you have todo lots of work and it will be time consuming. It is very rewarding though",
                "This class was probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Your experience in the class probably depends a lot on who's teaching it, because we had two sections of painting basics running this semester and they were doing completely different things. It seems like the professor is given a lot of flexibility over the curriculum. I can't speak for other professors, but I absolutely loved the class under Oscar. Even though there's a lot of differing levels of ability in the class (people with no experience vs. art majors who have been painting their whole lives), Oscar leveled the playing field by making us paint using these super old, antiquated forms of painting like fresco and egg tempera, which don't behave the way you're used to. Instead of just accepting the paint the way a modern-day canvas will, these surfaces will fight against you (almost like a living organism), and you have to really understand the medium in order to coax out a painting. This means that you have to really think about what you're doing instead of just going on autopilot. The thing I liked most about this class was probably how much Oscar encouraged us to be truly thoughtful and intentional with art. He once said something along the lines of \"you can learn these painting techniques in any class, but I'm trying to teach you how to think - how to generate ideas when you're staring at a blank canvas and don't know what to do.\" As a STEM major with limited artistic experience, I really appreciated that. Besides being a super unique class (The stuff we did in this class eg. fresco, egg tempera, going to the woodshop is stuff you probably won't get to do in any other class), this class allowed for a space where I could reflect on my emotions and draw inspiration from my environment and experiences and use that to create something that's meaningful to me, even if it doesn't look amazing from a conventional perspective. I think even if I were to never paint again in my life (which I don't think is true), I've still taken away something valuable from this class in that it's changed the way I view art. When I first signed up for this class, I was expecting to come in twice a week and paint some still lifes or whatever, but I ended up learning some real life lessons that I think will stick with me for quite some time.",
                "Great class, especially with Oscar!",
                "yes absolutely. I think a lot of the theoretical aspects of this course are what basic painting classes more generally are missing. I do think if what you are looking for is a class where you learn to paint technically (doing still lives, figures, etc. this is not the class to take).",
                "Yes, especially one who wants to continue painting (like a first year art major) as they will learn a lot about the foundations of it."
