                "I learned a lot about the various asset classes that Yale invests in along with some portfolio theory.",
                "I learned about how the minds at the forefront of every major asset-class thinks about investing, which was extremely valuable. Perhaps more valuable though, were the times when we could shoot questions at Amy and Alex about the endowment itself. Gaining this perspective, understanding how one of the most prominent institutional investors thinks about manager selection and asset allocation, was extraordinarily helpful.",
                "I learned a great deal about endowment management, including what characteristics make a good investment manager. Filled in gaps in my finance knowledge, including leveraged buyouts and real estate",
                "Broad overview of different asset classes (long/short equity, buyouts, venture capital, real estate), plus endowment management (manager selection, asset allocation) and touching on fundamental equity analysis.",
                "The speakers who came to teach in this course were incredible. We got to hear from managers across the Yale Investment Office's asset classes, and we were able to learn firsthand how their firms operate. I also learned how to model and how to present my thoughts in a concise and clear manner.",
                "The Yale Endowment model was the most emphasized topic of the course and would serves as a foundation when comparing the Yale Endowment to the asset allocation of the speakers' firms. Its goals and spending philosophy were essential themes and a lot of behind-the scenes-processes that go into funding all schools of Yale arose in discussion. Besides university endowments, we covered clever examples of short selling and longs, unique cases studies in merger arbitrage and real estate, ethics, VC in technology, and general LBO knowledge. The best part of the course is engaging in constant discussion to really feel like you are a member of the investing world and know what characteristics to look for in a potential investment.",
                "I learned about the decision making that goes on within Yale's Investment Office, which was a privilege and a unique experience.",
                "I learned about the Yale Investment Offices asset classes. I loved hearing from a handful of the YIOs managers and working on in-depth assignments.",
                "the fundamentals of investment analysis across different asset classes.",
                "I learned about the Yale endowment and their portfolio management strategy. I gained insight into different asset classes and investment strategies of different firms.",
                "Before this course, I basically did not know anything about finance, although I had been an economics major my entire time at Yale. As such this course gave me the opportunity to learn about all the different types of investing by reading through pitch materials, 10Ks, and hearing from guest speakers in fields ranging from short selling to real estate to absolute returns to venture capital to private equity and more. It was also interesting to hear the strategies YIO had employed over time, originating with Mr. Swensen, to become so successful.",
                "I learned how to model a company stock's intrinsic value, what an LBO was, and different strategies that the Endowment's managers use to generate high and consistent returns. It was amazing to hear from so many guest speakers, and I really loved getting to go through a case or company with some of them!",
                "I entered the class with little to no prior knowledge of finance, but thanks to the expert guidance of Amy and Alex, along with our insightful guest speakers, I was able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry. The course proved to be truly enlightening, as I not only learned how to develop a Valuation Model but also acquired the ability to effortlessly analyze and interpret complex financial data. Through extensive writing and reading assignments, I was able to refine my skills in writing effective memos and comprehending them. Overall, the course has been an invaluable learning experience that has equipped me with practical and applicable knowledge of finance -- something unmatched at Yale.",
                "Buy side overview - very helpful",
                "Great overview of several asset classes.",
                "I learned about different fields and types of investing, as well as institutional goals for investing."

            "comments": [
                "Having more of an emphasis on hard-skills and security analysis in these different types of investment categories could supplement the lessons well.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the assortment of speakers we heard from and thought the manager memos were very good ways to consolidate this knowledge. Each of these industry leaders brought their own teaching method/style to the table, which actually gives some insight into the culture they cultivate at their respective firms (very interesting). I also found learning about institutional investing, ethics, manager selection, and the endowment itself to be very compelling. Even more classes spent on this would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think my biggest issue with the course was that one of its principal assignmentsthe midterm project, which involved building a DCF modelwas very much disengaged from the content of the course. Yes, we learned about investment analysis, but this generally took the form of broader conceptual learning rather than technical training as far as I can recall. We were given some short online tutorials, but aside from this, I can't recall every discussing any of the actual  components that went into this project. I think it's fine to stick to teaching investing conceptually, but if you introduce a technical assignment, there should be technical training to go along with it.",
                "This is a class with exceptional instructors and guest speakers, and it's frankly crazy to have a class with this much capability to bring in world-class speakers each week. I learned a ton, and even though I don't plan to go into finance, think that a lot of the skills learned in this class are broadly transferable to life/management of a company/instititution.",
                "Incredible guest speakers, assignments are highly relevant and engaging, Alex/Amy/Joe are incredibly nice and helpful. The class does cover a wide range of topics, so sometimes you're not able to dive in at a very deep level. But if you talk to Alex, Amy, or Joe, they would almost certainly be willing to provide more materials to engage with.",
                "This course is incredible because it is taught in the Yale Investments Office, through which we gained access to investment professionals both inside of the office and out through guest speakers. That being said, I felt that the course was a lot less practical than I would have hoped for. Class consisted of speakers coming in to tell us about their careers and experiences, which were interesting, but then we were assigned a company model with barely ten minutes on it in class. I found that the workload and class structure were extremely mismatched, and that it was quite difficult to meet with the professors and TA to get useful information. This combination made the class incredibly stressful and forced me to Credit/D it when I did not want to.",
                "Strengths are obviously the speakers who are all extremely knowledgable and have consistently generated outsized returns in their subfields. Weaknesses are how deep we could get into any one strategy, so it did seem like a broad survey course, and the lack of guidance on the midterm project, which threw classmates off guard with how much modeling was assumed. The numerous writing assignments were all very helpful in engaging with the material, but it was hard to write detailed enough responses without prior knowledge because the class did not cover each investing topic in enough depth (or at all, just via the speaker). The assigned readings besides Swensen's book were also not the most useful. Also, some of the writing prompts made for very descriptive essays, and they could be made more argumentative so students have to develop a stance and support it with evidence. Professors also gotta call on more different people instead of the ones who would always contribute (feels like they just got complacent and would just pick people that always talked), which isn't really in the spirit of a discussion-based seminar. The intros at the beginning of every class were funny but not the best use of time at all, I know finance is all oh let's small talk all the time because I only do business with people I like, but I would rather have had 20 min more of the speaker teaching than hearing about my classmates' experiences every time in Neverland that the speaker would not even remember. The ethics aside was very mid and would rather have had another speaker. First class was mid and should have been background reading, maybe we can cover all the asset classes in this class as a background for the speakers that would then follow. Manager review classes were okay, maybe more background here too, but they were good for asking and answering questions.\r\n\r\nMore guest speakers, especially those who like to ask questions and probe students for answers, really helped students ponder how things are done and answer their \"what if\" questions. \r\n\r\nDinners were chill but prob should be for people who are super sociable, instructors should continue engaging everyone there, I mean they are just standard talks over meals\r\n\r\nAmount of assignments was great. I really liked writing about all these topics every week and some people might complain but for a one-class-a-week class it was very appropriate. Some of these topics need to be more argumentative, like maybe do you think this manager would invest in this company or this company and why, because simply describing their firm is boring, everyone heard about it in class, and we are just summarizing the presentations then. Need to extrapolate specific firm strategies to the broader investing world. Every investing class (especially an intro like this one) really needs to have a stock pitch as a project, so I think it was appropriate for the midterm project, but the amount of guidance we received was not much. Not even on modeling, but like, how do you know which key drivers are important and how do you make assumptions? It became very hand wavy since we weren't taught in a class the background of making these assumptions and knowing how to objectively rate a companies' performance/growth.\r\n\r\nAlso Joe was great, his emails every week were SUPER HELPFUL in keeping up with what was due and this provided a centralized source of information, better than Canvas.",
                "The strengths of the course were the teaching staff, the amazing guest speakers, and the interesting course content. However, at times the logistical details of assignments were not clearly communicated.",
                "Strengths: You will meet amazing students from across Yale who are interested in finance and adjacent careers. The speakers and professors are also incredible mentors and assets who will teach you about all different asset classes from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course does throw you into the deep end for topics that you are unfamiliar with, so there may be periods where you feel like you are in over your head. However, the professors and TA (shoutout Joe) are incredible in providing guidance through difficult assignments.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professors and the professionals they brought into class. Truly a once in a lifetime opportunity! The only weakness I can think of is that it was at times a little difficult to write about economics topics that I was previously unfamiliar with, but the professors and TF were always available to answer my questions.",
                "It provides a comprehensive guide to investment management. I don't see how it could be improved, it was very well conducted.",
                "Strengths: fantastic guest speakers and professors Chivetta and Hetherington are great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt too broad, not enough technical explanations and the quality of the classes depended too much on the preparedness of the speakers",
                "Strengths - hearing from amazing speakers and investment professionals (better than being in a theoretical econ class) \r\nWeaknesses - less feedback on homework",
                "I think assignment could be sent out farther in advance as sometimes we would not receive our assignments that were due at noon on Monday until Friday morning. Furthermore, although the video walkthrough was nice, I think there could be more guidance about the midterm project in class , especially for those without a finance background, so there would more of an opportunity to ask questions.",
                "Strengths: I really liked how many guest speakers we had, and how the relevant assignments were so tailored to the specific speaker coming in. It's so surreal to write about a company and then get to hear from one of its most consistent investors about why they believe it's a great buy. I also enjoyed the structure of the final paper: I got to apply what I had learned from the class to a different investing scenario, and I really liked the freedom I had to do so.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel adequately prepared to model a company for the midterm project, and I struggled with some Excel errors even with the helpful tutorials. I also wish there was a little more guidance on what they were looking for laid out in the initial guidelines.",
                "Strengths: The instructors and TA (Joe) were exceptionally kind and supportive, always available to help and willing to go above and beyond to ensure our success. Since they are not really faculty, they felt more like mentors who generously shared their time and expertise with us. Joe also stood out for his exceptional organizational skills and prompt email responses, which all students appreciated. Overall, the course structure was well-designed and provided an enjoyable learning experience\r\nWeakness: The only weakness of the course was the midterm project, which was quite extensive and required significant background knowledge. Furthermore, it was scheduled immediately after Spring Break, leaving students with little time to complete it. Breaking down the project into smaller components and providing more guidance on how to approach it in class would have been helpful. While the project was ultimately rewarding, more guidance could have enabled us to produce even better work.\"",
                "Strengths: great guest speakers and structure of course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of teaching for midterm\r\nproject model. There should have been a optional modeling class for those who had previously done this.",
                "I think the workload was too high and the assignments (especially the midterm) sometimes required background knowledge that we did not receive from class. The lectures/speakers were amazing, though."

                "Yes. It's a fantastic class and you should absolutely take it if you have the opportunity. Also encourage students who aren't necessarily in the finance sphere to apply. It's a great way to learn big topics and fundamentals and probably the most enjoyable econ class that I've taken as an econ major/non-finance person",
                "Absolutely, if you have any interest in understanding how the endowment works and hearing from some of the best professional investors in the world. The workload is very reasonable and much more interesting than most classes.",
                "I think that it is great to be exposed to the Yale Investments Office and professionals in the industry. That being said, the professors assigned us so much work each week that I was unable to get to the midterm project, a model on a company, until spring break. While away with my family, I was forced to spend much of my break alone in my hotel room attempting to understand the model. I had met with the TA prior to and during spring break, but without any experience modeling prior to the course, I felt that I had to teach it all to myself. While I was able to learn a lot on my own, and the speakers were interesting, I would caution a student to be careful prior to taking this course unless the professors are able to restructure it in a way that omits a speaker or two in order to teach students practical information.",
                "Yeah, if you were looking for a broad survey course of investing and wanted to be a part of an investing discussion every week. Not super challenging but pretty interesting to see how people from different backgrounds could contribute unique ideas to investing.",
                "Yes, I think any senior should take this class if given the opportunity because of how engaging the guest speakers are.",
                "Yes! The people at the YIO are incredibly knowledgeable and well-connected mentors who can help provide academic and career guidance within and adjacent to finance. Additionally, the class community is incredible, with super smart and interesting people that you may not have met otherwise.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Even though I was pretty new to a lot of the content, the class wasnt intimidating and was a fun intellectual challenge. The class did have a lot of writing, though, so Id recommend taking it with a lighter course load.",
                "Absolutely, it's an absolute privilege to take this course and to learn from the best in asset management.",
                "Yes but only because its a chance to learn directly from the endowment which is one of the best institutional investors in the world. Overall, I found the class a bit boring at times and without much cohesion",
                "If one is interested in learning about finance/investing, this is a great crash course in learning a bit about all the different types and learning from very accomplished and well-spoken guest speakers.",
                "Yes, I would. If you get in, you should definitely take it! Just to give you a high-level idea of the structure this year in case the syllabus isn't informative: there are multiple guest speakers (I want to say around one every two weeks or more frequently), and you will often have pre-class and post-class assignments tailored to what you will prepare for/what you have gleaned from those guest speakers. Think evaluative writing assignments and not problem sets. There is also a significant amount of reading from Swensen's text; I really encourage you to do the reading because it makes the class so much more coherent and clear. You will also have a midterm project of some sort as well as a final paper. There are no exams. I would take the class because of Alex and Amy (and our TA this year Joe was incredible), as well as for the guest speakers! They are so friendly and conversations alone are so much more enlightening than the work you will put into pre-class assignments.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you're not interested in finance.",
                "This course is a must-take for any student remotely interested in finance. The experience is nothing short of transformative, as Amy and Alex masterfully create an environment that transcends traditional classroom settings. It feels less like a lecture and more like a dynamic, thought-provoking discussion that pushes you to challenge your preconceived notions. The course's location at the Investment Office adds an extra layer of uniqueness, making it truly exceptional and distinct from other courses. Additionally, You can get dinner with the guest speakers at least once, and you should definitely make use of that as the speakers are very accomplished people and at the top if their field. I wholeheartedly recommend this course!",
