                "Strengths: Dr. Attanasio is kind and a crazy smart and well-accomplished economist. The lectures were fairly well organized and the slides were well made.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class was not the best in many way ways. For starters, the assignments were SUPER unorganized. We didn't get our first assignment until like week 7 of class. What's more, we didn't even know what kinds of assignments we would get for the first 6 weeks. The final projects we ended up getting were actually empirically hard. I luckily had some coding experience but if someone had never coded before, I have no idea how they would have completed that project. This is especially unfair considering there were basically no prereqs (or a coding requirement). Second, the lectures were very boring. They were all pure lectures at 9am with basically no classroom participation. It was very hard to focus. I would have appreciated some alternate formats (like breakout rooms) to break the rhythm of the class). Lastly, Dr. Attanasio is very approachable, but also not great at structuring and answering questions in a way that's helpful. Even his instructions were very confusing. I , and most everyone else I spoke to in class, was confused by some of the asks for the final project.",

                "I think the material was good, but there was definitely too much reading material. Not even all of the required ones ended up being discussed in class. I think it would be better to narrow down the readings to the essential ones.\r\n\r\nI also think some assignments could have been pushed forward so that students do not procrastinate until the end of the semester. Feedback would have also been nice."

Dr. Attanasio is a kind and crazy smart\/well-accomplished economist, but this class was not the best for many reasons. For starters, it was not very engaging at all. The lectures were fairly well organized and the slides were well made and detailed, but most of the class was dedicated to him just lecturing to a bunch of empty screens. He never really tried to engage the class or tried alternate formats to increase participation and break up his lecturing (ex: breakout rooms). The fact that it was at 9am made engagement even lower. In his defense, he tried to get feedback and was always open to hearing students out which is a great quality, however, the class really lacked in the engagement category. The assignments were also SUPER unorganized. We didn't get our first assignment until like week 7 of class. What's more, we didn't even know what kinds of assignments we would get for the first 6 weeks. The final projects we ended up getting were actually quite empirically challenging. I luckily had some coding experience but if someone had never coded before, I have no idea how they would have completed that project. This is especially unfair considering there were basically no prereqs (or a coding requirement). The assignments themselves were also kind of challenging and time consuming. We only had to complete 3 of the 4 but I felt like I spent at least 12-15 hours and wrote like 7 single spaced pages for each. Thus, this course felt SEVERELY backloaded as far as workload. I did nothing for the first half of the course (like literally nothing) and had SO MUCH to do in the later half. Tying to that, we got literally 0 feedback the whole semester. We have no grades at all -- and it's literally a toss up to see where our grades are at when they come out. Lastly, Dr. Attanasio is very approachable, but also not great at structuring and answering questions in a way that's helpful. Even his instructions were very confusing. I , and most everyone else I spoke to in class, was confused by some of the asks for the final project.\r\n\r\nAll to say, this class definitely has potential. Dr. Attanasio is a sweet professor who will undoubtedly make this course better in the future. However, based on this semester, I would not take this course again. I got very little out of it.",
