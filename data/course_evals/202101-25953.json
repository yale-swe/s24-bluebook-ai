                "Strengths: Chinese classes at Yale have been, by far, the best thought-through and most engaging classes I have taken. The Professors genuinely care so much about student learning and clearly spend so much time investing in tailoring the content and structure of courses to maximize student attention. Even on zoom, Professor Liang ensured that every member of our class had ample opportunities to practice speaking, reading and listening.",
                "The interactive, small-group class sessions were helpful to improve speaking and listening. Some homework assignments, however, felt like busy work that did not actually help me improve. The worksheets were just questions pulled directly from study guides and were not a meaningful way to use the grammar points. The final project non-Chinese elements like video editing take more time than actually writing the Chinese part of it, which was also true for the cooking video assignment. Having a tutor is a great way to practice speaking, but using the tutoring time to review sentences written for homework meant that we didn't actually have much time to practice authentic speaking, which seemed like a missed opportunity.",
