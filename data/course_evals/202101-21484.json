                "Lots of opportunities to practice and learn through our exploration quizzes, class was very informative and gave us time to work on problems in small groups",
                "This course does not place enough emphasis on practice. The course material is taught way to quickly to be fully absorbed. The change between sequences and series is too abrupt to fully learn the difference between the two. I especially found it detrimental to be introduced to new material during the week of the midterm or final. I would not say that students are focused on learning new topics when they are struggling to grasp old ones. Having a PSet due the day before a midterm is also pretty cruel. Students are trying to focus on studying and the added pressure of another grade does not help. I liked how for the final the Pset was not submitted. This allowed for me to practice for my understanding instead of worrying about a grade. Overall, I struggled keeping up with this class, even as a frequent attendee of my professor's office hours and peer tutor hours.",

I also hatted that everyone else did 24 hour midterm/finals so I was accustomed to that, not these very limited 1.5 hour tests. I dont want to sound so harsh but there was really nothing I thought was good about the course except the concept checks.",
                "It was well paced, and fairly easy to keep up with the work and understand the material. I don't really have any complaints besides that I felt the explorations that we had to do before the lectures weren't particularly helpful."
