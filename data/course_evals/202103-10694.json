We explored a wide breadth of protest movements and heard from many excellent speakers. I learned a lot about what happens behind the scenes of protests and what sustains or kills them.",
                "I learned about various aspects of political protests, as well as the current state of political protests in the world.",
                "I developed knowledge, skills, and insights into historic and contemporary methods of political protests - how they originate, manifest, end, and persist - in a variety of political and cultural contexts.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Guest speakers, interesting readings, stimulating discussions, and Professor Hierro. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Slightly repeating conversations and a bit too much content for some classes to cover in ~2 hours.",
                "The discussions were always very interesting and I feel they always flowed well under Professor Hierro's guidance. The assignments were interesting and manageable after some alterations. The guest speakers were very interesting and I feel I learned from them in ways I couldn't learn from articles. The only improvement I would recommend is some earlier conversations on the final paper and more time for students to discuss either readings or guest speakers on days that we have both.",
                "Professor Hierro always wanted us to build exclusively off class readings in writing our responses and other essays. For the reading responses, obviously, this was necessary. I wish we had more freedom to branch out in our other essays, however. The course syllabus is absolutely a prime guide, but it is just that: a guide; it shouldn't restrict us. If we are interested in writing about an aspect of political protest that doesn't appear in the syllabus, we should be encouraged to do so, so long as we base our arguments on appropriate secondary literature. By the end of the semester, I began to expect a comment on every submission that my writing did not conform to class discussions. Additionally, I wish the report and other preparations for the final essay began sooner in the term so we could really dig deeply into our chosen movement.",
                "The course materials and topics were very interesting to anyone interested in a modicum of politics and social affairs.\r\nThe class itself could have been more structured as it largely became student participatory led and guest-speaker led.\r\nLike the first lecture, it would have been great if the professor continued to use powerpoints briefly to set the discussion to a framework before letting students take over.",
                "The course featured a high concentration of guest speakers. Some of the guest speakers were fantastic, including the opportunity to speak with Pablo Iglesias. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I am incredibly thankful Professor Hierro worked to facilitate. The guest speakers were all interesting and engaging, but one significant drawback of having so many guest speakers was that it limited our class time for discussion. As a seminar, I expected to have rigorous discussions on the readings. However, weeks that we had guest speakers really cut into our ability to have discussions and some weeks could even feel like the readings were disconnected from the class. Thus the guest speakers were both a strength and a weakness. If I were to improve this, I would hone in on about 2 guest speakers throughout the semester.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it was very well organized and included a very comprehensive selection of readings and perspectives. The course facilitated student engagement and discussion well. The weaknesses of this course are the occasional lack in participation, but overall there was very strong engagement.",
                "The course was taught well and was highly organized. Expectations were very clear and assignments were structured in a way that complemented the readings and class discussions. One possible way that it could be improved is by including slightly more challenging readings and topics.",
                "Lots of different aspects of protests covered",
                "Professor Hierro took great care to invite enlightening guest speakers and explained concepts thoroughly. Be advised that the course is heavy on theory. I would have enjoyed a less calculated approach to protest that made room for emotional labor and critical reception. This course is also assignment-heavy, which was a nuisance at times.",
                "The strength is that each weak's lessons are relatively straight forward. Usually, every week there is a key lesson that all the readings seems to be gravitating towards so at the end of the semester, it felt like I could recite what was the big take away from each week. We also had lots of guest speakers which always was interesting to hear from real life people organizing political protests.\r\nWeakness is too much small tasks each week compared to other seminars. It felt as if each week there was some written assignment due with a combination of response papers, documentary response papers, seminar check ins, and canvas posts made it quite a bit. The assignments aren't particularly difficult, just a lot. Another strength though it that the Professor is very flexible and receptive to response, so she did decrease some of the assignments. She also is super nice and helpful."

The class was also quite conducive to student discussion and I felt that always went really well and was informative and helpful in exploring other viewpoints.",
                "I would recommend the course if you wanted to learn about political protests in a discussion based setting.",

                "If you're interested in learning about global protest movements, this is a good course. I feel like I've come out of it with a better understanding of various social movements in different countries, how they formed and how they've evolved, etc. The workload is very manageable, and the guest speakers were pretty interesting.",
                "Sure",
                "If you're interested in the study of protest, particularly movements outside of the United States, this course is for you.",
                "Yes, you learn alot of different dynamics of political protests and it gives you a different lens to view current protests in the world."
