His writing feedback was always quick and incredibly thorough. I entered this class unfamiliar with philosophical writing and techniques for analysis, but Professor Werner devoted class time to properly explaining them and giving us ample class time and writing assignments to practice these skills.",

One weakness embedded within that structure is the difficulty of giving some works the time thy might deserve. It feels at times as though we move on from certain works quickly. Another weakness was the amount of work on top of the already rigorous\/heavy philosophy work in the form of the extra assignments. These were not bad in principle (and actually quite helpful), but could have been more spaced out or shorter potentially.",

The payoff is great, but the effort needed is similarly great.",
