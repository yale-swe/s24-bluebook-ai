A strength was the attention she gave to putting together each reading and lesson plan under the different course themes covered on a weekly basis. There were no significant weaknesses I can readily think of.",

                "I enjoyed the course structure which drew upon media and films to watch as well. The only thing I think would be better to improve on the conversational aspect of the oral is to have smaller classes to enable some more actual conversation, rather than just responses.",
                "Les discussions sont fascinantes, car on s'intresse aux sujets enseigns. J'ai lu des articles qui avaient rapport aux problmes urgents en France. On a parl des difficults et puis des solutions envisageables.\r\n\r\nLe travail  faire pour lundi peut tre un peu excessif, car on a souvent une criture en plus des lectures. Quand mme, la charge de travail est gnralement matrisable.",
                "The greatest weakness of the course was the in-class essays because they were supposed to be vocabulary and knowledge/expression tests at the same time. However, when you have to structure your entire answer around including the correct number of (memorized) vocabulary words, it means you are not structuring your answer based on knowledge, reasoning, or an argument.",

Si on veut bien apprendre le franais et parler la langue couramment, il est trs important de suivre le franais 160 au but d'amliorerson expression orale. De plus, le franais nest pas simplement une langue. Cest galement un patrimoine culturel et une manire de penser.  mon avis, le franais 150 est gnial et ncessaire, mais cela ne suffirait pas si on voudrait parvenir  un niveau de confiance lev avec sa connaissance du franais et de la France.",
