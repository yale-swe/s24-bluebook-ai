                "Professor Chantrain is one of the kindest and most caring professors youll ever have. She is really passionate and knowledgeable about the subject and she will always support you to make the class as good of an experience as possible for you. If I had to change something, Id suggest more active learning. It was sometimes hard to keep up with all the grammar when it was being presented in class. Maybe it would be better to have us study the grammar in advance and practice in class.",
                "The course was formatted quite well and it was easy to follow along and understand a lot of the concepts. It also wasn't expected of us to understand particularly hard concepts right away, so the stress level wasn't bad. Feedback was always very helpful and explanation would be given with it as well.",
                "Strengths: the course material is quite doable. Prof Chantrain is VERY helpful, and you would have to deliberately refuse to learn if you want to find this course challenging. Exam-wise, I LOVED the course.  Weaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, fun language, and manageable workload.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook exercises weren't very engaging; the exercises the professor made were more fun and understandable.",
                "I think there could be more practical ways of learning the grammatical structures, rather than just practice sentences. But I also think that the lecture portion of the course was very well taught.",
                "This course was great because of the professor. Learning hieroglyphs in and of itself is really cool, but Professor Chantrain really completed the class. She was always patient and available, helping students really understand the course material. The translations and transliterations we did were pretty straight forward.",
                "Professor Chantrain is really great at explaining the content and provides very helpful summaries of the grammar. She really cares about the course and makes the content fun to learn. The course follows the textbook (Allan, 3rd edition) so between Professor Chantrain and the textbook, the material is presented very clearly. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Chantrain is an amazing professor! She is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable, touching on every little nuance and offering insight into ancient Egyptian culture. It is evident how much she cares about her students. She even compiled a presentation on artifacts from the Met since we were unable to go to a museum at the end of the semester. As a remote student, Middle Egyptian was the highlight of my early mornings. The relatively small class size lends itself well to working in groups on exercises and getting to know your peers. The material was presented at a good pace and we covered a lot more than I expected. The provided grammatical summaries are very helpful. Also, the assignment-oral exam testing format was very fair and minimized stress.\r\nThere sometimes feels like there is a lot to memorize, but that is the nature of Middle Egyptian. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and did not observe any significant weaknesses.",
                "Despite having to memorize the signs, this class did not feel like it was only memorization. Professor Chantrain taught us the grammar required to understand the structure of sentences, and then allowed us to read sentences on our own using dictionaries and sign lists. By doing this, we were able to build a strong base understanding of the language without having to memorize too much at once. The only complaint I have about this class is that sometimes the lectures moved a bit fast and were long, so it was difficult for me to keep up with my notes, but this was fine because all of the notes that professor Chantrain presented in class were posted on canvas, so I could go back and study later."

                "We had pretty run-of-the-mill virtual seminars. We couldn't go to museums to look at actual stone slabs and read hieroglyphs but Prof Chantrain wonderfully makes up for that by showing us pictures of hieroglyphs on ancient chairs and whatnot.",

If anything, it would be helpful to work through more reading exercises during class.",

                "If you are interested in the language I would recommend it, but go into the course with the knowledge that if you get behind on one concept it will be hard to catch up as many of them build on top of one another.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you need a language requirement. The work and course is quite manageable. I never felt overwhelmed or anything by the amount of work that was given. It was really fun to learn in this class.",
                "Absolutely! Most classes were split roughly into three parts: (1) go over and review the homework, (2) lecture on new content, and (3) work on some practice problems from the new content. Professor Chantrain is really good at explaining the material and care a lot. I'm so happy I get to take this class when she is the professor because it is so much fun. The assignments aren't too bad once you start remembering all the grammar rules and common signs. Most of the time, the homework can be completed quickly but the first homework on adjectives and the first homework on verbs took me a while because the was new and a bit complex. Professor Chantrain does a great job explaining it, though.",
                "YES!! This was arguably my most favorite class this semester. The warm atmosphere and community are fantastic. Professor Chantrain is super kind and helpful; she is committed to helping you learn. Middle Egyptian itself is a beautiful language. As you dive into the language, you learn more about ancient Egyptian culture and realize what we share as part of the human condition. Also, it is pretty neat just to be able to read hieroglyphic. Testing is very fair and homework is minimal. I would definitely take this class!",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It's easygoing, but engaging at the same time. Most importantly, it's fun! Translating hieroglyphs is something that I thought I would never do and it took me by surprise how enjoying it is."
