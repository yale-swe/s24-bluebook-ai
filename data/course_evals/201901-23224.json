    "History of Caribbean colonization, development of Caribbean cultures due ti slavery, how to write a history paper based in primary sources, archival research",
    "This course truly encourages the student to develop a better understand of history and the way it impacts the present. The final research paper refines your writing skills and is instrumental in learning about evidence in history as a whole.",
    "I think I was pushed to be more creative with source material, especially primary sources. I also think I learned how to synthesize an argument for a presentation, and how to field questions on an argument to make it more defensible.",
    "The course provided an excellent introduction into relevant historical works on Caribbean history."

   "comments": [
    "Really interesting subject, really interesting discussions-- a bit difficult to read one book a week and necessary to read it in order to discuss, so sometimes it got hard to keep conversations flowing when only a few people had read the book",
    "This course was very good about providing support for the essays we wrote. However, sometimes discussions struggled a bit-- not everyone was super prepared, and there was not a feeling that one had to do all the readings before class.",
    "The class material was exceedingly engaging and class discussions were always very interesting and open. Professor Rugemer provided really helpful feedback at every stage of our individual archival research projects as well, which was very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah! Caribbean history is important as is learning about all different sides of it, not just Anglo colonization but also other cultures present on the islands. Also the books were interesting to read",
    "Yes. It is a great history course with very interesting readings. If you have no connection to the reasons it might be difficult to engage in class but overall highly recommend taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in history seminars. I would also recommend this class because in general I've found few history classes here that deal with this particular geographic area, and I think it's an important one in formation of \"America\/Americas.\"",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student with any interest in Caribbean History."
