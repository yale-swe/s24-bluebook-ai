    "I would. This is an excellent course designated for intensive language study, Teachers are very nice and patient.",
    "Japanese is a great language. If you're learning language for utility it may not be your first choice, but if you are already curious about Japan or want to study a particularly beautiful language, I think it's very worth continuing on to the higher levels."
