                "Strengths: Prerecorded lecture videos and readings were certainly helpful in providing an introduction to epidemiology. Learning to use SPSS was really easy because everything was given step by step. Breakout rooms allowed me to meet other people in the class.",
                "Marney is amazing! I think some of the case studies were a little repetitive, but fun nonetheless. I very much enjoyed the final project. My only comment would be that I thought the quizzes and p-sets were more rigorous than I was expecting based on class work.",
                "Prof White put a lot of thought and effort into organizing this class in an engaging and productive way and varied each week to keep it really interesting and fresh",
                "Strengths: flexible because its hybrid, flipped classroom format was very helpful and beneficial\r\nWeakness: Very fast paced",
                "Strengths: lots of group work, a range of skills from scientific to mathematical to policy stuff, passionate professor.\r\nWeaknesses: FLIPPED CLASSROOM (prerecorded lectures and then zoom group work during class time).  EVERYTHING is on zoom. If you know yourself to have trouble with zoom, this class is NOT worth it.\r\nAlso, do NOT take if you don't have a stats background! They say it's open to anyone, but stats knowledge is actually super important. Don't be fooled.",
                "I really appreciated the behavioral health assignment Professor White gave us at the start of the term. It was cool to have the opportunity to implement a positive behavior change as part of my class grade.",
                "the lecture quizzes were often difficult to answe even after completing the lectures and readings",
                "The Zoom format of this course did not detract from the course at all, it could be considered a strength because it allowed for slight flexibility with regards to a schedule. The asynchronous lectures were also very helpful.",
                "Strengths: pretty chill; people were nice. Content was fun if you're interested in statistics. Weaknesses: it was too chill so no one was really making an effort; there was very little real public health \"facts;\" instead, they were only examples to illustrate statistics.",
                "Strengths- Professor who prioritizes student wellbeing and goes out of her way to meet her students where they are. Flipped classroom learning style makes for engaging classes. Lack of midterm exam allowed me to focus more on learning the material rather than memorizing it. \r\nWeaknesses- Weekly quizzes were sometimes strangely worded with unclear answers, but occassionally missing such questions does not lower one's grade by much at all.",
                "This course was kind of a flipped classroom, in which lectures were to be watched outside of class, and class time was used for group work. I liked engaging with my fellow students and all the case studies were very informative. I always felt like the length was just right for class time, and there was always something new to be learned. However, I did find the fully virtual setting difficult at points for engagement."

                "No, don't take it. The professor is nice and I think she really wants to make the class less stressful, but she overshoots. All group assignments are graded based on completion, so you can tell that none of your groupmates care. And it is not a gut class - you need to do well on the PSETs and the final (~take-home exam format). You don't really learn facts about public health; all you get is statistics about how to calculate risk ratio, etc.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Marney White was an amazing professor who truly prioritized my and her other students' wellbeing. Relaxed teaching style made for engaging and not intimidating classes.",
                "If you can hold yourself accountable to watch online lectures and engage with zoom classes, this course is awesome. Marney is a fantastic teacher and so sweet, so enthusiastic about the material. I always felt like the cases were relevant, applicable, and interesting. It provided a strong foundation for future studies."
