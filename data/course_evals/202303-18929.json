We then shifted to learning about statistical mechanics, which uses probabilistic math to derive thermodynamics abstractly. This view leads to lots of interesting applications like blackbody radiation and quantum ideal gases.",

            "comments": [
                "There are so many things to say. This course is taught extremely poorly. The lectures are virtually incomprehensible, and Prof. Reed's skips details that he thinks are trivial (and are very nontrivial to the rest of us). His handwriting is also incredibly hard to read. There is no teaching assistant or peer tutor for this class, even though we requested one. Instead, we were told to go to office hours (which were at a time when many people could not even attend). The final exam is brutal, and the problem sets are very hard as well. To even understand what is going on (a little bit), a high degree of mathematical sophistication is required.",
                "I think the course text and problem sets were very well written and appropriate. The lectures were quite good, but sometimes lacked clarity and an overall sense of purpose and narrative. I think the greatest weakness of the course was the small amount of office hour time, which was limited to one hour per week. Especially since the lectures were sometimes hard to follow, more time in office hours would have been appreciated. Finally, I felt that the problem sets did not prepare me particularly well for the final exam, and there were no other supporting materials (extra office hours, practice questions, etc) that we could use to prepare. In short, more support for the students and more organized lectures would improve the course greatly.",
                "The course is well-structured and contains really interesting material that turns out to be highly relevant to other branches of physics (especially phenomena in solid state physics that I did not expect to make sense of through statistical mechanics) through a good mix of theory and applications\/proofs and computation. I especially enjoyed philosophical expositions of the foundations of thermodynamics. As a non-intensive physics major, I found it mostly accessible. \r\n\r\nThe different formalisms used in class and in the textbook can be confusing (although the instructor does his best to clarify this).",
                "The strengths of the course were the problem sets. Problem sets because they were mainly textbook (Reif) problems that heavily followed the chapters. side from that I felt like the class faltered in so many ways. Lectures talked too much about theory and unnecessary mathematical derivations. My only source of useful knowledge came from reading the textbook, not so much anything else. The midterm was manageable and felt coherent, but I felt like it was incredibly wordy and didn't really tie together what I learned.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course was the final...goodness that final was WAY WAY too esoteric and daunting. I do NOT think that final was a good reflection of what the course tried to tackle.",
                "The material is very interesting, and is built from the foundations, with little assumption of previous knowledge, which is a strength.  The course is fast, which may be a weakness, but also may just require more work outside the classroom.",
                "I think going to class actively confused me more than simply reading the textbook. It didn't feel like the content was presented very clearly or structured.",
                "Strengths: The textbook was easy to follow, and the homework was manageable. The exams were also not too hard. Weaknesses: Although Prof Read tries hard to explain concepts lucidly, I found many times that his explanations were missing something and learned more from the textbook instead. That made his compulsory attendance policy somewhat annoying."

                "Physics majors are pretty much required to take this course. To other students, unless you really really want to learn the material, I would not recommend it. The lectures often fail to be engaging because the material is either hard to understand or poorly explained, and there is very little student support.",
                "I think the course in its current form is less daunting and better organized than past course evaluations imply. Would recommend if you want to learn thermo\/stat mech for any reason.",
                "If Read is teaching it I would say wait if you can. This optimizes your learning for the subject cuz it can go two ways:\r\n\r\n1) You get a new instructor who may give the course better structure. \r\n\r\n2) You get Read again. Though he's not the most receptive to feedback, he is aware of it and he will tweak the difficulty at some points. That being said, he'll have some more experience in a later year.",
                "Yes.  If you are an intensive physics major, you have to take a course in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and I thought this class was super interesting, and suitable for undergrads.  The material is really cool, especially when you discuss applications of the canonical and grand canonical distributions to quantum systems.",

                "If you're in the intensive Physics major, you have to take this. If you're not and you're simply curious about stat mech, you're better off reading a textbook."
