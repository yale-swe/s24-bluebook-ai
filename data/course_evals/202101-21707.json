            "comments": [
                "Strengths - This class is well-organized, teaching you lab and writing techniques you'll use in your future as a scientist. I enjoyed the labs themselves (lots of pretty colors), I enjoyed the lab lectures (lots of fun science trivia), and I enjoyed writing the reports and digging deep into the literature. The written feedback on reports is incredibly thorough, thoughtful, and helpful, pointing out what you did well and where you could improve in the future. I grew a lot as a writer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Experiment 3 Report was one of the most difficult things I've ever put together (and this is including pchem lab reports). I think this report needs to be split up into 2 separate lab reports or require less data analysis. Or maybe more context needs to be given in the packet or in lecture. It was a lot to have to learn both how to use the computational clusters and also to figure out Tanabe-Sugano diagrams, not to mention that the workload overall was already x4 just bc of the sheer number of complexes we made and had to talk about. I'm proud of this report, and I learned a lot, but it was easily x4 the amount of hours put into any other report in this class.",
                "The major strength is in learning how to write a lab report in the ACS style, which is far more complex and time consuming than typical lab reports for non-advanced classes. The major weakness was the lack of clear information in the syllabus. For all of the writing assignments in the course, there was no information about them or very little information given until they were about to happen. What the writing class consists of should be clearly demarcated at the beginning of the term so students know whether they want to take this class WR or not. The deadlines often changed for all assignments, but the communication was never made clear in advance. I also think Friday afternoon lecture is perhaps not the best time to have an engaging lecture with students, especially in a zoom format.",
                "The strengths are the structure of these experiments. It is evident that these have all been carefully chosen and crafted by Professor Parr. I think lab 3 could be improved by being more explicit in what was required. I recall being overwhelmed by all the information we had to analyze and trying to write its narrative. A weakness is that there were also times when Professor Parr assumed I knew concepts but too much time had passed since I had learned them or I never actually did. Overall though, probably the best lab class I have taken at Yale.",
                "This course is truly phenomenal. I enjoyed the experiments and Dr. Parr was engaging every step of the way. That being said, the workload for this course was very heavy. I think 3 lab reports, instead of 4, may have been more manageable, given the amount of calculations and writing involved in certain weeks.",
                "It's a good lab class but the deadlines and organization were sometimes not ideal. Well often cover things necessary to write the lab report 4 days before its due which was quite annoying. There was not much guidance given on some assignments for the WR credit like the final review paper.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this course is Professor Parr and his comments on your lab reports. I've never received such clear and helpful feedback on any of my work since coming to Yale.",
                "The course is fairly disorganized. It is very unclear when deadlines are, especially when the syllabus has dates on it that change all the time. Assignments are generally unclear. However, Parr gives very good, detailed feedback on your lab reports and you will actually improve your scientific writing by taking this course. However, if you are taking it for a WR, beware that the final assignment is quite extensive and it'll be very difficult to complete in the midst of your final lab report and other final exams.",
                "I believe this course was taught extremely well, especially given COVID. One thing I found really helpful was that the lab classes were recorded, which allowed for not only flexibility with when I could watch the class, but more importantly allowed me to go back and watch videos for previous classes multiple times, which really helped when the material was technical or complicated, and my note taking in real time was not sufficient. My only issue with the class was that sometimes the schedule was not clear, and was not updated enough throughout the semester, but this is mostly only a problem for this semester because it was extra confusing with the break days.",
                "Strengths--really interesting content, clear instructions, help always available if you ask, and very clear and detailed feedback on how to improve. No weaknesses!",

                "Absolutely! This is one of my favorite classes that I've taken in the chem dpt. The time spent in lab is fun, the lecture is engaging and interactive (though information-dense), and the 4 reports are fun and different, so it truly feels like you're learning something new every time. The workload is pretty spread out (except report 3, which took 4x the amount of time as any other report). The written feedback on reports is the most thorough I've ever received. I grew a lot as a writer and now even approach reading papers in a different way.",

Additionally, the labs are fun and not too complicated, so you can get a good sense of the science behind each experiment.",
                "I learned a good amount about writing, but I feel like oftentimes Parr wouldn't give the clearest guidance or explanation. For example, there was a lab where we had to use the computing clusters, and we almost nobody in the class could do it. Other times, Parr would talk about things in lecture that were just way above our heads.",
                "100%.  The labs were really cool and I feel like I genuinely learned a lot regarding practical chemistry techniques and writing lab reports that emulate lab scientific papers in the real world. Also Dr. Parr is amazing and really really helpful in all regards. As far as chemistry classes for the chem major go this one has been hands down my favorite.",
