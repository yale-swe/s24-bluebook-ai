                "Strengths: Prof Kraus is a gem. The poem is really fun, and basically the opposite of boring. Weekly quizzes were great for reviewing and improving my Latin and also took pressure off us (I liked them better than a big midterm test). I liked that we did some of the readings in English to get a broader view of the poem as well. Weaknesses: Class discussion often wandered a little far afield into areas that just a couple people in the class were familiar with, which just made it harder to follow for everyone else, so class time was sometimes less enjoyable. Also, the length of Latin readings increased dramatically throughout the semester (from 50-60 lines to 110 lines), which piled up a lot of stress for me at the end.",
                "It was extremely well-organized. The readings were always pertinent and very interesting. We could have, perhaps, lingered on the language a bit more given its complexity"
