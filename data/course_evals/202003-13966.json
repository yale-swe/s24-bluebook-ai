                "I think the biggest thing I learned during this course is to challenge beliefs or knowledge being presented to me. Instead of taking information as it comes, I have learned to ask \"who\/what perspective is missing here?\" when reading any text that presents itself as the whole story. I developed my sense of self by challenging the assumptions I had about education policy. I developed skills of writing policy briefs, presenting over zoom, and reading texts that aren't presented as traditional texts (STALLED, etc).",

I also learned how to write a policy brief which I feel will be very helpful in the future. We also looked very close at policies and looked at the way they may have loopholes, how they can be co-opted, and how they must change in order to better (or actually) serve the communities they intend to.",

                "- Great variety of policy areas and sources that gave us insight into the applications of theory into actual policy language\/ writing \r\n- It was amazing how much we were able to cover without sacrificing time that students have to read through the units \r\n\r\n- Although the Policy brief assignment was useful, I wish that there was more time and attention given in order to help us better prepare for and develop that skill. \r\n- Instructions were  confusing at times and led us to spending a lot of class time clearning up confusion; it could help to just reduce all of the things that were being done in general.",
                "Strengths: the professors, the other students, the topics\/material, pretty much everything\r\nWeaknesses: I think the only weakness comes from this being the first time the course was taught so I think its just some adjustments to assignments etc but we made changes along the way!",
                "Though with potential and good intentions, I wish there was more organization to truly have deep discussions. I felt like oftentimes the readings would just be left to the side and not engaged with fully during class. I also think that this organization goes for assignments as well, as sometimes things got overwhelming. Though there were moments I wanted to engage in a creative and meaningful way, I felt too overwhelmed to.",
                "Strengths: The professors care so much. The inclusion of a week on Indigenous theory was wonderful. The classroom was always very supportive and the professors asked for student feedback. The assignments were interesting!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of assignments was a lot. The class would have been a lot less stressful if the workload was even a tiny bit smaller. It was the hardest\/most work heavy class I've ever taken.",
                "The structure of the course I thought was both a strength and a weakness. While it was easy to follow having the different intersections of identity apply to education, I think it would be good to have more than just one class dedicated to discussing the intersection between all of these identities and cross sections.",
                "The workload of the course felt too heavy for the circumstances of this semester.",
                "Strengths: Touches on very relevant topics that every person in education should be exposed to and have conversations about. Craig and Andrew are very engaging and always use the feedback they receive. They also practice what they teach so there is a consistent connection between the ways what we learn is possible in a setting of education. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class does focus on policy, as it says in the course title, which may be less engaging for some who would rather engage in more direct action, but nonetheless the course provides the opportunity to be critical of policy and its efficacy.",
                "The only (minor) weakness about this course was the lack of depth in engaging with text. The readings were all informative and thought-provoking but we didn't spend as much time discussing the text as we could have."

                "I think implementing the mindful minutes at the beginning of class was a success because it allowed me to center myself in the present before diving into curriculum and discussion. I also think think allowing a few minutes to take your eyes off the screen in the middle of class was very helpful to come back fresh to the discussion. Another success was how accessible the readings were. Having them on course reader allowed me to plan my weeks more easily because I could evaluate how much time it would take me to do the readings, and it reduced stress added from COVID.",
                "I liked the posting of grades on Canvas, the use of Zoom library study hall break out rooms, Zoom polls, small and large group discussions, the break halfway through class, and the use of different mediums (videos, social media, etc.) to convey information was all very helpful. \r\n\r\nI think the group projects were a little difficult to do remotely because time zones vary for everyone and it can be difficult to engage with people on Zoom because of Zoom fatigue."

No matter your focus of study here, education policy impacts us all, and it is important to understand the implications of it. Also, decision making is not just isolated to education, and this course gave me an insight into how that process works.",

Both of the professors are deeply committed to their students' well-beings and very understanding. They are genuinely open to suggestions to improve the course and students were very involved in shaping how class operated."
