                "Strength: Sun is such an amazing person who is just so so so supportive of her students. \r\nWeakness: I think some of the content could have been elaborated better through a handout that clarified the key models that we are expected to know. I partially blame it on zoom, but it was a bit difficult to follow along in some parts of the lecture.",
                "I wish we worked more on the final paper in class? I thought it was fun that we could dive deep into whatever we want.",
                "Strengths: I really appreciated the opportunity to work with a group on problem sets and also on student presentations, as it was lovely to be able to work with and hear from my peers and engage in discussion and collaboration about the most recent papers in the urban economics field. The major strength of this course is Sun herself. She is such a wonderful professor, with engaging lectures and anecdotes, and is so willing to host office hours and help students craft paper proposals that make sense and are of interest to them. Not only is the course content so wonderful and interesting, but she is herself a big reason why this course was a success.",
                "Strengths: Sun is such a warm and enthusiastic professor. She does a good job of engaging the class even on an online format, and she was always very open to feedback and flexible in terms of scheduling assignments. She really seemed to care about each one of us!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like I could have learned more if we didn't have student presentations once a week. The presentations were interesting but based mostly off of memorizing papers that we would read for class, so I didn't feel like I learned anything in depth, just a lot of different things at a shallow level.",
                "Professor Sun is the best human on this earth.",
                "Prof Sun is a great teacher! She really does a superb job of being there for us to ensure that we understand the material. Her office hours are convenient and the lectures are well formated!",
                "The biggest strength is that Sun is by far the most caring, thoughtful professor I've had at Yale. Aside from the unparalleled effort she puts in, she is also an extremely knowledgable and skilled professor. The material is really interesting as well. No weaknesses come to mind.",

                "I liked how engaging the professor was; she even made the effort to cold call on us -- which I liked; I also liked hearing student presentations on the papers\r\n\r\nIn terms of assignments, the group partnerships seemed to not work very well. I'd prefer, because of that, to possibly split pset 1 into multiple psets or just encourage working alone.",
                "The biggest strength of the class was the professor's clear enthusiasm for the subject matter and effort to make the class enjoyable for all of us. I also thought that some of the papers we read were extremely interesting and insightful.\r\n\r\nI thought the biggest weakness of the class was that we didn't really go in depth enough. The class often focused on details that were relatively obvious, rather than economic models. There were two problem sets that went more in depth, but I felt relatively unprepared for them.",
                "I think this class would be better if it was either a) about a specific region or b)about a specific model. It was hard to learn such a wide breadth of topics.",

In addition, there were a lot of student presentations, which often were interactive but only at the very end, which made the class less engaging.

Furthermore, she really cares a lot about each individual student and the subject matter of the class.

This course gives you a toolkit by which you can explore a specific topic of interest while also learning from peers and the instructor. This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale simply because the classroom environment was so supportive, intellectually stimulating, and fun to be in, even though it was over Zoom. Moreover, Sun is incredibly flexible and kind, making sure that each student is supported and feels welcome in the classroom. There are very few professors like her at Yale who are as approachable and good mentors as she is.",

                "I would recommend it to somebody who knows they are interested in the economics of cities. I was mainly taking it to learn more about urban economics, and it wasn't a great class for me. Though there were parts of the class that were interesting, I'm not sure I came out with all that much more knowledge. I think a lot of this was because it became hard for me to focus in class, more so than other classes, and I didn't absorb as much as I could have.",
