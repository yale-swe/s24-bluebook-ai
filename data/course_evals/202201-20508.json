            "comments": [
                "I very much appreciated the focus on programming (as it seems the most relevant method of learning statistics). That said, some focus on problems outside of programming could be useful in preparing for the midterm\/final. The online lectures were also very well done.",
                "The design of the course was great!",
                "very practical.",
                "I liked that the course had prerecorded lectures but also live classes for questions, etc.; it was helpful in offering flexibility with scheduling, and I always like having lecture videos to revisit them for exams, notes, etc. Sometimes the material felt a bit repetitive, but I suppose it is better to have it clearly examined than sped through.",
                "Loved the asynchronous options. Seemed very well suited for different students' learning styles.",
                "The class was pretty thorough and I feel like I have a good baseline in statistics. Professor Meyers is very knowledgeable and structured the course well. His reinforcement of previous material in order to make us retain the information was nice. The asynchronous format gave people a lot of flexibility; however, it also made me feel more disengaged with the course. I would attend the in-person lecture the majority of the time and often felt that I should have gotten some extra sleep instead because I didn't learn anything new.",
                "I think one of the strengths of the class was the flipped classroom system. Essentially, these were Canvas quizzes that had videos teaching us content, and then there would be practice questions about the material, but these weren't actually graded. This was a really great way of learning the content and you were able to do it at your own pace at your own time, which I really liked. I think the usage of Ed discussion could be improved. Using Ed is a mandatory part of the course as it accounts for 3% of your grade, but it felt kind of disorganized, particularly before the midterm\/final exam. A lot of people had questions and they would take a long time to be answered.",
                "The class is very well organized!",
                "i like the flexibility that professor meyers provided with asynchronous pre-class videos",
                "The strengths were that the course was very supportive, with homework emphasizing what you were learning in lecture. I think it could be improved by either offering the online videos and having an office-hours \/ homework session during class time or by taking away the videos and having only lecture.",
                "Professor Meyers is fantastic at explaining concepts. Normally I'm not a math student, but I always felt like I knew what was going on in class. He repeats himself often, which is really helpful, and his problem sets and exams always have an appropriate level of difficulty. He never tested us on something that he hadn't taught.",
                "I liked the flipped classroom format. The in-person lectures did get repetitive though.",
                "Strengths include various office hours and prerecorded lectures that allow students to go back and review difficult concepts. Weaknesses include some power points being difficult to understand.",
                "the hybrid model was kind of confusing and made it difficult to stay engaged with the course, but i really liked learning how to use r",
                "Strengths: Professor Meyers is a good lecturer, and he did a lot of review of concepts.",
                "All the lectures were in prerecorded videos so I never went to class which probably wasnt great but it was nice because then I didnt have to wake up for a 9am class",
                "Strengths: Well-taught, material was easy to learn\r\nWeakness: Felt like the learning process could have been spiced up a bit more",
                "Use of tutorials can be good for the class",
                "I liked the asynchronous nature of the course.",
                "Great course, many options to learn",
                "The class was paced weirdly. The difficult material was rushed at the end while the easy material had an inordinate amount of time placed on it at the beginning. I think that less time should be spent on mean and median.",
                "The asynchronous nature of the course allowed students to learn the material at their own pace, which is both a strength and a weakness, as though it allowed students to complete the course as they desired, it also meant that some students would be \"dragged along\" the course as opposed to being actively on top of it.",
                "I love the structure of this course. It was probably my favorite structure thus far at yale. It was a mix of remote and in person learning. I loved the posted videos because it was the same material as in class and I was able to rewatch them and go back to them as often as I wanted to. This helped me a lot.",
                "The course material was very accessible and the homework helped with understanding the material.",
                "Strengths: flipped learning. I liked how it was online. TF office hours were great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: towards the end of the class, felt confused about the lectures. Felt like a lot of information was coming in at once.",
                "Strengths of the course are that all the videos are posted online and the information is clear, weaknesses are that the lectures are kind of dry and the class times were at 9am, so it was hard to stay motivated asynchronously",
                "Well Organized. no complaints",
                "Strengths: Well communicated deadlines, in-depth videos, and Professor Meyers seems like a nice guy.\r\nWeaknesses: TOO MUCH R. The tests have questions about critical concepts that aren't communicated very well during class. Class times were largely useless (the videos were more informative). And 9 AM is way too early.",
                "Strengths: TFs during office hours are really helpful for completing problem sets. The questions on the problem sets themselves were very fair and really helped to solidify my understanding of the material. The lectures are asynchronous and pre-recorded, which I found to be a plus. The exams are pretty fair. Ed discussion was a great resource for asking questions, and both Professor Meyers and the TFs were usually quick to respond. || Weaknesses: I wish the expectations for the \"participation score\" had been more explicitly stated. More access to practice problems for exam preparation would be appreciated.",
                "The main strength of the course was the flexibility we were allowed in terms of how we chose to learn the content. I really appreciated the asynchronous video option because it let me actually get ahead on topics so that I could get an early start on each week's pset. In terms of improvements, the practice midterm but especially the practice final didn't really reflect how the actual exams were structured. The midterm and final were significantly harder than the psets, and the kinds of questions asked were also somewhat different from the homework. But other than that this was a good course.",
                "The professor is a great lecturer and good at explaining concepts and R. The exams are difficult and may cover some content not explicitly stated in lectures.",
                "Strengths- Always engaging with the students and really going over how to answer questions\r\nWeaknesses- Getting points deducted on exams if u answer the wrong one instead of receiving no credit",
                "remote, asynchronous structure was both a strength and a weakness",
                "This class was really strong because the professor offered different ways to engage with the materialin person lectures, prerecorded quiz-style lectures and recordings of live lectures. The problem sets were also really helpful in reinforcing what was taught during lecture.",
                "good class",
                "Strengths: The professor and TAs were very available and helpful; the course was very accessible for those students (like me) who had limited experience with statistics; the assignments and exams were not too difficult and actually really helped me understand the concepts better. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The split\/flipped classroom idea was sometimes convenient, but as someone who often attended the live in-person classes it made the class a little bit repetitive.",
                "Strengths: Prof Meyers is a rlly good lecturer so concepts are explained well and you develop a good grasp of the logic behind the code. TAs this semester were extremely helpful and also able to clearly explain.",
                "This course allowed flexibility for various learning modes  including in-person lectures, online videos, and practice problems. I appreciate the office hours and Ed Discussion Forum, as they provided fantastic opportunities to ask questions and ensure understanding. Moving forward, it would be helpful to have additional practice problems (including multiple choice) leading up to exams.",
                "Not very engaging, and can be repetitive at times",
                "The strengths are the flexibility of the course format- it is both in person and online, and there are ample opportunities to access help and extra resources. One weakness is that the time that the course takes place and the lack of people attending class in person made it less welcoming (though not the fault of the professor).",
                "I think it was well taught, and it was a great intro course. The negative side of this class was that it was asynchronous the whole year. This made it very different, and I didnt like it as much as I would have if it had been in person. We didnt get to interact with our peers as we would in a normal class setting.",
                "writing code during exams was a bit challenging given that i was used to typing code in R.",
                "Lot of work and the content is pretty wide, but overral I learned a lot.",
                "It was nice to have all of the lectures on video, but I think it would be beneficial to have some sort of discussion section for questions.",
                "The strengths of this course were the brilliant teaching team and the community they built. Through office hours and Ed Discussions, there was always someone I could reach out to if I had a question, which I really appreciated. Although I would also say that the flipped, asynchronous content of this course was a strength (it granted me the flexibility to reference material throughout the semester), it did become a bit tedious over the course of the semester. I sometimes wished that Professor Meyers would require more mandatory, in-person engagement in order to better my understanding of the course topics.",
                "I really appreciated the flipped classroom format and the various methods the instructor offered to engage with the material. I really appreciated having the ability to review and rewatch lectures at various points during the course."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course who would like to gain a basic introduction to statistics.",
                "I would because I learned a lot but I would have liked it better if the class was offered at a different time of the day",
                "Absolutely not. Avoid this class at all costs. A very long pset, HOURS of videos, plus two 9 am lectures per week! Its way too much work, and Ethan Myers does not make lectures enjoyable.",
                "Yes, if the student wants a foundational understanding of statistics this is a great course for it.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in gaining skills in R programming and some foundational statistical concepts",
                "Yes. Great course to learn Stats and coding in R",
                "I would recommend this course to another student; the workload was fair and I learned a bit.",
                "If this student is disciplined and works well in asynchronous settings, yes. Otherwise I think I'd be a bit weary of it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think it is very valuable to learn about statistics and data science especially at this level.",
                "If the student has never studied statistics before then this is a great starting point.",
                "To be transparent, I took this class for a QR credit. I think its a good one to take if youre not really interested in pursuing a major in the STEM field, but want to get a basic understanding of stats. I think stats can also be really helpful in the social sciences, and have found that this class has helped me in my social science classes. So, if this is something that interests you, yes.",
                "Yes! Classes build upon each other in a way that makes sense and grew my interest in statistics.",
                "Only if they want a solid basic introduction to statistics. This course is what it says it is -- nothing more and nothing less. I learned a lot but it wasn't taught in a very exciting or inspiring manner.",
                "Yes. great way to get an R intro if you don't have background in coding",
                "No. Do not take this class if you just need a QR credit. I came into it thinking it would be fairly easy since I have taken AP Stats, but it doesn't help outside of the first few p-sets. This class is a lot of R; bewaRe.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a basic introduction to statistical concepts. The topics we learned are useful for all kinds of research fields. I also greatly appreciated how the concepts were reinforced using R, as the class serves as a great introduction to the programming language. Professor Meyers' explanations during pre-recorded lectures are usually very clear, and in general, I learned a lot in this class.",
                "Yes, especially if you are looking for a QR but not planning to study anything math related. The actual content covered is pretty straightforward, and, while I wasn't found R confusing at the beginning, it's actually a very useful skill to have, especially if you have no other coding experience. The psets line up very well with the code covered in lectures\/videos.",
                "yes! good introductory stats class",
                "Yes! I think this is a great introduction to statistics and makes me wish I had more time to explore the subject.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, its great for anyone who wants to see if statistics and data science might be a good route for them or just wants an accessible QR credit.",
                "Yes to develop an intuition and foundation of statistical thinking which can be broadly applied to many fields.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student (and already have!). This is a great course to learn statistics and engage in this new area. I had no background in statistics and was nervous about taking this class. However, I was supported through this class and appreciated the Professor and the teaching fellows.",
                "Probably not, just wasn't engaging enough and didn't show us enough applications of the concepts we were learning",
                "Yes- especially if the student has not taken a class in statistics before, this course gave me a basic understanding and I think it prepared me for further statistical courses in the future.",
                "I would because I find this class interesting, but I wouldnt recommend a student to take it if it was asynchronous again.",
                "Yes! For those looking for a QR class or an intro to stats without background, it's a great introductory course that incorporates lots of learning modalities. It made me want to take more stats.",
                "Yes. A good course to start learning stats without previous background in coding or calculus",
                "Yes, but keep in mind theres a LOT of R studio coding involved.",
                "I would recommend this course as it is a great introduction to the statistics world and provides a gateway to many other courses.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I had a wonderful time taking it, and I feel like I really learned a lot through it. The course is extremely well-organized, and the teaching team is welcoming and dedicated to helping you better learn the material. It was the perfect introduction to the field of Statistics, particularly for a non-STEM student like myself.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain an understanding of statistics or experience in R and R Studio."
