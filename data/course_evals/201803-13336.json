   "comments": [
    "I learned an extensive overview of Latin grammar as well as interesting anecdotes about Roman history and Latin phrases. I developed insights regarding the connection between the Latin and English languages as well as connections between elements of Latin.",
    "I went into this course hoping to get a foundation in reading latin and Im coming out of essentially being able to read any Latin. The course is fast-paced but manageable. I also feel like understanding syntax in Latin has given me a better understanding of the function of syntax in English.",
    "I learned the basics of Latin grammar and the skills required to read introductory Latin passages.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Latin grammar, and learned basic latin vocabulary. I gained knowledge on Latin syntax and sentence structure, specifically all the declensions and conjugations of latin, all tenses, moods, and voices for all conjugations of verbs. In context, this helped me read short passages (with glosses, or definitions of words we did not know) by Vergil, Cicero, Caesar, and Ovid, all of which we read by the end of the semester. We also practiced a lot of translation (mostly Latin to English, but occasionally English to Latin).",
    "I learnt how to read an translate Latin sentences. I also learned how to dissect how a latin sentence is formed and its syntax.",
    "I learned how to better grasp a new language through understanding grammar.",
    "Latin grammar, syntax, morphology, and sentence structure. Began to develop the ability to translate Latin sentences into English and compose English sentences in Latin. A brief introduction to Latin poetry and verse.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the basic elements of Latin grammar and some idea of Latin literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course is very strong in teaching grammar and drilling sentence construction. However, the textbook often uses phrases like \"Memorize this phrase\" or \"memorize this construction.\" I find those phrases extremely frustrating because they emphasize memorization rather than finding linguistic patterns which would lead to deeper learning.",
    "Strengths-really good understanding TFs who were more than willing to work with students \r\n\r\nWeaknesses-copious homework (but the TF worked with us to set a feasible amount)",
    "Because the class meets every day, there is not really much room to fall behind. Which helped me stay up to date on the information we learned. Professor Brown continued to make sure we maintained a good understanding of the vocab and grammar.",
    "One strength (yet also a weakness) was the pacing of this course: although at times it seemed rushed, as a student it felt like it was just enough to be able to have a strong foundation in Latin grammar by the end of the semester. Another strength was the outstanding teaching by the Classics department (Dexter Brown was an amazing teacher, and I have heard good things about Noreen Sit too [who just so happens to be teaching LATN 141 next semester!]). Therefore, I think anyone from the Classics department would be well-equipped to teach this course with amazing success.",
    "I felt that this course was taught well. However I thought it started moving too quickly after chapter 7. I also felt that we should have had access to the anki flash cards earlier.",
    "I thought the overall workload was necessary and manageable. However, I might have understood some chapters of the textbook better if I had more time to learn their content.",
    "One strength is the way the course is organized. We had regular homework to practice morphology and translation, and we would go over these exercises along with general questions in class. We did practice synopses and fun short group exercises to work on memorizing declensions and conjugations. The weekly quizzes were manageable. My only problem with the course was having a different instructor on Monday in the \"lab\" section, usually after the quiz. While Liam was a good teacher, I would've preferred to have the same teacher throughout to ensure complete consistency. Translating Latin is more of an art than a science, so Dexter and Liam understandably sometimes differed in how they would translate the same text."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "For anyone wishing to learn Latin, it is a strong course, but it is very fast paced.",
    "Yes",
    "Latin 110 was definitely the biggest time commitment among my classes, however I would still recommend the class to other students who might be interested in Latin as a language or the history of Rome. By the end of the semester you will likely be shocked by the amount of information you were able to learn over a few months. Additionally, you will have the skills required to read introductory passages in Latin, which is rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, even if you have already fulfilled your language requirement. Latin is one of the best taught languages in my opinion, and I cannot think of a single aspect wrong with this course. Latin is an amazing language which helps you understand both roots of words in the English language as well as understand the ancestral language that led to the Romance languages. More importantly, it allows you to understand scholarly writings in history as well as the history of the dominating Roman civilization (and its art forms).",
    "I would only recommend it if they have a lot of time to commit to this hard class. Also if they are passionate about Latin or have some sort of background in it.",
    "Yes, this course is great for learning a unique language that many overlook when choosing a language credit.",
    "Yes. As long as you are prepared to do Latin everyday and spend time practicing some of the memorized stuff, it is a great course. Put in a little extra work early on (when other classes haven't picked up too much) to make it easier on yourself later.",
    "Yes"
