                "The strengths of the course are that it is a very rigorous course that allows you to learn a lot in very short time. The class is also very engaging!",
                "It is very well suited for heritage speakers because there is a greater emphasis on writing and reading as well as conversation rather than specific grammar points. However, I had a bit of trouble knowing the latter vocabulary since they were more specific than the types of conversations me and my parents would have, but I could catch up since we worked on it every day.",
                "Strengths: high participation, rigorous workload\r\nCould be improved with faster feedback on homework? I think I found myself making the same mistakes more than once before corrections came back and I realized what I was doing wrong. I understand that there is a lot of homework to grade though",
                "A major strength was the extrememly organized structure of the course and definitely the amazing professor I had. Professor Chan was extremely friendly and caring as a professor and her enthusiasm carried the class all the way to the end. She was always keeping the class engaged and attentive. A weakness of the course is also a necessity of it - learning Chinese is a very intensive and process and both consumes large amounts of time and mental capacity. My stress peaked around 2 months in when I still was getting used to the heavy workload of having daily homework assignments, journals, and new-vocab drilling which equated to around 2-3 hours a night. After then, though, I got into a better flow of doing my daily work. It was a bit of a chore to stay so on-top of things because it was a never-ending marathon, and I definitely felt my motivation waning near the end, but it was worth it. A minor weakness would be that professor Chan isn't the most timely with getting assignments in - it was mostly due to technically difficulties with getting adjusted to doing the whole class online though, and we usually would get grades back at most a week after the fact."

Especially if you are a heritage speaker, I know I would not have learned this much on my own through self studying, and it is special to be able to learn a native language that has died down throughout years of English schooling alongside people like you! It is an amazing community and much more fulfilling than any of my other classes because I know that this knowledge will just progress and be a part of my daily life with my family.",

If you are someone who wants to impress your Asian parents who have been nagging you about not knowing how to read or write in Chinese or are just wanting to expand your knowledge past basic listening and speaking this class is perfect for you! You will feel very cared for as a student and the projects\/groupwork you do will also help you get to know your peers (as if the 4 times a week interactive sessions weren't enough to help you get to know your classmates haha)!"
