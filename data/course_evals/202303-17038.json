My only complaint about the current setup is the final deadline -- I wish we had one more week to submit the final essay! (It's due the Sunday before the last week of classes, well before reading week starts, so it can be very stressful juggling this task with other final coursework as that deadline approaches.)",

I highly recommend doing independent research regardless -- the senior seminars are great, but you'll get so much more out of this opportunity if you work independently.",
                "Yes! I am super happy that I did a thesis, and that I did it in one semester. It definitely satisfied my interest in doing a research project of my own choosing, in a lot of depth, without the stress of a yearlong project. I think especially if you're AMST and looking to write a traditional paper, this is a perfect timeline to create something."
