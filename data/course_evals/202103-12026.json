                "This was an amazing class. I liked how small it was. There was a lot of individual attention and small group interactions, which I much prefer to larger lecture classes.",
                "I think the resources that Hal picked to study from were diverse and extremely relevant to what we put into practice in class. I think some of the work felt unclear as to how to garner a good grade so more transparency would be helpful.",
                "I loved all the readings we did and our scene and monologue work. I would have liked more time working on our final scenes and discussing the readings in more depth. Sometimes it felt like there were too many assignments that we didnt get to spend enough time on all of them. We received very clear feedback on all assignments, though, which was super helpful.",
                "Strengths: Variety in class styles (class discussions, activities, improvisations, rehearsals), good readings; fun, exciting class, lots of personal feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes a bit slow (for example, we only did 3 acting presentations), beginning of the semester was a bit slow and end was a bit rushed; so I guess, better course pacing. I would love to have more instruction on the similarities and differences in the teachings of Hagen, Stanislavski, and Gillett; sometimes, they blended together for me.",
                "Overall, an enjoyable class. I really liked doing the readings of famous acting teachers, like Hagen and Stanislavski. It was nice being able to work on scenes and monologues. One weakness would be the timing of the course. I feel like we spent too much time on monologues and our senes and didn't get enough time for the final project."

                "If you are interested in theater and acting specifically, I would! You can learn a lot and develop your skill set in this class, and Hal is a great instructor.",
                "Yes I would! Especially for students with no prior acting experience. Hal is great!",
                "Yes I would. If you haven't taken an acting class before, it gives a nice foundation and an opportunity to work on scenes. If you took acting in high school, it might feel repetitive and a little slow. Overall is pretty fun, not too much work, and gives a good base understanding of acting techniques and practices."
