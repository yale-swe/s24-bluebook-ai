                "We learned a lot about the history of East Germany, though most of it in pretty abstract terms. Since it's a language credit and not a history credit the focus was mostly on giving a picture of life and politics in the DDR rather than an exhaustive historical picture or having us memorize dates. We had a few vocabulary quizzes, which were generally pretty easy and just made sure that we were on top of the specific terms that were relevant to the period.",
                "I practiced my conversational German skills and got a decent overview of what life in the DDR was like. There was also some amount of grammar practice.",
                "I learned a lot about the history and culture of East Germany and bettered my German skills.",
                "This course most challenged my ability to speak, write, and understand written German. Of course, I learned so much about the history of the DDR via secondary and primary sources, but it was really a challenging course regarding the language of German.",
                "I learned a lot about East Germany from the historical and personal perspectives.",
                "I learned so much about life in East Germany  and was exposed much more to authentic\/colloquial German language through this course."

                "Dr. Schenker's teaching is one of the big strengths; she knows how to get the class involved in learning (ex: we all had to present on one topic from DDR history, so we all researched at least one thing in depth) and uses fun activities to keep everyone engaged.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Schenker is incredibly kind and the topic is clearly near and dear to her heart, and our classroom was always a fun social space. I also enjoyed the email exchange program much more than I had expected to. The workload of the class is well spread-out across the entire semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Above all, this class is easier than an advanced L5 class should be. The highest level of German course on offer should not have students who struggle to hold a conversation about an analytical topic  they belong in lower-level courses. This is a shame, because the course was oversubscribed and so the level could definitely have been raised a little to benefit the stronger students. I mostly took this class because I wanted more German writing practice, but there were very few times writing assignments that received substantive feedback. Much of the class involves discussing the most recent reading assignments in small groups or listening to student presentations, both of which are not super engaging or helpful in cultivating language skills. \r\nOne suggestion for improvement is for the instructor to send out periodic updates on what assignments are due when  there were lots of minor assignments that could slip through the cracks if you weren't paying close attention to Canvas.",
                "Strengths: interesting subject material, awesome and knowledgeable professor, cool exchange with former East Germans\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of small assignments that were sometimes listed in different places",
                "More general focus on the history of the East German state.",
                "There was always so much to learn! Frau Schenker put an immense amount of effort into making the course engaging for us, and I knew that I had to bring my best to the class every day to match this energy. One strength of the class was that although everyone was on completely different levels, Frau Schenker made sure that everyone could get through the material and get something out of each activity. One weakness was that, because there were so many readings, it felt sometimes as though there wasn't always a through line.",
                "Strengths: email exchange with someone who lived in East Germany. Diverse learning materials\r\nWeaknesses: level\/quantity of reading material was sometimes too difficult and grammar lessons were breezed through",
                "I enjoyed the different formats of learning in this coursefor example, learning language through movies, interviews, exchange partners, worksheets, games, etc. I think I wouldve also enjoyed more activities where we could practicing more niche structures of German language (like how we learned to transform verbs into adjectives in German. An example in English is the verb run to say the running child)."

If you're a heritage speaker or speak very advanced German, you probably won't get all that much out of this course. If you want to learn how to write better, this class probably isn't for you either.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course. It's an awesome opportunity to improve your German and learn about a very interesting subject. I've taken several courses with Prof. Schenker and have enjoyed them all.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who want to become more 'spontaneous' in every aspect of their german language education. It takes a fair amount of foundation to be able to be apart of this class, but you get so much out of it at the same time.",
                "Yes if you're interested in East Germany. It's a really cool topic and a unique way to learn about the country",
                "Yes! I personally think East German history is often overlooked, and this class does a wonderful job of simultaneously teaching you German history and the German language."
