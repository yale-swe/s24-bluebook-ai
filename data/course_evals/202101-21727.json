                "Range of material was great, loved the class discussions, assignments graded very quickly",

                "I don't have any weaknesses for this course. Students are kept engaged through the small seminar format and there is plenty of opportunity for discussion and engagement. The assignments are all clear and reasonable. I highly recommend this course! All of the assignments are finished before reading period so you don't have to worry about extra work during finals.",
                "Strengths: the content is highly diverse and very interesting. The topics covered broad areas related to business, but all with a clear ethical lens that made the class less focused on technical knowledge and more on social dilemmas and ethical understandings. I enjoyed the variety of homework assignments from documentaries to articles to books and this provided multiple mediums for the class to learn. The professor is wonderful and consistently engages the students with his personal knowledge on all the subjects - but without being overbearing. The breakdown of the assignments is also a strength as it's evenly divided and provides opportunity to grow and improve on both oral and written french.\r\nWeaknesses: it was hard to get feedback on ways to improve on the assignments beyond specific comments. Besides going to a language tutor, it's difficult to overcome problems in pronunciation or grammar which counts as part of the grade but is not addressed or workshopped in class.",
                "The strength of the course is that everyone is able to freely discuss their ideas in a judgment-free zone. The only weaknesses that I can think of are due to the virtual format but nothing to do with the actual course itself.",
                "Love the materials and the style of the course! There's very little that I would want to change about it."
