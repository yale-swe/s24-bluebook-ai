I learned to write a historical research paper using primary and secondary sources.",

The writing  assignments allowed us to synthesize primary and secondary historical sources. The reading  were all very interesting and thoughtfully selected.",

                "Strengths: the reading list, which was fantastic. (In particular, I loved \"Empire of Cotton.\") I liked hearing from my classmates about their discussion papers. I also liked doing research for my final paper; Professor Harms was a fantastic resource and recommended great books about my topic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps it was a function of the virtual classroom, but I found class discussion to be a bit stilted. A friend told me that last year Professor Harms had a TA help lead discussion, which I think would've been great."

The readings are well-selected and give both background information and in-depth accounts of African commodities. Papers aren't super long and you have so much flexibility with the final paper.",
