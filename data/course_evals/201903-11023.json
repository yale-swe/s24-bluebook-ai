    "A basic understanding of writing and speaking French.",
    "I gained elementary writing, listening, and reading skills in French. I learned about verb conjugation in the present, immediate future, imperfect, and perfect tenses. Other grammar concepts included possessive, indicative and interrogative pronouns, negation, and prepositions. The speaking and writing assignments provided great opportunities to integrate these concepts and expand vocabulary.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Instructors, weekly tests encourage consistent preparation and effort.\r\nWeaknesses: The full immersion into French with a focus on new explanation in English is very unhelpful early in the course. Having explanations made in English would make it much easier for students to adjust to the period in the beginning and get their bearings in the course.",
    "The course provided a great deal of speaking and listening practice in class. As a result, I was almost immediately able to pick out words and phrases from class when watching French films or listening to French dialogue. The extensive grammar practice in the workbook and course packet was also very useful. However, not all of the workbook exercises were equally helpful--some of them felt like purely busy-work (finding vocab words in the text). These exercises just added to the stress of the course without lending much useful practice. I think that rather than assign entire chapters from the workbook, the faculty should carefully decide which exercises are worthwhile and only assign those. That would reduce the stress of the class and make it easier for students to make time to practice speaking and listening exercises or review material presented in lecture, both of which are much more useful than the menial exercises in the workbook.",
    "Weaknesses were waking up with my hectic schedule to go to class"

    "If you need to fulfill the language requirement and are really interested in learning French, this course is definitely worth taking. Just be willing to put in a lot of work and spend at least an hour every night devoted to French.",
    "Only take this class if you really want to learn French. The workbook, reading, and course packet assignments take up a lot of time each week. On top of that, you will have to find time to review for an exam each week. The high workload is designed to maximize exposure and reinforce concepts, which is effective but also induces alot of stress. If you're not motivated to learn French, it'll be hard to justify the stress of this course and you probably won't be very happy taking it. However, if you are dead set on learning French, then approach this class as necessary rite of passage into the department and make sure you don't let yourself fall behind.",
