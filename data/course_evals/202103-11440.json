                "This course taught me a lot about the quantitative side of Political Science which I had previously been too afraid of to pursue. I learned a lot (a lot!) of R and data analysis tools which I think will be invaluable to me as I move forward.",
                "I learned a lot about the statistics/data/methodology side of political science, which wasn't something I'd explored much before. Also, I learned a lot about the specifics of how money influences politics, not just on the campaign finance end, but throughout the entire political process, which I think is super important to understand. I gained a much better understanding, also, of how effective (and ineffective) certain reforms can be in leveling the playing field and trying to evenly distribute money in politics and/or take money out of politics.",
                "Learned about the many different ways that money is involved in American politics besides campaign donations and lobbying, the two major sources of money and politics which are most often discussed.",
                "In this course I learned about the variety of ways in which money influences the American political system. I also learned how to use R proficiently and about how to write a political science research article.",
                "Wide knowledge of Money in Politics literature and current research with a focus on methodology and political science as a research practice.",
                "I learned all about how money is involved in our political system.  I also learned a lot about how to do political science and data analysis.",
                "This class teaches you about Money/unequal resources in American politics, but first and foremost it is a research class. It focuses heavily on preparing you for a major final group project and a lot of the focus on the readings was more on the research methods than the results. This was very rewarding by the end of the class when we did an original analysis for the final project"

            "comments": [
                "The readings were heavy and a bit unmanageable at the beginning of the course but Professor Hacker was extremely gracious and responsive to feedback so the readings mellowed out after that. Other than that I thought that the course flowed well and each week we had interesting discussion of the topic at hand. I found the setup of the course, which allowed for time at the end of the semester to focus on the final research project, extremely helpful. I also appreciated the reading responses as they were set up to allow some wiggle room as other class assignments made necessary, and I felt like they were a good way to form cohesive thoughts about the readings both individually and in conversation with each other.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic, readings covered different nuances and perspectives, group capstone project at the end was a really exciting way to bring our knowledge together at the end of the class, also having Sam as a TF was excellent!!!!\r\nWeaknesses: would've benefitted from more class discussion about the topics and content of the readings, not just the methods and tiny details of the experiments in the readings. Class could be pretty dry at times because of that.",
                "The syllabus covered a wide variety of pertinent topics and different scholarly approaches to studying the issues of interest. \r\n\r\nMany people in class did not participate during discussions, which often ended up being relatively small discussions between the Professor and the few students who would engage.",
                "Strengths: the content matter is incredibly important for students interested in politics to know, and Professor Hacker assigns excellent readings. Additionally, there are lots of opportunities to succeed outside of the final project, but the final project is definitely the heart of this course, and it's clear that Professor Hacker takes the class and the research projects really seriously. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Two hours of Professor Hacker's lecturing can be difficult to stick with. Also, there wasn't a ton of support for students to learn Rin the future, the skill sessions should probably focus more on that particular skill and start looking at it earlier in the term so that the TF isn't overwhelmed with teaching everyone in the class how to use the program right before the final project is due.",
                "Strengths: cool format, clear feedback, accessible Professor and TA, nice subject matter, group project\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading assigned at the start, students talked way too quietly and I often couldnt hear their responses, we got into groups for the final project a bit too late in the semester",
                "strengths: great training in political science research, very rewarding final project, labs with the TF were really useful, really fast and helpful feedback on our papers\r\n\r\nweaknesses: there was a lot of reading, though about halfway through the class it became much more manageable when some of the readings were made optional. I think the discussions could have been organized a bit better to really dive into the meaning of the results and to synthesize a picture of how money affected American politics, which sometimes got lost in the focus on research findings and research methods",
                "The primary strength of the course is indubitably Jacob Hacker and Sam Zacher. Professor Hacker did a fantastic job of making class engaging, and Sam did a remarkable job of leading skills sessions with relevant and useful material. \r\n\r\nThe secondary strength of the course is the capstone project, which prepares you for (1) a senior thesis and/or (2) a career as a political scientist. Professor Hacker and Sam offer tremendous support throughout the entire process from ideation to tracking down data to developing analytical methods. If you are interested in conducting quantitative research in political science and don't know where to start, then this course is for you!\r\n\r\nThe only \"weakness\" of this course is the sheer amount of reading assigned each week. With that said, the readings are masterfully curated and each paper assigned is worth reading. You will leave this course with a strong understanding of the multiplicity of ways in which money can and does influence American politics."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who want to learn Political Science data analysis but have previously been intimidated by it. I learned a lot in this course about things I had previously shied away from and I think Professor Hacker and TF Sam made the material much more approachable which I appreciated.",
                "Yes, if you truly are interested in learning about quantitative data and analysis in political science. I didn't know really any of that stuff before taking the class, so it doesn't mean you need to have a background in it, just that you really want to learn. Because all of what we did was based on data and it's not a more debate-focused/ideas class. Read all of the reviews and see what you think, plus the syllabus.",
                "If you are interested in understanding the different avenues through which those with resources can guide American politics policy, this is the course for you. Furthermore, if you are interested in engaging in interesting group projects of your choosing, this course also offerse such an opportunity.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is driven and has worked on original research before. Students without any prior research experience or collaborative project work should not consider this class until they have had exposure to that. It's also not a class for people with a passing interest in political sciencewe really dove into the weeds of money in politics, which taught me so much, but only because I was really interested in the subject. It's probably possible to skate by in this class without learning much and just getting increasingly bored. If you're not particularly fascinated by polisci, that'll be your experience, I'd bet. But if you're really interested in the role that money plays in politicswhich, as a participant in democracy, you probably should bethen this course is fantastic. It's still under development as a practicum, but Professor Hacker is really invested in making it work for everyone, and will adapt it according to students' needs.",
                "Yes. I think it is a really innovative class structure. Prof. Hacker and Sam do a good job challenging you with material while being open to feedback and suggestions.",
                "Yes!  This class really taught me how to conduct research which isnt often taught in political science seminars here.  Professor Hacker is an incredible teacher and very knowledgeable, also a great guy to just chat in office hours.  I think this course is great for both political science majors and other students at Yale.  Even grad and professional school students would enjoy this course",
                "I would recommend this class to someone who is excited to do original analysis of political data and doesn't mind a heavier reading load. The best part of this class was the way it let students be innovative and how it encourages students to make research that is useful beyond the classroom.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you are interested in writing a senior essay, going into academia, or pursuing a career in public policy. Beware that this course will be much more difficult for people without a strong background in statistical methods."
