If you are at all interested in history, even if this is not your region of primary interest, you will learn so much in this class that will help you contextualize relations around the world.",
                "I learned so many specific details about the gendered histories of certain countries in Latin America. I loved how detailed the readings were.",
                "This course taught me a lot about how capitalist\/colonial states have imposed different gender ideologies onto populations in order to serve their interests. We also explore the intersections of class and race with gender.",
                "I learned more about the history of Latin America and the Caribbean especially as it came to governance and how that affected people through a gendered lens.",
                "This course was just fantastic. Not only did it deepen my understanding of the region and time period with which we engaged, but the discussions, weekly writing assignments, and final term paper made me a better and more thoughtful history student. Professor Eller was so dedicated to fostering our interest and skills as history students; through her frequent feedback and suggestions for further reading material, she provided us with endless opportunities to expand our knowledge. In many ways, this class taught me as much about how to be a better student than it did about the specific material we were learning."

                "I love the freedom we get to design our final project. however, I think that the course itself is not extremely coherent. The books were very interesting but I couldnt always see how they related to each other, and I feel like I cant generalize what I learned from one book onto broader historical trends.",
                "Strengths- Prof Eller is very kind and knowledgeable. We read many interesting works across a variety if disciplines. Low stress.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- this class does not really have a common thread; its spans five centuries and two empires (Spanish America and English colonies in the Carribean), and its treatment of gender is quite broad. I learned stuff from this class but I think i could have learned more with additional structure and a more narrow theme or range.",
                "The variety of content is this courses biggest strength. That said, the biggest weakness is that the overall structure could be a bit clearer.",
                "The readings selected for this course l, with the exception of 1 or 2, are absolutely incredible. Each is so informative and interesting, and touches on some part of gender. Professor Eller also did a good job selecting these so that they touched on several aspects of gender and did not feel too repetitive. Another major strength is Professor Eller, who is such an expert but is also really approachable and helpful. The major weakness was that it didnt always feel super accessible for students with no background of this history.",
                "The main strengths of this course lie with Prof. Eller, who is absolutely wonderful and one of the best professors Ive had. I think what I loved most about this course was its lack of rigidity in terms of content Prof. Eller did a great job of allowing us to explore and discuss the topics we wanted. Also, I really appreciated her flexibility with regards to assignments I enjoyed the reading response substitution options and just the fact that expectations were very manageable.",
                "Course readings and class discussions were very interesting. I think the substitutions for reading responses were extremely helpful.",
                "The readings are so well-chosen and interesting. They are just a little long.",
                "The fact that we cover a lot of different countries and long span of time in the course is a strength and a weakness. You will get to explore gender in many different contexts in Latin America however sometimes it's hard to get really deep into a particular context.",
                "The readings were very interesting along with the discussions we had in class with them.  Prof. Eller's excitement about the material really made learning about it all the more exciting.   The breadth of what we learned about this region of the world was really good and I feel like I have a more comprehensive understanding of the history of Latin America and the Caribbean.  I also liked that we were able to explore topics we were interested in through our essays.  The alternate assignments to the weekly reading responses were a very nice course to give students the ability to earn points if they couldn't do the reading response, while also expanding on the topic of the week. \r\n\r\nI think Prof. Eller was also really good about incorporating student feedback into improving the class as we went along like reducing readings by a bit.",
                "The strengths of this course were its organized structure, engaging content, and Professor Eller's enthusiastic teaching. The weekly writing assignments and our class discussions greatly deepened my understanding for each specific reading, while Professor Eller's frequent suggestions and the final term paper kept us focused on the larger narratives and historical dynamics at hand. I particularly loved the opportunity for us to bring in outside connections to replace our discussion posts; I learned so much from my classmates over the course of the term. The weakness of this course, however, was the scope of its material. Because we covered such a large geographical area and time period, sometimes it was more difficult to understand the nuances of what we were reading because we did not have any background information. While Professor Eller's further reading suggestions were incredibly helpful, I think that it would be nice to incorporate some crash course, mini-lectures in the future in order to provide quick context to students--particularly those who aren't history students or who are unfamiliar with Latin America and its history."

                "I would if they want to learn more about historiography in latin america as well as read a lot of historical texts. I wouldnt necessarily recommend it if you want to understand patterns of gender in the broader latin american region because it was too specific.",
                "Yes! Its a great perspective for Latin-American history.",
                "Yes! This class is well organized, Professor Eller is brilliant, approachable, and accommodating, and the material is so interesting.",
                "Yes! Its a wonderful history seminar that explores really fascinating topics and themes. Its somewhat broad in terms of the time periods and regions we cover (and in that breadth there sometimes feels like a lack of depth), but the discussions are very interesting and Prof. Eller is great! Also, the workload is very manageable",
                "Yes and especially if taught by Professor Eller! She is a walking encyclopedia and she always comes to class with a contagious enthusiasm for the subject. Professor Eller's feedback is always insightful and helpful as well. The course itself covers a lot of different regions and time periods so it can feel like what we are studying jumps around a lot but overall it's interesting.",
                "Yes. Professor Eller is such a great instructor and the class content is so interesting. You will learn a lot.",
                "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning more about this region or if you want to take a history class at Yale!  I learned a lot from the material, my classmates, and Prof Eller and had a great time while doing so.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Eller is incredible, and the material covered in this class is fascinating. I learned so much through our weekly readings, Professor Eller's continuous suggestions and feedback, and my classmates themselves (especially as they introduced outside material through the discussion replacements). This is one of the best history seminars and classes I have taken at Yale. Particularly as a history major, the course fostered my enthusiasm for the subject by teaching me how to be a better student. Professor Eller cares as much about our interest and skills as students as she does about the content, which I greatly appreciated. I cannot recommend this course enough."
