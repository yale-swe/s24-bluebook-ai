                "Weakness - moves very fast, has limited time to practice topics, peer tutoring hours are late and quality of tutors varies, homework always requires professor or tutor help, and not all professors are equal in their teaching skills.\r\nStrengths - Professors tend to be willing to help and accommodate, disabilities are accommodated for test taking, and the book is available for free in a PDF form.",
                "Strengths were the lectures and printouts, which really helped solidify my understanding. Weaknesses were the \"flipped classroom\" aspect where we were expected to teach ourselves the material before class.",
                "The main strength is definitely the number of resources. Youre taking this class with hundreds of other students so its very easy to work with others. The TAs in office hours are very approachable, and the course has so many resources (videos, practice problems, notes, etc) that are helpful when prepping for the exams.",
                "This course is taught in a very lecture based style with little student engagement, despite attempts to change that by the instructor. This is both a good and bad thing, as it is easier to focus on learning the material, but it is also difficult to stay engaged.",
                "One strength of this course was the amount of resources available to the students. From in class lectures, to the online videos, as well as office hours and Ximera, there were plenty of ways to get help. However, at times emailing the professor if extra help was needed wasn't very useful, as the professor did not respond. Additionally, I think it could've been helpful to have access to solutions for all of the problem sets, as with some other classes I have taken, I find it useful to be able to compare my work to the solutions, to see what was done differently, even if both are correct.",
                "I think that the instruction could be improved a little so that we go over material in class instead of just problems.",
                "I put an enormous amount of time into the psets for this course (upwards of 6 hours per week, in addition to class time and reviewing the material). To be honest I wish that there were a version of this course that was slower paced for people who like math but for whom the ideas take longer to understand.",
                "Watching the videos made me learn the material twice, so everything really stayed in my head. Prof. Anderson was also really great at explaining things, answering questions, and making sure we knew all the things we had to know.",
                "The strength of this course is its rigorous approach to mathematical engagement. The weakness of this course is the work load of the problems sets, which I found to be unnecessarily tedious.",
                "In-class was not helpful in developing skills to succeed. Had to learn mostly outside of class, which was a major weakness.\r\n\r\nRigorous practice with p-sets was a strength.",
                "I think the consistency of the material taught between professors could improve in this course. I think many of my peers and I struggled with the fact that certain professors taught in different ways that may not have been as constructive to our learning as others. Certain professors covered material that was much closer to the exam-type questions and thus their students seemed to perform relatively better than their peers. I also think it could be unfair to some students for the professors to aim for a B- average grade and thus make the tests harder to try to reach that. Though that was not as much the case this year, I have heard the math department usually aims for a B- average grade in classes. I think this is rather unfair to students who have never taken multivariable calculus before. As there are many students who have already taken multivariable in Math 120, making tests harder just to bring grade averages down makes succeeding much more difficult for those students who have no prior experience in the course, when Math 120 should exist for students who have never taken it before. I also think this B- grade aiming causes students who previously enjoyed math, but may have not been as strong in it, to drop the class and decide they actually don't enjoy math anymore. I think that one strength of the course, however, is in the psets. They were a good length for practice while not being horribly difficult. I think the relatively shorter ones that were around 8 questions were the best length.",
                "Lot of material in a very short time: would prefer if there was less",
                "This course should be curved."

                "If the student is a math or physics major, I would recommend this class. For humanity majors, I would not recommend this particular math class. It is very time-consuming and focuses more on math that applies to physics.",
                "Absolutely not! Unless you're interested specifically in math, physics, engineering, etc and it will be useful or interesting for you, or unless it's required for your major, don't take it. It's brutally difficult and (in my opinion) not worth the headache if the material isn't interesting or applicable.",
                "Depending on the professor yes! If you get Meghan Anderson or Ian then yes! They love teaching this class and understand the material really well. The psets can be really hard and intense but its definitely worth it. I feel like I learned a lot of material in a short amount of time and overall enjoyed the class.",
                "Yes definitely. It is a fun intellectual challenge to extend calculus into a 3rd dimension. The course is set up to facilitate this, and it is quite enjoyable.",
                "Yes, this class has a manageable workload and will give you a solid grasp over calc 3 material.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, because I think that multivar is really interesting! The difference between student experiences varied widely based on their teacher however - I personally did not feel that I got much out of my teacher in class or office hours, and was heavily dependent on peer tutors to get a handle on the concepts in this course. Emily was an incredible peer tutor.",
                "Yes I would because it is crucial to establishing a mathematical foundation.",
                "No, unfortunately. Felt like the purpose of the class was to be difficult rather than to teach.",
                "I would warn them to make sure they stay on top of their work and studying and let them know that if a professor's teaching style is not the best for them, they should not feel bad about changing classes or attending a different section. I believe I was able to learn multivariable calculus through this course though, so I would recommend it to students who need the course for their future majors.",
                "yes, but I would say the professor is the class!",
                "This course is provides a good understanding of multi variable concepts. It is important for many majors/prereqs and this course does a good job."
