                "With only 5 weeks, really mastering the content was difficult. This class also has a lot of new content compared to L1-L3 (where you kinda learn preterite\/imperfect, subjunctive, por\/para over and over again). For me, the content I had never learned before was the past subjunctive, compound si clauses, impersonal se, and passive voice. You do review simple si clauses and accidental se from L3 and prepositions from L1-L2. Some of the grammar topics seem a little obscure (namely, reported speech); I would probably never use it in real life. You also read a lot of short stories, watch a lot of short films, and read a short novel and watch a movie in Spanish. I enjoyed these activities, especially our discussions about them. I felt that by the end of the class, we were able to have thoughtful and analytical discussions about the content we were watching\/reading.",

                "The STRENGTHS of this class are Profesora Medina and Cividanes. They both are very passionate about the Spanish language and seem to enjoy teaching it. They want students to succeed and make themselves readily available for office hours and other forms of support. They are encouraging in class, making sure everyone gets a chance to participate and share their opinions. This class seems like the most content-driven class I have taken at Yale (compared to L1-L3, which seemed to be very grammar-driven). Medina and Cividanes really encouraged us to have academic and analytical conversations and applauded us for trying our best to make complicated points in Spanish. I also really enjoyed working on the podcast on asynchronous Wednesday classes. I felt like it was a great way to build community with classmates online, practice speaking, and learn a lot about something that interested me. The WEAKNESSES of this class are the workload and the structure of the VHL homework. The short time frame makes this class have a very high but mostly manageable workload. However, the workload was really high with the novel during the last week of class. Because the novel has so many unknown vocabulary words, it was really difficult and slow to read. Reading three chapters, on top of a nightly \"prueba\" about the novel, and also practicing grammar and preparing for an oral exam was an almost overwhelming amount of work (if I hadn't coincidentally had the week off from my part-time job, I would have been overwhelmed by the workload during week 5 of the course). I also did not like how we learned the grammar concepts on VHL and had to do graded homework on the concepts before meeting in class. And then in class the next day, we would go over the grammar topic again. I would have much rather had a lecture about the grammar topic in class, and then done VHL homework that night to reinforce my learning. I often found myself fumbling through the VHL the night before class, then getting a much better understanding after a class lecture, and then going back to VHL in \"practice mode\" to try to re-reinforce my learning.",
                "Strengths include the dual teachers, engaging in class conversation, and the feedback given (generally). Weaknesses would be the grading which is harsh and often arbitrary, and the extreme speed with which content is taught.",
                "Strengths: the teaching was spectacular. Both Profesora Cividanes and Maria were amazing professors, and I highly enjoyed every day of class. Each day had a mixture of writing and speaking activities, and it felt very much like there was a structure to everything that we were learning. I enjoyed the cultural project, and the literature\/films that we had to watch along the way. They also did a great job of organizing the class such that we got to know our classmates. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very little. The one thing I would say is that the Modules homework had a very low margin for error, and some of the questions felt a little as though there were two correct answers, or two answers with partially correct and partially incorrect answers.",
                "I think the course was done extremely well given that it was on Zoom, I think the only thing I would change is when we are going over grammar topics it would have been useful to have been given 2 minutes to read over the grammar notes from the textbook prior to going over it as a class. Other than that, I loved the course.",
                "I loved the faster pace of the summer session course, however, it could also be too much material for the allotted time which made it more difficult to meaningfully learn."

                "Yes but with several caveats. You may also be just trying to finish your distributional language requirement, and if thats the case for you I definitely recommend doing it in the summer as it cuts out a lot of the extra work in a normal semester. I wouldn't take this class if you struggle learning content quickly, because the class moves extraordinarily fast and you will often be tested literally a day or two after learning new skills. Overall its a great course if you truly care about learning Spanish, and if you just want to finish the requirement I would recommend this course (especially with Cividanes and\/or Maria Miranda).",

One feels very strongly that their Spanish skills improve throughout the semester, and I felt as though the class was manageable despite the condensed summer schedule. The feedback I received was very concise and helpful, and I enjoyed each days worth of activities.",
