I also appreciate that the syllabus is light on the reading and really gives you the space to dive 100% into your ethnographic writing. Weakness: Yukiko's grading may seem harsh at the beginning and discouraging, but at least in my experience, the final grade she give me was extremely fair, and dare I say generous. So don't worry about your grade when taking this course; as Yukiko says, grades are a great heuristic to help you understand how far you need to go to produce a top-tier product."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in producing ethnographic work in the future or if they are interested in socio-cultural anthropology. I have always enjoyed reading ethnographies, but writing one was certainly not for me.",

                "Yes. If you are serious about anthropology, this class will help you understand what anthropology truly is. I've taken 4 or 5 anthropology courses before this, but now I realize I did not grasp the power of anthropology and what a special discipline it is until taking this class. Anthropology is not just interviewing people and writing down what they say; it is a way to help your reader see the world through both your interlocutors' and your eyes. It is not an easy class; not because of the workload, but because of the intense thinking required to create truly meaningful and impactful ethnographic writing. But this class has taught me more than any other anthropology class I've ever taken. It's made me a much better listener and writer, and I appreciate ethnographies much more now that I've had a taste of writing one myself."
