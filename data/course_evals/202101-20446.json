Some topics covered include: Possible characteristics of God (and whether those are even coherent), arguments for\/against God's existence, the place of faith and reason.\r\nIn order to understand those arguments often there were substantive digressions into more general epistemology, so also gained some knowledge in that area.

                "The course covers major issues in philosophy of religion: divine attributes (what is God like? how can we prove it?), proofs of God's existence (cosmological,  ontological arguments), problem of evil and related issues, faith and reason, moral implications of belief in God, and the interaction of science and religion.  This class MAJORLY expanded my mind and understanding of religion, and encouraged me to consider problems I'd never thought of before. It's an incredibly creative class (more so than other philosophy classes) because Prof. Pittard is really open to different styles of argumentation. The sheer quantity covered is also really impressive, and I'm glad I took this over a philosophy seminar.  Prof. Pittard (I'm pretty sure) is a theist, but he treats both sides really fairly and again is a super expansive and creative thinker..",

                "Discussion was a strong point, since it solidified and developed my understanding of different concepts presented in class.",
                "Strengths: \r\ngreat variety in religious thought and assessment, covering many of the major figures alongside more niche advocates\r\nfoundational experience in philosophical paper writing with helpful guides and feedback\r\nvery structured class with accompanying class notes (VERY appreciated!)\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nrepeatedly off schedule (usually for the good reason of fielding student queries) \r\nmoves pretty quickly from topic to topic, though synthesis between sources is helpful\/encouraged",
                "Strengths:\r\nCovered wide array of topics so now I feel like I have a basic understanding of the Phil. Religion landscape of issues. Lectures were clear and compelling, often diving quite deep into dialectics or raising concerns which I had never before considered. Readings also were interesting often raising different points or giving clear presentations of central positions. I liked the exam and essay format, as the exams made sure you actually understood each issue discussed in the class while the essays gave you license to more fully engage with a topic. Prof. Pittard is super generous with talking in Office Hours, and this is a great way to learn further about topics that were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe main weakness I think was how disconnected lectures were from some of our readings. It felt at times like the readings were just tacked on to actually give us homework as opposed to actually central to the course, and this was because the lectures would essentially go over all important content from the readings and only then diving further into the dialectic. To improve this I would say it would be good to have the readings as touchstones in lectures which can be referenced as exemplary of positions or as ways to shortcut further into a dialectic.",
                "The live lecture is very helpful as is the discussion section.",
                "I loved this class. My fave class at Yale. John Pittard is amazing.",
                "Overall, this was an excellent class and I was really happy I took it. I appreciated the complexity with which arguments were approached in class. My one small piece of feedback is that, in assigning readings, it may be better to assign fewer, longer readings. For instance, some weeks we had to read 4-5 short readings per lecture day. Though the page count was reasonable, it is sometimes hard to think about\/evaluate so many competing views for a single class, so I thought it would have been better to assign a similar number of pages but fewer readings.",
                "Strengths: dynamic lecturer, great teaching fellow, manageable syllabus",
                "This course is, to be short, an amazing course. The assessments are numerous, but are ideal for an undergraduate student, since they were ongoing and didn't put much pressure on during finals period. Prof. Pittard is an AMAZING professor -- I don't think I would have enjoyed this class as much with anyone else. The TFs were also great, and the reading selection was great.",
                "I really enjoyed the texts we engaged with and our discussion of them. I also think Professor Pittard is an excellent lecturer and made the sub-optimal format still quite enjoyable. I think the lecture potentially could have benefited from some visual aids - we all had a handout online that we used for the class, but especially in the virtual format, some visual aids to the lecture could probably have helped with engagement and focus. Other than that, I thought the course was structured well for learning and very interesting.",
                "Professor Pittard is incredibly.",
                "Strengths: Professor Pittard is such an original, interesting thinker. Steph (my TA) was a ton of fun and just a really empathetic, kind person. The content is incredibly interesting and every class I learned something new about how we might prove\/disprove\/understand God. Prof. Pittard's lectures are well-organized, with useful notes sheets to follow along with. The exams are very fair. Weaknesses: We were sometimes a day behind schedule so we missed out on the afterlife class, which is not a big deal. Other than that, I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. I loved this class and would give it a 10\/10. One of my favorite philosophy classes I've taken, and definitely the most informative..",
                "I thought that the course was well-organized, and Professor Pittard did a great job of covering a lot of material in a small amount of time. Biggest weakness was the bare fact that it was on zoom, but hopefully we will never have to ever do that again. That said, Pittard's was one of the best-adapted-to-zoom classes I took this semester. I also actually really liked having the combination of having exams that required us to familiarize ourselves with the authors and their arguments, and having papers that helped us analyze those arguments and put forth our own."

I think this course is great at giving a survey of issues in Philosophy of Religion, and forcing you to think critically about questions in religion which are often not given such attention. If that is what you want from the course, along with a Prof. who is willing to engage with you in Office Hours on topics that you are more interested in too, then this is a great course (it also is good for developing Philosophical argumentation\/writing skills).",

                "Yes, especially if you have any interest in religion or related subjects. Even if you don't, I think that you will develop a deeper appreciation for philosophy of religion. Prof. Pittard is such an enjoyable lecturer, so you will definitely have fun in the class, if nothing.",
                "Take this class! Professor Pittard did a wonderful job. Lectures were interesting and well-organized.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I'm a philosophy major, but it felt equally accessible to people familiar with philosophy and to those engaging with it for the first time. The way that we engaged with philosophers in chunks focusing on different overarching questions was very easy to follow and made sense, even without a philosophical background. Also, the questions touched on (nature\/existence of God, free will, problem of evil, etc.) were very relatable and significant questions, not mired in philosophical technicalities, making them very accessible.",
                "Yes - absolutely",
                "Yes",
                "FOR PHIL MAJORS: I would 100% recommend this course to other philosophy majors. The content is different from some other philosophy classes in that it's very creative, and it feels immediately relevant (at least to me, who is interested in figuring out whether God exists). Lots of modal proofs and analytic stuff, but also some continental philosophy towards the end. Professor Pittard also includes a diversity of perspectives (i.e., some non-Western content) but not in a way that feels forced. Overall I would say this is one of the less-difficult PHIL courses out there (from my sampling), and it's not too hard to do well if you're as fascinated by the content as I was. FOR NON-PHIL MAJORS: Yes, take this course, but you should know what you're getting into. The readings are pretty dense, and you're expected to have a high level of rigor and precision on your essays. You should definitely talk to your TA about their expectations for the essay to get a sense of how you should be writing. However, of all the philosophy courses you can take, I think this one is one of the most interesting ones as it's on a wonderfully important and complex subject, and Professor Pittard is just excellent. OVERALL: Take this course! With Steph as your TA if you can..",
                "Yes!! Professor Pittard is a great teacher, and the class is a great introduction to Philosophy of Religion. Pittard genuinely cares about his students, and is very good at presenting arguments in a clear and logical way. The course helped me think more deeply about the justifications for theism, and also taught me to have a better understanding of the limits of rationality in answering many fundamental questions. I think this class is fantastic for anyone with an interest in religion or philosophy, regardless of how much experience you have with philosophy. In my section, there were philosophy majors and div school students, as well as people who had never taken a philosophy class before. I think Pittard does a good job explaining concepts and organizing the course in such a way that makes it valuable for people with a wide range of backgrounds in the material.",
                "YES! A truly fascinating course - it's going to take the whole summer to unpack it. Prof Pittard is an incredible lecturer with a deep knowledge of his subject, and the section discussions were by far the best I've had at Yale.",
                "Yes, the course is very interesting if you like thinking about philosophy and are curious what the answer is, or even if there is an answer, to the questions of a God's existence, why is there evil in the world if God is supposedly good, how can we justify our own beliefs in the face of competing claims, etc."
