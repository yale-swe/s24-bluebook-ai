    "This class has too many assignments that shouldn't really benefit seniors at this point in their thesis (e.g. review a presentation). The class did impose deadlines on writing our theses and presenting on them; that was probably the most helpful element. I would have appreciated more consistent thesis-writing deadlines throughout the semester (there was one for five pages, then a twenty-page final submission). Attendance wasn't strict\/many people didn't show up most weeks, so the community element was a bit shaky. It was good to check in in a group each week."
