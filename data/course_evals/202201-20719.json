I am also able to read and write at a higher level, and with enough effort (and perhaps a dictionary) can work my way through some pretty advanced texts! Besides these specific skills, I have noticed a substantial increase in my confidence-- It is okay to look foolish when speaking a new language, because this is how you learn. This growth has extended even beyond Italian class (presentations in other classes feel easy when they are in your first language!).",
                "strong proficiency in Italian grammar and vocabulary. The ability to have a smooth conversation with Italian speakers.",

                "I improved my foundational Italian skills immensely, learning many new conjugations and tenses, developing my speaking skills and reading comprehension skills.",

                "I think this course teaches at the proper speed and is taught to the depth it needs to be. However, I don't think we need as many assessments as we had.",
                "Strengths: Classes were fun and I liked the wide variety of activities which we did.\r\nWeaknesses: It often felt like there was just way too much to learn (especially in terms of grammar). Learning a language is incredibly difficult, and having a course based so heavily on exams felt dismissive of all of the work it takes to learn a foreign language. Having your grade tied to being perfect made this course very stressful at times. I think having more weight given to projects would be better, as students would still be required to engage with and practice the language, but in a format which would allow for the occasional looking-up of a word or certain irregular conjugation.",
                "The course has a strong sense of community, which made it fun to go to class and interact with classmates. However, sometimes discussions could get held up by reluctant participation.",
                "The class discussions and exercises are very helpful in terms of practicing the language and encouraging every student to contribute in class.",
                "This course was strengthened by any opportunities to converse unprepared and casually with other students in the class. It was at these moments I most acutely realized my shortcomings and my strengths. I felt too much time was spent reviewing homework exercises, when the answers to these exercises are available online. I also felt my experience as a student who always completed the homework and was genuinely eager to learn Italian was worsened by students who did not prepare for class and were not interested in speaking in Italian, but I don't see a feasible way to improve this. I enjoyed the random activities, such as watching movie clips, listening to songs, or reading about famous Italians. I think the course could benefit from more of this, and more opportunities to speak with one another. Furthermore, this could happen in a really fun way (going for walks in nice weather or restaurants together).",
                "One strength was the format of teaching, with group discussions and conversations about Italian films, texts, and grammar practices. one weakness was the grammar section towards the end of the course, as that material was not taught thoroughly enough.",
                "The course is extremely engaging and the high level of participation from students makes it a rewarding class.",
                "The camaraderie of this class is fun, and Deborah is a helpful teacher who wants her students to do well in the class. This class is a big time sink, and you will have to take a lot of tests.",
                "A big strength of this course is its size: since there are around 15 students, there is a lot of time and space for everyone to participate and ask questions. \r\n\r\nI think it could be improved if there was a system to determine when students should\/can speak, so that this way, everyone gets a chance to participate and less time is wasted on waiting for someone to raise their hand.",
                "The course is super engaging and fun as well as intellectually challenging! Maybe a weakness is how hard some tests are... especially towards the end. Maybe more study resources would help?"

                "Yes I would, as the professor was excellent and did a great job of creating a constructive atmosphere in class.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course. The workload and concepts are manageable. If you put the work in by completing the homework readings and exercises, though they at times feel tedious, you will genuinely learn a lot. If you study earnestly, you will see results on compositions and assessments. Even if you are not interested in becoming fluent, attempting to learn a new language is a fun process and the benefits extend beyond this specific class.",
                "Yes! It was tricky at times but Deborah is an AMAZING professor who develops strong relationships with every student and really wants you to succeed. Most classmates of mine are studying abroad in Italy this summer, which is a testament to our success and engagement in the course.",
                "Yes, I would. Italian is a very fun language and the professors in the department are amazing.",
                "Yes, Italian is a great language to learn and the department doesnt ask too much of you.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students looking to continue their education in Italian. Though L2 is significantly more challenging and with a more significant workload than L1, it is a class that truly boosts your learning and sets the foundations to progress into intermediate Italian.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more Italian and really master the verbs. The class does get hard towards the end, though, so you have to put in much more work than in L1."
