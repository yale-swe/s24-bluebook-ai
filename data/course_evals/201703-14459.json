    "An unseen side of medieval India from the lens of the dynamic Mughal empire--I learnt a lot about the material itself and explored creative ways of approaching the topic.",
    "To critically look at the history of Mughal India by understanding its impact on contemporary Indian communal conflicts.",
    "I have learnt a lot about the different factor that led to inception and decline of the Mughal Empire. This has been a great opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and dwell into the history of the Mughal rule which is something that i did not get to zoom in to in the past."

    "Well structured course. Good topic selection.",
    "More structured and focused curriculum.",
    "The strength of the course were the student discussion as I got to learn more insights by the students in class. I also found the lecturer's choice of readings wonderful as they gave a whole new dimension to approaching Mughal History. I felt that the slides could be more engaging"

    "If only to learn a necessary stage in Indian history.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who would want to go beyond understanding Mughal history just by its architecture but through other areas such as art, politics and economics as well."
