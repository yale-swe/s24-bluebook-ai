                "This course was more a \"fact\"-based course than a methods one. We didn't learn a lot of applicable skills towards anthropology as a whole but I did learn a ton about Aztec culture.",
                "You will go over the formation of the Aztec people, their language, culture, and civilization. Note: this is an anthropology course, and like many other anthropology\/archeology courses at Yale that deal with Latin America, you cover groups of people as if they are scientific materials. There is little humanity and agency that is given to Indigenous people in this course, making for class discussions that can be very frustrating and a bit nauseating at times. Additionally, do not expect for this class to be art historic in any means.",
                "I learned so much about the Aztec people, as well as how to write a research paper. I also got a better idea of what archaeologists do.",
                "Learned a lot about the way modern day anthropologists study and understand the Aztecs, as well as what we have learned about them; also, developed my skills in academic writing.",
                "I was able to get a deeper understanding of the Aztec empire and culture. A lot of what I knew was either inaccurate or had very intricate stories behind them and this class helped me evolve my knowledge.",
                "I learned how to think through an archaeological mindset and how to differentiate this way of thinking from an anthropological viewpoint or other perspective. I gained a thorough grasp on Aztec culture and tradition, as well as the structure of Aztec society and how this research is supported through material evidence (throughout excavations) and primary\/secondary sources from Aztec times and beyond. This course also taught me to think critically on the quality of sources we draw from, as well as to question authors and their intentions (especially when looking at the codices).",
                "In this course you get a great overview of both Aztecs culture as well as that of the many other indigenous peoples in the greater Mesoamerican region. YOu also get a lot of practice doing reading summaries through the weekly queries and you can expect to improve on your research and paper writing skills through completing the final research paper for the course."

            "comments": [
                "This course has a pretty heavy workload, the weekly reading journals can take a while to do. Additionally, there was not a lot of direction in terms of what we should be studying for the exam. On the other hand, I found the course was organizing in a very efficient manner, so it was easy to identify which readings we needed to do in order to learn about a topic.",
                "This course honestly needs an entire overhaul if it is offered again. It seems like nobody in class with the exception of three anthropology students were dedicated to the course, which made it a super frustrating experience when you are trying to listen and no one else is. Therefore, I truly believe that this class would work best as a seminar, engaging with a small and dedicated group of students directly. It is clear that Prof. Chinchilla is an excellent scholar in the field, but I feel that his material and his knowledge had to be restricted and morphed into a beginner-level course for the audience. I understand that this is not a high-level course, but due to the complexities of the topic at hand and how fascinating it truly is, I think it would be better for everyone for it to be a seminar with 10-15 students max.",
                "The class was well taught and the weekly reading assignments were very interesting.",
                "I have nothing bad to say about this course except I would prefer a mid-semester essay over a midterm.",
                "Strengths of the course: incredibly engaging across the resources Yale has to offer- we had visits almost every week to the Marsh Botanical Garden, Haas Architecture Library, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, and many others. All the documents we analyzed in class and talked through were objects that we could often visit in person, which was not only helpful in understanding the content, but also in enriching our appreciation for Aztec culture and innovation. Professor Chinchilla was also very kind and understanding, and he and the TFs made sure to provide many opportunities for review sessions\/ help whenever students needed it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course: the structure of the course content was sometimes challenging to follow, and information that we covered in weekly readings didn't always align with the information we covered in the class on the following days. It would also be helpful to have more warning on the timing of the midterm exam and an awareness of the material that we are expected to know for it.",
                "A lot of interesting material is covered, but sometimes the shear amount of material can become overwhelming. The assignments were overall well organized and fit with the objectives of the course, however, the midterm seemed a little out of place in the course and it covered some material that was barely touched on."

                "I am fascinated by Mesoamerican studies and have a preference towards any course which covers the region. If a student did not have an interest in the region, they would be better served by other courses.",
                "No.",
                "No. Unless you are extremely interested in the topic, do not take this course. Even as a person who is quite literally going into this field, I did not feel as if my opinions were respected by the professor or my classmates. I had one student one time tell me \"Why are you even going into this field?\" during a repatriation discussion. Not a positive space by any means.",
                "Yes if they have any interest at all in the Aztecs.",
                "Absolutely. This course was really enjoyable to attend, the Professor Chinchilla is excellent, and the lens from which the class is taught is really compelling.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students! I think there is a lot to learn from past empire and how people change and adapt over time.",
                "Depends on what the student is looking for- if they are very interested in Aztec\/ Mesoamerican cultures and are looking for a comprehensive review, yes! This course is great and allows you lots of access to viewing artifacts that not many Yale students are aware we have. However, this is not a class on Aztec culture so much as an Archaeology course, as the name tells you.",
                "Yes, this course is super interesting, covers a lot of eye-opening material, and is very approachable from the angle of any major. If you put in the necessary work, you will preform well in this course so it's a great way to get a humanities credit while learning about something fascinating."
