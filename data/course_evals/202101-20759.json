                "I feel like Korean was my most consistent and engaging class through Zoom. At the same time, I think there are just inherent limitations to using Zoom that go beyond the course that made the experience less ideal than if it were in person. It's kind of chaotic to have everyone repeat after the teacher over Zoom, but I guess there's no way around that. I also feel like it's tricky to \"raise your hand\" to ask a question over Zoom. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed still having the opportunity to meet with a TA every week, I felt like that continued to improve my Korean.",
                "Strengths: Very interactive course, feedback for improvement was always quickly returned to the students to practice for the next class. Absolutely no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Lots of material in modules, good textbook, Choi SSN helped us correct common mistakes.\r\nWeaknesses: Homeworks felt repetitive",
                "The course is well structured in that it sticks to the syllabus and implements both the learning of and practice of the language by often splitting students into breakout rooms to converse to each other using the newly learned grammar and vocabulary. One of the weaknesses of this course is that the tests are very rushed; the professor shares her screen for the test and does not give students enough time before moving onto another questions. Because students work at different paces, I would like to suggest that the test be made on the quizzes section and just be shared with the students when the time comes so that we do not feel rushed when taking the tests.",
                "Prof. Choi is a very caring and organised professor. She prepares worksheets for every lesson of the textbook, gives regular assignments, and gives clear feedback on homework. The only weakness were the sometimes open-ended homework assignments, that required too much creative work just to practise grammar."

                "Tests over Zoom was something that caught me a little off-guard. For this class in particular, they felt very fast and not enough time given to take a picture and upload. There was also one time that my computer just shut off in the middle of a test and that felt very stressful, especially since the tests were already so fast paced and I was afraid that I'd miss something. \r\n\r\nI did appreciate though that there wasn't an unbearable amount of homework every week, especially since we were already meeting every day. The course load felt very manageable during this time.",

I often feel rushed on tests because I do not have control over the speed at which the questions are being presented and cannot check over my answers at the end because I do not have the question to reference. I do not think the share screen method works well for test-taking and would greatly prefer if each of the students had their own copy of the test so that they could go about the test at their own comfortable speed.",
