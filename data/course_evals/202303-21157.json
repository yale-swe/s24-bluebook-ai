                "I learned a lot about close reading in this course, as well as how to deconstruct complex arguments. We spent the entire semester discussing \"Emile\", so I left the class with a deep understanding of the work.",
                "I gained an ability to and appreciation of close-reading a single text throughout a semester. I had taken other courses that addressed similar questions but never before had I sat with a text for this long. We wrote intellectual journal entries each week, and I was struck when I wrote my final paper how natural it felt to write about the text. Often, I feel as though the final paper of a course is only tangential to the rest of the course. Instead, with this course, I felt that I built up an ability to think critically of the textin community through the seminarthat culminated in a far better understanding.",
                "Learned about Rousseau's political thought, theories on education, religion, and society. Continued to develop close reading skills.",
                "I learned how to read slowly and critically and to ask questions that might be more difficult or harder to articulate at first. Professor Garsten also taught us to really be able to articulate what the author is saying and to pull out his exact line of reasoning, a skill that is often undervalued.",

            "comments": [
                "The course was such a breath of fresh air. Getting to focus just on the book, coming in every week excited for discussion, everything came together and made a wonderful seminar experience.",
                "The purpose of the course was to engage with one text for the whole semester and really dive into and understand it. I think the course was strong in that respect; we spent a lot of time discussing the reading and the structure of the class allowed us to dwell on interesting topics. I wish that the class had been a bit more structured with more opportunities for feedback. We did weekly reading journals and got helpful feedback on that writing, but I wish there had been more opportunities to get feedback on our final papers before submitting them.",
                "Strengths: Reading slowlythe opportunity to explore each chapter on your own, come to class with questions, then reread that section the following week after seminar (in other classes, I feel like I stumble through the reading but then never get the chance to apply what I learned. Here, I actually applied what I learned in each class!). (If you're coming from DS or another intro political philosophy sequence, this is especially refreshing!) We also happened to have a phenomenal group of students, and I really liked learning from everyone. The reading journal also helped me work through my thoughts and arrive to seminar with a deeper understanding of the text. The journal also seemed to foster participation, because we all then had notes from which to refer during seminar; the seminar wasn't dominated by the people who are quickest to respond, whether or not their thoughts are well developed. Weaknesses: I would have liked to learn more about what we all chose for our final papers. For timing purposes, I understand why this is nearly impossible, but I was so impressed by everyone that I would have been curious to learn about what they wrote.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Garsten was a great seminar leader, with a great balance of giving his insights and hearing student perspectives. Reading one book throughout the semester was very rewarding, and I think I was able to come to a very deep understanding of the work. \r\nWeaknesses: I like the idea behind devoting two weeks to each book, but some books were much longer and denser than others, so I would suggest spending just one week on certain books (e.g., Book III) and maybe three weeks on longer ones (Book IV and V). More historical/intellectual context would have also enriched our understandings.",
                "Strengths: great class discussion; nice to have two weeks on each book; weekly reading journals were super useful",
                "I wish there was a little bit more direct intervention from Garsten. Some loud voices often coopted the discussion in the seminar. I appreciated how he had us keep reading journals; that was a good exercise."

                "I would highly recommend it! Any class with Professor Garsten will be great, if you ask me. He is such a talented discussion leader and gives great, detailed feedback on writing. I highly recommend getting to know him outside of class as well!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in spending an entire semester with one text, and engaging in complex conversations about it in seminar. One danger of the class is that you have to enjoy \"Emile\" to enjoy the class. If you don't enjoy the experience of reading lots of Rousseau, this class might not be for you.",
                "Yes! Nearly any humanities student could find something interesting in the course, because Rousseau writes about so many things! One week we discussed early child development and reading, another week we considered theological arguments for the existence of God, and we concluded with something like a romance novel in the final chapter of Emile (among other subjects). I had read some of Rousseau's other works and was not particularly enamored with them, but I really enjoyed this course. This was the rare class that combined the study of political philosophy with literature and education. Even if nothing else I've written is interesting to you, but you like the idea of taking your time to learn about a text, I would recommend it wholeheartedly. And, if that weren't enough, Professor Garsten strikes the perfect balance of opening the class to our questions while still guiding us through a rather complicated text.",
                "Yes, if you have some experience in political philosophy classes and have read Rousseau before. It is truly a fantastic class and the book/conversations will affect the way you view so many topics. This would be a difficult class if it's someone's first political theory class, because the book itself is heavily influenced by Plato's Republic and, therefore, a lot of the discussions connected the book to other thinkers like Plato, Hobbes, Locke, and Aristotle.",
                "Yes 100%. Bryan garsten is such an incredible professor; he leads class discussion masterfully and is so good at pushing students to think more deeply about the text. He also strikes a great balance between focusing discussion on/in the text itself and having students think about its interaction with our world.",
                "Yes any course with Garsten is great. He is brilliant, kind, and his close reading of the text is special. However students should know that Garsten is quite busy because many people are interested in learning from him. Consequently, I found scheduling office hours and receiving feedback difficult. He is great to learn from but harder to forge a relationship with because he is already so popular on campus."
