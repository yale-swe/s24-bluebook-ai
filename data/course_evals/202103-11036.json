                "I immensely improved my French writing, reading, and speaking skills.",

                "Composition of the course was rewarding: a meaningful amount of effort, but if undertaken concertedly results in a real improvement in skills throughout the semester. A good balance is struck between comprehension / reading and grammatical works. No meaningful suggestions on how to improve.",
                "Strengths: Course pack, test review\r\nWeaknesses: not nearly enough speaking. I really feel like it was so focused on writing/grammar that I didn't get that much of a chance to actually improve my oral skills because essentially the only time we would talk would be going over answers or during a couple presentations. But there wasn't enough conversational/reactionary speaking to get better at presenting. I think this could be fixed by potentially having less essays and more speaking assignments if there isn't a way to incorporate it into class time. Also my section always went over time which was really annoying. Reading Un Sac de Billes was so time-consuming that it just wasn't interesting anymore.",
                "I really liked the content of the course and the course's structure. The only minor flaw was running out of time on a couple of the exams, but that was an error of Lingco.",
                "One strength was the fact that it met everyday, which meant one never fell out of practice with the language. A weakness was that the amount of reading required sometimes felt unrealistic.",
                "I loved this class!!! The class culture was definitely the strength. Madame Koundi is incredible, and having discussions with other students in French was my favorite way to practice and improve. The only weakness I can think of is that the work can be overwhelming sometimes, but it really does help you improve your language skills."

                "Yes. If you want to improve your French, take this course, and take it with Madame Koundi.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - between high school and college, I've taken six years of French, and this was the most enjoyable French class I've ever taken.",
                "Yes!!! French at Yale is really intimidating, and it's hard to do well on some of the assignments, but the structure is built to really help you improve your speaking, reading, and writing. I can see such a clear difference from having taken 130. This is the class that made me want to keep taking French even though it wasn't required anymore. I know that the work is overwhelming, so make sure that you know you'll have time to get a lot out of the class, but it's so worth it in the end. 10/10."
