    "I definitely gained a good understanding of macroeconomic concepts.",
    "Introductory macroeconomics including inflation, GDP, recessions and their causes, and growth were taught.",
    "Learned the principles of macroeconomics, such analysis of the financial crisis, monetary policy, GDP and inflation.",
    "I learned how to do economics really well. Definitely felt like i learned a ton about how the economy works and how financial crises occured.",
    "I learned how the macroeconomy is influenced and influences government policy and global affairs. I am not an econ major and took the course in hopes of gaining a better understanding of our political world, and I felt, because of Marnix's quality teaching, that I achieved that.",
    "I learned about how national economies work and also about concepts such as central banks, inflation, etc. that help explain how those economies work",
    "I learned about the Great Depression, Great Recession, and the Great Inflation as well as how banks work, I feel that I can know understand economics articles much better",
    "I learned about central banks, recessions, the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the Solow growth model, and much more.",
    "Really useful course for getting a basic understanding of the banking system, the Federal Reserve, inflation rates, etc....\r\n\r\nGood intro to some of the most fundamental models of economics.",
    "Learned about interest rates and their effects. How the economy functions as a whole.",
    "A stronger macroeconomic understanding of recent world events (the Great Recession, the crisis in Greece, etc.)",
    "Understanding of how the economy works",
    "I had taken an A-level in Economics before so I had covered some of the concepts, but the mathematical models behind the models were new, as were some of the long-short run distinctions.",
    "I learned a lot about how economics and the world in general works. I really didn't like Intro Micro, because I felt like we didn't really get to see any applications of the stuff that we were learning, but Intro Macro is all about real events, crises, and policy. It was eye-opening and really refreshing.",
    "gained a broader understanding of the economic principles and driving forces behind the macroeconomy, how to connect current events to our in-class learning, improved my problem solving and analytical skills",
    "I learned the basics concepts of macroeconomics and how to analyze the most common macroeconomic strategies used today.",
    "Understanding of macroeconomic patterns, factors that played into the recent financial crises, financial institutions, and ability to analyze financial news and economic policy decisions. This course developed the foundation of my macroeconomic understanding."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Marnix Amand is a good professor\r\n\r\nImproved: It may be nice to leave time after lectures for an in class review of what was just covered.",
    "I was disappointed when I learned this course is more akin to a lecture in teaching style than it is to a seminar, and I feel the description of this class as a seminar is misleading. I feel that \"limited-enrollment lecture\" would be a more appropriate description.",
    "Lectures were excellent and often very interesting; it's clear Professor Amand is very knowledgeable in the field. The midterm exam did not do a great job of covering material focused on in class (or the problem sets).",
    "Teacher is a great lecturer. he is super prepared and does a great job of explaining everything. also, the psets are pretty much no work which is great.\r\ni think the only weakness is that sometimes when you ask questions he does not always does the best job of answering them, but u can usally look the stuff up online anyway.",
    "Strength: Marnix is an amazing professor. I really enjoyed lecture and felt engaged, even for a 9 am.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I liked the PSETS but didn't feel that they prepared me for the exams as much as I expected. I wish there was a little bit more structured preparation for other concepts that were tested on.",
    "It is very interesting but the high enrollment makes it a lecture and not really a seminar; the course would benefit from having additional professors so that there could be more sections and therefore smaller class sizes to allow for an actual alternative to the lecture",
    "Strength: engaging lectures\r\nWeakness: the professor often focused on topic that the book did not emphasize much, so it was hard to filter out what was really important to know.",
    "This is an amazing course. Take it with Marnix. I honestly don't know how this course could be improved.",
    "The main strength of the course is how accessible the professor is. I really enjoyed the seminar format. I had taken intro micro as a lecture, and the smaller class size and the increased accessibility of the professor were welcome changes. \r\n\r\nI thought one of the weaknesses was how much work the psets required versus how much they actually counted for. They were more or less graded for completion, as we could only receive a maximum of 2 points per pset, which meant that we would sometimes have to do something like ten problems which could take hours, for a maximum grade of 2 out of 2.",
    "Professor was great. If there was a section we could go to to talk over the material as a group.",
    "Strengths - high student engagement, slides and pset solutions are easily accessible online, each topic builds on cumulative understanding \/\/ Weaknesses - psets were only graded for completion and yet not returned in a timely manner, more review exercises for exams would've been helpful given the subjectivity of the questions",
    "More office hours or ULAs to help with psets would be nice",
    "This course was really well taught by Marnix Amand and the course material is super relevant to everyday life and understanding of government policy and financial markets.",
    "The second half of the course moves a little quickly.",
    "Amazing lectures! Possibly better feedback on the psets could help improve the course.",
    "I shopped both this and 116. The class sizes ended up being roughly similar but this professor was much more engaging. If the slides were posted earlier, it might be helpful to look over them before class. Generally, a well-organized course. I have taken 6 QRs at this point, and found the level of maths in this course to be about average, even though it is only linear equations. Integrating and fully understanding what the equations mean and imply make it more difficult then perhaps a pure math class covering the same material would be.",
    "strengths: professor was really engaging, problem sets were graded based on effort which was helpful to my learning\r\nweaknesses: course moved at a fast pace at times",
    "This course was pretty engaging for an intro econ class and taught me a lot about current events and historical economic strategies. The course was taught pretty closely to the textbook, which treated most of the information very simplistically. I wish the course went a little more in depth into the material."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you're doing the economics major or generally interested in economics.",
    "I took this course because I very much enjoyed microeconomics. However, just because one enjoys microeconomics one will not necessarily enjoy macro as I learned. I would suggest this course to people interested in policy and more indirect cause-and-effect than occurs in micro.",
    "I would recommend it if you think you are really interested in macroeconomics, as Professor Amand does a good job of explaining concepts in an interesting way. However, some of the material can be dry and tedious, and the class is not necessarily easy; exams were challenging.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class. not a lot of work and he's a great lecturer. very engaging throughout.",
    "Absolutely. I think Marnix is an incredible person and professor. I took the class as someone only tangentially interested in learning about the macroeconomy and I wasn't dissapointed.",
    "Yes; it is engaging and the topics feel relevant to news you hear about or work you may do in the future with an economics degree",
    "If you take this course with Marnix, it will be one of your best courses at Yale.",
    "If you're a potential econ\/poli sci\/history major I would definitely recommend it. I had taken intro micro as a lecture, and thought that the seminar format of this class was so much more engaging and made learning the material a lot easier.",
    "YES, the professor was AMAZING.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this seminar over the lecture. I felt that my gains in understanding were much greater (especially compared to my experience in the intro Micro lecture). I'd also recommend this course even if you've taken AP Macro like I had -- it goes way beyond the AP curriculum. Prof Amand is a good lecturer and holds weekly office hours.",
    "yes if you want an understanding of the economy",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I learned a lot and the assigned work was helpful and not super stressful, as it was graded for completion\/effort or gave you unlimited tries to get things all correct. I was able to focus on actually learning the material rather than freaking out about if it was right or not.",
    "Yes - the material is very interesting.",
    "Yes definitely! Take with Professor Amand!!",
    "Yes. It teaches you the material and you have access to the professor",
    "Would recommend it over 116, provided the instructors are the same.",
    "Yes! Marnix is really wonderful. He is amazing at explaining complicated economic concepts in a way that is simple enough for someone with little background to understand, but also in depth enough to give you more insight into how economic phenomenon have played out historically and currently (the Great Depression, the Great Recession, the European Debt crisis). As a non-major, who really just wanted to have some tools to understand economic language and concepts in current events, this class was perfect. The psets are usually pretty short, and just graded for completion, so not to bad at all. And the exams are pretty straightforward if you study a bit. Definitely recommend.",
    "The course provided a solid introduction to the macroeconomy so if you are interested in that, then take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is much better and more personal than the lecture, and it gives a good background to understand news about the economy. However, the tests are very difficult and do not match the rigor of the day to day class.",
    "Professor Amand does an amazing job of organizing and delivering the material - I would definitely recommend taking this course as a seminar over the lecture course. I found this class to be challenging, but definitely worthwhile to take with Professor Amand. It's not the easiest to get an A but this should not deter you - take it as Credit\/D\/Fail if you must, but you'll get so much out of this course.",
    "Yes"
