People also always make snap judgements about personality but this course helped me analyze the times when these snap judgements might be accurate and when they might not be.",
    "I learned a lot about what makes people similar and different from each other. We learned about personality traits, how they develop in childhood, how people and environment we are in affects our personality, and how we can change our personality.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think Professor Hirsch's two lab assignments were a perfect way to have us engage with personality psychology. We served first as research participants in a personality psychology study which helped us get exposed to the field and then we got to explore our own research question in lab #2, which introduced us to the work of scientists in this field and helped us understand exactly what you can learn by studying personality psychology. I also love that Professor Hirsch brought in guest lecturers such as the baby and Rock. It was a welcome change from our typical lecture format and let us see personality in the real world. \r\n\r\nI also enjoy how Professor Hirsch backs almost everything she teaches us with research on that topic. She simplifies it so that we can understand the important points and how it relates to our lecture.",
    "Strengths: This course was very engaging. Professor Hirsch used polls, videos, detailed slides, discussion questions, and music to make the class more interactive. The assignments were very interesting and fun to do! The exams were fair, and the movie activity was really fun as well. Professor Hirsch made it easy for students to ask questions and she made sure we knew the material well.\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",
    "Weaknesses: early morning class\r\n\r\nStrengths: really interesting, great professor, easy-to-follow lecture slides, great guest speakers!",
    "Great teaching, clear guidelines laid out of what will be taught\/tested.",
    "Strengths were it was interesting. Weaknesses were that textbook readings were not always connected.",
    "Professor Hirsch is awesome and I think she did a great job. I think the movie activity should be a movie that either everyone has seen or no one has. Even though Harry Potter is pretty mainstream I had never seen it and felt a small disadvantage cause I spent a lot of time trying to figure out character's names, etc.",
    "Very informative class, maybe a bit too large though.",
    "Strengths: Clear and informative lecture style, and there's an effort to make it engaging. Weakness: 9am, there needs to be a better balance between lecture and textbook. I know it's a tradeoff between repeating textbook info during lecture or making it more engaging, and I'm not sure how to solve that problem unless there was less reliance on textbook. The assignments can really add up -- it felt like there was something due every week on top of heavy reading.",
    "Too much textbook reading, the lectures got very dry and not interactive by the end of the course. I thought the homeworks and movie activity were great.",
    "I enjoyed the lab assignments that were a part of this class. I thought it was a unique set of assignments that also taught me about the processes of running a psychology experiment without having to complete an entire study.\r\nI thought the exams in this class were very unfair. There was no guidance on what was going to specifically be on the exam.",
    "The class was perfect! I loved it! Maybe more hands on labs so we could do more research and engage with Personality Pscyhology.",
    "The course was a great introduction to psychology with a specific topic in mind, and Professor Hirsch was incredibly enthusiastic about the subject matter. However, sometimes it felt a little bit redundant for someone who is already familiar with introductory psychology.",
    "The course is well structured and the lectures are easy to follow.",
    "The class was extremely well-organized and engaging. Dr.Hirsh made everything super clear using a variety of techniques to make sure the concepts would click across a variety of different types of learners. Class was filled with activities and media that reinforced concepts and homework allowed us to get experience applying this knowledge.",
    "Professor Hirsch was a very engaging lecture and she was definitely very passionate about the material. I thought that the homework assignments and the movie activity were very helpful to apply the concepts learned during class.",
    "The lectures and content were very interesting. There could be better guidance on labs",
    "Great material",
    "This course was extremely boring. The labs were graded unfairly and the tests were super unfair.",
    "Its a great course. Lecture is worth attending but the slides are good. The assessments are good. The material feels relevant.",
    "This course can be a bit redundant but its structure is really good for learning. You also get a really good idea of how to conduct research.",
    "I thought one of the strengths of the course was that it was really well organized. The expectations were really clear and the professor's teaching and lecture slides were always really clear, and the examples that she used were always engaging, memorable, and relevant (e.g. watching the Harry Potter movie at the end of term and having to give examples of personality-related terms that we'd encountered throughout the semester). \r\n\r\nProf. Hirsch was greatit's clear that she is really enthusiastic and knowledgeable about her field, and I felt that I was learning a lot with each lecture. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I wish we could have talked more about was the real world implications of personality psychology. For example, I volunteer with No Closed Doors, which helps New Haven residents with job search and applications, and one thing that I encounter fairly often is that many large employers, like Walmart or Stop n Shop, require applicants to fill out certain personality-assessment-type exams as part of the application. Many colleges' career counseling departments, for example, have links for their students that tell them what jobs they might be suited to with their particular personality. I understand that we are approaching the field from the standpoint of a personality researcher, so it may not be a perfect fit to talk about the huge industry that personality assessment has become, but it would have, I think, been helpful for me to be able to make those sorts of connections to the way that we see personality testing in the real world, and to see what some experts have to say about it from the research side (what types of personality testing are helpful for people? Under what types of circumstances? Are there conflating variables or other aspects of personality assessment that might be problematic or not necessarily borne out by the research end of things?)",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Lectures were super engaging!! Loved the mixed content of video clips, PPT slides and in class exercises \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Multiple choice on the exam were really difficult. I felt like a couple of the multiple choice each exam was very specific to the readings, and could be more generalized to topics in the readings or from lecture",
    "Strengths; course structure and material",
    "Fun lectures, exams are a bit more difficult",
    "I think this is a very well done class",
    "A strength of this course is definitely the material, since personality is something so relevant and intuitive that we almost forget to think about it. Professor Hirsch is also a great lecturer; she breaks down the material in a way that is engaging and easy to understand. I also liked that the requirements and expectations on assignments were very clear and that the workload was relatively light. In terms of weaknesses, my only complaint is that lecture material could sometimes be repetitive, and it was hard to know what material from the textbook would be important to know for the exams.",
    "I thought the class was great! Super interesting and relevant to everyday life",
    "The workload was very manageable and it was a great way to get a survey of the topics in personality psychology. I really enjoyed how the course assignments were organized; there were two lab assignments with multiple parts that built on each other and also a movie activity in addition to the two exams. During lectures, it was also nice to get a recap of the previous lecture in order to jog what we had been doing before. It was great with retention and learning about the new concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses were not about the professor but how the professor presented the material. Professor Hirsch is an energetic and chill professor who is super approachable. However, I did not like how she ran her lectures during the middle of the year. At the beginning of the year, there were surveys and videos about the topic at hand that gave us real-world connections to the topics and kept us engaged by providing a reason for why we were taking the course. The lectures became bland and dull during the middle of the semester. One possible reason I have for this is that the slides just have way too much text; even though it might help for people to review, it is their problem if they are not present during lecture. There is no need really for such long slides; maybe even create two versions of the presentation slides.",
    "strengths: well structured, clear, easy to follow, informative\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "Strengths: super engaging, work is interesting and doable!",
    "This course was amazing! I really enjoyed every aspect of the course!",
    "The course truly structured its assignments in the way that was best suited to teach the material of this course. All too often, courses default to psets and long tests, which aren't always the best for the subject being evaluated. This course truly adapted the traditional structure to best benefit the learning of the students, and did so in a way that was relatively fun. The instructor was also a big part of what made this course great. She always brought a certain passion to the lectures that made them very engaging, despite the 9am start time.",
    "This course was well paced and covered a large amount of material at a reasonable pace that made sure that students were not bored, but also allowed for full comprehension. The material was presented in such a way that it was easy to understand and included many interesting examples to allow for deeper engagement with the material."

    "Yes! People make judgements about other's personalities all the time and this course will help you be more aware of those judgements and what goes into them!",
    "Yes! This class is amazing and really fun, and I recommend it to anyone whether they are a psychology major or not. It's a great opportunity to learn about your own personality, how personality psychology research works, and how to interpret the personality traits of other people. Although it was an early class, I genuinely looked forward to coming to class every day!",
    "If you're interested in an intro level psych class, highly recommend this class because it's interesting  and the assignments help you understand the material better!",
    "Yes, good. interesting",
    "Yes, great intro-level psych course for majors or non majors.",
    "Yes, because it was interesting.",
    "highly, it was an engaging topic with engaging material",
    "Would highly recommend this course! I think the subject matter was very interesting, and Prof. Hirsch is an amazing lecturer and all-around wonderful person. The workload was not trivial, but I never found myself stressed out by this class.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "Yes",
    "It was a good introductory class on personality psychology, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course. I took it despite having taken several Psych courses and felt that I learned a lot without too much overlap because other courses mostly emphasize Social Psych rather than Personality Psych. Prof Hirsh is a great instructor -- she is very smart and creates clear and informative lectures, and she also does a great job about setting expectations. The workload can feel heavy because you are tested on the lecture and the textbook, so you need to do both. Moreover, the lab assignments can feel monotonous on top of the weekly reading. It's still worth it though because the exams are straightforward and easy so long as you took good notes during lecture (and review them) and read the textbook (and skim your highlights). The lectures were sometimes just based on textbook material but often also had new material with interesting deep dives into certain areas. There were also some cool guest lectures.",
    "Yep, although to me psychology sometimes feels intuitive, I really though Prof. Hirsch was great.",
    "I would take this class if you are interested in personality development and personality from a psychology stand point.",
    "Yes! It is a fun class where the professor is very knowledgeable and helpful. Great lecture style and the textbook is also very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who wants to learn more about personality and is interested in the subject matter, but I would be hesitant to take it if youve already taken an introductory psychology class or AP psych because the material is pretty similar.",
    "Yes, very enjoyable course. Not too much work and interesting material.",
    "Yes! The class was a lot of fun. Even though it was at 9am and attendance wasn't mandatory, I never missed class because I enjoyed it so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a very interesting topic and the lectures were very organized.",
    "Yes! Youll learn a lot and not be too overwhelmed with work",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely not. There was literally no possible way to do well in this class regardless of how much effort you spent on it. Tests had questions that were extremely irrelevant to course material. We learned nothing useful. Barely learned about any personality types.",
    "Yes - learn about cool things, not too much homework, good assessments. Lecture is worth going to but is missable when other classes work gets in the way.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes; very engaging and relevant",
    "Yes!! It is so much fun to go to and if you attend lecture and do the readings (which are really interesting) the exams will be a breeze.",
    "Yes! Great class, more relaxed vibe and interesting.",
    "Yes this is a very engaging and interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I found it really exciting to be able to learn about the different ways we come to conceptualize and understand ourselves, and it's really fun to see a lot of these concepts play out in your daily life. The assignments let you get some cool insight into yourself and your friends, and the workload is extremely reasonable. Professor Hirsch is also super nice and helpful.",
    "Definitely! Not too tough and applicable for everyone!",
    "For me, I wanted to take a psychology course that was a survey of psychology but also something I was interested in. I choose to not take intro psych because I had taken AP Psychology before and scored well. Personality Psychology was a great survey of the topic at hand and it was great for the situation I was in. However, if you're looking for a survey of psychology and there is no good reason to not take intro psych, I would recommend taking intro psych.\r\n\r\nIf you've taken AP Psych, the process of doing psychology of research might even be basic in this class so it might be easier than expected, kind of a gut.",
    "Yes. This course was very interesting and you'll get as much out of it as you put in. very manageable workload.",
    "Absolutely! Super interesting and relatable content, as well as interesting and engaging (but not overwhelming!) assignments. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was enjoyable and the subject was applicable to everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. In addition to being a fun course to take, I believe that personality analysis is something that everyone could benefit from, and this course is one of the best ways to begin training oneself in that analysis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is a fun way to be introduced to a more specific aspect of psychology (which is a very large\/broad field) that is very accessible and easy to understand even for students who may not have any background in psychology. The material covered is very relevant to everyday life, so it is interesting in that sense as well."
