                "Professor Kim breaks down very complicated mechanics of water treatment so that it becomes easy to understand. During different stages of the water treatment process, there are different types of ways that contaminants, pollutants and NOM get removed, so we perform simple mass balances to understand how effective each of these steps are at removing dirty stuff in the water. Most importantly, he teaches you how to break down really complicated problems into simpler steps by analyzing the process, defining the system, and solving these simpler models to arrive at a solution. Let's not forget that he took us on a class field trip to the Whitney water treatment plant!          :)",

We then went more in depth into each step in the process (sedimentation, chlorination, filtration, etc) and learned the math and derivations behind the equations. There was a large emphasis on mass balances."

                "The strength of this class is Professor Kim, he is very good and patient. The only weakness for me is the lack of practice problems completed in class.",
                "Great professor! I wish more of the material would have been written out instead of only slides. I liked watching the zoom videos from last year and that teaching style where there were slides but he was writing out concepts while speaking. I think that is the best way to fully understand the material in this class.",
                "A great course, gives you general engineering knowledge while narrowing in on specific topic (water treatment), which I found very impressive.",
                "Professor Kim makes lectures so interesting and knows how to gauge the overall participation of the class. We would take breaks or stop to do a min-seminar on ground-breaking technology\/research related to the chapter we were discussing if he noticed that students were getting sleepy. The material was sometimes quite dense but Professor Kim reiterates the concepts quite often to make sure everyone understands and is on the same page. The problem sets were quite interesting but manageable; you would have to put in the time to go to office hours and our TA Aidan was almost always there to guide us through the problems. Overall, the class was engaging and I enjoyed the vibe I got from taking a class with Professor Kim.",
                "I like that this course went through each type of filtration techniques as separate lecture notes, which I thought was done in a very organized way. While I do appreciate the slide format, I think that it caused the lectures to go by faster than they could have.",
                "I think it could be improved if there was more application taught in the class as opposed to strictly concepts.",
                "Strengths: Mini seminars are highly enjoyable and informative. Content has many practical uses.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are very conceptual while problem sets are very math-based.",
                "A strength of this class is the exams. There can be a lot of material and some of the derivations can get pretty intensive, but Professor Kim reassures you that the most important things to know are the mass balances. I thought the exams were a very fair evaluation on our knowledge, and additionally, Professor Kim is a very generous grader.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this class is some of the long and tedious derivations are incredibly hard to follow, especially in the powerpoint format that Professor Kim uses. I often found it hard to focus with all the numbers and letters on the screen. However, I appreciated Professor Kims mini seminars that he gave on interesting current research in the field."

It is a really great course for anyone interested in understanding the water treatment process but more importantly, how we, as engineers, should break down complicated problems into smaller, simpler steps (by making some key assumptions and grouping unknowns) in order to arrive at an approximately good solution to our problem. Professor Kim cares very much about all his students and is always available by appointment and so feel free to contact him to schedule a time and maybe get lunch with him in the Commons. (You won't regret it)",
