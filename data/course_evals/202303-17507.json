                "- It is a great overview of the history of the economic development of Latin America and its current challenges \r\n- Professor Zedillo has a lot of knowledge as former President of Mexico which he tries to share during the first 30 - 60 minutes of class\r\n- Professor Zedillo is always open to answer questions of the students\r\n- Really enjoyed the sessions with other colleagues like Professor Werner, to complement the view of Latin America.",
                "The seminar is great. The readings were interesting, and Professor Zedillo offered lots of great insights.",
                "Key themes about the economic history and development of Latin America. An analysis of common conundrums and policy missteps that have impacted the continent. Exposure to some of the leading thinkers on Latin American development.",
                "I came into this course with very little Economics background, but after putting in a ton of work, I can confidently say this was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale (I'm a senior).\r\n\r\nComing into the course, I had taken introductory microeconomics about 3 years before--and that was it. So, at the beginning of the semester, I had no choice but to put in a heavy amount of work to catch up on macroeconomics (I read a textbook, looked stuff up on online, asked questions to ChatGPT and other students), and then kept a consistent amount of effort throughout. Fortunately, this course was very qualitative, which was helpful for me as a beginner: I did not get bogged down with equations or formulae, and I was able to apply general social science skills to work through and understand the concepts. Still, every week was a new, enriching challenge with fresh readings; by the end of the course, my knowledge of economics (especially international economics) and Latin American economic development had taken a quantum leap. \r\n\r\nProfessor Zedillo provides unique insights of extremely high value, and the pressure and excellence he exudes helped shape my experience for the better. As a Latin American, I think this class is an incredible privilege to understand the world and history I come from, and how I can help shape it for the better in the future."

Would have loved to have more speaking time of Mr. Zedillo, lecture style\r\n- More feedback of reading responses or Midterm would be appreciated",
                "The strengths are the structured chronological approach and a rich selection of readings. The weakness is that the class focused on student presentations, which rarely offered anything beyond what was discussed in the readings.",
                "Strengths\r\n--Prof. Zedillo is incredibly well-informed, and his anecdotes from the inside of Mexico's central bank and presidency are fascinating. \r\n--Readings are well-cultivated, and we strike a good balance between breadth and depth of topics\r\nWeaknesses\r\n--Basically no feedback offered on how you're doing in the class. The midterm is a score out of 200 with no comments or guidance\r\n--Student presentations take up the bulk of class time, and these can be a bit hit or miss. I would prefer to listen to Prof. Zedillo lecture on the same topics.",
                "The main strength is the sheer amount of high-quality knowledge and insight you get about Latin American economics from a former President of Mexico. The second main strength is the format of the class, where each session has readings followed by a student presentation. I presented twice, and each time I was forced to engage deeply with the reading material; when I wasn't presenting, I could tell the presenters had put in some serious effort to do a great job, and it really enhanced my learning. The presenters work hard because Professor Zedillo WILL call out and correct any BS or mistakes in the presentations: there is pressure to be excellent in this class, and it makes your experience better.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is that, when people weren't presenting, I got the sense that some students (particularly SOM students) would just snooze and not pay attention. I wish there was a no-technology policy during class so that people actually have to engage with the session. I also wish there was more feedback from professor Zedillo after the readings and midterms."

                "Yes, specially if you have any type of relation or interest in Latin America. Professor Zedillo shares personal stories and practical knowledge. The course gives you a great overview of the falls of Latin America and the challenges for development. I would say that Professor Zedillo is actually always open to answer questions or thoughts from the students, he looks like a serious person but I think he is truly interested in teaching students. Professor Zedillo talks for like 45 minutes and the remainder of the time is for student presentations (some better than others), would have loved to have more time of Professor Zedillo talking.",
                "Yes, the course teaches you really well about the main economic currents underpinning Latin American development since the region's independence from empires.",
                "Yes, if you're prepared to put in the work and are interested in the topics",
                "Any Latin American who is serious about understanding their country and how to make it better should take this course. Just know that Zedillo is not at all the type of professor to hold your hand throughout--you've got to be self-motivated and put in the hours yourself."
