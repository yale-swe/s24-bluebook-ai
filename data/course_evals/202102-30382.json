                "Impacts of behavioral choices at a public level",
                "I gained insights about human behavior that I had previously assumed were axiomatic. I also learned about myself.",
                "Fundamentals of what behavior change really means and how it is applied in public health. I also learned the strategies that can be employed to encourage and effectively cause someone to implement healthier behaviors.",
                "Comprehensive foundational knowledge in behavior change theory, including behavioral economics, the individual and environmental drivers of the major behaviors that are associated with chronic disease, data supporting that association, individual and public health-based interventions, and social inequities and cultural factors that drive disparate outcomes across communities. Skills acquired include research skills and the proper citation of sources, and further application of theory to real-world situations. Lastly, the individual behavior change assignments gave me insight into my own behaviors and areas for improvement.",
                "Firmly a good knowledge on social behavior as it influences a certain population, skills on how to navigate behaviors specifically towards positive change and new insights particularly asymmetric paternalism.",
                "I learned about self-motivation, cognitive behavioral theory (as it directly affects/shapes how I view any behavioral changes). I gained insights about myself such as motivation for behavioral change, endurance, and limitations. These can all be translated into public health as well, especially if I'm thinking of creating some broader campaign to help change a specific behavior.",
                "Increased understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of factors that drive behavior change.",
                "This course was extraordinary.  The level of insight of the professor and her dedication to the interventions outlined in the course is really impressive.  I have had a lot of background in the fields covered in the course and I was amazed at how much I still learned regarding the effectiveness of interventions and the way that the science and practice come together to create either superior outcomes or at least insight into what interventions are not working.  I also really increased my appreciation for the way that the research and the literature support impactful interventions and challenge approaches that seem appealing but lack evidence.",
                "-Personal awareness.\r\n- Foundations of behavior change at a personal level and how this translates to  a larger population.\r\n- Awareness and deeper understanding  that behavior change is complex process that PH professionals must be aware of  when planning and implementing  public health programs",
                "I developed meaningful tools to set and implement goals and how you might structure an intervention on a population health level.",
                "I found the instructors videos to be extremely user-friendly, helpful, and overall the course content and the way the course was taught really improve my overall wellbeing\r\n-Giving us motivation to improve our overall health by incorporating assignments was great\r\n-My only real experience with the TF's were with Crystal, and I found her to be extremely supportive, and taught the discussions well\r\n-Definitely having this course as the first course along with statistics was a great idea, as it was less stressful, less time-consuming, and provided a good balance",
                "I learned some about critically approaching the interpretations from some studies.\r\nI learned how difficult change is.",
                "I learned basic principles of public health behavior. We learned about behavior change and why it is so difficult on a personal and public health level.\r\nThe class sparked many interesting discussions.",
                "How Dr. White can teach health behavior, while also positively influencing the health of her students is quite amazing, and I think that is one of my most positive take-aways from the course.   I learned that changing human behavior is quite difficult, especially amongst ourselves but I was motivated to do so at first by the extra-credit, but later by the health behavior changes themselves!\r\n\r\nThe fundamentals of obesity and poor physical activity in America were reinforced and updated my knowledge base.  However, I was not aware of the enormous public burden of mental illness, and gained valuable insights into the prevalence not only among the general population, but among graduate students and physicians as well.",
                "I learned a lot about nutrition and behavior change. The course provided great insight into strategies that could be used by public health initiatives, as well as challenges faced by practitioners developing or implementing public health initiatives. The course also opened my eyes to a lot of new things as related to population health.",
                "Fundamentals concepts of behavior change through lectures, readings, and hands on experience. There were also some staggering statistics in nutrition, physical activity (or lack thereof), and mental health.",
                "1. The social and personal factors that are critical to the development and implementation of a public health intervention plan. \r\n2. The perspective also allowed me to learn quite a bit about myself. \r\n3. The importance of messaging and the interconnectivity of health as it relates to the individual and the community.",
                "The biggest insight was how mental health needs to be on par with physical and dietary considerations. I also managed to maintain my behavioral change goals all semester--quite the accomplishment!",
                "I gained a lot of insight into how to influence behaviour and decision making on an individual and population level.",

                "Behavior change techniques \r\nPopulation health analysis \r\nDesigning a public health intervention",
                "Foundations of behavior change was an excellent overview of the many behavior change strategies that can be utilized in the field of public health as well as in daily life. Being graded on our ability to enact behavior change in our own lives was an effective strategy that left a positive impact on my overall health and well-being. Learning and implementing different types of behavior change strategies helped me figure out what strategies were best for my own behavior change projects as well as gave me ideas to enact change in the field of public health.",
