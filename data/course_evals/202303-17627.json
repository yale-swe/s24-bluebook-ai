We also tracked the intersection and influences of philosophers upon each other, following the progression of intellectual history.  All of the course readings are primary sources, so you quickly develop\/strengthen abilities to understand dense texts. I walked away with a broad understanding of intellectual history that overflowed into my other humanities courses; at many points throughout the semester, I was able to make connections between my courses that would have been otherwise lost.",

We learned about the ideas of many individual philosophers, in addition to how these philosophers interacted with, encountered, and influenced one another, including but not limited to: Hegel, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heiddeger, Sartres, Simone de Beauvoir, Hannah Arendt, Girard, Foucault, and Derrida.",

I also learned how to put different thinkers in dialogue, which was particularly interesting.",

                "Really strong course overall with a major flaw! I understand that the whole \"surprise\" of the course was revealing that Heidegger was a Nazi at the end, but I feel like more attention throughout the course could be paid to the biases of the philosophers and how they impact how we interpret their philosophies. For example, Hegel said that Africa has no history and characterized Africans as sorcerers with no morality or religion. His racism should have been acknowledged to students to inform their reading of his theories on history. As a woman of color, having to learn about bigoted white men with little to no acknowledgement of their racism on the part of Professor Shore was incredibly disheartening, especially because the class was otherwise so strong. I am happy to talk to Professor Shore more about this in a constructive manner!! Feel free to reach out by emailing josie.helm@yale.edu.",
                "Not sure tbhcourse is well designed to give you taste of each thinker (almost like a sampling table) that you can take too pick\/choose thinkers to explore in depth later, section helped with making sense of readings\/enriching understanding of material, and essays gave opportunity to reflect, and midterm\/essay was interesting moment to synthesize (and all were reasonable and interesting).",
                "Strengths are that we learn so much about the broad scope of the history in a short amount of time. The lectures were great. Weaknesses is that sometimes there was way too much material in one lecture, and it felt very rushed especially as we ran out of time at the end of class. There was way too much material to be able to discuss it all in section, but I think it's just the style of the course and kind of what's necessary to be able to give us the full picture.",
                "Strengths - Marci is the most incredible lecturer. She will captivate you with stories on the bloodbath that was 18th-20th century Europe and thinkers' roles in driving or responding to this. The assignments are flexible and open-ended, enabling students to commune individually with political and philosophical ideas. Section really helps to distill sometimes abstract content into real-life considerations. No weaknesses.",
                "Lectures are pretty interesting, and the primary source readings were (largely) interesting too, even if several were dense and difficult to understand. Prof. Shore is engaging and I had a fantastic experience working with my TF. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were interesting, but sometimes, I felt it would be better to split certain thinkers (like Hegel) into two lectures. The course also goes very fast, and I wonder if some of the thinkers\/readings could be trimmed. Also, the paper topics are a little unorthodox, and I think it would help to have a traditional final paper in lieu of the final exam (or to do the final exam in-person rather than as a take-home). Finally, I wish the course had more of the history side and less of the ideas (a couple of the thinkers are really complicated, and focusing on the history \/ context when they wrote the ideas seems more important than the ideas themselves in several cases).",
                "It gets a little old because Professor Shore uses a very specific vocabulary (the amount of times she used the phrase orgy of bloodlust is disturbing) and spends too much time emphasizing the fact that there are trends and currents in intellectual history without actually delving into what they are. That said, it was a nice introduction to modern european intellectual history. Due to Professor Shores specialization in eastern european history, there was a slight bias in the syllabus and even more so in lecture toward eastern european thinkers. It would have been nice to have an ed discussion forum or something similar for us to share and discuss ideas.",
                "Strength: Professor Shore is a fantastic lecturer. She always ends class with a bombshell, so please do stay for the last five minutes. The section is FANTASTIC as well (shoutouts to Daniel). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more review. I liked the last lecture that tied everything together, but would've appreciated more synthesis throughout the course.",
                "Overall this course was great, and Shore is a great lecturer. Some weeks we had an unreasonable amount of readings, so guidance on which readings to prioritize for those weeks would've been appreciated.",
                "Strengths: lectures were brilliant (love Marci) but sections were very inconsistent I feel. The final exam was incredibly long and draining (3 essays for the whole 3.5 hours), and though suited for the course, perhaps 1 or even 2 slightly longer essays, or take-home essays, could have been a better judgment of the course. As it was, it was an endurance exercise as much as a review of material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore, accessible yet interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "strengths: Marci Shore is a great lecturer and explains difficult philosophical ideas in simple term and analogies. I really enjoyed being able to learn about the iconic thinkers in an accessible format. I also was able to apply many of the ideas I learned to concrete instances around my personal life, which was surprising!\r\nweaknesses: the course felt less like \"European intellectual history\" than \"European philosophy\" in the sense we didn't really learn about the historical context for the thinkers' ideas; the readings were all primary sources of the philosophers' original text which were difficult to read on my own and discussion sections were not super helpful in deepening my understanding of the readings",
                "only strengths great lecture with great syllabus. Marci Shore is also awesome. section could be more structured to facilitate deeper learning\/engagement with the material, but it's fine.",
                "Strengths - very interesting. Good selection of readings - not too overwhelming\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes delved into philosophical intricacies which I would not have expected from a history course.",
                "It's a good class. But note that it's an intellectual history class, and will at times seem more like a philosophy class than a history class. I wish it had spent more time on European history and a bit less time on the complicated minutia of each thinker's philosophy, especially since we are expected to write about history in our essays.",
                "Professor Shore's lectures are simply PHENOMENAL. She teaches with such passion, such intentionality, and such poise that is impossible to not become fascinated by modern European intellectual thought yourself. Towards the end of the course, my friends and I had to wait at least thirty seconds after the lectures finished before we could stand up, as we were so transfixed by the lectures and lost in thought that we couldn't bear to leave before reaching some sort of mental closure. Shore does a wonderful job connecting all of the thinkers at the end of the course, and perhaps more importantly, maintaining throughlines in the form of questions that many of these thinkers have contemplated (like the subject-object gap). She is inexplicably able to weave disparate parts of modern European intellectual history into a cohesive narrative. Shore's lectures are so entertaining, too; her anecdotes and (seemingly) tangential remarks about her children just contribute to this overall sense of wonder. My TF Yung In was a gem, too -- she adroitly facilitated discussion in our sections, causing them to feel like seminars (and truly helpful in understanding complex ideas and readings rather than a chore). I wouldn't have batted an eye if it had turned out that Yung In was secretly a tenured professor on sabbatical -- that's how knowledgeable she is! She was also always willing to help and frequently invited us to reach out. Professor Shore and Yung In made for a brilliant pair, leaving me completely astonished on Mondays and Wednesdays, and clear-eyed and perspicacious on Thursdays. The only weakness I can think of is the sheer density of readings at times; the \"Husserl's Children\" readings were lengthy and relatively uninteresting (but that's only one out of fifteen weeks of reading!). So, no real weaknesses and many, many strengths.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore's lectures, the syllabus structure, knowledgeable TFs; Weaknesses: The reading loads were all over the place; some weeks were up to 200 pg of reading, others were extremely short. It was sometimes to difficult to tell which readings were most important. Also, I think the instructors could emphasize more of the historical context during the first half of the course",
                "Strengths: the biggest strength of this course is the sheer number of thinkers that are covered. The lectures and readings together give you a pretty broad and wide-ranging overview of intellectual history in the 19th and 20th centuries. Readings are difficult, but if you've always wanted a chance to read some of the most important philosophical texts of the past 200 years, this class is a great way to do it. Marci's lectures are very clear and well-organized, and they're very good at summarizing the most important historical and intellectual points for each thinker in a very comprehensible way. Also, the workload is not ridiculously highthe essays aren't too long, and they're actually pretty fun ways to apply what you've learned about 1-2 thinkers in a creative way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class isn't particularly engaging or intellectually stimulating. Marci is an amazing lecturer, but she does not allow questions, and discussion sections don't really have super engaging or interesting discussions (they are mostly just there to review and clarify difficult concepts from the lectures and readings). Also, the readings are very long\/difficult\/dense, and you don't really need to do all of the readings to do well in the class (as long as you understand the material from lectures), so it can be pretty hard to motivate yourself to work through all of the readings.",
                "The main strength of the course is that Professor Shore is an excellent lecturer: I found myself looking forward to every class to see which angle she would take on the topic at hand. This class is worth taking to hear her lectures alone. Administratively, the essays are very manageable, and the final was quite fair. In terms of weaknesses, I feel that the course doesnt do enough to engage with the reflexive relationship that existed and exists between European thought and histories of colonialism. Theres a Fanon reading, but it wasnt discussed in lecture. In addition, theres evident inconsistency in quality between lectures: I found the Nietszche and Foucault lectures to be especially lackluster in relation to others. This is understandable in the context of the fact that this course covers so much content, but next to the EXTRAORDINARY lectures on Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, and Girard, among others, I think a bit of revamping could improve the course. I also think that there is some counterproductive conflation of the Stalinist Terror with the Holocaust that approaches the kind of double genocide theory that Shores husband Timothy Snyder has been condemned for by peers. None of this should dissuade you from taking an excellent course, but its worth mentioning.",
                "Phenomenal class with a great assortment of thinkers. TAs were all really smart and engaged with the topic too. Only weakness is that some of the works we read were loads of yapping. Not a fan of Derrida.",
                "The course was very well organized. The topics were all well selected and the flow overall was very good.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lecturesextremely tight and well-paced, section was a great place to clarify questions about each thinker, reasonable workload (pass\/fail brief weekly reading responses, two very short papers, two exams), the readings were well-curated to get a sense of each thinker without being overwhelming.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses! Flagging to future students that having a good TF is important because section is quite importantyou learn about the thinkers not just by absorbing lecture, but by actively asking questions about them.",
                "good overview, not very deep",
                "Strengths: Interesting thinkers, excellent, descriptive lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is an understood constraint of the course, I wish we could go more in depth with each thinker. \r\nAnother more important weakness is that the historical flow is less clear.",
                "amazing course, everyone should take it regardless of their major. Professor Shore is an extremely engaging lecturer, so the complex material gets well-decompressed with a touch of personal anecdotes. No downsides to this course.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING class. BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE TAKE THIS CLASS. Makes complicated texts and subjects something I could grasp without feeling like the content was being diluted. the lectures were incredible and the writing assignments were always interesting, The midterm and final were fair, sometimes a bit hard to study for but definitely helped me learn more.\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of the course is Professor Shore's lecturing; she does an amazing job of assembling and presenting information in a digestible way. This connection to the material is further developed by discussion sections; depending on your TA, your format of interacting with the assigned texts will change, but they are all there to help familiarize you with the actual publications. One weakness is the amount of assigned reading, especially if you are taking other reading\/writing heavy courses. The course packet is about 900 pages, and most of the texts are difficult to get through. You should not go into the class expecting to read all of the texts every week; even if you don't, and you rather focus on the primary thinkers of each week, you will still be able to gain a solid understanding of the material. If you set a routine, pay attention in lectures, and make an effort to stay up to date with readings, the course is not that intense for the benefits that it offers.",
                "Strengths: professor Shore is an engaging and passionate lecturer, which makes attending class fun. Weaknesses: since the structure of the course is a lecture-survey, most of my learning came during section after reading the primary sources. The class relies on TAs to help the students really get into and discuss the material, which would theoretically be fine, but not all the TAs were equally passionate teachers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore is a phenomenal lecturer, the readings were interesting and engaging, the essays were fun and creative, section was lively and provocative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings varied wildly in terms of length and complexity. More consistency across readings might be nice.",
                "Great class. Too much content to really understand or go into depth into any of the thinkers, but thats really the nature of the class.",
                "Marci shore is incredible. Such an amazing lecturer and really well connected and selected material.",
                "Strengths: Great content, well-structured, and an extremely knowledgeable group of instructors\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "This course was great at making complex philosophical ideas digestible. \r\nHowever, I sometimes felt that the professor's personal ideological biases seeped through in her teaching.",
                "The central strength of this course are Marci Shore's incredible lectures. Professor Shore's lectures are clear, engaging, and informative. She is able to pack so much information into the lecture time slot and somehow make it accessible and entertaining at the same time, peppering the information with funny stories, the philosophers' personal histories, and mnemonic devices to help us remember the material. She really is a storyteller, and the way she weaves together information is extraordinary. She is able to break down these super dense, seemingly inaccessible philosophical ideas into concise formulations that then make the readings all the more easy to understand. The lecture hall was packed all throughout midterms week, which is just a testament to how much students love the lectures and always want to attend, even when things get super hectic! \r\n\r\nThe other core strength is how well the course is organized on Canvas, with important quotes\/vocabulary from every topic posted ahead of time to help guide student note taking.\r\n\r\nProbably the one way the course could be improved is to make sections more uniform across the board. I loved my section experience, but heard a variety of experiences from friends in different sections. It seemed like the general consensus was that section was hit or miss, and also the way sections were run was quite different depending on the instructor.",
                "Strength: lectures",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Shore's lecture style, as I felt she did an excellent job at communicating very complex ideas in easy-to-understand ways. I do not think I would have understood much without her teaching skills. I also liked how frequently she would connect each thinker to one another to demonstrate the various webs of influence and interaction that transpired. I do think that at times the course included so many names and schools of thoughts that I lost track of who was who or why each person was important, and I felt like some of them were understood ultimately as inconsequential because of how brief their spotlights.",
                "This course was outstanding! The lectures were succinct, engaging, and intellectually stimulating, the sections reinforced the lecture material, and the essays gave us a chance to explore and analyze the ideas in our own words. The only suggestion I have is to recenter the midterm around essays rather than short answers + an essay.",
                "In terms of strengths the course material itself was very interesting and engaging. The amount of reading was not excessive given that it was only assigned once a week. The discussion sections were important in clarifying questions and encouraging dialogue\/reflection.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the format of the exams could be made more clear beforehand, so that one could lay out their notes in a way that made it easier to study later on.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore is a brilliant lecturer, the course is well-organized in terms of syllabus and materials on canvas, and the workload is reasonable.\r\nWeaknesses: There's no one really holding you accountable, and there are only a few assignments throughout the semester, so you have to be self-motivated to stay on top of the readings and pay attention in lecture.",
                "weaknesses: very uneven TFs, Professor Shore is not directly involved with the students at all strengths: establishes good foundation for European Intellectual History",
                "Strengths  the lectures themselves, the organisation, the syllabus and Marci!\r\nWeaknesses  because there are so many readings we were often rushing through them in section, which often felt unproductive\/superficial though that can't really be helped",
                "The syllabus is really incredible and as such the students are exposed to great thought and thinkers. Prof. Shore has a great knowledge, but is often off track. She sometimes fails to mention the historical perspective of the writers, such as what events influenced their thought."

                "Yes!!",
                "Yes! Great survey course for those interested in philosophy with a dose of historical context. Its especially good for first-years seeking an introduction.",
                "Absolutely! Was so interesting! I enjoyed Marcus lectures (tho will admit not everyone I knew did), and I think its a great way if you have limited knowledge of European thought\/philosophy to engage with and learn about new philosophers (and for me, which was super important, why their lofty thoughts make sense for their context)",
                "Yes! I think it's important to learn these fundamentals, and you also get very invested in the arc of the story. It introduces you to super fundamental ideas and prompts lots of reflection.",
                "Yes yes yes!!! Take it even if you are not in a related major. These topics are incredibly important for your general knowledge and understanding of history, and the class genuinely makes you think about how this affects our world order today. Marci is wonderfully engaging and can make anything from Freud's psychoanalysis to Heidegger's existentialism fascinating.",
                "I would, but with the caveat that this course is VERY philosophy-focused with little history. Prof. Shore contextualizes the thinkers, but I was disappointed that we did not do more work historicizing each thinker. The heavy focus on primary sources\/philosophical ideas meant that discussions could sometimes get really dense without much history to ground them.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Shore is an excellent lecturer. You'll be bound to fall in love with at least some of the thinkers in the course. But you'll also begin to think of the world in a different way with these philosophical lenses.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It provided me with a great baseline knowledge of European philosophy that will help me in my later Yale classes. The material was difficult, but the relatively easy grading and assignments made the class not intimidating nor stressful. Shore is also a very engaging lecturer.",
                "Yes as an overview course or if you just miss\/wanted to do DS without the workload. Lectures are engaging, primary source reading can be difficult but worth it, and you definitely learn something new.",
                "YES. Professor Shores lectures are riveting, and the content contextualizes every course  Ive taken at this school (and every dinner party where people throw around terms like dialectic. My only regret is not taking it sooner.",
                "YES! If you take any lecture course at Yale, please let this be one of them! Marci is an amazing professor and the course is structured in a way that is manageable while remaining incredibly engaging.",
                "YES, this course was super informative in giving me a sense of the arc of European intellectual thought and some thinkers intrigued me in ways I hadn't imagined before! it's not perfect though, for example, I think the last two lectures were meh and discussion sections were not very helpful in deepening my understanding of course materials.",
                "absolutely! everyone should take this course before they graduate. you learn so much about philosophy and really prepares you to be an intellectual in the world.",
                "Yes if you are willing to put in the work to immerse yourself in the class - this is not an intro course. \r\nNo if you dislike philosophy.",
                "Yes if you're interested in intellectual history. You do have to like intellectual history! But if you do, you'll really like the class.",
                "Overall, despite the issues I've identified, I would recommend it. Professor Shore is a great lecturer and the readings are well-curated.",
                "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to all Yale students. Professor Shore's lectures are simply brilliant -- this is the best lecture class I have taken, and likely will ever take, at Yale. The class changed my perspective on various philosophical questions, from the nature of truth to the power of guilt and responsibility. It is an especially meaningful experience for students, such as myself, who have not yet encountered philosophy or the history of philosophy in an academic setting, and will be exposed to--and forced to grapple with--questions that humans have spent millennia thinking about. One may forget about the names of philosophers or the terms that they use over time, but will indelibly retain a unique way to view the world and their surroundings. If you only have the chance to take one humanities class at Yale, take this class.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to other students. It is a great overview that gives you just enough background into the philosophical ideas underpinning modernity.",
                "Overall, yes. This class is a very good broad and wide-ranging summary of many of the most important currents in intellectual history over the past two centuries. Marci is a great lecturer, and she really summarizes all of the most important philosophical arguments of each thinker in a clear and comprehensible way. This class is also great if you've always wanted to learn a bit about basic (continental) philosophy without taking a full-on philosophy classthe workload is not too ridiculous, and you also get some very cool historical information\/anecdotes as well, which was often the highlight of each lecture. However, don't expect a hugely life-changing or intellectually stimulating experienceI would view this class as a pretty standard Yale lecture, with the benefit of one of the best lecturers at Yale, but also with the usual drawbacks (discussion sections aren't great\/no one really wants to be there, pretty low active engagement with the material, etc.).",
                "Yes! The amount I learned about philosophy has given me a plethora of new lenses with which to evaluate the world, and Professor Shore is an amazing guide through what can feel like a difficult set of topics.",
                "Best class Ive taken by far. Not only does it make you a better thinker and reader, but if you take the time and effort to meaningfully engage with the course you will also have some deep thinking about much broader issues not just in the political sphere but in your everyday life. This class really made me think like no other class Ive taken yet, which was really refreshing. Every student should take this class.",
                "Yes definitely! It was a great course to take to improve both philosophical and historical knowledge.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It's an excellent introduction to extremely important thinkers whose ideas shaped the course of world history, mixing history and philosophy. Prof. Shore is incredibly nice and a great lecturer. I sincerely believe that everyone who's interested in these subjects should take this course before graduating Yale.",
                "I would- its a fantastic introduction and survey course of late 19th and 20th century European philosophy, its evolution, and how philosophers built and explored on ideas of their predecessors, in the historical context of 20th century Europe and its destruction. If this sounds interesting to you, dont hesitate.",
                "Strongly. Marci Shore is an excellent lecturer.",
                "I actually feel the content discussed and read is at a fairly difficult level, especially for what you might expect from an introductory course -- still, the course accounts for this by attempting to be as helpful as possible in helping you understand it, both in lecture and in section. Professor Shore was great at explaining the importance and intricacies of concepts in lecture, often leveraging examples from her own lived experience to help do so, and anything that was left even a bit vague was always covered in depth in section. My TA was always willing to spend extra time to go over more difficult ideas or passages, and I enjoyed the manner in which discussion was oriented in order to foster not only inter-student discussion of the concepts but also the degree of credibility we felt they offered to the issues they attempted to solve. It did unfortunately feel as though a fair amount of our readings were not afforded the time they deserved, simply by the reality of the limited amount of time we had to discuss such a large number of primary texts. Also, I was a bit surprised by the number of people in my section that seemed to have an already existing profound understanding of most intellectual currents we discussed, which sometimes made it so that others who were reading these ideas for the first time did not have the same opportunity to weigh into the discussion. Nonetheless, for a class that discusses such a vast amount of philosophical ideas of profound caliber, and that successfully markets itself to an immense selection of potential students, I would say the class was incredibly effective and worth taking -- but if you want to get something significant out of it, you will have to ensure you have enough time to meaningfully work through the readings. Otherwise, it was great! You should consider it.",
                "yes, content was p interesting",
                "Yes. For any student who wants to learn about the many different influential intellectual movements which influence thought in the western world in which we live, this is a great class.",
                "It is a course that should simply be taken by everyone to understand how the ideas that shape different societies came together, and it will teach to think independently and identify certain patterns instead of conforming to them",
                "YES YES YES TAKE IT TAKE IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Even if you do not want to major in the humanities, this course offers a great foundation for understanding the broader context of many subjects that you will encounter through both your college career and life beyond Yale.",
                "I'm glad I took the class as CR\/D\/F because I got to dive into some interesting thinkers. Otherwise, I can see how it would be stressfull for students who haven't engaged with this material before, as the class requires a decent amount of outside work to first understand thinkers' concepts and then draw historical connections between the thinkers. I would recommend the course if you can commit to doing all the primary source readings, doing supplemental readings to understand those primary source readings, and you can get into a discussion section with a TA who is good at synthesizing the thinkers' points with historical context.",
                "Yes! It's one thing to leave a course equipped with new knowledge, but it's an entirely other thing to leave the class with a broad, conceptual understanding as to the trajectory of the course. I now understand exactly why this course is labeled \"Intellectual History Since Nietzsche\" -- namely, that Nietzsche announced the death of God, and since then, all of intellectual history can be understood as an attempt to fill that gaping void. Indeed, from History with a capital \"H\" (Hegel and Marx) to the phenomenological, existential, or unconscious self (Husserl, Heidegger\/Sartre, Freud) to structure (Levy-Strauss, Derrida, etc), there has been no shortage of attempts to replace God in the past two hundred years. And that broad understanding is something that very rarely crops up in courses, no matter how great they may be.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes. This is such a great and enriching survey class.",
                "Yes! It's a great survey course on European philosophyone that all students should take to be better informed on how ideas develop to affect our world. The historical lens on philosophy really grounds complex ideas in a tangible way, so it's a great course to take whether or not you've engaged with some of these thinkers in the past.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Marci is an amazing professor. It's impressive how sh has managed to incorporate so much material into one course so effectively. The course \"rushes\" through time, philosophies, and thinkers, but it's executed brilliantly, allowing students to grasp the broad picture and trends in European intellectual history along with numerous insightful details. Getting that \"big picture\" is the main objective of the course. It lays a strong foundation, enabling students to contextualize what they would learn about European thinkers later on.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student without much background in intellectual history or european history as a whole.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Whether you are pre-med or a DS alum, this course delves into the deepest human questions and provides frameworks for thinking about problems that are relevant to everyone's life, no matter what you study or what career you intend. to pursue. Speaking from personal experience, I would highly recommend this course to DS alums, as it covers all the gaps in intellectual history that DS does not cover, such as structuralism, existentialism, Husserl\/Heiddeger etc. In the same way that DS provides an overview of philosophical problems that then helps you figure out which philosophers\/issues you would like to dive into further, European Intll history does so specifically with modern philosophy (with a focus in the second half of the semester on 20th century thought), in addition to helpful historical context that DS does not cover.",
                "Yes, Prof. Shore is an amazing lecturer and provides a good survey (not in depth) of all the thinkers covered in the course. I didn't gain anything from section, but it was worth it for the lectures.",
                "Abslutely!",
                "Yes!  Wonderful course, fascinating lectures.  So great to take in conjunction with any other humanities courses at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is important not just for academics but also for life.",
                "Yes, 1000%! So much of these thinkers come up in other courses. This was a wonderful survey course and I found myself thinking about these ideas outside of class...you'll drink your coffee black and want to go abroad after this. Also, preps you for those dinner parties where you can insufferably bring up Nietzsche in every conversation. Marci Shore is a fantastic lecturer. Also, I didn't even have Matthew Reese as a TF but Oh My GOD GIVE THAT MAN A TENURE!",
                "Absolutely! History major or not, this course is well-worth taking for any Yale student and will require you to reflect on major questions that probe who we are and how we should live.",
                "Definitely, the way the course was structured and the material presented not only taught me concrete information but opened my mind to view the world around me in a different light.",
                "Definitely! (unless you took DS). It's a reasonably low time commitment, you will gain familiarity with a lot of important thinkers, and the ideas you learn in this class can really guide you to think and learn in new ways. You'll also get to learn from a professor who really knows how to lecture, not just read off some slides. It's a pretty theatrical experience.",
                "No, I felt that it was too disorganized and the content can be quite vague.",
                "Yes yes yes yes!! Whether you want an accessible introduction to the humanities, or are a senior humanities major\/person who missed taking DS or has some gaps in their education, or is simply looking for an introduction to 20th century philosophy (all of which is relevant today  Heidegger, Sartre, Arendt, Foucault are truly timeless thinkers) and some great storytelling, this class will do it all.\r\nIf Yale had a core curriculum, I would demand this class be the sole class on it.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in a low-stakes introduction to some fascinating thinkers.",
                "Yes--it's an interesting class.",
                "Yes. It was an INCREDIBLE survey of European Intellectual History since the Enlightenment, and made me SO much more informed (I had pretty much no deep experience in any sort of serious philosophy prior). I now find that so many of the ideas of the thinkers we read and learned about appear in my everyday life, and I genuinely am able to apply them myself, for example in my own decision-making. It's definitely super useful to HAVE these ideas swimming around in your head; I think they make life more interesting."
