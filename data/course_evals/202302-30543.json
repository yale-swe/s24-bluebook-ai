While living in Italy, the course helped supplement the cultural immersion experience by teaching technicalities of grammar and vocabulary which host families and various other experiences could not. 3 hours a day of full immersion in Italian really propels you to fluency.",

Instead there was a \"culture\" section where we would listen to songs or read articles. The consensus from the class was that we would like to read something different (that we understand) or spend the time having planned debates\/discussions.",
                "A lot was crammed into the last week which made it stressful but the teaching was very clear.",
                "The strengths are plentiful; the instructors really care about your input and help shape the course accordingly. Moreover, the fact that everything is conducted in Italian really makes a difference in terms of reaching fluency. Feedback received is very clear and although the textbook is expensive, it is thoroughly used throughout. The workload is very manageable and fair within the context of the summer experience. The grading is the right amount of harsh overall to push you to succeed. At times, however, there would be an exam and a composition around the same time after having had a required weekend trip. Furthermore, due to the intensive nature of the course, you must be prepared to get taught a complex facet of grammar the day before an exam or look over it in advance. I believe this is part of deal when you do a summer course like this, but sometimes the syllabus can put complex content close to the exam. Nevertheless, if you ask the professors they are more than welcome to make accommodations.",
                "Refer to reviews of ITAL S130.",
                "I believe that the strengths of the course included the kindness and willingness of the instructors to explain material that was not super clear. I think it also helped that the syllabus and instructors recommended that students read the material to be discussed in the following class the night before. It allowed for any confusions to be cleared up easier. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, there was not much. I do feel as if not enough time was spent some days on the more challenging grammar sections before switching over to the culture portion of the class.",
                "The course was well structured. The grammar part of the class was clear and easy to understand. However, I feel that we could have learned more Italian phrases and sayings during the culture section.",
                "The small class size made for a very engaging class and since we met every day and the class got to know each other very well, it was a very close-knit environment and very comfortable for language learning."
