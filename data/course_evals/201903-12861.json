    "I developed a new understanding of the refugee literature genre, and the unrealistic expectations set upon the writers of this. I've learned to ask myself while reading this genre what exactly an \"authentic\" representation of the refugee experience is, and whether the narrator is a reliable narrator or not.",
    "I learned how to produce a high quality thesis, manage my time properly, and various techniques to continue writing when I am stuck. I also was able to expand my view of both refugee literature and what it means to be a refugee\/displaced through the interesting readings in this class.",
    "I improved my writing and essay skills in all areas- especially in forming my thoughts and critical opinions and in learning how to draft and edit an essay",
    "I developed my ability to draft, edit, and push my writing.",
    "Improved reading comprehension and writing skills.",
    "learned how to write and think critically about literature (and nonfiction too). learned how to read well and expanded knowledge of what \"refugee literature\" can be.",
    "Learning to read and discuss refugee literature from many different points of view. We read a variety of literature from many different authors, cultures, and time periods. My previous definition of refugee literature was challenged and redefined many times throughout the course.",
    "I improved my writing a lot by taking this course. For example, I learned how to write more concisely. I learned how to fully develop an argument and how to choose an argument that is much more complex than what I was used to on a high school level. Throughout this course, I struggled a lot with the brain-storming stage, and this course taught me how to have more confidence and patience as a writer as I explored arguments that were out of my comfort zone. More specifically, I gained an understanding of the responsibilities of refugees and the complexities involved when refugees choose (or choose not) to write."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I greatly enjoyed the fact that this course was a seminar class very much centered around student learning and discussion. I think it can be improved by setting up agreements on the first day of class in regards to how the discussions should go (such as not dominating a conversation and having equal distribution of participation) and the values that we have during a discussion (such as respect).",
    "I do not think there were any weaknesses!",
    "I would add in more current news",
    "Strengths: Incredible professor, Dynamic Structure, Fascinating Reading \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "4 papers throughout the semester, the first three becoming progressively longer and more involved, while the fourth was shorter (~3-5 pages) and more creative. reading, class discussion, writing, and peer editing were all really helpful in becoming better reader and writer. My first English class at Yale and Justin was great so I have little basis for comparison and little to complain about",
    "Strengths: interesting topic that attracts very opinionated and curious students, interesting literature\r\nWeaknesses: tended to be very instructor-dominated or led by a single outspoken student (oftentimes very disproportionate amount of time allotted per student for a seminar), usually did not account for multiple points of view (many of the discussions were one-sided)",
    "Such a great teacher! So incredibly kind and understanding. Texts are engaging and so much guidance.",
    "One strength of this course is its variability. Though most of this course centers around student discussions, Professor Park uses different learning techniques to challenge students. There are visual aspects involved in class, as well as some in-class group projects, and the essays are very open (meaning that the student has the flexibility to choose their own argument). However, one weakness of this course is its pacing. Some works of literature, in my opinion, were a bit rushed. It sometimes felt that this course attempts to cover too much refugee literature in one semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Park is great and so obvious cares about his students' learning. We also had the opportunity to interact with a lot of great texts that aren't well known, and we spent a lot of time trying to s trengthen our writing skills.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class that I took this semester. I used to really dislike english courses and writing because I always thought that I was a terrible writer and I wouldn't be able to improve. This class really changed my mind. Before, I never would have voluntarily participated in class (i.e. just to get the points for participation) but the readings in this course were so thought-provoking that I always had something to contribute. I also improved my writing by leaps and bounds, especially since before I was only taught to follow the 5 paragraph format.",
    "Yes, definitely a good course to push your writing skills",
    "Yes. The content and themes of this course have influenced all of my other classwork. It has made me a better writer.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. This was the only english class I shopped so I can't compare to others, but Justin was a great teacher for ENGL115, and the material and class discussion were always interesting and usually pretty relevant for current events",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who genuinely cares about refugee-related causes, loves to discuss challenging topics, is proactive in going to office hours, has an interest in history, and\/or is interested in a variety of literature. If so, this class will probably become your favorite.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I had never read refugee literature before taking this course, and this niche course is extremely applicable to current events. It challenges students to consider the responsibilities of refugees as they write, the demands of the audience, and the potential cliches involved in telling a so-called ethnic story. On top of that, this course pushes students to question abstract concepts such as empathy, imagination, and the idea of home and forces students to step out of their comfort zone when considering these concepts."
