If you are in the slightest way interested in East Germany, Cold War literature, or film, you should take this class because it was so interesting. I loved all the literature and film that we read and watched, and I learned so much. Because it was both a graduate and undergraduate course, people came to the class with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, and it really created a vibrant learning environment."
