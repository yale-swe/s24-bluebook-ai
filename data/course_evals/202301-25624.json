                "Better ability to process various types of media in Spanish - improved conversational ability.",

I also grew to be more informed about Spanish culture, especially through the intercultural exchange program we did with the students from PUCP, a university in Lima, Peru.",

                "Very heavy workload. Homework was not posted on time on a regular basis.",
                "strengths: well organized, cooperative, straightforward \r\nweaknesses: repetitive, and lacks engagement at times",
                "Overall, I think L4 Spanish is a fascinating course, and I really enjoyed learning about art, indigenous culture, political issues, etc. in a seminar style, in Spanish! The course content was great. However, I feel as if we had too many perusall assignments outside of class. Also, one recommendation I have would be to integrate the end-of-semester conjuguemos reviews/ grammar practice activities throughout the entire semester, because they greatly improved my understanding of and fluidity with verb tenses.",
                "Rigorous and generally interesting material. Felt like the content was cohesive which was helpful but also may have limited our conversations to the same kinds of discussion (which may not have been great for vocabulary?).",
                "I think the course offered several opportunities for us to learn about Spanish culture and practice our more technical skills. I definitely feel that in comparison to my previous Spanish class from last semester, I found myself being more engaged in the course material. My only complaint was with how the Canvas site was managed, as there were several instances throughout the semester when modules would not be published, leaving me and my peers confused as to how to approach our homework for that day.",
                "Strengths: Homework was generally kept pretty doable in one night, although not always. There were a lot of different types of assignments, and that was a plus. Grading was pretty chill. I really liked the intercultural dialogue parts (virtual \"pen-pal\" zoom conversations a few times throughout the semester). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was too much expected of us for it to be 1.5 credits instead of 2 credits. Expectations for the intercultural dialogue weren't super clear. I would have appreciated slightly more formal/involved instructions on what to talk about each week and when to switch between languages.",
                "This class is great at exposing students to aspects of hispanic culture, as well as connecting the students with other hispanic students to expand knowledge, conversational skills, and overall comprehension of Spanish.  However, there was not a good level of work for the class. This was by far the most time consuming and unforgiving workload I have had."

                "Looking back, I'm glad I took this course, and I do feel like I've improved as a Spanish speaker. However the workload of this class was VERY high - homework assignments included almost- daily readings with required public comments on perusall (many of which didn't feel 100% productive) and group projects with limited completion time. Additionally, there was an overall lack of clarity about what was due when because of unclear due dates. This increased the stress of my classmates and I, and we often found ourselves completing additional, unneeded work by mistake. However, Profesora Leon is very sweet, engaging, and understanding, and she facilitates great discussions! And I loved the intercultural dialogues with students from Peru!",
                "Yes, if you want to improve your Spanish with lots of exposure and are willing to engage with all of the work. I found that when I was busy otherwise, the assignments quickly started to feel like busy work, but this was likely a result of my schedule.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think Professor Leon's course facilitated lots of room for growth and improvement in a way that was approachable and unintimidating for its students, which is something I personally value a lot when it comes to selecting the right courses for a given semester.",
                "I guess if you're really interested in Spanish and have less anxiety about speaking in class than I do, it wouldn't be so bad. Otherwise, if it's not required for you, I wouldn't recommend taking it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to better their Spanish speaking abilities, but I wouldn't recommend taking it with many other heavy workload classes."
