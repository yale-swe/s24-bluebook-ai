    "-A lot of new knowledge of classical literature, and a development of a new vocabulary for thinking about literature that I don't think I had before (this developed not by this class alone but throughout the experience of Directed Studies)\r\n-Really enjoyed the essay prompts and think I grew as a writer",
    "I learned about the early works of the Western literary canon and developed my writing and analysis skills.",
    "I gained skills in close reading. Professor Barasch pushed me to read more closely and get more out of each text.",
    "Finally got to read Homer, which I wouldn't have read otherwise. Learnt a lot about literary analysis and improved a lot in class discussion.",
    "Close reading, Dionysian-Apollonian dialectic, poetic forms, literary tropes, and the beauty of words",
    "Close reading of passages\r\nThematic Connections between  the works read\r\nKnowledge of ancient Greek and Roman texts",
    "I learned a lot about the earliest texts that shaped literature as we know it today.",
    "I learned to better analyze readings in literature, and read in relation to the greater importance of a work of literature."

   "comments": [
    "strengths- seminar discussions were always fun and engaging; I learned a lot. Always got pretty thorough feedback on my essays.\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes felt like a lack of continuity throughout different themes in literature; the sheer pace of the course is overwhelming.",
    "The course was great for introducing students to a lot of important works and ideas. As with all DS courses, however, the speed with which we moved through the material limited our ability to go into great depth or discuss aspects of some texts.",
    "Less reading I guess",
    "This courses strengths are the significant improvements made in students reading and writing ability.",
    "strength: got to read lots of classics, which definitely provides a solid foundation for future literature studies. \r\nweakness: tried to cover too much.",
    "I think the discussions could be more structured, guided by study questions that pertain to the theme of the book. It's easy to be bogged down by details in DS.",
    "Strengths: \r\nVery open intellectual environment, controversial opinions more than welcomed\r\nDiscussing the Bible as a work of literature with students of different faiths is incredibly fun and a totally new way to look at things\r\nYour writing will improve\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nLots of material, very little time: Some works get as little as 75 minutes of attention (waaaay less than time spent reading them) which can be frustrating\r\nMainly \"Western\" literature (whatever that means); no Asian or Indian literature",
    "I know there's only so much we can read in a year, but it would be interesting to read some ancient works that aren't Greek or Roman but had a heavy influence in the Western canon, for example: Gilgamesh, the Book of the Dead, Pirkei Avot, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad-Gita, or the Ramayana. It would also be interesting to read works from the Islamic golden age like the Qur'an and One Thousand and One Nights, or to read non-Italian vernacular works like the Eddas, the Nibelungenlied, Beowulf, or el Cantar de mio Cid.",
    "The readings were really interesting in this class, and Barasch often made interesting points that added to my understanding of the texts. However, we often didn't cover anywhere near the entirety of the text."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as they've accepted the general limits of Directed Studies and its emphasis on breadth over depth, the literature is definitely an exciting experience",
    "Yes, since it is a good overview of the early works of the Western canon. You need to be prepared for a large workload of reading and writing, though.",
    "The class was very interesting and exciting",
    "Yes. Directed Studies literature is an excellent course that pushes students to their limits to become better writers.",
    "yes, if you would like to study literature\/art in the future.",
    "Yes. Barasch is great at provoking your thoughts and delivering points that you might have not considered.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with Professor Barasch. The method in which we address classic texts allows newcomers and experienced people alike to analyze these texts with completely new takeaways.",
    "An excellent survey of pre-modern literature in the Western canon. Everyone loves DS Lit! For anyone who is worried about the under-representation of women, I think female characters are present and complex in the Odyssey, Sappho, and Greek tragedy -- which together make up about half of our course material -- and there are important moments about women in the Iliad, the Aeneid, the Metamorphoses, the Hebrew Bible, and the Divine Comedy -- rounding out the syllabus. For anyone who is worried about the under-representation of minorities, this is certainly the literature of \"the Western world,\" dominated by Greek, Roman, and Christian perspectives (although the Hebrew Bible is Abrahamic). However, while everything is viewed through that lens, which is often limited, what is viewed through that lens in these texts is often of vast importance to all human experience. Each of these works has something important to offer everyone and cannot be discounted. Furthermore, these books were written in conversation with one another. There is something great to be gained in reading them that way.",
    "This is a good course in which you'll read some of the most important works of literature. However, you definitely have to be prepared to put your own work in, both in reading the texts and thinking about them, since discussions cover so little ground.",
    "Yes"
