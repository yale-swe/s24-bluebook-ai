Ximera was an especially useful resource. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt find the classes themselves extremely productive or engaging. I felt like I didnt leave class fully having mastered a topic but instead found Ximera more useful.",

Some other things I liked were the guided notes, review sessions before exams, and being allowed to use a one-pager when taking exams.\r\nI think one of the weaknesses of the course is that what we were taught in class wasn't always enough, and often much simpler than the homework, so at times, the homework was very confusing."

There were lots of opportunities students could take to get help, such as office hours, peer tutoring, and review sessions. Every class, we got guided notes, and every week, we got a new problem set. We always knew what was coming up because the teachers communicated through announcements on Canvas, so we were always given an adequate chance to prepare."
