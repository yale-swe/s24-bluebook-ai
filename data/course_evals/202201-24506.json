                "The weekly reading responses could have been graded more often",

                "I liked the lecture style of this course and the consistent workload. I would have benefitted from getting feedback on a draft of my final paper.",
                "I think perhaps this course would benefit from steering towards either a seminar structure or a lecture structure, I found it a little challenging to participate  in person as this class kind of inhabited the space between those two formats.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kockelman is very eager and passionate to help students and makes himself very available for questions during office hours, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Class felt unstructured, meant to be a seminar but is actually more of a lecture, you receive essentially no feedback on your work throughout the entirety of the semester so you have no idea how you're doing by the end of the course, impersonal classroom dynamic makes it difficult to pay attention, some of the readings were the most challenging texts I've ever had to read",
                "The course's greatest strength was the broad range of thinkers on which it drew; no two weeks were alike, and it was never possible to predict what would come next. By discussing the nature of the human as subject from so many distinct angles, the course gave the sense that a scope which was, if not comprehensive, at least indicative of the full range of thought on the matter was being presented. However, the handling of the material itself could be less effective. The in-depth notes required from each reading often made the process of preparing for class feel like filling out a checklist, and class discussions were largely driven by a few dominant voices, with little expansion of the material beyond what was written in the readings."

                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend to anyone with any remote interest in anthropology, psychology, philosophy, or art theory. Paul is really great at combining a wide range of texts across disciplines and truly one of the best professors I've ever had.",
                "Yes, because it is very interesting and leads to extracurricular learning as well as classroom learning. Also, the consistent workload was helpful to my participation in the class.",
                "I think take the course if you have ideas and interests that looking at the foundations\/underpinnings of agent\/person\/subject\/self could help flesh out. I did find it tended more towards philosophy\/theory than I was expecting",
                "No. I thought the course was going to be a seminar (given that the class only had 10 people), but it ended up being more of a lecture where we would raise our hands to add onto what Professor Kockelman was discussing so that we could get our participation credit. Because of this, and also because of how unstructured classes were, I found it difficult to stay engaged. Professor Kockelman brings a lot of energy to class, and I definitely appreciated and admired his expansive knowledge about the topics we discussed, but I wish the class had been more discussion based. He is also fabulous in office hours and is very enthusiastic about offering help to his students, but I think this came across more in office hours than it did during class. We also received essentially no feedback on any work we submitted throughout the semester, so I was finishing this class with no idea what my grade might be. My favorite part of the course was writing the final paper because we had complete freedom to choose our topic and base it on a close reading of some texts from the class, and I found this to be very fun. However, I unfortunately cannot say that I look back fondly on my experience in this course, mainly because I feel like I didn't really learn that much and most of the time I was in class I found myself checking my watch to see how much more time we had left",
                "This course offers a perspective on questions of the self which few Yale students will encounter outside of it, and for this reason it is worth investigating. However, the high homework load and lack of engaging class discussions make it difficult to maintain interest over the course of the semester, so I would likely avoid this particular class."
