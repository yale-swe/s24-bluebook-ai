I know unique folk tales and jokes from Deaf culture, and I have a much better understanding of the issues facing Deaf people in the world today.",

There are many elements to take into account when learning ASL from facial expressions to the motions, and I think this class gave me a wide variety and Im excited to learning more.",

            "comments": [
                "The immersive class setting was super useful for picking up the language. Professor Fisher is everything you could want out of an instructor. The only difficulty I had was reviewing vocabulary since the online textbook the class uses doesn't allow you to revisit old assignments without marking them as resubmitted\/late. Online ASL dictionaries often used different signs from the signs we learned in class. In the future I think it would be helpful to have more recordings of the professors signing for students to use as review.",
                "The ASL classes are unique because they prioritize community engagement through the service project. This helps the student get involved and have a practical opportunity to practice what they are learning",
                "I think this class was really engaging and fun. Classes were organized effectively, and the inclusion of things like videos, games, and discussions made things very fun. \r\n\r\nI think early on, it was hard to study for class outside of class. The review videos were very helpful, and would have been very useful early on. I felt like I was getting behind for a lot of the year, and I wasnt able to get tutoring.",
                "I loved how interactive the class was and the way the class was taught",
                "Strengths: Professor Fisher\r\nWeaknesses: It can sometimes be hard to know what you're supposed to remember in terms of vocab.",
                "I really liked the orientation of the class so we could all see eachother. I really think this style of learning was important for this class in particular and I think the way the class was presented on PowerPoints was also very helpful.",
                "The pacing of new topics was good and the in-class reviews of vocabulary from the previous class was very helpful. The course's focus on Deaf culture and community makes is strong and incredibly valuable. Having a bit more guidance on service projects could be helpful, or incorporating time in-class to work on projects or check in with the professor and classmates."

                "Yes, but please don't believe the misconception that this class is a gut. The service component of the class ends up taking a lot of time especially at the end of the semester, and learning new vocabulary is surprisingly difficult compared to learning spoken languages. But if you're interested in Deaf culture\/history and you like the linguistic aspects of ASL (which are totally different from English), you should absolutely take this course.",
                "Absolutely, it is definitely the best language option in Yale College.",
                "I would recommend this class. ASL + focusing on culture, accessibility , and diversity was really great. Class is fun, and the asynchronous day being Friday is truly incredible. Students understate how difficult this class can be at points, but its doable and fun at every point.",
                "Absolutely this is the most fun class Ive ever had",
                "Yes, it's a great class and you learn a lot",
                "Yes! Professor Fisher is the best. I took this because I knew I wouldn't have time for a more work-intensive language like Spanish or French, but ended up loving it.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone looking for a language at Yale. ASL is different from all the other languages and it is even more special that the teachers here at Yale are deaf themselves. I think this makes the learning environment that much more special and unique.",
                "Definitely, this has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you have thought about learning ASL, you should take the opportunity to take this class - the professors are wonderful and you will be able to learn a lot in one semester. Your friends who have taken ASL will tell you the same thing!"
