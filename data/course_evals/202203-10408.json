                "Knowledge of main thinkers throughout modern European history, intellectual and personal connections between them; how to read dense and challenging philosophical texts and make sense of them.",
                "You often hear philosophical terms thrown around in everyday speech--dialectics, modernism, the New Left, structuralism--and this class teaches you what they mean in an accessible and engaging way",

                "I learned about the major thinkers in Europe after Enlightenment. I learned how to read primary texts of these thinkers, putting these thinkers in conversation with each other.",
                "This course was a fantastic introduction to Intellectual History and truly sparked my interest in the field. I learned many new philosophical concepts and gained insight on a previously known period of history through a different lens.",

                "So much! Got an introduction to many major thinkers of the 18th-19th c. European canon and a good sense of the trends/themes that connected them all. Much easier to learn about philosophers when you understand the previous work that they were building on. You don't go in depth on any of them; the professor describes the class as teaching you enough to intelligently discuss these thinkers at a cocktail party -- but if that's what you're looking for, then this is great!",

Understanding of Enlightenment and Romanticism, Hegelianism and Marxism-Leninism, psychoanalysis, expressionism, structuralism, phenomenology, existentialism, anti-politics, and deconstruction.",

                "Shore took us through the biggest thinkers in Europe starting in the Enlightenment, through Romanticism, Phenomenology, Existentialism, Modernism, and finally into Post-modernity. It was a class with a lot of breadth and little depth. It gets you started thinking about the \"big questions\" of existence and being.",
                "You will learn about the main philosophical and political movements since the Enlightenment in Europe. You will read excellent texts and see how many thinkers influenced each other across time and space. You will learn to articulate their ideas and relate these ideas to your own beliefs",
                "I learned so much about philosophy -- I feel like I have at least a basic grasp of all the philosophers we discussed in this class. I'm constantly connecting random moments in my life to philosophy we learned in this class too.",
                "I gained so much context for the events of the 20th century by understanding the influence of various schools of thought. I also worked on forming connections between different thinkers and the events of their time and other thinkers. I think the most interesting insight though comes after you've understood the general wave of intellectual thought and the ideas of these philosophers begin to pop up in your everyday life. I feel that I was able to reconcile so much of what happens around me as well as my own thoughts and feelings by contextualizing them with theories learned in this class.",
                "The course offers an excellent coverage of history of philosophy, it is fascinating to learn about the thinkers themselves behind theory",
                "I learned so much this past semester in History 271. It is a very comprehensive Western Philosophy survey course, and beyond just learning about each individual, I learned how to put them in conversation and actually analyze their beliefs in context of others.",
                "I've learnt so much about philosophy starting from Hegel, and those are super applicable to life as well.",
                "Learned about the development of intellectual thought. Read and discussed a range of thinkers, how their philosophies interacted with and stemmed from each other, and how to understand this.",
                "This class gives a fantastic overview of the history of European thought from the Enlightenment through the fall of the USSR. Each class is devoted to a different thinker, and Marci does a fantastic job of weaving the narratives together into a coherent story of intellectual evolution.",
                "even if i didnt learn every single thing in the subject of eur int hist  or even anything near that, as a non history person, by the end of the course I was surprised by how much I had managed to learn. I had a general overview understanding of most things/thinkers/concepts, and general understanding of how things developed overtime historically. I was also pleasantly surprised at the ability i gained to connect different themes.",
                "How intellectual thought developed in Europe from Enlightenment to post-war era",
                "I learned so much about the ways to think about the world, life, self, others, society, governments, etc. The course gave me the language to deconstruct everything and understand it, and constantly find new ways to understand and analyze things in every aspect of my life. I find myself always thinking about concepts and frameworks and arguments introduced to me in the class, either with my friends or just myself.",
                "General knowledge of major philosophical movements in Europe since the Enlightenment",
                "Not much to be honest. I would strongly advise against taking it if you have some familiarity with philosophy or if you've taken DS, for instance.",
                "Learned lots about 19th and 20th-century intellectual history (major currents, periods, waves of thought, etc., in addition to the philosophies of notable thinkers like Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, etc.). I appreciated learning about these thinkers across the broader arc of 19th and 20th-century history, analyzing how major events such as WWI, WWII, and the Holocaust impacted intellectuals and their ways of thinking.",
                "Good post-DS knowledge of modern intellectual history",
                "I learned more about the development of intellectual history! It was really cool to follow the threads of different thought and see how various thinkers have affected one another.",
                "This course provided a really helpful overview of European Intellectual History and Continental Philosophy. I appreciated its broad structure, which allowed for varied and engaging exposure to the subject matter. I had never taken a philosophy course before, so this class helped me gain comfort with philosophical readings and themes.",
                "A notion of modern intellectual development in Europe.\r\nThe idea that reality may not be like we usually think it is, that it depends on discourse and language.\r\nThe strength of ideas to move humanity.\r\nAnalyzing philosophers from a historical lens.",
                "The insight I learned in this class was tremendous. Truly. I am now very comfortable relating philosophical thought to certain aspects of life and the course has completely altered my perspective of how I should perceive life and thought.",
                "I gathered an understanding of the arc of Western philosophy since the turn of the eighteenth century.",
                "I learned a lot about the modern European philosophers. I had no idea Hegel and Marx were so influential, and I learned the gist of what a lot of philosophers were talking about. I really liked the existentialists.",
                "A chronological understanding of European intellectual history that helped me see connections between thinkers and fill in gaps in knowledge",
                "More of a philosophy class than a history class, but it was nice to be introduced to a number of really important thinkers and concepts.",
                "Knowledge of intellectual history, broad ideas and thinkers.",
                "I gained a better understanding of the major western philosophers.",
                "Great survey course on 20th century continental philosophy. Gives you basic understanding of the main questions, themes, and projects of 20th century philosophy and a great roadmap for further reading.",
                "Connecting the philosophies of very different European intellectuals",
                "Best class I have taken at Yale",
                "Professor Shore is an amazing lecturer. Learned an overview of philosophy in Europe.",
                "This course provided a great survey on modern European philosophy and its role in historical events, and I gained a new appreciation for the importance of asking philosophical questions.",
                "I was most excited to finally begin to grasp the people behind the thoughts that bleed through so much of the foundings of our global lexicon. \r\nI will be thinking of de Beauvoir's musings on the curse of maternity, Lenin and Fanon's reckoning with uprisings, and Stein's problem of empathy among many others for some time. I know this is a bedrock course that I and so many of my peers will be thankful for taking for many years to come.",
                "a new outlook on life, a sweeping knowledge of western philosophy post enlightenment and throughout the world wars, so much more than I bargained for, such a gem of a course",
                "Origins of totalitarianism, expressions of the self, different modes of self exploration",
                "This course completely changed my worldview. After every lecture, I was left with so many things to think about and to incorporate into my daily life. The reading load and workload also helped to show me how best to balance time and helped my writing skills.",
                "Excellent base for understanding patterns in European intellectual history, prominent thinkers.",
                "Learned a ton about the most important European thinkers of the last 200 years.",
                "A broad idea of European intellectual history, including its themes, motifs, and connections to real world events.",
                "Fantastic insight into European intellectual history.",
                "I was exposed to many important intellectuals from modern history. I learned about modernities attempt at replacing god in various ways.",
                "I loved this class, had taken DS but learned more about the lineage of western philosophy since the Enlightenment which filled in a lot of gaps",
                "This course absolutely changed the way I think and perceive the world around me. Professor Shore introduces a new thinker to the class in every lecture in the most fascinating and compelling way  I often felt like I was listening to a story, rather than a dense philosophical theory."

            "comments": [
                "The lectures felt like fun \"story times\" but sometimes failed to be the most cohesive in terms of a standardized process of learning that often comes with survey lecture courses. Complemented with section though, I definitely feel like I learned a lot and don't particularly have many qualms with the course. At the end of the course, you begin to learn about the historical context of some of the thinkers, and the more controversial parts of their belief systems. I'm honestly not sure if I would've wanted to learn about that earlier, as it provides more context for who they are but also can detract from their original arguments when taught simultaneously. The effect felt larger learning about it after the fact, just wished we could've done so for more thinkers.",
                "Marci Shore clearly wants to teach a class about Eastern European intellectual history, but I sometimes felt like the rift between Eastern and Western Europe made the class jump geographically from one end of Europe to the other. I refer here to the latter part of the class. I think that similarly to the exclusion of thinkers from European colonies (with the exception of Fanon), Eastern Europe should have its own class to improve the cohesion of the material.",
                "Strengths: the lectures and TA",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore is an engaging lecturer, most of the readings are really interesting, and the papers encourage you to write in a non-traditional way \r\nWeaknesses: in the weeks that covered entire intellectual movements, it would have made more sense if we'd focused our readings and lectures on a few thinkers, rather than introduce 4-5 philosophers and give a little bit about their contributions",
                "I think lectures sometimes moved in a circle which I dont mind but some people do. Sometimes the readings are not explained but for the most part they are.",
                "amazing lectures",
                "Strengths: Marci Shore is a fantastic lecturer. It's really amazing being a part of her class. The papers are short and help consolidate knowledge learned. Weaknesses: so, so much reading. Very hard to get through!",
                "While I really appreciated the lecture sheets, sometimes it was hard to know which words Professor Shore had not mentioned in lecture versus what she had mentioned in lecture that I had simply missed in my attempt to try to understand philosophy. I wish that after the lecture, an updated list of terms was posted that she did manage to cover, so I could review any course content that I didn't quite catch in lecture.",
                "It's a survey course on European intellectual history, gives a good introduction to these thinkers. Each lectures focuses on one thinker (or a movement), so there is no time to dive deep into a thinker's ideas. But it gives you a good sense of what the period's intellectual debate and discussion is about.",
                "The course lectures are perfect. The instructor gave extremely impactful, moving talks using fun anecdotes and interesting storytelling, whilst still focusing on the fundamental material for each week. I was excited every week and found myself deeply concentrated on each lecture. At times, the reading was imbalanced (one week specifically stood out), but the professor did such a great job that this didn't matter.",
                "The MAIN strength is Professor Shores ability to weave intellectual history into a coherent narrative. Every new thinker reflects back and builds upon or changes several previous ones, and the constant reinforcement and mentioning of previous philosophers really shows their similarities and differences. For example, highlighting the extremely important overarching themes of Enlightenment reason versus Romanticism passion, as well as Hegels phenomenology which leads to Marxism, or how subject becomes intersubjectivity becomes a search for the Other, and ultimately how structure is built and destroyed. These themes gave a very coherent overview of main intellectual thought across time.",
                "No weaknesses. I only wish I had taken this class earlier in my Yale career so that I could have benefited from it throughout my time here. Still, if you have the opportunity to take this class ANYTIME, please do that.",
                "The lectures are excellent. The readings were interesting and thoughtfully selected, though on some weeks (specifically Husserl's Children) they were too long, which made it difficult to actually glean anything from them. The sections helped clarify and further understanding of the lectures and readings.",
                "Marci Shore is a phenomenal lecturer that made the information more digestible to my first-year self, and having audio recordings of the lectures made the material extremely easy to review, as well as handouts of terms for each class. The discussion section is also great for developing the ideas of the thinkers among others, almost imitating a salon, and clarifying missing information from the weekly readings, which to me were almost all composed of the essential segments of writing without extra \"fluff\" to skim through; although many of the thinkers' thoughts are confusing and dense, reading did not feel like a chore as the pieces were chosen thoughtfully. The main weakness I found with the course was that the second half of the course was more dense and varied with thinkers compared to the first half, which meant the individual ideas were less developed. I don't mind either but the course should be consistent in delivery.",
                "Strengths: lectures are fantastic and thought-provoking, readings are usually manageable (and skippable if not) -- by far the best lecture course I've taken thus far!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: essay prompts are very atypical and not designed for you to really build an argument, so I didn't get much practice with philosophical argumentation, other than on the final. Didn't love my discussion section.",
                "Course is structured well to facilitate learning. Lectures are great, Prof Shore does an incredible job of contextualising and breaking down complicated concepts by influential figures. Lectures so clear that I felt I didn't have to do the readings anymore, and led to my slacking off towards the end of the term.  One weakness is because of its breadth you don't really get more than a brief overview of each thinker.",
                "strengths: great lecturer; resources to help with notetaking and studying for exams (the handout sheets with important terms!), not too overwhelming \r\nweaknesses: section didn't really add much value to lecture. material was sometimes vague and not explained thoroughly in class. readings were glossed over at many points",
                "Strengths: The lectures are engaging and it is an excellent survey course. Discussion is very helpful and the readings are excellent.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is very disorganized- from the Canvas site to the communication with the TAs. I don't think that Marci Shore does much for the class beyond the lectures. No one ever asked any questions but I kind of doubt she would have answered them because she is so in her own world. At times, her anecdotes were extremely out of touch.",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures, clear through lines and themes across the course, wonderful and engaging readings, should be a mandatory class for all Yale students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just a lot of reading, so keep UP",
                "Strengths: Prof. Shore knows so much about all the philosophers and she's super passionate. She does a pretty good job of connecting different philosophers' ideas.\r\nWeaknesses: THIS IS NOT A HISTORY CLASS!! I took this because I thought I would get a solid historical background on European intellectualism and I did not. Every lecture was just explaining the philosophy of either one person or a group of thinkers. I think it's super misleading that this course is listed under history and humanities but not philosophy. To be clear, I learned a ton, but I was not looking to take a philosophy class and realized too late that I wasn't going to learn almost any history. Any history was just mentioned in the first 5/10 minutes of class in order to contextualize the philosophy that Prof. Shore was planning to talk about.",
                "I think the selection of the course is one of its strengths. We got the chance to commune with so many thinkers. The flipside of that is that I think the lectures are often very speedy which can mean that many thoughts go over one's heads as we're barely given any time to ponder any of the theories while we're learning them. I think this course could be more effective if more time was given to understanding each individual thinker.",
                "I found no weaknesses in the course. It worked really well in a lecture format, and the sections were good to discuss the lectures and introduce assignments. I enjoyed the pacing of the class, and the readings were all very thoughtfully chosen.",
                "strength: lectures are super well taught.\r\nweakness: there's some room for improvement for sections, a bit unorganized",
                "This is a fantastic course- excellently organized and extremely interesting. The breadth of paper prompts allowed us to engage with the material in whatever way we liked- whether that be a traditional paper or a more creative exercise.\r\nMy only criticism is that the number of assignments seemed excessive. On top of readings and weekly responses, we had two papers, a midterm exam, and an extremely difficult final exam. I felt the final exam did not appropriately assess our knowledge of or engagement with the course. It involved two extremely long essay prompts that were impossible to fully answer in only 3.5 hours, much less answer in a creative and analytical fashion. I think a final paper would have been a much, much better way of assessing our ability to engage with the material. The midterm required a lot of memorization, which was helpful to some degree in forcing us to assimilate the information, but testing us on assigning random quotes to thinkers felt like a fairly pointless exercise (especially given the similarities in ideas between many- you couldn't get credit even for making a strong argument that a quote could have been said by another).\r\nI think an ideal assessment schedule would be one short essay (with the same breadth of prompts), one midterm exam (without the quote assignments, or with significantly more lenient grading), and one final paper that allowed us to engage more deeply with one or two thinkers.",
                "Strengths - great lectures and very interesting content\r\nWeaknesses - some readings were very hard to follow and a bit redundant",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of inspiring thinkers and draw amazing connections among them throughout the course. So many different ideas and perspectives but you never feel lost because everything connects to something else and are presented in conversation. Lectures are exceptionally well delivered, clear and super engaging, and sections are also very helpful in understanding the readings. \r\nWeakness: none.",
                "Strength: lectures were clear and interesting and section was designed well",
                "Strengths were the fact that the lectures were online so you could listen to them if you missed one. Weaknesses were just how cursory and superficial the coverage was.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, interesting readings, manageable coursework\r\nWeaknesses: bit more contact with Professor Shore would be great",
                "Good lecture course. Loved the final lecture ending with a quote from St. Pope John Paul II. Very even handed. Allowed me to think for myself. Good TFs too",
                "Professor Shore is a wonderful lecturer, and I think that the course really was organized very well. I'm not sure if there any ways that immediately come to mind for how to improve the course.",
                "Strengths are the professor and interesting topics in question. The selection of authors makes the subject very coherent.",
                "No weaknesses. Great course. Marci Shore is an eloquent, engaging, and amazing lecturer.",
                "I often felt that the course sidestepped history.  Lectures on the contributions of each thinker to the corpus of the philosophical dialogue were erudite and often interesting, but as a history major I felt that we too often ignored the consequences of the ideas we learned about on the real world.  We talked about Arendt and Sartre and Heidegger and totalitarianism, but what about the others?  What about Dostoevsky, for example, and Russia?  Nietzsche and the Third Reich?",
                "We definitely had too much reading from a bunch of people, such as Edith Stein, Heidegger, etc which were basically incomprehensible. Lots of heavy reading. But the lectures were pretty brilliant. Marci Shore can really tell a story. The lectures got repetitive at times, and I fell asleep for some of them. But all that repetition helped concepts sink in.",
                "Strengths: Fantastic lectures, great syllabus; relatively low workload with high reward\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like we did a lot of readings but didnt really engage with them which disincentivized doing readings a bit.\r\nAlso didnt like that the second essay was due the day after thanksgiving break",
                "Good all around.",
                "I dont have any critiques! I thought it was well designed and led.",
                "The reading list is fabulous -- very well curated; not too overwhelming; most were incredibly interesting. Lectures were often great as well but occasionally a bit hit or miss.",
                "Phenomenal class, maybe my favorite at Yale",
                "+: lectures, topics, assignments\r\n\r\n-: readings could be a little unrelated and long, wish we could incorporate them more into section\r\n\r\n-: my TA was slow at grading so we did not know our grades until very late",
                "Strengths: This course had manageable reading assignments which I really appreciated since people were able to actually read and contribute in section. Professor Shore's lectures were also incredible, and I learned a lot from her. Weaknesses: This is a very niche note, but the Edith Stein book took up over a third of the course packet and really should have been separate to make the packet cheaper and more manageable.",
                "Strengths: enthralling lectures, concise/purposeful readings, wide-ranging essay topics, clear student expectations\r\nWeaknesses: room for additional introduction to non-Western schools of thought, could benefit from optional screenings of suggested films",
                "Strength: Marci Shore. She is the most mesmerizing lecturer that will keep you on the edge of your seat every second. There is no time wasted in this course, so much material to cover, so much fun to be had. Readings are topical and fascinating for the most part.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Lectures are great. But the group discussions can be rather unfocused.",
                "Great course. No improvements needed",
                "Strengths: great lectures\r\nWeaknesses: the interesting-ness of the thinkers really drops off after fall break",
                "Overall I thought the course was strong. The one thing I would say is that if you're going to try to increase diversity by including an Angela Davis reading, make it something that's more substantial than a comic.",
                "Brilliant class. Very much enjoyed the content, teaching style, and pacing.",
                "Everything was great.",
                "Honestly a wonderful well constructed course. Not many weaknesses",
                "The readings are perhaps too unintelligible to be useful to students  maybe lowering the amount of reading required or choosing more digestible texts would be better. Additionally, having two exams and two essays also sometimes felt like a lot for a class that demanded so much weekly reading."

                "I totally would. As someone with little to no background in this, I'm glad I now have a comfortable understanding about philosophy.",
                "Take it if you want to learn purely European intellectual history. The attempts this class makes at bringing philosophers of color into the fold can sometimes look a lot like tokenism to show the brilliance of the white authors in the syllabus. For example; we once had a three-page reading by Angela Davis exclusively focused on her appreciation of Marcuse, not why she liked him, just that she liked him. Never did any of the writers of color criticize the white scholars, in fact, they only laud them. Fanon might disagree with Lenin, but we only read his appreciation of Hegel. I think this course should either commit to those authors' complex views of European intellectual history or leave them alone instead of taking their appreciation for European thinkers as mere validation for the existence of this course.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely! Please take a class with Marci - you will not regret it. This class exposed me to topics and ideas I never knew about and made me love philosophy and history at the same time! Marci is an extremely engaging lecturer, and the material is well selected - it all connects together, makes sense, and you get out of the class knowing a lot about all the big names in philosophy (and less famous but nonetheless important names as well). Discussion sections were awesome - my TF was knowledgeable and sweet, and facilitated discussions well. Most people taking this class are really smart, and you will learn as much from them as from professor and TFs. I am so sad this class ended - I want more! This is the quintessential class.",
                "Absolutely. If you have even the faintest interest in philosophy, it's a great introduction to some seminal thinkers.",
                "Yes definitely take this class! I thought the lectures were great and the readings were interesting even if they were complicated. I did not have any philosophy background and I learned so much from this class.",
                "yes! the lectures are phenomenal and you get a really good idea of the topic",
                "Yes! Super fun and chill class that covered important European philosophers and connected the progression of ideas in a historical timeline. Very very very good lectures, great to attend and as a CS major, a really nice and interesting change of pace.",
                "I did not enjoy this class at all. A lot of the material was focused on small, random thinkers from Eastern Europe, with no explanation of their impact or relevance. Professor Shore was shockingly political during lecture. Lecture was too unorganized to be comprehensible, as the professor kept \"dancing around\" the subject and \"coming at it from different angles\" and never actually directly addressed the key points and their relation to other thinkers. Ran out of time with every lecture so just read a rushed quote.",
                "Yes! It's really fantastic and Marci Shore is awesome. The sections are good to clarify topics Marci Shore goes over. Exams are sort-of difficult to study for just because there are a lof of thinkers, a lot of different philosophical concepts, and very little time to get through all of it.",
                "If you've never taken a philosophy course, this is honestly a good place to start. While at times I did have to put in a little extra time to understand the topics (bless all the philosophy videos on youtube), it is a great survey of European intellectual thought. I learned a lot throughout the semester, and think that even if the names of the particular philosopher fades over time, I will retain an understanding of the questions raised and discussed in the course.",
                "YES! Prof Shore is such a good lecturer, every class is like an in-depth TED talk, with a lot of good content and anecdotal story to help you remember the concepts better.",
                "Yes, even if they're not studying History or Intellectual History, this is such a fun, interesting course. If you're a History major this is a must.",
                "Absolutely. Please take this course, it changed my outlook on life and gave me a second, philosophical point of view to assess my surroundings, morals, and ethics. It is low workload but attending all the lectures together really creates an invaluable picture not able to be found elsewhere. As a STEM major, this would be the one class I recommend as both an amazing introduction and also a wonderful thought exercise.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to learn a lot about the history of modern Euro intellectual thought.",
                "Yes. Without a doubt one of the best classes I've ever taken here. Very memorable.",
                "Definitely! It provides a wonderful overview of major philosophers in the context of history and exposes you to excellent readings.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to almost any student of any level that wants to take a fun and interesting humanities course involving philosophy or western social and political movements. The only people I see this course not suited for is those that already have a deep grounding in both philosophy and political history in Europe. I feel as if the material in this course will aid me in future humanities courses. In addition, I myself found the course helpful to clarify my thoughts on a personal level, as I've been struggling with multiple personal matters this fall.",
                "100% yes! This is by far the best lecture course I've taken at Yale. It's definitely an intro course, but you're learning about someone new every lecture, so the class never gets repetitive, unlike most courses I've taken.",
                "Yes, anybody with a remote interest in learning about famous modern european thinkers should take this course.",
                "Yes! As someone who has never studied any philosophy, I appreciated the intellectual history focus. I was able to do well even without the background, and now I feel like I can talk with someone about what we studied with a certain level of mastery.",
                "Yes- I took the class as a STEM major interested in dipping my toe into philosophy- and these little piggies were dipped to be SURE! I learned a lot and though my engagement wasn't the highest with this course, I am still really glad I took it.",
                "YES. I think everyone should take this class before junior year as it has completely changed my perspective on all of my courses. The lectures are amazing, every second is filled with brilliant insights and connections. Marci builds a world and when she asks questions, they really matter and she really gives you fat to chew in the process.",
                "If you want to learn a ton of philosophy in a short period of time, definitely take this! If you're looking for a class on European history, this course is definitely not that.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they do not have any background in philosophy and if they are not particularly keen on a single field within philosophy. The course despite it feeling hard and boring for the first couple of months, really comes together towards the end and you start to view the world with a different lens. It also gives you the base to go off and read more philosophy on your own.",
                "I would 100% recommend it to any other student. The class was paradigm shifting for me and it gave me the appropriate language/perspectives to analyze many things I personally encountered",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others, and already have. I think the information in this course is really important to all History majors, and people interested in current events and policy because these thinkers have greatly informed much of what we think today. Each person featured on the syllabus is such an impactful thinker, and I feel that it is important that everybody learn about them.",
                "YES!",
                "Yes. It's a great introductory class to the history of intellectual thought and it teaches content that is valuable to know. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I highly, highly recommend this course! Marci is such a star, and I hope everyone has the chance to learn from her at some point in their Yale careers. The lectures were riveting and well connected, and the reading excerpts were thoughtfully chosen. I wish I had taken this class earlier in my time at Yale- the ideas you learn about are the foundation of the rest of your Yale education, and completely changed the way I thought about my other courses. The only drawback was that we covered a lot of material in very little time- I would love for a sequel of this course to be offered so that we had more time to explore each idea in depth.",
                "Yes if you want a solid background in philosophers and thinkers. expect to take what you learn into context outside of the class, wasn't much time to dwell on any specific thing in the class itself. the class at times felt boring, but all in all i feel like it was worth it and overall very interesting and important stuff",
                "Yes. One of the best classes at Yale that I've taken. Prof Shore is incredible and breathes life into the materials, which are very interesting on their own.",
                "Yes. This course taught me so many things and opened my eyes to different perspectives.",
                "I would recommend this course to most students as Professor Shore is an excellent lecturer and the readings are informative and not overbearing for the most part. However, this is not much of a history course. While Professor Shore brings up historical contexts in her lectures, the readings, most discussions, and graded work are not strongly related to history. Only take it if you want to take a philosophy course.",
                "YES YES YES YES YES. favorite class at yale so far. If yale has a core curriculum, this is the only class that i think 1000% must be on the list. Changes the way i think.",
                "I would recommend, especially if they have no prior experience in the subject as it is a good introductory course",
                "I would if they are a STEM student looking to venture into the humanities for the first time. Otherwise not really.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, regardless of year or major! I found it to be a very manageable yet engaging class.",
                "Yes! Great course to deepen knowledge of modern intellectual history. Having DS helped and was not redundant.",
                "Yes! Especially for people who are interested in philosophy but intimidated by it, I think this is a really great class to take. Profesor Shore makes the content very accessible and compelling. It is absolutely a survey course though  we don't necessarily go super in-depth, but this general knowledge is still very useful.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the content of the course and the lectures were very interesting. Students who are willing to spend time with the material will benefit greatly.",
                "Yes. It is a perfect introduction to philosophical thought, and gives you lots of insights applicable to present debates about modern civilization.",
                "Absolutely. If you are looking to open your mind to the great thinkers of history and become exposed to radical ways of perceiving things, this is the class for you.",
                "HIST 271 provides, at the least, a foundation for students to understand the canon of modern Western thought.  It is a useful thing to know, and the lectures are interesting and insightful.",
                "Yes, I think I would if they are interested or especially like the material. I liked philosophy but was sort of disappointed in a bunch of thinkers. They dismiss universal truth too easily, and thats why for most of the course I thought they were pretty much being ridiculous. Call me an Enlightenment fanatic but its sort of true. I did like reading the thinkers though, and some lectures were quite good.",
                "Yes, but with a caveat. I entered this course thinking it would be an introduction to the way different intellectual movements impacted people's lives. Rather, it was a survey course on European philosophers.",
                "If you are truly interested in philosophy, yes! Im a former DS kid who slacked my way through the philosophy courses out of a general lack of interest, and took this class as a sort of do over. I feel like I have a much better grasp of modern cannon philosophy now than I did before, and am glad I took the class, but wont pretend it wasnt hard at points to overcome my broader disinterest in philosophy. That said, I really did learn a lot. Professor Shore is an talented lecturer and, if you actually like the subject material, you will love this course.",
                "Definitely! I think theres something here for everyone. Im a senior taking this course in my last semester at Yale, and even though Ive been exposed to many of these thinkers before, this course really filled in many gaps in my knowledge and helped me see the bigger picture. Note that the course is very fast paced and we only scratch the surface of any given topic, so if you are looking for a deep dive philosophy course you will very much walk away feeling unsatisfied. It is exactly what the course title advertises: a history of intellectual currents in Europe after the Enlightenment.",
                "Yes, but mostly if you don't already have a strong base of knowledge in 19th/20th century European philosophy (e.g. took DS or something). By nature of it being a survey class everything's a bit surface level, but it's effectively taught and pretty interesting if you aren't super familiar with the material and are interested in having a background in philosophers/ideas that come up again and again in other courses.",
                "Yes, gives you good context for talking about philosophers.",
                "Yes! This is great information to have even a vague understanding of. Lectures were so interesting and well organized. Highly recommend!",
                "100%. Great introduction to 20th century European philosophy. Suitable (and manageable) for everyone, from philosophy and history majors to literature or STEM majors.",
                "Yes",
                "THE BEST COURSE IVE TAKEN AT YALE!!! Take it regardless of your major. Marci Shore is one of the most talented lecturers at Yale, and you will get so much more from the course if you attend her office hours.",
                "Yes! I think this is one of the history classes that make Yale unique.",
                "This is the best lecture course I have taken at Yale. I absolutely loved Professor Shore's lectures and would leave each class having learned so much. I never was a fan of philosophy, but the way the content was presented in this course got me to care about asking big questions for the first time ever and I really enjoyed how this class connected philosophy and history. The paper topics were lots of fun to write, and the reading was manageable so section discussions were always really interesting. All in all, I would rate this course 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone whether or not they are familiar with or already interested in the content. It is a great course, and you will learn a lot regardless.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who wants to wade into influential and approachable philosophical discourse.",
                "YES, a thousand times yes. Marci Shore will change your life and make you laugh and make you love and hate the world at the same time. Her lectures are gorgeous works of art. Her will make you live and love philosophy. I see Nietzsche, Hegel, Heidegger, and Sartre everywhere I look today.",
                "Yes, if you are keen on getting a broad historical view on philosophical ideas.",
                "Yes great organization for introducing western philosophy",
                "I would! Excellent intro course, and a great way to explore major ideas in European history.",
                "Yeah it was cool",
                "Yes! Really good class that will give you a lot to think about.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great introduction to the major themes of intellectual history. It also teaches you how to think and write.",
                "Absolutely. Fantastic class. Came into Yale as a STEM major. No longer am. Took a few classes like this and realized this is what Yale is for. Take this class and others like it.",
                "Yes. The Professor is great, the material is important, and the class is engaging.",
                "Yes fantastic, Marci is a phenomenal lecturer, so brilliant, charismatic, insightful and engaging, and its great if you like to think about lineages or learn in lineages",
                "Yes, if you are interested in leaving the class armed with a full knowledge of European philosophy. Professor Shore presents each theory with infectious enthusiasm  her explanations are clear and she manages to keep everyone engaged.",
                "Yes. Very good philosophical foundation."
