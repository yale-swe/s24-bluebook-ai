                "Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, more rigorous treatment of electricity and magnetism. Also improved my vector calculus and mathematical methods in the process. Learned unique style of problem-solving.",
                "This course covers statistical mechanics and E&M, and is split pretty evenly between the two - the midterm was entirely stat mech and the final was entirely E&M. I learned a lot of probability and stats methods and concepts that I hadn't really seen before in the stat mech part of the class, while the E&M section built more on material I had already learned and expanded the mathematical tools I had to deal with the concepts I was somewhat familiar with. It was nice to see how stat mech and thermo tied together, I would have liked more time to explore that but I understand the time constraints given everything we had to cover in the electromagnetism part of the class.",
                "Continuation of the thermodynamics from 401, statistical mechanics, electro- and magnetostatics.",
                "Much deeper knowledge of stat mech and electromagnetism. Increased understanding of vector calculus. Better ability to problem solve generally.",
                "I learned about E&M and statistical mechanics.",
                "This is the second course to classical physics, my personal favorite. We delved into subjects I never touched on in high school or the introductory courses, like thermo, and I loved how that transitioned smoothly into fermion\/boson studies. I also enjoyed how the EM section led us to EM waves that are photons so its a very cohesive course that teaches you how fundamental and connect physics is. Love it.",

                "I really like the class environment and problem sets. Prof. P is a huge asset to 402, and if he is teaching, I could not recommend the course more. \r\n\r\nThe strength of the course is that we see a wider range of physics than something like PHYS 430 which is more intensely focuses on E&M alone. This is great if you're a junior like me with limited time to take physics courses but still want to see a range of physics. Additionally, 402 is a great environment with a lot of available help to understand the material\/problem sets.\r\n\r\nThis course could perhaps be improved by including some more interesting applications\/examples of natural phenomena that demonstrate the E&M concepts we are learning about.",
                "The course thrives on Professor Padmanabhan's teaching; he does a great job facilitating learning, both in class and in office hours.",
                "Great problem sets, lectures are structured very well, a wealth of resources are posted like old lecture notes, live transcripts, videos, etc.",
                "Having taken 401 with Professor Padmanabhan I was already familiar with the course structure, and understood that office hours are key to completing (and for me, even understanding) the problem sets. I really enjoyed lectures, and found office hours and study halls to be very helpful and engaging, particularly when held in person. However I also appreciated having the smaller Zoom sessions available to drop in on the weeks I needed extra help (this was most weeks). While the psets were very complicated I would say they did a good job preparing us for the exams, both of which were take home and open book\/notes\/Canvas slides. The exams (particularly the final) were not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but having access to check my understanding of concepts during the exam removed a lot of the second guessing for me, which I appreciated. I will say that you should not rely on the open book\/note policy to actually help you SOLVE the problems, but more to check that your justifications for your work are valid.\r\n\r\nThe main improvement I would suggest for this course is to assign more TA's or more TA hours, because if there had been two or even three study halls a week I would have appreciated it.",
                "I think that it's a good overview of the topics, I especially liked the statmech section.",

                "Strengths: community of classmates\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be a bit dry",
                "Strengths are the modules, teaching, homeworks, All were great.",
                "The strengths are that the professor is very flexible and empathetic towards students and genuinely wanted everyone to succeed. The weakness is that the exams are very difficult, and electrodynamics lectures often felt rushed due to the vast amount of material covered in only half a semester."

                "I believe if you're a physics major, your hands are somewhat tied and you must either take 402 or 430. Therefore, I will address the rest of this review towards someone in a physics adjacent major or someone who is just curious about physics.\r\n\r\nIf Prof. P is teaching, I would recommend this course without any hesitation. You get to learn about statistical mechanics and E&M all in a one semester course. Talk about bang for your buck. This is not a survey course by any means, and you get a solid understanding of the main ideas of both subjects.",
                "I would! It is intensive but a great dive into the topics it covers; I feel a lot more well-versed in them now.",
                "Yes! The topics are interesting and combine to highlight physics in a beautiful way.",
                "I would recommend this course if you've never seen stats\/probability before but you have some basic grounding in E&M. For E&M, if you understand cross products, dot products and right hand rule already that is very helpful, and if not maybe review them before you take the class. Also remembering the basics of Coulomb's Law and how currents generate magnetic fields is good, although that is reviewed. Be aware that problem sets will be very labor intensive, and schedule time for office hours and study halls into your calendar accordingly. Also, reading the textbook is surprisingly helpful!",
                "It's required for physics, but I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get a closer look at some more advanced physics topics.",
