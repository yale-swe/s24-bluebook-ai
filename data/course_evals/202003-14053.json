It was also challenging to prepare for quizzes because the questions were often incredibly specific. It was hard to focus reading to prepare for the quizzes.",
                "Strengths: in person with lively discussion, assignments not overly difficult and were related to the material, case studies were very interesting, personal feedback with professor on all assignments\/discussions etc\r\nWeaknesses: doesn't count for a Yale credit (which ridiculous as it is more valuable AND more work than many Yale courses), 0730 meeting time not ideal, quiz content not always clear, canvas organization could be better.",
                "I thought CAPT Withrow did a great job and it was one of my favorite courses at Yale. I've given more detailed suggestions on his specific survey, but for the purposes of this general Yale survey I'd say anything he comes up with will be great. I would have loved to hear more about his own experience\/sea stories, but he is already considering ways to be able to integrate that more into the class given the limited time. A major strength is that Captain Withrow is very invested in engaging with students, giving extensive feedback, and being available in office hours; very few of my actual Yale courses have had anywhere near the depth or extent of personalized feedback that \r\n\r\nI invested a huge amount into this class: I did all the readings, optional readings, suggested readings, etc. (I even read\/watched the materials casually mentioned or referenced in class), and it is truly comparable to a general Yale course. We had a good amount of readings, pop quizzes, papers, and exams. I'd say it was a standard workload for a Yale course, and I've invested far more into it than some of my Yale classes that were structured differently or had less of a workload. I absolutely think it is worth a credit and should be recognized by the University. That being said, I personally really enjoyed learning just for the sake of learning without thinking about grades, GPA, etc; I'm not a midshipman, so it doesn't count for me at all. It's nice to know that I took this class because I genuinely wanted to and I worked hard at it because I genuinely wanted to learn. But still, I think the class itself deserves more recognition from the University. It was a fabulous opportunity, and I am grateful to have been permitted by the instructor and the program to take it and to have had enough university credits such that I had space in my schedule to be able to take it."

That being said, if this class ever counts for a credit, it is extremely valuable in gaining a better understanding of the military as well as learning ethics in a more interesting setting than the usual business environment.",

I'm not exactly anonymous since I was the only student not enrolled in NROTC, but I think this class would be a really engaging discussion of ethics, duty, and leadership that can be extrapolated to any profession and frankly to all aspects of life. I am a double major, and ethics is stressed in both my majors, and yet I still learned an incredible amount from this class; in other words, this is a great intro for someone with no academic background in ethics, but it is also fabulous for students with a very heavy academic background in ethics. The class discussions and the scenarios add a lot to the course, and CAPT Withrow has a huge amount of experience and insight."
