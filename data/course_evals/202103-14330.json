                "I had never taken a philosophy course before this, and I left feeling as though I had a general roadmap to ancient western philosophy. I also learned how to make philosophical arguments and articulate them both in class and on my papers.",
                "This was my first introduction to the discipline of philosophy, and I learned a lot. I come away with a much better sense of how to parse and break down philosophical claims and arguments. I learned a lot, in addition, about how to critique philosophers logic and compare the thoughts of multiple writers.",

                "DS Philosophy gave me an immersive introduction to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy (with some Near Eastern philosophers toward the end). I learned how to develop objections and write philosophy papers, and I feel I have more of a grounding from which to approach later philosophy.",
                "I learned a lot about Aristotle and Plato and was introduced to philosophical analysis.",
                "Ancient and medieval western philosophy, the second half of the course was very much about god. How to read philosophical texts and engage critically with their arguments, the practicalities of how to write a philosophy paper."

                "It's often difficult to translate convoluted texts into clear arguments, so getting more explicit step by step summaries of the arguments (like we did for some of them) would definitely have helped.",
                "All of the Greek and Roman content (Plato through the Skeptics) felt like a connected thread of philosophical debate. Everything after (Aquinas, Anselm etc.) felt like a mostly separate discussion that I wish had been demarcated more clearly.",
                "I think that the end of the syllabus was too crowded! We didnt have enough time to sit with any of the thinkers after Aristotle, so the class ended up feeling rushed and cursory. I vastly preferred the first half of the course, when we addressed shorter passages of text in greater depth.",
                "I thought that the course did a good job of providing a strong foundation of ancient and medieval philosophy that helped contextualize the other DS sections and provided lots of interesting questions to consider. The pacing felt a little rushed at times and sometimes it felt like the discussion only touched on a small portion of a very long reading, but otherwise I thought this was a very interesting introductory philosophy course.",
                "I had some of the most vibrant and stimulating discussions as part of this course. The philosophical works we studied were challenging (especially at a DS pace), and I appreciated that we went through the key arguments as a class. In particular I enjoyed the moments of spirited debate. The only weakness I can think of is that I found it difficult at times to understand the feedback on my writing and wished there were more direct instruction on how a good philosophy paper looks.",
                "The course moves quickly which is great for a survey but occasionally lacks for depth.",
                "The seminar discussions was definitely the highlight, especially because everyone was so engaged and challenging each other. It was also very special to attend brilliant lectures every week from different professors."

It's a bunch of wonderful(ly frustrating) existential puzzles and most people no matter what they're usually interested in would enjoy it. Also, and this was just a bonus for me - I found that the arguments that discussed different forms of God really opened my mind as an atheist to allow some space for the possibility of god-like figures/forces. It's so helpful to look at these things from a logical standpoint as opposed to entirely instinctive or cultural ones!",

                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was definitely a rewarding component of the first semester of DS and brought up many themes that will continue to inform my thinking for a long time.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. The readings were fascinating, the energy in the class was conducive to deep learning, and the writing assignments were intellectually rich.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to philosophy and writing in philosophy.",
