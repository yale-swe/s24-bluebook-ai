   "comments": [
    "I learned how to critically analyze art and connect works to pieces within their own time period as well as throughout time.",
    "Learned to appreciate the influence of Greek art and architecture in LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Now that I know this material, I can't unsee the influences of Greek art all around me...",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to ancient art. I came in knowing nothing about the period and by the end was very comfortable with the content.",
    "I knew nothing about HSAR coming into this course, and I absolutely loved it. I learned how to really analyze art beyond the \"wow this is so cool\" factor, and I learned how to write a HSAR paper.",
    "You learn the fundamentals of Greek art and architecture, and how it the rich visual tradition vastly transcends its ancient origins.",
    "HSAR 243 is the full run-down of Greek pottery, sculpture, painting, and architecture. I feel like I acquired enough knowledge to hold a conversation with anybody in the field, and I now know the classical underpinnings of Western art. Finally, my art historical writing has improved immensely thanks to the great feedback I received on the papers.",
    "This course is a thorough survey of Greek Art and Architecture, as the title suggests. The student is taught how to \"see\" Greek art from an academic perspective and to view these objects in the larger art historical narrative of the course.",
    "I developed a new knowledge in the area of Greek Art and Architecture.",
    "I learned a lot about looking at ancient art and recognizing symbols and patterns. We looked at a wide array of media and time periods and I learned how ubiquitous ancient themes are in later art.",
    "I learned how to analyze Greek structures and artworks as well as their cultural significance to issues contemporary to their time.",
    "Ive never taken an art history course before so I learnt a lot about sculpture, vase painting and architecture and to look at art in a different way."

   "comments": [
    "Greek art is awesome and one strength is the review powerpoints posted. can't be improved-- loved it!",
    "Strengths - loved the YUAG sessions, if anything wish we had more! Or wish we could explore the influences of Greek art \/ architecture on campus.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. Every aspect of it is maticulously planned and executed.",
    "I thought the lectures were fascinating- I never missed unless I absolutely had to. Can't think of any improvements!",
    "The readings are slightly unnecessary, as professor Gaifman will cover essentially everything in the lectures.",
    "I enjoyed coming to lecture every week and was glad that there was no section, considering Prof Gaifman asked questions in lecture. I loved that we looked at so many different views of each artwork; it felt as if I was actually seeing it in person.\r\n\r\nMy only issue with the course is the textbook. The Neer (especially the Neer) and Osborne readings were all solid, but I often felt as if I was just reading exactly what I would hear in lecture. It might be worthwhile to look into other readings that supplement the lectures, rather than repeat them. I would recommend a book (textbook or not) on the history of Ancient Greece -- as somebody without a background in classical studies, it would have been super helpful!",
    "The course is based on lecturers, along with unique opportunities to handle objects in the art gallery. the structure is coherent and well-organized.",
    "This course is great. The material is very interesting and each lecture has a new theme which builds off of the previous lecture.",
    "The course was well-taught and the expectations were clear. Sometimes the hour felt long or the lecture became repetitive, but it only helped to better my understanding of the material. There were not very many assignments and I would have liked to have a better idea of how I was doing throughout the course.",
    "This course was incredibly comprehensive and a strength of the course was certainly being able to go to the Yale University Art Gallery and doing some hands-on work.",
    "I absolutely loved the class, so for me there werent any weaknesses at all. It was always super engaging and the slides were well presented.",
    "Amazing comprehensive account of Greek art and architecture that kept the students engaged throughout the semester. Strengths were amazing material, amazing professor and amazing TF. All around amazing."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. the class is straightforward and engaging and interesting; i would recommend to anyone.",
    "Though I came into this class looking to just fulfill an \"ancient art\" course, I learned a lot more and had more fun with the subject material than I thought I would! What you learn in this class, you can really use and it will keep popping up in your life long after the semester ends.",
    "This is a fantastic lecture course that I would highly recommend to any student without reservation.",
    "Absolutely. It's great for beginners and veterans alike, and it is stimulating and engaging. The material is so interesting and you are never ever bored!",
    "I would recommend this course.  It is approachable and the lectures are engaging.",
    "This is a great course for those interested in the classics or western art history. It is relatively low-commitment and fairly interesting. Professor Gaifman brings so much love and enthusiasm to the course -- it was great to have a professor who was serious about scholarship and learning that also had a sense of humor.",
    "Would highly recommend this course to another student, even vaguely interesting in Greek art. It is catered more towards an introductory level than other more theory based art history courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in art history, especially ancient art. It is very enjoyable and the material is interesting.",
    "Yes, overall the class was rewarding and very active. Professor Gaifman is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject.",
    "Yes!! My first art class and loved it! Amazing teacher and material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student and all of Professor's Gaiman's classes",
    "yes! a great survey of greek art, especially for non-art history majors",
    "If youre interested in anything related to Greek civilization or one of the most important epochs of art history take this class!",
    "Absolutely! I'd recommend a class with Professor Gaifman to anyone, not just those doing art history or classics."
