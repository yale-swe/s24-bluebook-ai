                "This course emphasizes group work and communication. Definitely models a real lab scene. There are no weaknesses!",

                "It's a chill lab but the write ups take a long time. I appreciated having a rubric but it often was very ambiguous.",
                "Overall, I really liked the lab and thought it was a great biology course. We waited around in lab doing nothing for long periods at times awaiting instructions which could have been limited if the TAs were prepped to lead certain portions of the lab.",
                "This class was awesome! It was a lot of work, but Dr. Moreno took the time to make guides for both our notebooks and lab reports, which was a huge strength of the course. The labs were exciting and different every week, giving us a great plethora of lab organisms, skills, and procedures to learn each week. One weakness of the course is that Dr. Moreno had to jump back and forth between two sections on a given lab day, which meant that we would be sitting for large chunks of time with nothing to do before she came to our side to explain things; this resulted in us spending much more time in the lab on a given day than we would probably have to spend based on the protocol alone."

                "Yes! The professor cares about your learning and is extremely accessible! You will learn so many things even if you're a senior. Absolutely take this course!",
                "Honestly, only if you need a bio lab.  I am sure there are other more interesting labs for biology though! This is a good into course to learn techniques if you want to go into research, but it is a broad overview of such.",
                "If you are looking to improve bio lab skills and need a bio lab, this is a good course. Moreno is a fair and caring instructor, though the workload is heavy for 0.5 credits",
                "Hard to recommend in its current form just because it's a truly insane amount of work for 0.5 credits. 40+ hours in the lab, some quizzes you have to study for, 5 lab reports (~2000 words and several figures) that take 8 hours each if you're fast, and a lot of lab notebook work outside of class (>10 hours). I think the lab reports actually are worthwhile, so I don't think the class should change, but I do think this class should be turned into a full credit with a full writing credit.",
                "Yes, if you need a lab for pre-med, take this one. Prof Moreno is very supportive and helpful",
                "Definitely. This is a good course to take for any bio major, but specifically, an underclassman looking for a deep dive into different protocols,  model organisms, procedures, etc. The workload, which included lab quizzes, lab notebook entries, and lab reports, although a lot, was always organized and helped me grow as a scientist and a scientific writer."
