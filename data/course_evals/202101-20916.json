                "The strength was Mika Yamaguchi. She's a wonderful teacher and she's very engaging. The homework was not that difficult, but it furthered my understanding. I don't recall there being any weaknesses.",
                "I really like that the course is very organized. Everything was very easy to follow and it was helping for my learning. We also had a lot of opportunity to practice the grammars and vocabularies.",

You really do learn an amazing amount of Japanese. However, this class does require quite a bit of work. There's a good amount of homework every night and the learning pace of the class is pretty fast.",

The class is a commitment, there's a good amount of homework every night and the learning pace of the class is pretty fast.
