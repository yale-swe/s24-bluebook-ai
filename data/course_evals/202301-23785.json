                "Strengths: The ability for the professor to engage the students without having to make them feel fear. The ability to engage the TF into the conversation in a fruitful way, the energy of Professor Honeychurch, the structure and content of the readings, the ability to lead one class and feel like you accomplished something of worth, the engagement of the other students in the conversation, the Uyghurs festival\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that would not take away from the wonderful strengths above",

                "Yes Honeychurch is the best. Wild Professor but in a fantastic way",
                "Do you know anything about the archeology of ancient Eurasia? How about Mongolian culture of the past and present? Probably not, or at least, I didn't until taking this amazing course. I don't know why I signed up for it, but the reviews looked good. So I did, and I am so happy I did. This course is one of the best I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Honeychurch is a unique, highly-energetic, and passionate professor who will have you caring about the tiniest details of archeology drama. Don't be afraid of the archeology part of this class! I'm an English major. There were econ and pre-med and history majors in there, and we all did well. You will also have the unique experience of meeting NELC majors and grad students who know so much stuff about archeology it's scary. They can just read all these ancient scripts on the tablets we discuss, and it's very very impressive and fun. Take this class! But be warned! It is a decent amount of work, but for some reason, I found myself wanting to do it. Archeology papers and essays never seemed so tempting. Also be ready to laugh during the class. Professor Honeychurch isn't the most serious guy.",
                "YES- made learning about archaeology feel very approachable while also diving into the nuances of research and of the field",
                "I wish I could write more but to do so would only be an attempt at writing into words thoughts that have no written counterpart. I have learned to view my life and my time at Yale in a completely new way. The course taught me more about the beauty of learning than I ever thought possible. Seeing Prof. Honeychurch so enthusiastic and kind to everyone made me want him to teach all of my courses! It is a true joy to learn from a professor a subject he is truly passionate and excellent at teaching.",
                "Absolutely - Prof. Honeychurch is a wonderful and engaging teacher.",
                "To anthropology/archeology students, sure. Otherwise probably not. It had glowing reviews but it was not very approachable for those outside of the area of study."
