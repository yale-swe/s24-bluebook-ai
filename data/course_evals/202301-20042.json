                "I learned the mathematical computation behind 1D and 2D signals and how those can be applied to medical applications such as vascular function or image processing.",
                "Intro to biomedical signals and images",
                "How to analyze and think about biomedical systems and signals. Topics include: linear time invariant systems, the convolution operation, Fourier and Laplace transform, EMG signals, frequency domain, signal discretization, signal recognition and classification (machine learning), modeling blood flow through vessels, modeling the left ventricle of the heart, 2D signals and systems, images.\r\n\r\nYou learn to think about biological systems in a more computational and quantitative way.",
                "I gained a more deeper understanding of Laplace transforms and their use in modeling vasculature as electronic circuits. Moreover, I learned about concepts regarding machine learning and image processing which are useful overviews for more advanced classes.",
                "I learned about a variety of real world applications for signals and imaging. I learned to apply a lot of the knowledge Ive gained from previous courses into the content for this class."

            "comments": [
                "The notes are really hard to follow in class and to look back on. Very easy switch would be to do a continuous scroll when writing down notes in class rather than turning the page quickly. I never had enough time to write everything down and it was very hard to stay engaged in lecture. The class and PSETs were really hard. It is nice though to have a class with Prof Duncan and Staib to get closer to the DUS and have them so accessible",
                "strengths - grading seems to be relatively forgiving so you can focus on understanding the content, Prof. Duncan does a lot to try to make the course easier for students because the content is pretty difficult. Content-wise though, a considerable portion of it does overlap with things from physio or BENG 355L so you won't feel completely unprepared.\r\nweaknesses - lectures were REALLY unengaging and it was very difficult to maintain my attention.",
                "The course structure is paced well, and examples given in class give an excellent demonstration of both conceptual and practical applications of each topic. One aspect I hope to see improved is a more thorough walk-through of PSET solutions after their submission.",
                "Sometimes it was hard to understand their notes, but they are really nice and helpful",
                "Strengths: Taught by two professors who specialized in the topics that were discussed in class. Gave a varied approach to learning. The content was difficult, but help was always provided.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exam questions sometimes called for extremely different approaches than were discussed or provided earlier.",
                "While the lectures in the course were not the most engaging, the professors and TFs provided ample information and notes on the topics in class as well as opportunities to ask questions.",
                "Strengths: the TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, we always got quick feedback on homework assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not engaging, exams were very difficult, and there were no office hours held by the profs or TFs (except for once weekly section)",
                "Strengths: Great teaching, interesting material! This is definitely the more math-heavy side of the BME major but I thought it was so applicable given that all of the medical imaging and analysis that happens nowadays is based on computational operations like those we learn in this class. Prof. Staib and Prof. Duncan are both wonderful to talk to and clearly are very knowledgable about the field. Also, the TAs our year were wonderful and they had the best pset solutions that would walk you through a problem very clearly so you could learn from your mistakes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were too fast and it was difficult to follow during lecture. Also, sometimes lectures were not that engaging and contained a lot of material that was not tested on, making studying for exams difficult. There was also a slight disconnect between what is taught in class and the psets - more integration would help reinforce concepts rather than forcing the student to rely on the TAs to teach entirely new concepts or methods.",
                "The greatest strength of the class is the professors and TAs who are amazing at continuously answering questions, filling in the gaps of understanding. Another strength was the use of visual examples to better understand matrix convolution or other class concepts. A key way that the course could be improved is by having more real-world connections with how the material is used in industry or in current research literature."

                "I would recommend this course to people who want an introduction to signals and its relation to the medical field. It doesnt take a small amount of work to succeed, but it is worth it to understand the topic.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the knowledge gained in the course is applicable to many different areas of medicine and the course maintains a good balance between mathematical and science concepts.",
                "Definitely don't take it if you're not BME. If you think the material might be interesting, you're probably better off learning it in a different imaging\/signals class. Staib's half of the course was not engaging, contained way too much information on the powerpoints, and tested topics that we did not have enough practice with. Duncan's half of the course was more interesting and he was much more transparent about questions that would be covered on exams, but still pretty challenging. Overall, the course feels very disjointed because their styles of teaching and the material they covered were so different -- it almost felt like I was taking two classes at once. Also, don't be fooled by the exams being open note... they are some of the most challenging exams I've taken in the major.",
                "If you are BME major, you need to take this course.",
                "I would only recommend this if you are BME. There are a lot of concepts that are overlooked and having EENG 200 as a prerequisite is a great help as the math and concepts are similar."
