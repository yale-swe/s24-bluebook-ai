                "I learned so much about cinema in the Spanish-speaking world, as well as a lot about the process of producing an independent film. The course also helped with my Spanish speaking and writing skills; although there were no formal grammar lessons, the sheer amount of writing in the class allowed me to practice vocabulary and grammar concepts on a consistent basis. In that sense, the course was great training in using Spanish outside a formal classroom setting.",
                "I learned about the technical and artistic aspects of script-writing and movie production. Additionally, I gained a wide breadth of cultural knowledge about many Spanish-speaking countries and regions. It was a delight to speak to directors, and I was inspired to make my own film.",

                "Strengths:\r\nDynamic learning environment.\r\nFun and engaging class readings, viewings, and discussions.\r\nDirect contact to primary source material for course topics (meetings with directors and actors of films).\r\nLarge media library with access to course material and class recordings.\r\nExcellent and quick feedback on writing, speaking, and language.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nCluttered Canvas pages, sometimes difficult to find files or rubrics.\r\nAssignments created without written description made it confusing or unidentifiable.",
                "Strengths: I thought the guest visits were interested and engaging, and I really liked when discussion developed between peers \r\nThis is not necessarily a weakness, but I wish there would have been more peer-to-peer discussion. Also, I felt like there may have been one assignment too many.",
                "A strength of this course is that the films we watch are very interesting, making the course fun. A weakness of the course is that sometimes it felt like there was no purpose to the short films we would watch (especially in the first week or two of the class), making it very easy to become disengaged during live class.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the material is absolutely fascinating and the professor is great. Latin America has multiple thriving film industries that produce amazing movies that we are just never exposed to, and I wouldn't have even known where to start. But Professor Tortora is so knowledgeable about the subject and has picked a fantastic set of movies that are incredibly informative. If you like learning about other countries' films and culture, with a specific interest in Latin American art, you will love the class. Also, for the final project you can make a little movie which is awesome and fun.\r\n\r\nThe big weakness of the class are that there is a TON of assigned work (reading and movies). You are basically watching 2 movies a week for homework and writing little responses to both of them, along with a few essays a semester and other things. BUT you really don't have to do all the work, you can read a summaries of movies if you don't have time and be okay.",
                "The films we watch are really great and you learn a lot about Latin American culture. I cannot recommend Professor Tortora enough.  However, this course is very writing intensive as you have to write a review about each film we watch and there are three short essay assignments.",
                "The strength of this course was the syllabus and Professor Tortora's immense knowledge about film in Spanish. The online setting allowed us to meet so many of the filmmakers whose work we studied, and encountering new directors and actors at the Latino and Iberian Film Festival was particularly enjoyable. However, the weakness of this course also came from it being online. There was often no set agenda in class, and Professor Tortora rarely used slides or another kind of teaching aid, which I always find helpful as a student to follow along with the course material (especially in an online setting).",
                "Strengths: Professor Tortora was engaging. The format allowed for personal growth in language skills.  Small class size allowed for good discussion. Movies were interesting."

However, the pandemic made it more difficult for us to discuss the films as a class, and we weren't able to create the theater-like atmosphere that makes watching movies so enjoyable.",

                "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested in learning about Latin American culture, or generally interested in international film, you should 100% take it. I seriously had so much fun in this class, your homework will literally be to watch a modern Colombian film about being a teenager in Cali. The assignments can be a grind, but for your final project you can make a movie which is also awesome. Also, Professor Tortora is such a gem, she is so knowledgeable about the subject and knows so many of the people who are making these movies and doing this work. We talked to a ton of filmmakers and actors who had starred or created movies we'd watched like 2 days before. Just take it, I haven't seen an L5 class in Spanish that even seems close to as interesting, do not just take a class to fulfill the requirement, this class will make you happy the language requirement exists.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course if you have a passion for film and\/or Latin American culture. You get to meet and converse with really great filmmakers .",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The film and filmmaker conversations were incredibly interesting, and I learned a lot about the history of the Spanish-speaking world--and improved my Spanish skills themselves--through watching and analyzing the movies on the syllabus. I also think the trouble we sometimes had with discussions won't be a problem outside of the pandemic. I would just warn any potential student that the course can sometimes be a lot of work, with multiple movies to watch each weekend, film responses and three critical essays to write, and a final project at the end of the semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was fun, informative, and enriching.",
                "If the student is interested in LAST or refining Spanish skills, yes. This class will accomplish exactly that."
