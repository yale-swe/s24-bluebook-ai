    "Uta Hagen theory for acting",
    "Acting techniques, observation, knowing myself.",
    "I am not sure what the goal of the class was because it often seemed as though we were just learning to act in one specific way, not about any particular performance concepts. Most of the class had minimal experience with acting and were more interested in the technical side of theater and this class was not at all geared towards this side of theater."

    "I would recommend it to theater majors or those interested in acting. It's a really helpful class with acting and general knowledge of theater, it was a great time, and Toni is wonderful.",
    "No, but it is a required course."
