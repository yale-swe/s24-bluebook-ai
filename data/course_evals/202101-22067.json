There was a certain level of knowledge assumed (about the history of Buddhism, Judaism, Utilitarianism, etc.) that was not necessarily there. More context for each module would have been nice, even if it add more work.",

If you are looking for a class that will be the quintessential \"Yale\" class, this is it! It has many great components, history, philosophy, religious studies, etc, but ultimately it is up to the student to make the most of the course. If you're willing to \"buy-in,\" this class will be really worth your time!",

This class is not meant to provide an answer to what makes a life worth living, its meant to be a tool so that you may find your answer if you so choose.",
