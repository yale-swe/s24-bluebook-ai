    "Intermediate level Spanish with a focus on fluidity and more advanced grammatical structures than L1 & L2",
    "I developed skills in Spanish grammar and writing, verbal communication, and comprehension skills. I learned when to use proper tenses, how to use and conjugate those tenses accordingly, how to speak with more fluidity, and I increased my ability to understand and speak Spanish without having to always translate it in my head first.",
    "I learned more about how to speak Spanish and work in a group setting.",
    "I think this course helped me a lot to transition from an introductory language student learning the basics to a more advanced student, prepared to take on conversations and literature.",
    "Basic grammar.",
    "I developed a more fundamental knowledge of the Spanish language and culture, and became much more proficient in my speaking ability in various tenses.",

   "comments": [
    "Great course. As an L3 language class expect a lot of homework and to be studying for a good amount of time every night.",
    "This course is extremely intensive and moves very fast. This forces the student to learn and master concepts immediately (within 1-2 days of being introduced to the material). The strengths of this is that the student learns quicker and learns with a group of other students who are motivated. The group work is great and makes the class more fun. Moreover, the amiability of the professors makes the class much better. The weaknesses are that not all questions can get answered during class because of how fast the lesson is taught; it doesn't give students the opportunity to ask all the questions they have about the material during lecture, which makes the material harder to learn (on top of this course being already intensive). Also, there is not always a lot of time during office hours. This could be improved by possibly having more office hours or by welcoming questions during lecture.",
    "Both of the professors were understanding and patient; they seemed to care about their students' growth and wanted them to succeed.",
    "It is a very structured course but it can be disengaging when taken online.",
    "I think it is difficult to stay fully engaged for two hours. Although the break helps a lot, I still sometimes struggled to make it through the class especially towards the end of the week.",
    "Strengths: the course was organized well, and there was plenty of practice with the grammar that we learned.\r\nWeaknesses: there was often quite a bit of homework each night, and some of the homework on SuperSite felt repetitive.",
    "It s just the textbook nothing else. In order to be improved the course should incorporate more creative assignments and accurately represent Spanish speaking countries that dont only include Spain. We only really ever saw white people in any sort of images or films with one exception, it felt like a lot of Indigenous and AfroLatinx erasure.",
    "The main strengths were its oral components, as there were many opportunities to converse with fellow students and develop speaking skills. The course is easy to follow using the textbook and all expectations and requirements are clearly explained. One weakness of the course was that many handouts were not shared before class, and there was often difficulty in understanding what was expected of us with documents that were shared with us during class, right before entering a breakout room with another student.",
    "I liked the course but online it is hard"

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class with the caveat that L3 language class do take a lot of time and work. Additionally expect tougher material than L1 & L2. Build your class schedule in minds that this class will consume a lot of your time.",
    "Yes, I would, but I would warn them that it takes a large amount of time. The statement that this course takes approximately 15-20 hours per week is definitely false, for it takes considerably longer to learn. All of the homework, on top of learning all of the little details, exceptions, and irregularities, makes this course extremely time consuming. Nevertheless, a student will learn a lot in this course and will feel comfortable in this environment.",
    "Yes! It fills the requirement.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professors Cividanes and Reymundi were both excellent and it was clear that they wanted their students to succeed. Both were willing to help outside of class and make sure that everyone was comfortable with the fast-paced learning.",
    "Yes, it was an intensive but enjoyable course.",
    "No but its a requirement so you have to take it.",
    "I would! I think it is a great way to develop Spanish speaking ability and to learn a lot about the culture. The textbook is also a great resource to have for continued learning.",
    "Yes it is necessary"
