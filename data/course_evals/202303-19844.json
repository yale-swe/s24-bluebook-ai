                "The strengths of this class is the wide variety of themes that we covered. I felt like my Spanish improved so much because of all the different vocab we had to use for each unit. Also, the strong emphasis on grammar, even though it wasn't a explicit part of the class, was helpful in polishing my conversational Spanish. It felt like a lot of the assignments were just busy work and it did not really increase my performance in class.",
                "Strengths were the asynchronous day and the project/unit basis for the course, which divided it up into manageable chunks. Weaknesses were monotony in the class meetings, and that it was often difficult to participate in conversation if you're not one of the best speakers.",
                "The workload isn't too bad but I wasn't totally engaged. I think it was hard to have the expected conversations and there wasn't a lot of accountability. I think there could be more grammar in the beginning, and maybe vocabulary sheets corresponding with the units? I just didn't always feel that I had the baseline to just delve into things in the conversations. It would have been more interesting if there was a stronger foundation or at least a review of L2 grammar.",
                "I found the various project formats extremely helpful in both developing my Spanish and staying engaged with the content of the class. I also found asynchronous Wednesdays extremely helpful as a means of catching up on work in the middle of the week and completing my Spanish assignments in my own time. Sometimes the workload seemed a little excessive (especially nights including heavy reading)."
