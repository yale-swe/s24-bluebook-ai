                "Through this course, I truly learned so much about Spanish and language classes in general at Yale. Not only did I improve my writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills in Spanish, but I did so in a way that helped me engage with different cultural material (such as novels and films). The class discussions were wonderful at helping me to practice listening and speaking completely in Spanish.",

            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses of the course are that there are a lot of assignments that could sometimes overlap and be very overbearing. Strengths are that you do build conversationally in Spanish and are exposed to more Spanish materials like movies and short films.",
                "I think that this class was very strong in developing skills fast, but also the work was not spread out evenly at times and this made some weeks very overwhelming.",
                "There were many strengths to this course--the teacher was wonderful and cared about our education, the class material was engaging, and all my peers truly wanted to learn. The only weakness I can point out may be the inconsistency of the workload. There were times when we had three or more projects or assignments we were working on at once, and there were other times when we had only one or two pages to do. Making the workload more consistent could help me better prepare my schedule, since I would know what to expect.",
                "Strengths: work was relatively consistent and reinforced many concepts through different mediums needing growing lawyers of nuanced understanding. Weaknesses: sometimes the worksheet questions were vague\/unclear in what they were looking for and did not help me or my peers to sense how were were applying our language learning skills to them. It could be improved by asking more targeted, rewarding, or reflective questions.",
                "Professor Sanchez Walker was an excellent instructor. She taught the material well and was incredibly kind and understanding. The syllabus, however, was at times awkwardly paced and didn't make enough time to actually teach grammar units.",
                "good teaching",
                "The biggest strengths were the course materials being authentic and interesting and the teacher keeping the class engaged. The only weakness was that there was a lot of busy work and assignments due at the same time, but for the most part it was manageable."

                "I would recommend Noelia Sanchez Walker's section of the course because it was very educational and empowering, though I heard other sections were not nearly as well organized.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they really desire moving forward with the language, and do not have many other classes to take and work to do. This class requires a lot of focus, energy, and time.",
                "Yes, it is a good mix of literary analysis and grammar practice.",
                "I would recommend this course, it was the most I have learned in a spanish class in my life so far.",
                "Yes--100%! This course was extremely helpful and helped me facilitate my language learning, especially with Professor Sanchez Walker. It helped me expand my mind and explore many Spanish-speaking cultures, while simultaneously relating the material to my own life. Every assignment seemed to have a purpose; there was little to no busy work to do.",
                "Yes - this is a necessary intermediate course that really helps to solidify the fundamentals before diving into more nuanced texts later.",
                "Yes! Profesor Sanchez Walker is an excellent teacher, and I think I had a better SPAN 130 experience than students in other sections.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student especially for completion of their language requirement. Although you have a lot of assignments to complete, the grading is very fair and you learn a lot of Spanish in the span of one semester. In addition, the course material is fun to interact with and my teacher made the class run very smoothly."
