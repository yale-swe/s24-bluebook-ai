                "I learned how to write a play without worrying too much whether it was good or not. I learned how to be an effective dramaturg for my classmates and how to revise based on feedback.",
                "I learned a lot about the practice of writing a play itself. Instead of just talking about specific strategies, we actually did work and learned how it felt to find your creative voice in practice.",
                "Learned to write a full-length play. Practiced automatic writing and building a story based on characters rather than plot.",
                "I learned eleements of a play that are necessary and implemented them in my own play.  Also I wrote a play!  In a semester!  That's crazy and awesome.",
                "A whole lot of wisdom on dramatic storytelling and finding ones voice as a writer :)",
                "I learned to trust myself in my writing process. I think this class is great for students who constantly doubt their work and change ideas very frequently. This class taught me to just go with an idea and see where it takes me rather than me directing my writing. I think time with Deb is also a blast, she is such a bright and fun person that every class is worth going to.",
                "This course was absolutely foundational to the art of playwriting. Deb was a fantastic professor and provided helpful feedback and prompts to help everyone, regardless of prior skillset, write a play. We discussed character motivations, plot, and listening to your inner playwright."

            "comments": [
                "Deb has a non-prescriptive teaching style, so while she pushes you to ask important questions about yourself, your characters, and your writing, the class does not offer much in terms of structure, feedback, or guidelines. I personally could have used more organization, instruction, and specific feedback, though it was a fun, creatively stimulating, and welcoming class environment.",
                "The main strengths of this class are Professor Margolin and the high engagement level. I found the freedom of the class to be very helpful to my creative process, though I can see why some students might prefer more oversight (specific due dates, pre-scheduled workshop dates, etc).",
                "More checkpoints and pages required throughout the semester.",
                "Learning from your peers and from actual published, produced playwrights (Deb and Stef, the TF) is invaluable.  You really have to be on top of yourself or make an accountability partner out of some friends in class so you don't fall behind in your actual writing of the play.",
                "It was excellent. Deb is a wonderful professor, resource, and human being and her passion for the theatre and ability to teach the art by making us reflect on ourselves and our lives is unparalleled. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: You get to work with Deb, you learn to trust yourself, you get to hear some hillarious stories from Deb's carreer. I think a great strength is also that you get to hear your work being read out loud and decide what you need to change or if it's actually good. You get feedback on the spot as well and I found that really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the only weakness is that I never got some direction on tone, style, or any basic roadmap on how to write a play. I had never written a play and found it difficult to just start. I think some discussion on what tone is, what style you should be writting in would be helpful.",
                "Wonderful course with lots of feedback and time to workshop. Deb is a huge pro for the course, she is a truly kind and knowledgable guide through the playwriting process. The only downside was my own lack of time management skills. As there are only two deadlines in the course, it is easy to put off writing, which in turn makes writing more difficult. Maybe a few more deadlines would help others like me."

                "Absolutely. Best class Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Generally yes! Deb is wonderful and hilarious. It was a fun class, though I think it could have been more organized and probably would not have suffered if it met only once a week. You should go into it only if you are willing to be vulnerable with Deb and your classmates, as many of the questions asked in class can be very personal.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in playwriting. It really approaches the subject from a unique and personalized standpoint. Instead of learning the mechanics of putting together a play, you learn how to find the play within yourself and translate it onto paper.",
                "Yes! Deb is such a fantastic, giving mentor. She infuses her students with passion and whimsy.",
                "YES YES YES!!! This was one of my favorite classes of the semester.  You learn so much about playwriting from Deb and your TF (Stef in my case) and get the chance to develop your style in a supportive environment.  This class also built my confidence in my creative abilities.",
                "Absolutely! Its not so much for learning technical aspects of playwriting as it is for learning about the human elements of the art in a bigger picture sense - if thats what youre interested in please please take it!!",
                "Yes! Especially if you're not STEM and\/or don't think of yourself as creative. Deb has a really good way of bringing things out of you",
                "100% Deb is a great mentor and I think you can benefit from her feedback a lot. The class is also very chill and good for anyone who isn't comfortable with writing, I think this class forces you (in a good way) to get out of your comfort zone and just start writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a relief to take time a few times each week to write and read the weekly plays. I would say to set your own goals and deadlines for writing early in the semester so that it doesn't pile up later. Deb is a wonderful person, so any class with her is worth taking.",
                "Yes!!! As a first-time playwright, I now feel confident in my idea to create and share plays with others."
