Near the end of the semester, I really liked how Professor Shoemaker sent out emails to guide our thinking before discussion the next day. I definitely think they helped guide my reading a lot better, and as someone more of a silent thinker, it helped me contribute to the discussion more avidly. Paper grades were more than fair and rewarded you for improvement (choosing the higher grade if your paper fell in between two).",
                "One thing that is both a strength and weakness depending on how you look at it is the reading load. There was a lot of reading required for this course, far more than what most of us had previously had to do, which was pretty hard. A lot of the time I couldn't finish the reading in time for our class discussions or had to just skim 100 pages between classes."

                "Absolutely. It was definitely the highlight of my semester, and the course takes you to places you didn't think it would (if you told me a course about human limits would touch on trees, I wouldn't have believed you). In class discussions were a lot of fun and getting to meet everyone was incredible. Definitely would take it again, and would highly recommend to any first years looking for a good seminar (especially STEM-based)",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of whether you're stem or humanities oriented. Anyone can have great discussions and conversations and gain perspective by taking this class."
