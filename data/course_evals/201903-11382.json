    "I learned counterpoint, chordal analysis, and form\/analysis of minuets\/trios and theme\/variations.",
    "I learned more about music composition and the art of chordal analysis.",
    "I learned counterpoint and voice writing skills and then learned basic composition skills.",
    "more practice with roman numeral analysis. better understanding of musical phrases and voice leading. practice with composing",
    "Never did counterpoint and analyzed theme\/variations and minuets through form and harmonic analysis until I took this class.",
    "Techniques for analyzing and composing music in the style of Mozart and his contemporaries",
    "Analysis of harmony, composing basic minuet\/trio and theme and variations, counterpoint",
    "I learned different techniques on how to compose. I learned how to destruct pieces and analyze them to see what type of things we can determine.",
    "Species counterpoint, roman numeral analysis, phrase structure, minuet and trio analysis and composition",
    "We started by learning counterpoint, then progressed into baroque-era composition which was used to teach harmonic function and popular compositional methods such as circle of fifths sequences, dominant expansion, tonic expansion, and modulation to other keys to add some variety to your composition.",
    "I learned a lot about how to build up music from very simple starting points. I also learned how to analyze music with chords and understand the relationships between different chords and keys."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful course, strength is Adam's teaching and how the course will let you absorb knowledge without even realizing you're learning new things. No weaknesses that I can think of. Very helpful and thorough feedback on midterm\/final projects.",
    "Strengths: Very nice pace at which the material is taught. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More time needs to be given to the method of Roman numeral analysis. I feel like this section of the course was skipped\/ glossed over.",
    "It's a good class, not too much work, not always the most interesting but I definitely learned good skills.",
    "Strengths: good level of workload. good practice writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can get boring if you aren't very interested in music theory.",
    "Well-structured, all the homework was related to what was discussed in class and was graded pretty fairly. Entertaining and engaged professor that was pretty lax about deadlines so long as all the work was done with decent effort.",
    "Not too much work but enough to get the hang of the content, great explanations, interesting, relevant material, not much feedback from the instructor",
    "Some strengths are that it was interesting to apply stuff we learn on actual pieces and compositions. One weakness I would say is I wasnt quite sure about the structure of the class sometimes. But overall it was a great class",
    "If you have some small background in music theory, this course can be a great refresher and you'll likely pick up a few new things along the way. It is a very manageable credit, even if you haven't been playing too much music in your time at Yale.",
    "It was good! We covered interesting material in a generally engaging way."

    "I would highly, highly recommend this course to anyone interested in music! You might be worried about inadequate preparation if you haven't taken a ton of music theory before, but if you have experience in music performance or any exposure at all it is likely you will be well suited for this course. It was a fun course and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, this course is not a very high workload and it teaches you a lot about introductory composition.",
    "Yes, definitely. Nate is a great professor and I learned a lot. He gives good critiques and explains things very well.",
    "If you are interested in music theory and want to build skills composing, writing, and studying music, then yes.",
    "Definitely a good continuation if you've taken AP Music Theory in high school, should be a fairly easy class if you're analytical and have a solid understanding of harmonic analysis already. Workload is very manageable in any schedule.",
    "Yes. The instructor is very thorough and competent with the material and the method of learning, and it is one of the easiest experiences Ive had grasping difficult musical concepts of all varieties.",
    "Absolutely- if youre interested in music in any way it changes the way you understand and play music",
    "If you are interested in learning a little more about music, yes i would recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge of music theory and analysis. It is very well structured and taught in a way to facilitate learning.",
    "I took it a non-music major who played piano throughout high school and was looking to get back to it. A very doable credit if that's what you're looking for, especially with Nate Adam",
    "Yes! The class was a good intro to music theory and was generally fun."
