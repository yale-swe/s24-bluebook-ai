My speaking, writing, and reading all significantly improved, as well as my understanding of Latin American culture after the readings and final projects.",
                "You learn to be very proficient in Spanish in ALL basic types: speaking, listening, writing, reading. Definitely less of a focus on vocabulary, however, in the way that they teach it, you gain a lot along the way.",

                "I would have liked a little more variance in the structure of our class days - some days devoted to open discussion and conversation as well as some days devoted to intensive grammar\/writing work",
                "The diversity of the format of each class was refreshing and engaging. In addition, you could tell how much the professor cared for her students and wanted them to succeed. Her passion and energy made the class fun to attend. I also enjoyed the time duration of class--I thought this was a great amount of time--and how classes were asynchronous on Fridays. The course could have been improved by making what was expected for homework more clear.",
                "Very interactive and you learn a lot, but can be intense.",
                "I thought this class was good overall, but the grading in it I think is rather harsh. Homework being graded for accuracy the day after you learn a verb tense or grammar structure can be tough. Or if you grade it for accuracy take less off for each mistake because making the same mistake throughout can take off a lot of points from your final grade even though your understanding isn't that far off.",
                "Strengths: I really liked how we engaged with a lot of different media short films, poems, short stories. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish Profesora Alexandrov had expressed more clearly how important the cultural project would be to the course. I feel that my group mates and I did not realize how much time this project would take.",
                "Strengths: Always engaged, very little busy work, feel like you're getting better every day, definitely feel confident in Spanish by the end.\r\nWeaknesses: The homework is a little all over the place in terms of difficulty (Supersite is always a nice intro to topics but the Canvas HWs were pretty hard).",
                "I really did not like the way we were tested and forced to incorporate certain words into a paragraph\/sentence. I cant do that in English, let alone Spanish."
