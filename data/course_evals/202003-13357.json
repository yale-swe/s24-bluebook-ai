            "comments": [
                "There isn't an enormous incentive to watch lectures. Anything assignments or discussions require only a knowledge of the reading, as long as the reading has been done thoroughly, the lecture rarely adds any additional understanding that isn't provided through discussions in discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot and have great TFs to help you\r\nWeaknesses: Very easy to feel overwhelmed and confuse the different thinkers",
                "Strengths: really engaged teaching fellows who want to help you succeed; lectures provide clarification and summaries for sometimes difficult readings; readings are manageable; essay topics are genuinely interesting\r\nWeaknesses: the final's structure was really difficult (three essays of three pages in 72 hours with challenging prompts that require argumentation and reference to 2 or more thinks) and required significantly more time than I think imagined by the teaching team",
                "Strengths-\r\nGreat professor, engaging lectures\r\nWeakness-\r\nDifficult long readings, heavy workload",
                "Strengths: discussed a variety of philosophers in politics\r\nWeaknesses: Each philosopher only receives a week of attention (which amounts to exactly two lectures) which is nowhere near enough to comprehend the nuances of their arguments; often times it was up to the students to understand what the philosophers were talking about. Lecture didn't clear anything up because the professor provided extremely biased reviews of the philosophers, and endorsed those she liked while being extremely pushy of those she disagreed with. This led to pretty much of a \"what i think political philosophy should be\" rather than \"political philosophy.\" Also, like half of the lessons were self-promos of the professor's book or books she planned to write. The course began with promising students to come up with their own response to the question of \"who should rule,\" and then proceeded to answer that question in the first lesson for the students.",
                "Strengths: Engaging, important texts. Spectacular professor. The course structure\/flow is fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: I wanted more reading...which will make the course harder. However, the difficulty of the course grades-wise stemmed from rather ambiguous essay grading. I had little idea how to write a successful paper. There should have been far more effort to showcase how an \"A\" paper is written. We all know how to write essays, however, writing a political philosophy paper is different. I felt a bit like I was winging it since we receive no feedback on discussion posts. The drafts were helpful but usually the prompts were released slightly late so the drafts were not great (speaking for a number of students).",
                "The lectures, sections, and amount of work was good.  I think the biggest weakness in this course is its lack of diversity in the authors we read - we only read one female author.  I don't think people understand how hard it is being female and reading all these books talking about how females don't possess full rationality or virtue and are therefore subordinate.  I can't even imagine how it must feel being black and reading so many justifications for slavery.  I wish we read more female and minority voices.  We read a few, but wish there were more.",
                "One strength of the course was the breadth that it covered: we really went through 2000+ years of philosophy. A weakness might be that, while the essays assessed our ability to make internal arguments, we did not extensively talk about this in lecture-- it was just sort of \"expected.\" It would have been helpful if there had been more emphasis on different kinds of philosophical arguments during lecture.",
                "it's A LOT of reading. If you're a first-year, I don't know if this is the best class for you to take, especially if you're going to be balancing other classes, extracurriculars, and social activities. One or two philosophers a week is A LOT. The only reason I got through it was that the TF explained important concepts more in-depth during the section",
                "Strengths: covers a broad range of different philosophies and political systems, does a good job of summarizing general themes\/ideas with each author (especially during the lectures), writing intensive section was a great help for improving writing skills; Weaknesses: when discussing complex ideas presented by some authors the live lectures often did not provide a very good explanation and I would often have to wait until discussion section to understand major ideas, the lectures focused A LOT on historical\/personal background of certain philosophers despite encouraging students not to focus on contextual information in papers - mixed signals",
                "Our reading material was engaging. But I believe the lectures could include more discussions and interactions with students. Especially for the writing intensive version, the course should provide more example papers to guide students as the reading material does not necessarily set a good example for how students are expected to write.",
                "Great course overall. One thing that could be improved is the TA system. I think there should be more standardization with grading and expectations for work among the Teaching fellows.",
                "The course provided a strong foundation for learning about classic texts in this subject area. The TAs for the course were also all very dedicated and helpful. However, it would have been nice to explore more of a diverse range of texts. To be frank, most of the authors were old white men, and it would have been nice to look at works from women and minority groups.",
                "The larger lectures were a bit harder to participate in, but the best part of the course was the weekly discussion section with the teaching fellows. They were very engaging and intellectually stimulating.",
                "The strength of this class is the sections and their interactive character. The importance put on writing and developing arguments is a key strength of the class which transcends the immediate content and proves very useful in a wider context.",
                "I felt as through there was too much reading to manage in this course. It was not possible to complete all the readings we were asked to do.",
                "It was a good overview, however I think some of the big questions we were trying to answer were too simplistic. I think that instead of applying the question of who should rule to multiple different authors, we could have focused more precisely on certain ideas in each work.",
                "Its material is interesting and the work requires critical thinking. It could be more diverse in lecture style.",
                "Strengths: Professor Landemore's lectures were very clear, and TF's were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes breakout room activities took too much time. I wish there had been more lecturing during lecture times.",
                "Sometimes, the course felt like it was moving too fast as we would focus on one thinker during one week and then move on. I believe this course could be improved by better connecting all the thinkers in a sort of line of thought rather than just grouping them based on chronology\/topics. Overall though, lectures and sections were very helpful in clarifying the very dense readings\/topics.",
                "Strengths: everything really\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only one concern; I came away from the final session getting the impression that a lot of fellow students (ones not in my section) had taken from the course the notion that democracy is worse than some form of aristocratic government. I don't believe this was the intent of the course, but I do find it worrying given that many of these students will find themselves in positions of influence in the future. Perhaps a greater emphasis on the final few texts, specifically in comparing them to the earlier texts and highlighting the advancements made in sociological analysis, might allow these students to develop greater understanding. Perhaps not though!",
                "For me, the most significant strength of this course was the quality of teaching delivered by the Professor and my Teaching Fellow. They were very kind and approachable and transmitted concepts with clarity. Another strength of this course is the Discussion Section format that accompanies it, which has been the platform where I have had some of the most insightful discussions and debates during my time at Yale so far.\r\n\r\nWhereas I on one hand consider the number of texts we explored in the class to be a strength, each one left me with a sense that I had not fully explored and that there was much to learn about it still. I understand however, that we could well have spent more than a semester discussing the implications of even one single text on the syllabus.\r\n\r\nThis course was very thought-provoking, and I loved it for that.",
                "Strengths: Provides an introduction to some foundational political philosophers and their way of thinking; Instructor used these philosophies to consider their potential implications on modern society\r\nWeakness: Too many reading assignments were assigned over such a short period of time that students are not given ample time nor opportunity to fully comprehend the material. Instead, students are left with a basic, baseline understanding of each reading. Additionally, I found most of the lectures in the first half of the semester to be unhelpful and mediocre at best. The professor would merely paste quotes from the readings on to the slides, read them aloud, but failed to provide further context or analysis.",
                "The course is interesting, but there is a little too much reading. It felt like we were just reading to read sometimes because we would sometimes read parts of a piece of philosophy, then not really talk much about that part in section or lecture. This class could be improved by incorporating more diverse thinkers, as we mainly read (and spent the most time on) the political philosophy of white men.",
                "In my view the course was just about structured optimally. We covered a huge range of material with just enough time to dive into each one, which was really fun.",
                "I think this course had a great initial start, with a lot of the readings having clear progressions week by week, but towards the end it sometimes felt like a jumbled mix of authors with no cohesive weekly plan. Further, the lectures were not the most engaging given the virtual format. Given this downside, the live discussion sections were my favorite part of the course; I found them very helpful in clarifying and discussing the readings.",
                "The lectures were alright but not especially engaging. Sometimes they felt more like summaries of the reading than anything else. But, overall, I really enjoyed the class and felt that it was a great intro course.",
                "The strengths of the course were lectures and seminars, as they were always clear and thorough. I think where it can be improved is that some of the readings did not relate to the content of lectures, while some parts of lectures did not relate to the content of the reading.",
                "I did not like the grading structure. A considerable amount is based on participation",
                "I liked much of the content; however, some lectures were very shallow. Much of the meaning of the authors can be ascertained in the reading, and yet often lectures just reiterate the reading. It makes the course seem shallower than it is because the deeper implications of the work is only touched on in discussion section.",
                "The lectures do a great job of simplifying the texts we read. However, engagement in the course is very weak. It could be improved by making the course seem much more inclusive.",
                "This course allowed me to dive deeply into the works of several famous thinkers. I felt that the lectures could be improved slightly-- sometimes it was difficult to follow Professor Landemore, as she would often use terms without defining them. It was also hard to keep separate her opinions of the thinkers from what scholarship\/more objective sources have said. Finally, a very small thing, but her slides often had tons of text. It would have been helpful if she put less on each slide and explained each thing more comprehensively. I also think the course could be improved by perhaps reading excerpts, rather than the full works for several thinkers (for instance Locke and Rousseau). This would allow us to discuss each thinker in a bit more depth, and possibly include more thinkers that felt absence from the course. (For instance, it was hard to understand the comparison between Marx and Hegel having read absolutely no Hegel, and hearing only a 5 minute summary in lecture.) Finally, I think it would have been helpful to trace a few more themes over the course of the semester. Professor Landemore shaped the whole course around the question \"who should rule,\" but many of the thinkers were less interested in who should rule, and more interested in questions about how people should rule, or what principles defined government and justice, how society was formed, or how society would shift. It might have been useful to separate the course into 3-5 units, examining different guiding questions, rather than forcing all of the thinkers into a lens of analysis that didn't always directly apply."

                "I felt very disconnected from my classmates as a whole and thought that work sessions or informal discussion\/reading sessions could have helped.",
                "This course was overall really well-balanced for this unique semester. I enjoyed having live interactions in section and in lecture once a week, often aided by breakout rooms, and I also enjoyed the flexibility provided by a weekly recorded lecture. My one criticism is the final's format. It was incredibly long and monopolized a significant amount of my finals period, partially because expectations were unclear.",
                "As good as it could be",
                "The professor posted all of the recorded lectures on Canvas.",
                "Excellent.",
                "I think everything was pretty successful.",
                "Everything was very well-adapted, but it would have been great if all the text had been provided on Canvas-- not only would that have saved money, but it would have also ensured that everyone in section actually had the same copy.",
                "Discussion sections fostered discussion and engagement. I wish main lectures could also do the same.",
                "I think the class was organized in the best possible way given the circumstances.",
                "I liked that the TA for my section had readily available office hours for students every week. Moreover, it was very helpful when texts were posted to canvas as PDFs online.",
                "The most successful part was the weekly discussion sections. I believe there could be ways to get students to engage more in the larger lectures.",
                "Break out rooms worked very well on zoom whereas recorded lectures was a bit alienating.",
                "The course was pretty well run virtually. I think students could have been placed into breakout rooms more often to keep students more engaged.",
                "The discussion sections were productive but discussions are less fluid on zoom than in person. The lectures were well taught but not very engaging.",
                "they all succeeded, no complaints",
                "In comparison with the other classes I have taken this past semester, I feel as though PLSC 114 was the best adapted, or at least functioned the best, in virtual conditions.",
                "Lectures were recorded so that students could revisit them or view them at time more convenient for their schedule. However, student discussion and collaboration was very limited.",
                "Including discussions in the live lectures was helpful and interesting. It would have been nice to have all synchronous lectures, but I understand why that was not the case.",
                "The use of breakout rooms in class on occasion did not really add to anything, but the use of breakout rooms in section was very helpful. Overall, the class worked well online.",
                "I think having both weekly lectures be live would have been preferable to having one live and one pre-recorded. I also think with higher student participation, lectures could have been more engaging.",
                "The combination of learning methods including a live-virtual lecture on Tuesdays and a recorded lecture on Thursdays really increased my engagement in this course. I felt better prepared for the lectures with this format.",
                "The lectures were very engaging which helped with the zoom format",
                "I liked the combination of in person lectures and some recorded lectures, but I think the recorded lectures were often better because they were shorter, but carry the same amount of content because they are naturally broken up into several parts. Live lectures which are not broken up can difficult to focus on after hours on Zoom. I like watching several, smaller lectures a week instead of one or two very long lectures.",
                "Small sections helped me engage better with the content, TF was helpful in guiding discussion that allowed me to go beyond lecture material.",
                "The sections succeeded. I think the lectures were a little damaged-- it was difficult (impossible) to ask any questions in lecture and often it was hard to remain fully focused in lecture. It also would have been helpful to have more extensive office hours. This is the kind of class where coming to office hours just to hear what others have to say is interesting. Having individual sign ups for office hours sort of prevented group discussion outside of class. The exam was a nightmare-- on the second to last day of class, Professor Landemore annouced that rather than being a 3 hour exam on Wednesday, December16th, the exam would in fact be a three day affair three days earlier than planned. This made my finals period nearly impossible. The exam took around 30 hours to complete, as it involved writing three separate essays with textual evidence. I understand why the teaching team felt a take home exam would be more fair during COVID, but they really should have let us know much sooner that the exam format had changed so that we could plan ahead, and should have made the exam shorter."

                "Yes, even if you end up hating political philosophy, you will be glad to have taken the course. It will give you great tools to analyze the world and the arguments of others.",
                "Absolutely take this course! I fell in love with political philosophy after taking it-- something that was completely unexpected as a Chemistry major. The political philosophers provide such a wide range of interesting thought, and a great deal of the class is devoted to the question of \"who should rule?\"-- a question that I think is important for all members of a democracy to be asking themselves. I found the content of this class sparking conversations in my free time, especially about the social contractarians like Hobbes and Locke. What you put into this class is what you get out of it though, and the writers' arguments are incredibly nuanced and interesting as long as they are given proper attention.",
                "Maybe, only as requirement. Workload is heavy and and the intellectual challenge is heavy for an intro class. But the challenge can be rewarding.",
                "If its part of your major requirements, perhaps. Other than that, this course feels like a speedrun of political philosophers in attempt to promote the lecture's own views rather than allowing students to come up with their own understanding of the approach to the questions of government.",
                "Yes. It's fascinating. I don't think a course made me more thoughtful like this one did.",
                "Yes. An interesting course.",
                "Yes if you are interested in political philosophy, thinking about who should rule, or need for major.  I honestly think this class would benefit basically all Yale students.",
                "Yes, I definitely would if you want to get an understanding of the most important works in the Western canon.",
                "Sure. If you're interested in political science or governmental affairs, this course provided a necessary and all-encompassing preview of political philosophy from the Ancient Greeks to modern day. For those who haven't taken a philosophy course before, like myself, it helps broaden my perspective on many of the governmental norms that our society holds, such as democracy and capitalism. Along the way, I learned the benefits and downfalls of all kinds of different governing systems, which is relevant in modern society as we try to move towards a more equitable and just place.",
                "Yes, I would. Anyone who wants to read, analyze and discuss complex political philosophy texts and write about them should take this course.",
                "Only if they are really interested in political philosophy. If they are not super interested, this course might be a little bit too intense.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to another student. If you find the material interesting, it is manageable. Be aware that the writing intensive version of the class can be very difficult if taken at the same time as other writing heavy courses.",
                "Yes, especially if the student has an interest in political science or philosophy.",
                "I would highly recommend PLSC 114 to any student interested in political exploration and philosophy.",
                "I would recommend this course. Not only can you learn about the foundation of our political system, but you become a better thinker and writer after just one semester.",
                "Yes.",
                "If you're interested in learning about ancient philosophers then I would recommend this course. However, if you aren't interested in this field I wouldn't take the course as it is a heavy workload.",
                "Yes",
                "If you are actually very interested in political philosophy, then you probably know a lot of the content of this course already. If you think you might be interested in political philosophy (as I did), then you may enjoy this course, but you will probably find it mundane (as I did). There are probably more interesting first year seminars covering the same assortment of authors.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in political theory, but not the writing intensive section.",
                "Yes. The reading load is very high, but you will end the course with crucial background and knowledge of political theory that can be applicable to today's issues regarding politics and government.",
                "Yes, it's a pre-requisite for EP&E and it gives you a good overview of western political philosophy. It was for the most part very engaging, especially towards the end of the semester when we read Hannah Arendt.",
                "I would if they were looking for a foundation on political philosophy or looking to pursue something political science-related in the future. Regardless of one's intended major, I think this class is definitely valuable in helping analyze political regimes today and understanding how government\/regimes form.",
                "Absolutely. I believe everyone should possess an understanding of politics and this course enables one to identify the core ideas in poltical thought that influence their lives every day.",
                "I most definitely would recommend this course to any student at Yale, and not necessarily only to those wishing to pursue studies in a field related to politics. This class taught me to reflect critically on why our political systems are as they are, and what the moral arguments justifying their existence are. For example, it provided me with the opportunity to really think about democracy, and question whether more autocratic forms of government, such as that suggested by Plato, would not be better.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students if they would consider the material to be related to their [prospective] major because the most it does is provide you with a baseline foundation for political theory.",
                "Yes, however, there is a lot of reading, especially because philosophy readings are very dense. Other than that, it is a pretty good, interesting class.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in political philosophy or just generally how governments are structured and how people understand and justify them.",
                "I came into this course with little to no background in philosophy, so I found many of the readings and authors interesting. If you are hoping to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of philosophy in general, this is a good initial course, but it won't be the most transformational course you take at Yale by any means.",
                "Yes. I think the course gives exactly what I expected and was quite engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who knows that they want to learn who should rule, reviews the readings on the syllabus, and is willing to put in the work to decipher complex readings.",
                "This course allowed me to quickly understand the expectations of a Yale College student in class discussions, writing, and larger lectures. Professor Landemore and the teaching fellows wonderfully covered a canon of pinnacle political philosophers, and often argued a perspective that expanded upon mainstream interpretations (which I rather enjoyed). I would definitely recommend this course to a colleague.",
                "It is a really interesting course, but there is a LOT of reading.",
                "Yes- but the course grading needs to be understood. There are only two papers, so it is VERY important that a student enjoys the content because they need to be ready to invest a lot of time into making each paper as good as possible. If you don't genuinely enjoy the content, the amount of reading and work required for the papers will be draining.",
                "Yes, pretty interesting and not too challenging.",
                "Yes. I loved the professors interpretation and explanation of many different ideas on each of the texts.",
                "If you are interested in political science, political philosophy, or just philosophy in general, I highly recommend this course. The course introduces you to some of the most important philosophers in history. It provides a good basis to build your knowledge off of.",
