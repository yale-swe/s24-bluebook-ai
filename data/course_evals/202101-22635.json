                "Through taking this course, I was introduced to various political science theories about decision-making on the Supreme Court, familiarized with legal terms and how the Supreme Court functions, and acquainted with many landmark Court decisions and notable justices. More than anything, this course taught me to think critically about the proceedings and decisions of our highest court as well as the role it plays and was originally intended to play in our political system\/policy-making landscape. The course raised many questions about the role the Court is playing in our democracy and provided readings that supported theories with empirical evidence, but the class also well as many normative questions about the role the Court should be playing, challenging me to think critically about our political and democratic systems.",
                "An in-depth understanding of the Supreme Court and the social\/political landscape surrounding the Supreme Court and courts more generally.",
                "The class centers around the politicization of the Supreme Court, providing various models that could affect decision-making including public opinion, personal ideology, and the appointment process. Beyond providing theories of Court action, Professor Rader helps students understand statistical models used to analyze Supreme Court behaviors. Journalistic takes of the Supreme Court were discussed at the end of the course as well. The class helped me understand the often underwhelming legal logic that seems to guide justices' decisions, providing a new perspective on what the role of the Supreme Court should be in the United States.",
                "I learned more about the American Court system, the Supreme Court, and its political influences. I learned how to write a case brief, did a political science research paper, and read a lot of interesting political science research."

                "Strengths: The readings were interesting, relevant, and never too burdensome, and the assignments all felt practical and meant to aid learning. Professor Rader also clearly cares about her students, and the understanding environment she fostered allowed for a really meaningful seminar experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since the seminar was largely discussion based, and since there were only around 11 of us in the class, sometimes conversations were slow when students did not participate. That is more a reflection of the format of the class (over zoom) and the particular group of students enrolled in the course than it is on the course itself!",
                "Strengths: the class surveys a wide range of potential reasons for judicial behavior, incorporating the writings of some prominent judicial scholars like Segal and Spaeth. The course puts the texts in conversation with one another well and does not suggest one clear solution. Professor Rader is also great at elucidating complex models.\r\nWeaknesses: the weeks that ask how Congress, the executive, and the public may control the Court can become a bit repetitive. I would have preferred to focus more on specific landmark cases, rather than these cases being used as passing evidence for one model.",
                "Amazing course. Great readings, even better professor. Class discussions were great, Professor Rader is great during office hours, course was really well designed. Assignments were helpful for learning and were graded fairly. Wish we got a little more feedback on each assignment, but otherwise was a perfect course."

                "100% yes! If you are interested in politics, jurisprudence, theories of government, or anything in between, this course is for you. It had a sampling of ideas for everyone, was structured to promote learning without extraneous assignments, and was just so interesting in this political moment. If you get the chance to take this course with Prof. Rader, I highly recommend you do it. She is highly knowledgeable (she somehow knows everything about everything having to do with the Court and politics -- it is highly impressive), and a wonderful professor overall.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes, this course will challenge your perception of the Supreme Court. Before taking this course, I had a bit of a naive take on the Supreme Court, viewing it as a defender of rights and a champion of legal principles. However, after discussion, my thoughts have changed significantly and I have grown to see the absence of legal reasoning in particular legal decisions. The role of non-elected individuals in a democracy is important to explore and this course is a great venue to do so.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you're at all interested in the Court system and the Supreme Court, or American Politics in general, this is a must take class."
