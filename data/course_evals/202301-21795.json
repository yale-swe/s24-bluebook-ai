                "This is the BEST class I ever took at Yale. You will learn new ways to think about writing, how to revise and revise again, about publishing, storytelling, and how to reconnect with your inner child. It has really made me want to continue writing beyond college.",
                "I learned a lot about writing, motivation, and what the publishing process looks like. I'm not new to writing, but I'm new to YA, and I enjoyed learning about an entirely different genre and increasing my range.",
                "How to build a good story in a longer form project. How to give constructive criticism",
                "I learned how to outline a story, to draw inspiration in strange places, how to plow forward when writing, and how to solicit effective feedback on my writing. I also learned the basics of you publish a novel..",
                "I learned how to be a real writer in this course. Professor Halpern took us through all the stages of young adult creative writing, from idea conception through revision of several chapters of work. Upon completion of this course, I feel ready and excited to complete my novel and hopefully get it published. This class is a must for anyone looking to pursue creative writing in the future.",
                "You develop the basic skills you need to write your first fiction (YA) novel, which is great!",
                "With limited previous experience in creative writing, this course introduced me into the world of writing fiction and provided me numerous tools to approach this big task. I learned how to brainstorm, organize my writing, create characters, describe settings, establish a voice in my writing, create authentic dialogue and how to edit and comment on others' work. It was truly a great learning experience which allowed me to develop an interest in creative writing which I am really excited to continue exploring.",

                "Strengths: fun, small writing \"houses\", amazing feedback from Jake and classmates, creative space, get to write YA in a class, just everything really. \r\nWeaknesses: none. honestly, there are none.",
                "I think this course is amazing. Each class was so engaging that time flew by, and we had a great class dynamic. I also really appreciated that the class revolved around a long-term project that I was able to work on all semester and to constantly apply all the new things I learned to, instead of having a big final project that I would've inevitably ended up writing at the last minute and not learning as much from. If I were to suggest any changes, I would maybe suggest that everyone should sign up for all of their workshop days early in the semester so that there isn't any confusion later on in the semester.",
                "Strengths: Jake! He is such a dedicated professor. The workshops and feedback were incredibly constructive. The class fosters a wonderful community. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Choosing a premise so early in the class for your book can feel very rushed and then limiting later on. The lectures weren't that helpful (I was comparing the lectures to Mark Oppenheimer's Daily Themes and there was a lot of repetition from that but I think if you hadn't taken a writing course before it would be new material).",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "The strengths were innumerable. Professor Halpern is not only super encouraging, but he genuinely engaged with students' work and provided great feedback. The cohort of students, while variable, is also wonderful. The care and focus that people put into workshopping each other's pieces is great. I cannot think of anyway this class could be improved, except for maybe encouraging people to begin thinking about their story ideas before the start of the semester so that they can hit the ground running.",
                "It's such a great class, and I really enjoyed it! I honestly wish we just had some more time (like class twice a week)",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, incredibly engaged classmates, interesting and thought-provoking lectures, great supplementary readings, fun and challenging assignments, good class organization, house groups (groups of 3 students where you meet every week and workshop/discuss your stories)\r\n\r\nI really don't think this class had any weaknesses!",
                "jake is a fun prof who gives a lot of good transparent information about publishing and the actual processes. really priceless information if you are interested in getting your own work published. and he also was very good feedback on your chapters. great brainstormer. \r\nrest of the strengths really are dependent on your class."

                "Absolutely!!! Take this class! It is a wonderful opportunity to write YA. Every class was amazing, the readings were great, the class was very supportive and gave great feedback. It is a great opportunity to write fiction and get started on that book you've thought about writing or maybe you have never thought about writing a book, but now you can! This is the best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in creative writing in any form, or even just someone who thinks they might be interested and would like to try it out. It was a great experience, not only in learning about writing and practicing it, but also in receiving clear and useful feedback from my peers and giving the same to them in return.",
                "YES! If you can get in then you HAVE TO take It! It is a bit of a higher workload than I was expecting because I wanted to give good/respectful feedback to my classmates and critiquing 3 pieces a week can be a lot in addition to working on a bigger project consistently.",
                "Absolutely. It's a tough class to get into, but I think it's such a wonderful experience because it's so small. Even so, Halpern is a great teacher and you couldn't ask for a better one. He teaches things you'd never learn anywhere else.",
                "This course was one of my favorite courses I've taken during my time at Yale. I didn't even feel like I was taking a class -- I would've signed up to do this as a club.",
                "Definitely! It is such a fun, inspiring class!",
                "Take this class! It's truly the best class I have taken at Yale so far and every student interested in creative writing and/or Young Adult literature/writing should try to take this class. It's one of those classes you never want to miss and where 2 hours flew by in the blink of an eye. Even if you have not experience in creative writing but a deep interest in YA literature, you should take this class and learn how to become a writer and important tools to embark on you journey of writing. Professor Halpern is an amazing professor so I really recommend that you take this class!",
                "this course doesn't focus on teaching you from the ground up the building blocks of story, character, etc. so if you've never done fiction before and are nervous about it/want that foundation, I'd recommend Reading Fiction for Craft/engl404 which I had taken and gives a good base in that. if you're fine without those building blocks laid out and explored in the class, i'd highly recommend this class. it was very fun, I liked the class structure, and my class has all exchanged information to maintain a little writers group for feedback on our continued work after the semester's ended. i feel like publishing a book isn't a far off goal, but something achievable. and that's something really neat."
