                "The course as taught by Caleb has a large historiographical emphasis, often questioning sources and asking how works might be read as historiographical interventions. We started the semester with Foucault and unsettled a lot of his assumptions as the term progressed. The course covered sex's relation to the state, slavery, and violence, among other topics - the syllabus is quite accurate. In terms of writing, good practice with close reading and analysis of a primary source, and academic book review.",

                "strengths were the readings and content was very interesting. the professor was amazing and understanding. it could have been improved perhaps by having a clearer finish as to why histories of sexuality is an important study in our modern day.",
                "This course was well organized and taught. Occasionally the seminars felt a bit long, but overall the course was well designed for thoughtful discussion and learning.",

Maybe not as a WR credit if you're looking for a lot of practice, but it's definitely a class worth taking for the material. I think I have a more critical understanding of both sexuality and the study of history after taking it. And Caleb is great! I would absolutely take another class with him.",
