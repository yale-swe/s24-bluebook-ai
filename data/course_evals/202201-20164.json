I also developed a greater appreciation of the way that materials are used in the buildings I see around me.",
                "You learn a lot about materials and also how to work with them. Will you come out of this knowing how to build everything? No, but it's really really important fundamentals.",
                "I gained insight into various building materials and got practical experience building with them. I also learned how to conduct architectural research and make a model of a building of interest using a scaled drawing and various building materials. Overall, it felt like I gained an introduction to various stages of researching and modeling a building, which - as a non-arch major interested in the field - was extremely helpful for the growth of my personal interests.",
                "THIS WAS AN AMAZING CLASS!!! MOST IMPORTANTLY, I gained the ability to think critically about design choices and the relationship between aesthetics, architectural intention, and functionality. Additionally, I learned practical skills like how to use Rhino, laser cutting, thinking about scale. A new understanding of really basic/fundamental construction processes like milling, creating a formwork, pouring concrete on a slope, how to make a wooden shed, welding. Knowledge about sustainable design choices like using excess/cleared materials from a property, closed-loop geothermal systems, etc. How to use different materials to elicit feelings.",
                "A fun overview of architecture through the lens of materials. I learned how things like glass, concrete, and wood are deployed in architecture and got hands-on experience working with those materials in lab.",
                "I learned how to get into the mind of an architect and how materiality can shape the way a building is designed and constructed.",

                "model making and independent precedent study",

                "This is a great course. Very well-organized with dense materials delivered in a fun and interesting way.",
                "Strengths: the pairing of 1-hour lectures with 2-hour labs made the class really fun and kept my engagement up.\r\nWeaknesses: no clarity as to how assignments are graded.",
                "Probably the most fun class you'll ever have at Yale.\r\nHonestly the only weakness is that the 9:25 lecture on a Friday is... difficult for people to show up. \r\n\r\n**Also. Huge shoutout to God King Nate. He's amazing. If you wanna learn any skill, go to him!",
                "Strengths include the balance between conceptual and practical learning, the variety in assignments, the focus on learning and growth over performance, and the obvious passion of the teaching team. If anything, I think one thing that could be improved is providing a more clear and consolidated rubric for the assessments as well as funds for the students to buy materials (eg, in case they need to get materials not available in the shop). Also, while I did not mind a bigger class than usual (the more students that get this opportunity the better), it would have been nice with a sign-up sheet for certain activities to ensure that we do not have to wait around and queue for smaller activities (especially for welding).",
                "Strengths: Tim, Nate, and the grad students! The hands-on labs & lectures.",
                "The content of the course was very interesting, and I think the structure of talking about a material and then immediately working with it in lab afterward was effective. However, the workload did feel a bit imbalanced; for most of the semester, we had very little (if any) work outside of class, but as soon as the last couple of weeks came around, we all spent numerous hours working on scale models for our final project. It's totally possible that it was just poor time management, but I felt like the course was heavily rear loaded in a way that was counterintuitive. Would maybe be nice to have some kind of benchmark for the final project a couple of weeks after the midterm to make sure students are actively working on it and not just letting it sit until the last week of class.",
                "I think some individual work before the final precedent study would be helpful. However, this course was incredible and I think the hour lecture followed by time in the design lab is perfectly planned.",
                "Strengths - the weekly hands=on lab was great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - things could be timed to move faster - i think the hands-on format of the course made it so that it scaled very poorly as the class size got larger. Fortunately many people had covid each week, if the full class had been present every week it would have been a much less pleasant experience."

                "Yes! If you are interested in hands-on work and architecture! Or want some physical therapy or stress relief.",
                "Yes! Many students who took this course had no prior experience in / exposure to architecture, so it was great to see how amazing everyone's final projects turned out. There is no other class at Yale like this one.",
                "YES. This class is what you make of it. Tim has a lot to offer, and he really wants us to have fun!",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested in the research/design process of architecture, this course provides a hands-on, comprehensive introduction.",
                "YES!!! The class reinforced for me how lucky I am to be at Yale and how few people get the opportunity to take classes that challenge and expand the ways that they think about the world. At Yale, it is a serious privilege to get to explore any field from the experts, and it was a privilege to learn about architecture from Tim. I think much more about the spaces that I find myself inhabiting, and the architectural choices that went into creating the spaces, what works aesthetically/functionally, etc.",
                "I'd recommend it if you're looking for a very hands-on class that (typically) isn't much work outside of lecture and lab. That said, if you're more interested in the architecture side of things than the material side of things, I'd recommend ARCH 150 instead as it goes over the field in a lot more depth.",
                "Yes definitely. This course is so different from any other course I have taken in the best way. Its hands on work and learning that is truly such a unique and valuable experience.",
                "yes, i enjoyed the labs and researching a building i was interested in. i learned by doing and making a 3D model of a building",
                "Highly recommend - great way to take a break from readings, psets and papers by getting your hands dirty and building cool stuff using real world techniques."
