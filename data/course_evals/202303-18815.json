                "Great course, hard to think of a way it could be improved. Difficult course to teach, but Miki is excellent.",
                "Miki is an excellent lecturer. She gives her students lots of resources to succeed. The downside of this is that the course is very high paced and it is extremely hard to keep up with the workload. Usually I pride my teachers for this however her lack of sociability with students made it very hard for me to be happy taking the class. I went to her office hours multiple times throughout the course of the semester and showed up early to class each day, but if I came up to her two weeks from now she would not remeber who I was. Not once did she ask to learn my name or interact with me on any personal level. Again, she is an excellent lecturer and a fantastic teacher. But she did not put in any effort into creating a welcoming learning enviornment. Throughout my time here at Yale I have noticed this throughout the math department and while this review is about Miki I feel like generally this needs to be improved in order to make math students feel happy studying their passion. This semester she made it very difficult for me to be happy learning math because she was not involved in my math journey to the degree I expect my professor to. I could learn everything from a textbook and feel like my teachers need to provide me with something more than a lecture.  Especially in higher level math the teachers need to make more of an active effort to make the space friendly so that students can enjoy the journey that is learning math.",
                "Unfortunately, this lecture is not recorded and there are no posted lecture notes, so anyone who misses class would need to find notes from peers. That said, this encourages everybody to attend lectures, which I believe helps with learning and understanding concepts. There are also a plethora of resources, including office hours, but especially Miki's own \"Miki sessions,\" in which she offered 5 different time slots per week for students to attend if they had any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nThis class also goes at a pace that allows students to learn large amounts of content and it is very rewarding. The problem sets, although long, provide great exercises to ensure and improve our conceptual understanding of course content. There really isn't a moment where the class gets boring because the content doesn't slow down, which is great, especially for students who find it interesting. \r\n\r\nThe sole weakness I can think of is that exams are very short (midterms are 50 mins, last exam 90 min), so there is not a lot of margin for error nor is there a lot of time to think and ponder on the exam questions. That said, the questions asked are fair and can be completed in that time, and this quick pace helps add more challenge to the course.",
                "Strength: Miki and ULAs. Interesting and at times beautiful material. Sets up later study and important applications very nicely.\r\nWeakness: very hard. Easy to get behind and hard to catch up. Exams were unpleasantly difficult but curved generously.",
                "you will definitely learn a lot of algebra in the class. it is definitely a lot of work though so you really have to stay on top of it every week.",
                "The course is very well structured to facilitate learning. The course focuses heavily on the textbook (Abstract Algebra by Dummit & Foote) which makes learning material from class and studying for exams much easier.",
                "The exams could have been more like the homework questions or visa versa. There was still a lot of relevant practice material which was great.",
                "Strengths: Miki is probably one of the best STEM lecturers at this university. I'm not kidding, she is THAT good. The class is also really cool, Abstract Algebra is a very useful branch of Math with a lot of applications to other STEM fields like Physics. Everything we did felt like it had some purpose, which I really liked. Weaknesses: The course is a significant time investment, but doable.",
                "This course was very well organized and provided several different ways for students to engage with the content, including traditional lectures, pre-lecture videos and quizzes, as well as problem sets. One request I have is that it would be cool to hear more about important applications of the math to modern mathematical research and subjects such as physics. I have read that these applications exist but don't necessarily feel like we talked about them much in class.",
                "Strength: learn a lot. Miki is a great prof. ULAs are AMAZING (shoutout to Olivia). Made a lot of friends in the class\r\nWeakness: pre-classes are annoying (3x a week you have to watch a 10 min video and do a quiz before each class). You never really get to breathe in this class.",
                "The teaching is very good, the ULAs are extremely knowledgable and helpful, and the pre-class components help to spread out the work and improve my understanding of the material. However, I feel that the format of the exams that emphasizes speed is not an accurate way to assess ability in this course, and is needlessly discouraging to students who are putting in enormous amounts of work to this class.",
                "I think the pre class and class discussion portions were particularly helpful. The number of practice questions were incredibly useful when it came to exam seasons. :)",
                "Miki is a fantastic lecturer, and truly cares about all students succeeding in the course (e.g she makes all the class answer questions by holding up fingers in her lectures). It was nice being in such a suportive environment.\r\n\r\nThe only handycap I think is that we didn't cover ring theory enough, and I feel like we should have discussed modules, at least a little bit. We also handwaved some proofs (like proving that Aut Zp = Z_{p-1}) and proving the fundamental theorem of abelian groups. Of course, these theorems are spefic cases of more general theorems (existence of primitive root in Fp and the structure theorem of modules in PIDs) but it would still have been nice to see a proof.",
                "The course was very well organized and well taught. The homework and exams were fair, and the instructor was very helpful. I didn't really like the way the big homomorphism theorem was presented, but it was interesting nonetheless.",
                "Clear lectures, difficult content that pushes students to learn more",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, course is taught well and designed, learned a lot from the course\r\nWeaknesses: Textbook is a bit dry at times and is sometimes hard to gain intuition",
                "The office hours were super helpful and the course material was interesting",
                "It would have been nicer to have a few more days in between the last day of class and the final exam. But I understand that it might be difficult given the short reading period.",
                "Strengths: Miki is one of the best professors I've had at Yale (if not the best), and the course is incredibly well-structured, well-organized, and well-taught. People complain about the pre-classes, but they are very effective at teaching you some of the material beforehand so you don't get lost in lectures (particularly important since the content of this class is very difficult), and each pre-class is clearly well thought-out and fits into the larger structure of the course. Also, I cannot stress enough that Miki is an amazing teacherlectures are really engaging (they are definitely fast-paced, but there is always time to ask questions in class, plus Miki makes sure that every lecture includes at least some practice problems/short \"content check\" exercises, which are super helpful). Finally, the material itself is fascinating (at least in my opinion), and problem sets are really fun to complete.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, there aren't many. The biggest potential \"drawback\" to the course is the incredibly intensive time commitment, but because the class is so fun and well-taught, it usually doesn't feel like a chore (though I strongly recommend taking this class in a semester with 4 total creditsthe workload is real). The only other major weakness is that midterms are 50 minutes long, and there is a ton of material to know for each one, so even if you feel like you understand the course material well, if you don't see the right approach for even a single proof in the very short amount of time you have, your grade on the midterm can take a serious hit. Thankfully, Miki is not a ridiculously harsh grader and is pretty fair with partial credit, which at least softens the blow slightly.",
                "Strengths-- super engaging teaching style, pre-class quizzes can be a bit tiring but end up helping w/ engagement so 100% worth it.\r\nWeaknesses-- not many, the only thing is that it may be hard to tell exactly how these concepts are used in real life (if that is important to you), there was one applications class at the end but it was pretty loosely related imo",
                "great lectures and very fair psets. hard hard course, but abstract algebra just be like that so difficulty isn't a bad thing",
                "Strength: great professor and very in-depth lectures, learned SO much about group theory, this class genuinely improved my study habits and made me better at both proofs and application-based problems, OH and review sessions are super helpful and collaborative\r\n\r\nWeakness: lots of content so you need to pace yourself, do not cram before midterms/final, start psets early due to high workload",
                "Strength: Miki, ULAs, and graders. Weakness: The pre-class lectures were a little time consuming, and the number of problems per pset could have been reduced."

That being said I would hope that the space becomes more friendly and welcoming so that people can have fun learning the material instead of grinding 24/7.",
                "I believe that this class is a centerpiece of the math major and anyone who wants a math major or enjoys math should take this course. This was the most interesting math class I've taken so far in college, and it is also one of the most organized, well-run courses, if not the most well-run course I've taken. Miki has run this course in the fall for several years, and there are not any holes in the course.",
                "Yes absolutely, especially with Miki, but definitely know what you're getting yourself into and make sure you can set aside the time to actually understand the material (just doing the pset questions is not enough) or you will get very behind and confused.",
                "you learn a lot of really cool math in the course. it is also hands down the hardest course I have ever taken at Yale (yes, even more than the notorious cpsc 323). If you want to see what you are capable of mathematically, definitely take this course, but also be warned that it will likely take up most of our time and energy just to keep up. This was the first course I ever took here where just passing was a significant feat for me and many of my incredibly intelligent peers. A lot the smartest people you can find on this campus will drop the class or will end up Credit/D/Failing it as it isn't *required* for the math major. I have no regrets after taking this though. just know what you are getting into.",
                "Yes, I think every math major should take this. You may be inclined to do real and complex analysis to fulfill your core requirement due to the difficulty of this course, but I think you would be doing yourself a disservice by avoiding these topics. This was the first 300-level math class I have taken, and can confidently say that doing well in this course has more to do with your effort than your prior coursework. The topics are new to everyone, and you can do well if you try.",
                "If you are seriously interested in math or have an otherwise light semester Id take the course, especially with Miki. If youre only mildly or not really all too interested, it can be quite a drag, especially the pre-classes.",
                "Yes, especially if Miki is teaching it! It's a wonderful course and you will learn so much. Don't be scared off by the high workload ratingsit's mainly due to the pre-classes and fairly long Psets. But I promise the content of the class is very doable, but takes a bit of getting used to (especially at first). I mean, when you're learning it for the first time (like I did!) it can seem very new and strange, but as long as you have the time needed to dedicate to this class, you'll do greatin the end, it's more of a time investment thing than an intellectual challenge I'd say... (I took it in a semester where I had 5 intensive STEM classes and I was still fine in the end). Miki's exams are very straightforward, but a big time crunch (50 minutes...) so you better know how to do the problems immediately upon seeing them or it's over, because you won't have much time to figure it out (but this is not a big issue if you familiarize yourself with every single example in the textbook, which is doable).",
                "I would highly recommend this course to math students who have a strong proof background and find beauty in pure mathematics even if the practical applications of the work are not immediately.",
                "Yes but be prepared for the workload and being humbled by freshmen IMO winners",
                "This is an extremely good course, but it is not worth the years it will take off your life. Only take this course if you want the only thing you do for an entire semester to be abstract algebra.",
                "A hundred percent. Please take it with Miki, shes probably the best math lecturer at Yale.",
                "Yes. Even for non math majors with some mathematical affinity, this course will teach you a new way of thinking about math. I think the course has gotten easier compared to previous years (from what I have been told), so it really isn't a bad course to take. If you already have seen some group theory then you might be bored at times, but I think it is more wise to take it rather than skipping to 380 immediately.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to study math. Group theory is important in almost every area of math.",
                "yes!! While it is very difficult, you will walk out feeling very proud of how much you've learnt in a semester.",
                "Yes!! This is a really cool course granted that it is extremely time-consuming/challenging/stressful at times. This was probably one of the most rewarding courses I've taken at Yale so far, and I've had such a fun time in the course working with my classmates on psets or studying for the exam. Only take the course if you have enough time to fully engage with the material though.",
                "Yes, if that student is interested in algebra",
                "Yes, I would recommend it. I would say to also prepare time for it but I thought I learned a lot this semester.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to someone who wants to improve their math in fun environment. The workload of the course is high, but all the assignments and prelecture quizzes felt like they were there for the students' learning and never felt like tedious. If this is a) your first 300 level math course and b) you don't come from an intense math background, that workload will be difficult. That said, there are many layers of support in the course, and (though I cannot speak for everyone) I think we all left the course as a better mathematician than we were in the beginning of the course.",
                "Yes, take this class!!! Just looking at other students' reviews (the average overall review was a 4.8 for the last two times that Miki taught it, and I can't imagine it will be much lower this time around) should hopefully convince you if you're on the fence. Miki is probably the best professor I've had at Yale in any subject, which is especially impressive given that many math and STEM professors are not fantastic. The course is really well-organized; every single lecture, pre-class, and problem set is thoughtfully designed (in some lectures, for example, Miki will reference a concept that is coming in the next problem set, or a few pre-classes down the linewhich just shows how well she knows the content in all of them and how they all fit together). Lectures are engaging and well-organized, and basically all of them include 4-5 (or more) short in-class exercises so you actually stay engaged and actively learn the material. There are also so many resources for you to use if you don't understand the material on the first go-aroundMiki is super approachable and really good at answering questions (both in class and in her Miki sessions), and TA office hours (especially the Wednesday night 5-hour double sessions) are incredibly helpful as well.\r\n\r\nI cannot say enough good things about this class, especially if Miki is teaching it. Yes, the workload is real, and the \"pre-class components\" mean that you have to spend a minimum of 1-2 hours on this class almost every day of the week, but the course is so well-organized and well-designed that it makes what would otherwise be an impossibly difficult class into one that is (usually) manageable. Just don't take any other super hard classes at the same time as this oneyou do need to devote a very significant amount of time into the classbut otherwise, I guarantee that you will not regret taking it.",
                "100%. Miki is an excellent instructor and this class is super well-structured for learning.",
                "Incredibly well-taught and interesting course, Miki is a great professor who really helps you through the course.",
                "Yes, but only if you are passionate about math and are willing to put in the work. The course load rating is not joking around. And make sure you take it with Miki!",
                "yeah, miki is a hell of a professor and the stuff being taught is all so incredibly cool. just hard",
                "Absolutely, builds foundational skills for mathematics!",
                "Yes, I think all pure math majors should take Math 350. The intellectual challenge as well as the scope of the course will drastically improve your ability to problem-solve and write proofs, and I know many friends that improved their study habits & time management skills from this course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding the beauty of pure math.",
                "If you are a math major, this class is a must take."
