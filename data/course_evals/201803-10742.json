    "Dramatic learning so much more than the previous 2 chinese modules. Allows for so much fluidity and free practice of actually learning the language not just the basic rigid things. Amazing course, can't imagine shaping a language course better.",
    "I feel much more comfortable speaking and reading after taking CHNS 130.",
    "reading\/writing\/speaking chinese",
    "Chinese!",
    "My Chinese have improved dramatically. It's a lot of active class time every morning, but it's so worth it. If you're taking Chinese, you know what you're getting into. It's a fair workload, but you get a lot out of it, and the daily homework forces you to put some effort.",
    "Intermediate Chinese vocabulary, characters, phrases & expressions, grammar, and pronunciation.",
    "Through CHNS 130, I dramatically improved my Chinese skills--at this point, while still not fluent, I'm definitely conversational.  Sets you up well for study abroad opportunities, and is definitely worth taking.",
    "I learned how to use more advanced words and grammatical structures to communicate. I learned how to make my sentences more vivid."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Honestly can't think of weaknesses, daily homework can get annoying, but they allowed for working in advance better unlike last semester (you could see the following week's work and plan accordingly) so you could manage better.\r\nStrength wise, teacher was very capable to say the least and encouraging discussion and making sure students understood the grammar structure and most importantly correct usage and ideas of the Chinese.",
    "The strengths are the professors and TF's and the textbook.",
    "Strengths: incredible resources and class\/homework structure.\r\nweaknesses: inevitably, not as much time to practice speaking in class due to larger classes.",
    "I wish there was more verbal\/speaking practice. I feel that we have a lot of busy work and a lot of class time could be used better (ex: We spend a day out of every lesson doing \"presentations\" where we just recite a memorized essay we wrote. This isn't really, in my opinion, conducive verbal practice and the time would be better spent having us practice conversing with our peers.)",
    "It's a great course! Highly recommend!",
    "Amazing teachers and very good curriculum.",
    "The course is extremely predictable--things follow the schedule, grades come back quickly, and feedback is always useful.  The online homework is a bit rediculous at times (questions are occasionally worded so strangely that I'd get them wrong even if they were in English), but the experience overall was very smooth.  Test prep also correlated well with the material on the exams, so as long as you put in the (admittedly considerable) time, you'll do alright.  Sometimes I wish we had more time to talk conversationally instead of working with the textbooks\/off the powerpoints, but I feel that language table and tutorials did a fine job of giving us time to speak with others.",
    "Strengths: Xu Laoshi is such a supportive, kind, and knowledgable teacher. We learned so many characters and grammar rules in just a semester. Weaknesses: the final video project took a long time and I didn't learn much from it, but we were graded very generously."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. This is the language course you want to take. If you are taking your placement, even if you have to prep up and study or something try to place into L3 as opposed to L2 or maybe even higher level, great for getting back your Chinese skills especially if you haven't spoken in a while too.",
    "yes, it taught me a lot",
    "Yes. If you want to learn Chinese take the class",
    "Absolutely. The daily work forces you to stay in it, but that's a good thing because your language improves dramatically. But if you're looking to just fulfill a language requirement, this probably isn't your easiest choice.",
    "Yes, it was amazing, and it was even more interesting than the introductory classes, as we learned a lot of idioms and more complex phrases that are common among Chinese speakers.",
    "Yes!  Do know that the class is very work intensive, but it's also been my most fun course this semester by a long shot, and you build great bonds with professors and classmates.",
    "Take this class if you want to improve your Chinese a huge amount in a semester. This class is organized so well. The daily calendar is planned super well. Xu Laoshi was one of the sweetest teachers I've ever had. The textbook is really interesting to read and easy to learn from. I feel like my Chinese improved so much."
