The small class size during the summer also helps since it feels a lot more personal and we can ask the prof more questions anytime. The professor is also very accommodating and understanding, giving us more time on exams and etc.; he really wants to help everyone get a good grade (provided that you put in the work) \r\nWeaknesses: the first exam was really tough as the professor underestimated how much time it would take us, and the questions felt extremely different from the homework. This was addressed for the next two exams though"

                "It's actually a pretty fun course! Professor Tsai is a fun professor and even with the super condensed schedule of summer classes, it really wasn't too bad to get through. the lectures are long and they're MWF (with homeworks due EACH class period) so you'll for sure have your work cut out for you, but as long as you listen and, I really recommend this, make a group chat with your fellow classmates and help each other through the hw together, it's really not too bad. The level of math isn't bad at all, the hard part is figuring out which equation to use really. If you want to try out thermodynamics for a bit and have a basic introduction to the field, this would be a good start (though if you're pressed on time, take the fall/spring version)"
