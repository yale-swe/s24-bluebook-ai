                "I would say that by far the most influential part of this class in my writing was the use of the drafting process. Professor Caplan walks students through the drafts with incredibly thoughtful and helpful feedback at each point. This made me think more deeply about my writing and I believe improve throughout the semester. The structure Professor Caplan provided for analysis of essays was also a new lens for me that I continue to use\/ponder outside of the course."

                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Very good first English course at Yale and gives you a very solid footing for writing in the future. The class is also small which is nice for getting personalized feedback. Also, PLEASE take this course with Lincoln Caplan. You wont regret it. He cares so much about you and your writing and he provides incredible feedback.",
                "Yes. It's a great class to improve your creative writing, the skill of writing essays that don't have an obvious outline when you begin to think about them, and where most of the work will have to be done by your own ability to put together your own thoughts rather than group together sources of evidence.",
                "Yes! The course is intellectually stimulating and again Professor Caplan is a terrific teacher."
