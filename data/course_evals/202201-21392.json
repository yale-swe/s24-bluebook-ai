                "I learned how to compare time periods, cultures, and literary texts in a very in depth and thorough fashion. I also developed deep appreciation for East Asian theater and drama traditions. The workshops also allowed us to get actual experience in Chinese and Japanese drama practice!",
                "I learned about many different genres and styles of Chinese and Japanese theater.",
                "I learned about many different forms of Chinese and Japanese theater. Each class is about a different form or comparison of a few forms. Like Japanese Rakugo, Noh, Kyogen, Kabuki, Bunraku, Puppets, and Chinese Zaju, Chuanqi\/Kunqu, Beijing Opera. We get to read and discuss about what they are like, actual plays from them, and authors analyses of them.",
                "basic understanding of the major Japanese and Chinese theater genres; the relationship between playtexts, performance, and the audience; the tension between updating classic plays and staying true to the original theater or literary traditions; how theater informs popular understandings of gender and class",
                "I learned how to close read, analyze primary and secondary resources, examine historical perspectives from a contemporary viewpoint, and craft a research question that encompasses Chinese and Japanese theater traditions.",
                "I learned so much from this course! I thought it was a wonderful blend of a variety of different disciplines: history, theater studies, with philosophical and political elements as well."

                "I think the strengths of the class relied on the fascinating subject matter and the multi-media aspect. It was an extremely interesting class. Weaknesses might have been a certain level of dryness in the beginning of the course. I found it difficult to get through a hundred pages a week of reading about drama context in the first couple of weeks.",
                "We definitely covered a lot of ground, which was nice, and it was cool to approach the topics from different angles (performance, theory, etc.).",
                "Strength: very engaging class discussions, interesting topic with workshops and videos not just readings, Professor is very understanding about deadlines and willing to give advice as long as you ask\r\nSomething to improve: since this course is listed under EALL, EAST, and THST, students come from varying levels of familiarity with theater. The assignments were pretty open-ended which is good for freedom and creativity but especially the first two required strong ability to analyze plays and understanding of the theater medium. Students who havent done that much before would appreciate more guidance and tips perhaps some demonstrations using readings in class.",
                "Strengths: really caring and knowledgeable professor who is good at facilitating discussions; fascinating course material and well-selected readings about Chinese and Japanese theater; my classmates were very engaged and our class discussions were always super rewarding and productive\r\nOne weakness: professor should consider limiting the number of auditing students because it's really distracting to have people not come to class and not contribute to class discussions \r\nNot a weakness but the classroom was strangely lit and not the most conducive to discussions and the chairs were uncomfortable",
                "Some strengths: we were able to engage with the material to a high degree. The seminar style of these courses allowed for discussions to ensue, and the workshops (we had one for Japanese theater, one for Chinese theater) allowed us to engage with the texts on a more physical level (acting out scenes with professionals from the field). Our texts were also diverse and inspiring to read. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses: I wish we could have more classes during the week just so the engagement to the text stays strong. This is a small detail but I wish we could have a bigger classroom, as some workshops\/discussions were difficult because there was limited space."

                "YES!!!! Take this class. Period. Professor Bernard is a gem and SO on top of her work. It will give you a great global perspective on theater as well as a great appreciation for how simply beautiful Chinese and Japanese theater traditions are. This was a fantastic, fantastic class.",
                "Yes. It is a fun and not-stressful course that opens your eyes to what Chinese and Japanese theater is.",
                "Yes! especially if you're interested in China, Japan, or theater in general!",
                "Absolutely. The historical narratives you read about in this course are still very applicable to the present day. In fact, these plays are still being adapted and developed for a more diverse audience. Additionally, Prof. Bernard is an excellent professor who will seek to bring out your greatest writing potential. She is highly organized, and as such each class yields fruitful discussion and learning. Something I particularly appreciated was how Prof. Bernard organizes course materials on Canvasthey are accessible, orderly, and one never has to struggle about finding readings. They are also in order, which helps lay out the plan for each class and each class thereafter. Most importantly, Prof. Bernard is a highly compassionate, understanding, and patient professor. She will take time out of her schedule to speak with you if you have any questions, and implores you to exercise your creativity limitlessly. Prof. Bernard also cares greatly about students' mental health and is very accomodating and understanding; this made my learning experience so much better. Thus, do take this class if you want to learn about Chinese and Japanese theater traditions, how they pertain to both past and present, with a professor who is kind, patient, and understanding!",
                "Absolutely! I think this course is incredibly accessible, with a variety of assignment types (close reading essay, creative paper, open-ended research paper, workshops...). Professor Bernard also offers a wide array of resources to ensure we feel supported throughout the course."
