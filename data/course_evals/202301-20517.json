The course is extremely well structured and the homework helps fixate the content. It is an excellent course overall!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Objectivelly I'd say none, but it sometimes depends on your classmates to be talkative for class to go well. I also thought the extra text that was added after we went through the textbook, although interesting, took time that would have been helpful for catchup/consolidating the massive amount of content we covered during the semester.",
                "Strengths: small class size, regular assignments and check-ins, multiple tests instead of one big final. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could have spent more time in conversation.",
                "The course material presented in class is highly engaging, allowing students to acquire a wealth of new vocabulary that finds application in daily intellectual conversations. However, one limitation of the course is that certain topics may not be covered in sufficient depth due to time constraints within the predetermined class schedule."
