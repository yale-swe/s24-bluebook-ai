                "The frequent midterms of the course mean that you have to really keep up with your studying to do well. I liked this format because it kept me accountable but also meant that I am currently not stressing heading into the \"final\" (which is just a non-cumulative midterm, essentially). The fact that there were 5 professors meant that I got a good sense of each specific field from an expert. The downside of the rotating teaching staff, however, is that I had to \"relearn\" how I took tests on every single midterm, and the professors varied in how much extra content (notes, practice problems, or at one point whether they posted slides or not) they gave to help us study. Standardizing this would be really helpful. Also, no midterm feedback was provided so I had no idea what I got right/wrong.",
                "A lot of the professors are doctors and are thus not super experienced with teaching undergraduates (and teaching on zoom at all? Half of them messed up the zoom recordings which was annoying). Some of the information in lecture was super detailed and it was unclear what would be tested. \r\n\r\nThat said, it was cool to have a revolving door of professors that each had extensive knowledge in their own area of expertise. But the class as a whole did lack a sense of cohesiveness.",
                "Weaknesses: the slides of most professors were all over the place, the course lacked organization, and there seemed to be very little communication between the prof and the TAs. We also couldn't see which questions we got wrong on exams which is annoying because it prevents us from finding out what we could've improved.",
                "Great strengths",
                "Strengths: I think this course contained really interesting content, and all the professors were super engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wished the course could be a little bit more structured in terms of streamlining resources. I would also wish that the professors would do better job of providing the TAs with resources so they could know what to expect from us and what we should expect on the exams. I also wish I would get more timely feedback on my exams so I know what not to do during the next exam.",
                "This class is a great introduction/survey into pathology, but can start to feel like an endless list of diseases to memorize at times.",
                "Better organization, better test prep",
                "I liked that it was different units with different professors, but the difference in exam style and difficulty made it hard to study.",
                "This course was run very well, but was very, very heavy with content. It was difficult to learn so much information in 4-5 lecture sections.",
                "The material was super interesting and all the professors were quite knowledgeable. The issue with having so many different professors is that there is a lack of continuity in course materials/what's expected on exams. It would have been nice to have been able to see our exams and how they were graded. Even if they weren't used for a grade, it also would have been nice to have practice questions to work on between exams.",
                "I think a strength of the course is its content; it is both extremely interesting and very detailed. I felt I learned a lot in such a short amount of time, with many applications to a future career in biology or medicine. One weakness is the application of the content. While we learned a lot in each lecture module, it felt as if we were on our own for the exams, and you never knew what to expect."

But the exams are not too difficult and none of them are cumulative so the class as a whole is not so bad. It did not change my life by any means.
