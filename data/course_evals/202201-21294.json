                "I was able to learn how to read through scientific papers and better understand the rationale behind experiments.",
                "I learned to think critically about the methods and organization of scientific papers. I practiced coming up with crisp experiments and designing with controls.",
                "This course was very helpful at helping me learn about how to approach research and the logic behind each experiment. By reading papers each week and discussing during class, I learned how to think about future directions and hypotheses about the studies."

                "The class was set up where we learned a variety of different topics and read papers from lots of seminal areas in the field of molecular biology. However, I think that the class was geared way too far towards the research aspect of science.",
                "Strengths - the wide breadth of papers was satisfying to read. However, the weekly assignments (especially the initial ones), seemed to be quite a lot and were not extremely beneficial (maybe it was for some of the other students).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not much in particular. It's hard to say what weaknesses are that the course instructors could improve on. It was CLEAR that some students did NOT read the papers on Tuesday and how can the professors ensure all students will? Maybe the professors should \"spook\" the students and show up on some Tuesdays?",
                "I just wish homework assignments could be dropped.",
                "The course allows for students to read many papers and examine the logic behind several experiments. I enjoyed being able to engage in student-led discussions of the papers.",
                "Strengths: the course was well organized on both Tuesdays and Thursdays. Having student leaders gave everyone the responsibility to show up and participate in class even when the professors were not there.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps on Thursdays, the professors could guide the class even more by asking students questions like \"What was the question the authors were trying to ask in doing this experiment?\" for each of the figures. Answering questions like this one is a skill I definitely need more practice in and is integral to truly understanding the point of the paper. Sometimes, the professors talk about specific details about the paper that was hard to follow along.",
                "While I enjoyed the student-run aspect of the course, communication from instructors was varied, especially in regards to assignment details.",
                "The strengths of the course are the Thursday discussions with the professors. It's helpful to be able to ask them questions about the research papers that we read for the week.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that you don't receive any individual feedback. The professors will give general feedback that the class should work on, but it would have been nice to receive feedback on our weekly paper responses and on our final project (prior to giving our chalk talk)."

If that is your goal, this class will set you up for that track and how to talk with other researchers. If you want to go more into industry or medical school, however, you will at times feel lost and not included in the discussions.",
                "Yes, especially for students interested in reading primary literature and thinking critically about how to design and construct experiments. Suited for students interested in pursuing a research-focused MD, MD\/PhD, or PhD.",
                "Yeah, I think its really fun and very well-organized. You end up learning so much about different realms of biochemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to gain more experience reading research papers and learning about the application of fundamental scientific techniques.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because you get to read interesting papers, discuss them with peers and professors, and the workload is fair.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class; it was my favorite MBB class that I have taken! It was one of the first times that a course emphasized how to understand every part of the research process as well as the logic behind how to propose an experiment. I feel like I can take away so much more from the papers that I read."
