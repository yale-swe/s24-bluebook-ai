                "This course was a combination of cultural anthropology and archaeology - discussion of Maya cultural practiced was mixed with looking at material remains. The class mostly focused on content, there's nothing I gained skill-wise I didn't already have.",
                "I gained a broad overview of the Maya civilization from the Preclassic to Postclassic periods through examining different facets of their culture like religion, politics, language, etc.",

                "I learned many valuable skills and information in this class. I learned many techniques used for archeology and anthropological work for analysis such as carbon dating, remnant tracing and others but I think what was more important for me was the information I learned in the class. I thought I already had a pretty good idea of what the Ancient Maya were but I was wrong. I learned so much about the ancient Maya that I did not know before and I am grateful to have a better understanding of an important culture.",
                "Got familiar with facts and debates about ancient Maya.",

                "Strengths: Professor Chinchilla is very nice and extremely knowledgeable about the Maya. Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, assignments meant to help you understand the readings, passionate professor, field trip to the MET to visit Ancient Maya exhibit curated by the professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings could be a bit long, 9 am class in a dark Watson center classroom",
                "The course had a pretty big workload  - weekly reading assignments, 3 short essays, a midterm, and a final paper. Fortunately, it was all spaced out in a way that never overwhelmed me. I think the course hit the right combination of work which made sure I was learning something from class without getting bogged down in it. Beyond scheduling later in the day, nothing immediately comes to mind which would improve this course.",
                "A strength was the textbook from Coe and Houston. Although it went into much greater detail than was discussed in class, I found that the language was accessible and not dense. \r\n\r\nOne area of improvement would be organizing the readings on Canvas into different folders by each week's topic . The journal articles were all just in one folder, which looked less neat.",
                "The grading scale for the assignments has a magnitude that is too small. The weekly readings are a reasonable amount of content and pages, but the weekly queries are pedantic for college students. The course material is interesting, but the lectures did not focus on the topics we were tested on.",
                "Strengths would be organization, pacing, and information given. \r\nWeaknesses would be personal engagement, ie getting clear instructions and understanding of what was wanted of me and how to do it. I also feel like there could be more collaboration or class discussion.",
                "This course is very well-organized, balanced with illustrations, lectures and discussions.",
                "I liked the short assignment topics and the opportunities to see professor chinchillas work and visit the YUAG \/ see obsidian tools, but I feel like the lectures could meander slightly and werent very focused on key points or on the readings for each week."

                "Yes if the student is interested in learning about the Maya and ancient Maya society.",
                "YES!!!!!! Such a fascinating course with a kind and involved professor! Very fun social science credit if you're willing to put in some work",
                "I would not recommend this course to someone outside of an Anthropology major. I found the course very interesting, but unless one a had deep-seated fascination for the Maya there's nothing this course has to offer to someone who isn't studying Anthropology. The workload was also big enough that it could be hard to keep up with if someone is taking a lot of homework-heavy STEM courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with even a vague interest in the Maya, Mesoamerica, or American archaeology. That being said, I would say that the workload was greater than what I would expect for a non-advanced anthropology course. The workload includes weekly reading responses, a short presentation on an academic article of one's choosing, a sit-down midterm, and a final paper. On top of those were three \"short assignments.\" The name is misleading as it did not take me a short amount of time to do them. A fellow student who had taken a different course taught by Professor Chinchilla told me that the three \"short assignments\" were implemented during the early years of the pandemic when students were enrolled remotely. I would like to make a case to get rid of these three \"short assignments\" as they felt more like busy work. Granted, I used the opportunity anyway to learn more about the Maya and improve my writing. However, considering that being back in the Yale academic sphere is quite challenging, I recommend reducing the course-load to make it less stressful for future students. Perhaps Professor Chinchilla could more highly weigh in-class student participation or the weekly reading responses in the grading.",
                "I would 100 percent recommend this course. The readings were engaging, and the workload was manageable. I also loved how we got to go to the Yale Art Gallery and look at artifacts, and we also got a trip to the MET to see our professor's exhibit on the Maya. This class is also very organized, and Professor Chinchilla is really knowledgeable on the subject.",
                "Maybe, if you're particularly interested in this topic. The only engaging assignment is the final paper.",
                "I would if they were interested in the ancient Maya. I don't think this class would be very interesting at all to someone who doesn't care about the Maya. The information is not presented in the most engaging way as there is a lot of textbook reading and lecturing but if you are interested and invested in the ancient Maya it is easy to stay engaged and interested.",
                "YES.",
                "Definitely, its such a fascinating topic explored in such detail with a leading scholar in the field. The workload is super manageable but still engaging."
