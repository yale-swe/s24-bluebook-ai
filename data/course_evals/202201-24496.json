                "I learned how to think more critically about dance and the relationship between my mind and body. This class helped me develop a greater sense of spatial awareness, and I learned a lot about my own body and its movements, especially in a space with other people.",

I also learned a large portion of Locus, a postmodern dance piece by Trisha Brown. This course generally expanded my understanding of dance improvisation and made me much more comfortable with it in many different forms."

                "I loved this class overall! It was a little tough to have a really long class, but given that Irene had to make a long commute every week it's understandable.",
                "Very open ended class where we had extensive input on what we did and learned in class. The weakness was the very white-centered and basic artists and artwork we focused on. Would love to see a more diverse array of genres and artistry.",
                "LOVED this class. Irene is an amazing instructor and facilitator. The students were great, and we formed a wonderful community and strong bonds. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in movement, dance, improv, and art!",
                "The guest instructors were really engaging, the viewings were great too but I think there were a few too many readings. Also, a 4-hr class needs something to keep it exciting, otherwise a 2-hr block might make more sense.",
                "Class is pretty long, which as a non-theater student was pretty difficult. However, I learned a lot about different artists and enjoyed learning Trisha Brown's work.",
                "This class provides a lot of freedom to explore the interests you have surrounding dance. This semester, a creative project was also offered as an option alongside the traditional papers. The class also serves an open space for anyone regardless of experience in dance, and the studio time keeps you engaged with the class.",
                "The class could have been organized a bit better, but it ended up being a good experience.",
                "Strength: I really appreciate and enjoy the ample time we had practicing dance hands-on, especially for a post-modern piece like Locus that seems very \"intellectual\". It is in experiencing and doing Locus that I could engage with the physical momentum and energy incorporated in the piece, and it was also from my own physical experience that I can appreciate our related reading more. I also appreciate tremendously the non-judgmental environment Professor Hultman fosters, which is essential for dance improvisation practice.\r\nWeakness: the connection between reading material and studio practice could be strengthened. We are reading some really interesting artists and their work, but sometimes those seem slightly disjointed from our studio practice and I'm sometimes not sure how I could put everything together to form a coherent picture.",
                "I really enjoyed that the course was a studio, making it feel very similar to a regular dance class at a studio. I also enjoyed that we were given a wide selection of readings that exposed us to different aspects of dance and intellectualization while not requiring too much academic focus on these readings each week, keeping the focus on the movement practice. I think it might have been cool to try implementing the techniques and theories we read about during our class time, since the readings and class practice did sometimes feel disconnected from each other."

                "YES. Absolutely. Great way to explore post-modern dance and dive into one piece.",
                "If you like post-modern dance, this class is for you. If you are a trained dancer who wants to expand your horizons and learn about new styles and theories, this class would be great for you. And if you have no experience dancing, I would recommend this class to you because it serves as a good entry-point into dancing. But if you only like dancing because of music, this class is not for you. If you are a student of color or trans or nonbinary student, this class is probably not for you.",
                "Yes if you are interested in post-modern dance.",
                "Yes! This course is really unique compared to those I've taken so far, and I really think it offers something to all students regardless of dance background. Spending dedicated time towards exploring your body and thinking about the way you move is super insightful, and you don't get this opportunity often to do it for a class. It's also generally a light-workload class, but you still get to think about very interesting ideas. It's a rewarding experience to be pushed out of your comfort zone and try improvisation.",
                "Yes! If interested in dance or movement at all this course is perfect for all skill levels.",
                "I would definitely take a dance course at Yale!",
                "I would if they are interested in a hands-on experience with dance improvisation and learning about post-modern dance. However, you should be prepared to spend time on your own for reflections and further explorations if you want to make the most out of the class - class discussions and practices are often to kickstart your thought process rather than giving you the whole picture.",
