Interdisciplinary methods and themes of cognitive science such as computation, philosophy, and neuroscience. Awe and appreciation for the evolution and design of such complex natural systems as the brain itself.",
                "I gained a broad overview of many topics in cognitive science, from decision-making to visual perception to evolution, etc. I also improved my ability to read journal articles that presented and discussed current research.",
                "Not much. the lectures were hard to follow and involved a lot of Prof. Scholls own musings about whatever was on his mind and egotistical attempts to make us laugh. He refused to record lectures and removed all helpful graphics and images from slides he posted online (not to mention minimal words to begin with on the slides) making it impossible to miss class and be able to grasp the material you missed.",
                "If you want a good general overview of Cognitive Science, then this course is great. It covered a lot of really cool topics, but not really in depth.",

                "This class was applicable in every way possible to the real world. I learned what it meant to study from what a professor says in class and feel like my study habits have benefitted as a result. I also gained insight in how to analyze research papers because of our reading assignments, which is a skill I needed and hadn't been exposed to before.",
                "I learned a lot about how the mind processes information and carries out its functions. The readings sometimes helped learning, but it can be hard to understand them at times.",
                "While I feel I developed an understanding of cognitive science, I would argue this class is not as informative as the other classes I have taken at Yale. This class feels more like Professor Scholl showing you experiments that are interesting, while not truly giving you an in depth reasoning of his intentions of showing the experiment. This class feels like you are watching a ted talk meant to show a glimpse into cognitive science. I feel like the main insight I learned from this class is that I have no interest in being a cognitive science major or ever taking a class with the cognitive science department again.",

                "All aspects of knowledge in the field of cognitive science!!!",
                "I learned about many general themes that run through the cognitive science discipline, such as cognitive architecture, modularity, instinct blindness, computation, evolution, nature vs. nurture. We applied these general themes into specific branches in cognitive science, such as language, sex and attraction, attention, reasoning and decision-making, and perception. This was very much a crash course on the cognitive science, and we didn't go in depth into certain topics really. However, it is a very good course if you're interested in anything related to the human mind, whether that be neuroscience or psychology.",

                "I feel as though I learned a lot from the course, but it's hard to sum up exactly what I learned. I definitely know a lot more about human behavior now, but the course was probably most helpful in terms of learning how to take notes and study. This course was unlike any of my others. There were so many examples in class that I had to learn how to follow along with the larger concept while still marking down all the examples (that showed up on the tests). There was also a powerpoint presented in class, but when we got the slides the pictures were not included nor was all of the writing on the slides. This class definitely helped me learn how to follow along with a lot of information while extracting what was important.",

                "I feel that I have learned a lot but also very little at the same time. Since it is an intro course, there was a lot of breadth but very little depth in a given topic.",
                "By taking this course, I was able to learn a lot about myself as a flawed, yet intriguing, human being. I really enjoyed looking at how different parts of my mind interact with one another. A lot of the content we covered in this course would be something I would click to watch on YouTube.

Areas we studied included psychology, computer science, linguistics, and neuroscience.

                "SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE! I have learned a huge amount about how the mind works and found myself coming up with many questions based on the material we learned and read. I already see myself applying the various insights we've learned to my daily life and I bring up the knowledge I learned frequently in conversation with family and friends. Some specific topics I feel come up a lot: cognitive biases, language acquisition, facial processing, etc.",

                "In this class, we studied how the mind works by covering: instinct blindness, cognitive architecture, innateness, modularity, computation, evolution, neuropsychology, AI\/robotics, infant cognition, comparative cognition, brain scanning, philosophy, language, perception, attention, reasoning, decision-making, morality, and sex & attraction.",

                "I gained a lot of insight about the nature of cognitive science and how much of an integral role it plays in areas of life I would have previously never considered.",
                "I learned a great deal of information about how the mind works as well as the fact that there is an incredible amount of information that we do not know about the mind.",
                "This course was an excellent introduction to cognitive science and the wide variety of fields that it encompasses; we began by looking at some big picture ideas of cogsci such computation and innateness before delving into specific case studies of actual research. Without a doubt, this class has changed the way I perceive the world and think about my interactions with others, be it visual illusions or the Prisoner's Dilemma. The class covered a very wide breadth of fields (a reflection of CogSci itself) as it involved research from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and more. Research papers pertinent to the week's lecture were assigned to us as reading assignments, and we were asked to engage thoughtfully with the work through the reader responses. These simple 20-minute exercises helped me familiarize myself with occasionally dense academic research to extract the key ideas (a very useful skill for research, I would guess.) Overall, the most important lesson I got from this class was about how to think like a cognitive scientist, regardless of what field one may want to specialize in further on.",
                "This gives you an introduction to a lot of basic concepts in Cognitive Science. Since it is an intro course it really focuses on the themes rather than the methods and specifics. This makes it great as a class to change the way you think about the world and people, but if you really want to get into the weeds of something specific you will need to take more classes outside of this.",
                "This is a great survey course of the discipline.",

                "Scholl refused to record lectures, slides were not reflective of the lecture so when attempting to return to the slides to review it was incredibly difficult to recognize what the point of the content was. Very few points available, incredibly difficult to understand how to do well in the course. Even teaching fellows were uncertain of answers and would argue over what was the correct response when we had our review sessions for our exams. A discussion section would be immensely helpful because students received no feedback on reading responses, so it was difficult to know if we even understood the content of the readings as intended. Lectures felt focused on being entertaining as opposed to informational. Some jokes made throughout the course felt ill-intended, especially in regards to gender and sexuality.",
                "The material is not hard to understand, but the way in which the exams are graded is frustrating.",
                "The professor was really good but for me personally I found it difficult to maintain attention and that is required to be able to do well on exams.",
                "Prof. Brian Scholl is an entertaining lecturer, but at times the topics get a bit mundane. It's also extremely difficult to gain knowledge for the course at times--the slides that are posted have minimal information and lectures aren't recorded. Having recorded lectures would've been super helpful",
                "It covers a lot of interesting topics lightly, so I appreciated understanding the scope of cognitive science through this class. I felt, at times, that complexity in subject matter was sacrificed in order for the class to be fun, such as in the Sex and Attraction lecture where the professor cited research where women were less likely to take up men in sexual prepositions than men were in the opposite situation to support the idea that evolutionarily speaking, men should want to have as many partners\/be as sexually active as possible compared to women, without mentioning the context around which women would be more afraid in these situations or the follow-up study that was done because of this social context. Overall, wouldn't take again but undeniably learned some cool things.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and the reading questions for this class as they often asked us to explain and work through our thoughts as we approached the scientific findings related to how the human mind works. The lectures were extremely engaging, and I was impressed by the amount of topics we covered in the class!",
                "The strength of the course was that Professor Scholl was a very engaging lecturing. The weakness was that lectures were the only real \"substantive\" parts of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Scholl is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and I looked forward to every lecture! A conscious and successful effort was made to unify the disparate parts of the course. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Prof. Scholl is a wonderful, engaging lecturer. The content was interesting and relevant to daily life. A 'weakness' was that the course was so broad, but this is more so the nature of a 1-semester introductory course -- there's not much of a choice if it is an introductory cognitive science class, because there is so much in the field. A weakness is not having access to the full, unedited lecture slides. After class, Prof. Scholl posts them but deletes many of the images from them; text is guaranteed to remain, but other things may or may not remain, even if they are actually important. It would be helpful when studying to still have access to them.",
                "weaknesses:\r\n- the professor: he doesnt seem to care about student wellbeing at all, makes tests that seem so out of touch with the content you would expect to be tested on and writes questions with the purposeful intent of trying to trick people. He made several sexist and transphobic comments which made me and others feel uncomfortable. All of the TAs were scared of him leading to a lack of transparency of what was going on and poorly run review sessions often containing contradictory information that we were then tested on. He also told TAs to withhold our paper grades before the final exam, making it so we could not know how we were doing in the class or whether or not we should credit\/ D going into the final.\r\n- refused to record lectures, the only lecture on my schedule which did so this semester.",
                "It was a little all over the place in terms of material at first, but go better throughout the course.",
                "It's a good survey of cognitive science, definitely, but Professor Scholl does not make it easy to take notes or study for tests.",
                "Strengths: Professor Scholl is a good lecturer and keeps things engaging. The material and studies are also very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The course and lectures are very poorly structured. There is no clear outline for each class and we seemed to be just jumping around to random topics that weren't very organized. The underlying themes were there but the actual material was just a hot mess of random experiments that somehow was supposed to tie together each topic. Also, the uploaded slides are HEAVILY redacted which is really frustrating. The figures and experiments are a key part of the course and most of the relevant material is removed from the slides when they are uploaded - really what is the point of this? The exams are also tricky and frankly, demoralizing...the kind of questions where you have to circle ALL of the correct answers and if you circle 2 out of 3, you're completely wrong. The questions aren't straightforward, either, and usually try to make some vague connection to the material that is unlike anything discussed in lecture.",
                "Personally, considering that I dropped this course, I find it difficult to find strengths One thing I can say is that for students truly interested in Neuroscience or Cognitive Science, it does give a broad basic overview of things one may need to be familiar with. In terms of weakness, the communication within the class felt very impersonal and the style of lecturing was very difficult to follow. Often times lectures would not remain on topic or become convoluted by tangents on other topics.",
                "Strengths -- Professor Scholl is a very engaging teacher and clearly is interested in the subject matter. The course also has a relatively forgiving workload and topics are very relevant to real-world situations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Clarity on expectations for the final paper and for exams was a bit difficult to obtain, there seemed to be a bit of confusion\/vagueness around what these large assignments would be made up of. The course material, while connected by broad concepts, could sometimes feel a bit hard to know what to actually focus on\/what details were pertinent",
                "A lot of breadth, very little depth. Lacked structure. Resources were really poor, review sessions utterly disorganized, and generally hard to engage. Exams were horrendously concocted and there was serious inconsistency in marking.",
                "Strengths: Well structured, engaging professor, largely interesting material. A kind course, overall. \r\nWeaknesses: Built-in exam preparation could have been more useful. Review sessions were of limited value, and it was difficult to know how to effectively use study time.",
                "Lecture slides that were posted didn't include pictures, but were well organized. Professor was always passionate, insightful, and fun. Topics learned in the course is very relevant to our daily lives and helpful to learn. Reading questions were helpful in preparing students to lectures.",
                "The strength of this course is that you get to learn a lot about everything and a weakness is that some of the concepts are so broad and continuously being developed that it sometimes feels like the explanation behind the 'why' and 'how' are lacking. The guest lectures were also really interesting and refreshing to see other areas where research was being applied.",
                "Professor Brian Scholl is a great lecturer however he spoke fast and it was very hard to type what he was saying. He had very little notes on the slide so it was hard to follow at times. It would be better if there were more notes on the slides. Lectures were not recorded which did not help. The reading responses were sort of helpful. I think they would be more helpful if they were written for undergrad students and not cognitive scientists.",
                "The main strength of this class is that the material is interesting. Additionally, my TA was very helpful when revising my paper and reviewing for exams. Professor Scholl is a very skilled lecturer and knows how to keep class comedic yet informational. \r\nTo begin, the first weakness of this course is the slides\/lectures. The lectures aren't very to the point, much like everything in this class. Nothing is clearly stated, and experiments are shown without a real explanation to the reasoning\/logic\/correlation behind them. \r\nAdditionally, no lectures are recorded. Especially with an increase in Covid and other illnesses, this is very inconvenient. While Professor Scholl does post the slides, half of the slides are often blank\/missing, and as I stated earlier, the majority of lectures are only examples\/experiments showcasing topics, so it is very hard to decipher what the slides are about. The professor, additionally, does not use Canvas and has his own website which is, in my opinion, very disorganized and hard to navigate. The twice-weekly reading questions are helpful to summarize your understanding of the reading, but they really don't benefit you in terms of learning course material. \r\nSecondly, the exams are written the days before and day of the exam, and it most definitely shows. The exams are very wordy and it is very hard to decipher what the questions are trying to ask. There are no examples of past exams, since he writes them the day of and they are all very varying in questions. I found this very unprofessional and I found the exams to be inadequate in testing what we learned and very random in content. This makes it very hard to know what to study for\/expect. For the two exams to be such a large percentage of your grade (60%), I feel there should be more resources to prepare. \r\nOn the topic of professionality, the biggest problem I had with this course was the organization and teaching ability of the teaching staff. I felt topics they expected us to know were always very unclear. In review sessions for exams, it was common for the TAs to not give clear answers to students' questions, not to answer questions at all, or to disagree with each other on the answer for questions. This makes it very difficult to know what answer they are seeking and what is fact and what is false. I often felt like the TAs did not know the answer to students' questions in review sessions so they would beat around the bush until they felt we were satisfied. Overall, this course needs very serious work and reconstruction. This course could benefit from looking at the organization and abundant resources of other courses - such as Econ 115.",
                "Strengths: Scholl is pretty engaging with demos so you won't fall asleep. Also the material is pretty universally interesting (aside from a few topics)",
                "Strengths: get insight into many different disciplines of cognitive science. Brian Scholl is a big strength as well\r\nWeaknesses: don't get much feedback on what you do because it's such a big class",
                "Strengths: great teacher, okay topics\r\nImprovements: very hard exams that don't stand in line with the rather relaxed teaching approach",
                "I think that the course has very interesting content and I like that it touches on all the different domains that play a role in cognitive science, but I also believe that there was a lack of organization to the course so it was a bit hard to follow why we were learning the things we were learning\/how to apply it.",
                "Strengths: Brian is a great lecturer, the exams were not bad at all, the reading questions were also a good way to direct our readings. The TAs were also very helpful in office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture slides were often bare because they didn't load the pictures, and so if you weren't there for lecture you could be completely lost when studying for the exams unless you ask a friend for notes.",
                "I really liked the way Professor Scholl lectured. Lectures were engaging and energetic, and I never struggled to pay attention. Sometimes the organization of a lecture wasn't the greatest, and it would be hard to connect the dots on why examples were included.",
                "Prof Scholl definitely succeeded in making the field of cog sci sound very interesting, but that came at the expense of actually teaching us cog sci.",
                "The course is very interesting and many things seemed practical.",
                "strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: why does Professor Scholl post the slides in black and white with all the important parts removed? It just feels cruel. I know he's trying to incentivize students to come to class, but at a certain point, we should be allowed to review the full material.\r\nLittle to no feedback. TAs do not return midterm paper until after the semester ends, which is stressful. It would clearly benefit students to know roughly how well they're doing in the class before taking the final exam. It's things like this that make the professor-student dynamic feel a little antagonistic.",
                "Strengths: material and lectures were very interesting and engaging, and the material was very real and observable in daily life. Weaknesses: course was formatted so that a student's standing was very unclear, a few large assignments make up the whole grade and it is very hard to know how you are doing in the course, this class could benefit from weekly quizzes or some sort of assessment other than the midterm and final.",
                "Strengths: interesting lecture content \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the exam questions were strange and not related to your knowledge of the course material, very difficult to know how to study for the exams",
                "I think this course covers a little too much material. The instructor has to go through everything pretty quickly despite having built in catch up days (which was a great idea). I also wish that when he posted the slides we could just have the whole slide instead of the powerpoint without the images from class. I really wish this class had section: it would be a lot easier to make sure that you have a good grasp on what can be some very confusing, abstract information. Finally, I think it's a little unfair that we didn't get our final paper grades back before the final exam. I understand that the TFs were busy writing the exam, but for people considering credit d-ing the class, you had to make your decision based off of your midterm exam grade.\r\n\r\nI thought the exams were very well-formatted with the questions you could \"skip\" and the questions were very effective at testing your knowledge. Additionally, while I don't think they're entirely necessary, I think the reading responses were simple enough and an effective way to make sure that everyone was keeping up with the readings.",
                "The lectures were AMAZING. Professor Scholl is a very engaging lecturer. The content was interesting and felt well-organized. It was a good blend of concepts and case studies. The only part of the class that I disliked was the readings. The reading questions weren't a problemthey kept me accountablebut I only enjoyed maybe two of the readings themselves. It felt counterproductive to be assigned long, dense, complicated readings that I doubt anyone in the class could understand. If we're meant to learn anything from the readings, we should be given readings that are comprehendible by undergraduate students. The impenetrability of the very scientific, technical readings made me enjoy the class less and I didn't gain anything from them. The readings that were possible to understand were very interesting, though.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Scholl was a good lecturer, and the workload was manageable and well-spaced. Weaknesses: sometimes it was difficult to bridge the very abstract concepts we discussed with the very specific examples that Prof. Scholl provided in lecture, though I suppose some of this is due to the fact that the field of cognitive science itself is so messy. The lecture slides that Prof. Scholl posts also are missing a lot of content, which makes it difficult to refer back to them while studying for the exams. I had a bit of a moment of panic before the midterm because I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to have taken away from the course so far.",
                "Other than question based review sessions led by TAs, there arent many resources to prepare for exams. Exams are half short answer and graded by TFs.",
                "Strength: this class covers a wide variety of issues and provides an overview of the field of cognitive science. Professor Scholl is a very engaging lecturer. Robert and Kim are also incredibly helpful and patient. This really drills the fundamental assumptions of cognitive science in you (e.g. instinct blindness) and prepares you well if you want to engage with the discipline more in-depth in the future. \r\n \r\nWeakness: due to the introductory nature of the course, sometimes the material feels scattered and you would have to piece everything together on your own. There was little feedback except during midterm\/final\/paper, so it was hard to gauge your own understanding halfway through the semester.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and readings (Every reading comes with a reading response that is graded pass\/fail). I did not enjoy the exams. It was HARD to study without good notes as the slides were hard to understand.",
                "A strength of the class is that the material was overall very engaging and interesting. However, there are many weaknesses. Firstly, a lecture class such as this one should have discussion groups. Secondly, the homework readings were quite lengthy and, in my opinion, ranged over too many topics and didn't always engage readers or always have any direct relevance to the lecture materials. Thirdly, there was absolutely no helpful information given in terms of studying for the midterm. The professor refused to give any old practice midterms or a clear sense of what materials to study. This was very frustrating when trying to figure out how to go about preparing for the midterm.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI liked how this course covered topics that were relevant and up to date; everything we learned was something that I could personally experience and understand, or was a recent news headline. The activities that we had in class were also really fun, as we got to interact with our classmates and discover something amazing about ourselves as humans together.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAlthough I loved having the low level of homework we did in this class, I wished the homework assignments were more related to test content and varied. Long readings and reading questions did not really help me at all on my midterms, final paper, or finals at all. I feel like the homework, despite being interesting and relevant to the class, should be more focused on certain subjects or at least appear more on the tests we receive in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Scholl is an engaging lecturer, and the topics are naturally quite interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Dont go into much depth into any topic given the nature of an intro course, and it can be difficult to know whats important to study for the midterm\/final",
                "Strengths: interesting content and engaged teaching fellows\r\nWeaknesses: Slides and readings were extremely unhelpful for learning the content; they were either unrelated to or covered only the smallest fraction of what would be covered on the exams. The only helpful resource was what the instructor said during lectures, but the lectures weren't recorded. Content rarely related back to an overarching theme; it seemed as if the content was based simply on random, unrelated, and specific things that the instructor found interesting. Exam questions were poorly worded and did not test the students' knowledge of the content, but rather their ability to navigate complicated questions. The paper prompt was extremely vague and unhelpful, even though the grading was harsh. Course also did not utilize Canvas, which was frustrating. Nothing in this class was straightforward.",
                "Strengths: Amazing sense of humor from Scholl, lectures are fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Course is disorganized and grading in exams is all-or-nothing (basically no partial credit on short answers, and you don't get points unless you say exact words or phrases). So if you are unlucky (like me), you might get your lowest grade ever in the midterm.",
                "better feedback better grading (really not fair) also not great we only had one grade in the book before credit\/d\/fail passed",
                "The material is interesting, but we go through it all really quickly and don't spend much time ensuring students understand it. I think learning during lecture was fun and intriguing, but the exams do not entirely reflect what we learned.",
                "Strengths: lectures were conducted well, and exam structure was perfect\r\nWeaknesses: readings were often extremely hard to read\/understand",
                "Brians lectures are engaging and hilarious. Its hard to get bored during class, which says a lot considering this is a huge 75-minute lecture class in Marsh. However, the lectures are so disorganized and even confusing to the point that in order to really understand *anything*, you *must* go to office hours to have things clarified. In this regard, its hard to say what the class will be like next year when Brian goes on leave. Lastly, the final paper (a thought paper) is quite nebulous and not well-defined. Still, the material is extremely interesting and has so many applications both to other academic disciplines as well as in real life.",
                "professor scholl is an amazing professor, however his slides are impossible to follow and really disorganized and that made it very hard to study for the exams",
                "The course succeeded in that the material had much potential to be very interesting and the TAs tried to be very helpful and explain concepts taught in a very confusing manner during class. While I was most excited for this class going into the semester, it struggled in connecting the multiple disciplines it claimed to connect, the Professor was very difficult to follow with his examples not having clear connections to class topics and no resources to help if something was missed during class as the slides shared supposedly to help us were missing a great portion of key information. Another weakness was the feeling that the Professor did not seem to be rooting for us",
                "not very in-depth; could be better structured; lack of materials to refer to",
                "Strengths: this has been taught for 20+ years so it has been very polished. Prof Scholl is a very engaging lecturer and this is like a giant series of TED talks on cogsci. \r\nWeaknesses: very difficult to study for, you never know what level of detail you need to know and since Prof Scholl goes on and on in lecture without informative power point slides, it takes a long time to study.",
                "Strengths: great readings\r\nWeaknesses: not enough coherence, no discussion sections",
                "Strengths: Good introduction into cognitive science. Weakness: Introduces you to the major, but doesnt really connect to futuristic applications that are relevant to a college student (i.e. what are jobs, research, etc you can get with this knowledge). Also, the midterms\/finals are really disorganized and its hard to study for.",
                "strengths: interesting lectures, covers a wide array of topics (breadth over depth that makes it suitable as an introductory class) \r\nweaknesses: YSB is too far away from main campus",
                "The course was extremely engaging but I think sometimes Professor Scholl sacrificed clarity in content for the sake of being engaging. In other words, the class was very fun but the content wasnt always explained super well. You wouldnt realize how confusing something actually is until the review sessions where you learn so much more content or the exam where you realize you didnt understand it as well as you thought.",
                "Strengths: Brian is a great instructor who made the lectures fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a HUGE class; sometimes you feel like you are just learning random facts from here and there since there's a lack of cohesiveness in the way it is taught; the exams are very hard, given this lack of cohesiveness.",
                "strengths: topics, level of engagement\r\nweaknesses: some readings felt very very unnecessary\/more simple explanations would do, especially as the course went on",
                "I thought it was cool information but it was not at all organized",
                "Strength: some materials are quite interesting, and the lecturer Professor Scholl is experienced enough to string together all the materials.\r\nWeakness: most materials are shallow, so while they are interesting, I do not find them thought-provoking. Moreover, we receive no feedback on our learning. Reading responses are graded as pass\/fail, and the essay is returned after the semester ends and little help \/ workshopping is offered. We do not have anything returned in the middle of the semester.",
                "Strength was the lectures. They were very engaging which was unexpected considering the stigma that lecture courses can be dull and impersonal. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the organization of the course. Many times I feel like I didn't grasp the main idea of the lecture because we would go off on tangents.",
                "difficult to note down all the necessary information during lectures as professor Scholl spoke quite fast and the slides didn't contain all the valuable information.",
                "Strengths: interesting, lectures werent boring\r\nWeaknesses: first, lectures arent recorded because the prof doesnt care about the extenuating circumstances we might run into during a COVID pandemic. (For real though this was a stupid policy given the 120+ students and the fact that ppl were unable to go to lecture when they had covid).",
                "The only critique I would give is that taking the pictures out of the lecture slides before posting them makes them really, really difficult to use to study from later.",
                "strengths: fascinating lectures, good professor, very interesting material, lots of cool opportunities where we got to experience illusions and examples of instinct blindness\r\nweaknesses: sometimes unclear guidelines and expectations on assessments with not enough feedback given; TAs expected very specific answers; final exam was much harder than the first; slides handed out after class were pretty bare and did not have all information presented in leture",
                "The largest weakness of this course is that the only material we had to study from was our own notes from class. If we missed a simple fact from class we would not be able to understand because the slides posted were missing information and images. I do not understand why classes could not be recorded for students to have more time to understand. A strength of this course was having the final early.",
                "Very poor feedback system. Good level of enjoyable engagement during course.",
                "Lecture was really engaging and interesting. Some of the readings (papers in journals) were quite dense\/jargony and hard to parse though.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Scholl is a great, engaging lecturer. The course content material is super interesting and applicable to a lot of different fields of study.\r\nWeaknesses: By nature of being an introductory course, the scope is broad and shallow. Prof. Scholl has a very eclectic and chaotic lecture style, which keeps it engaging and fun, but it's very difficult to grasp the message he is trying to say.",
                "Weakness: While the slides are uploaded online, Professor Scholl tends to not read off the slides and gives a lot of information in person, so it's hard to catch up if you miss a day and you'll need to get a friend's notes. Sometimes things are missing on the slides as well.",
                "This is an extremely fascinating course, the content is extremely fascinating, but this is easily the worst course I have ever taken at Yale. It is not structured for learning. As a person, I think that the course is strong in that it's genuine information everyone should know and expose themselves to at college. As a student, I cannot say the same, and think that this course is incredibly weak in it's design, does not reflect student exposure to material, and does not reward students for challenging themselves. It may be an inherent flaw in such a large lecture, but at the same time, I have taken other large lectures that did not make me feel as awful as this one did.",
                "Very engaging and interesting, more structure would have been nice",
                "I think the main weakness of the course was the complexity of the readings - they were often very difficult to understand. However, whenever Prof Scholl went over the readings in the next class, they made sense when compared to his lesson. When they were randomly included I had no idea what to gain from them.",
                "Due to this being a large lecture course, there is not as much individual engagement without attending office hours but the readings offered a good introduction into the course material before class time and the questions allowed me to think about what we were learning in a new way. The structure of the course was very organized which I appreciated. I think a more direct understanding of how to approach the exams could improve the course as students improve from the midterm to the final because they are more familiar with the types of questions.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Scholl. His lectures are incredible and I loved learning from him. However, studying for exams could be tedious because he did not like to record lectures or upload the full contents of his slides (he uploaded most tests but left out some images. This made studying more difficult because the majority of the lectures relied on the images). I believe Professor Scholl likely wants to keep kids engaged in his course and have them show up to lectures which is why the recordings \/ slides are more bare than other classes. While I understand this, it would be nice if he could upload recordings \/ full slides 2-3 days before the exam. This makes sure that students come to his lecture while also giving the resources necessary to study the material which is almost solely included the lectures.",
                "Strengths: great teaching style, fascinating material, thought-provoking and reasonable length reading questions; really appreciated the final paper assignment-- thought it encouraged creativity and really got me to think- it was a challenge but I learned a lot. Weaknesses: Some of the readings are just too long-- I wanted to read them, but there just isn't enough time to read 2 50-page readings between a Tuesday and a Thursday. I would have appreciated shorter readings or more guidance on which parts of the readings were essential and which were supplemental for my own aggrandizement; TA's did not provide post-submission feedback on final essay to all students, only by request; while Brian was accessible after class and via email, I think it would be really useful if he had scheduled office hours, as this provides an opportunity for more in depth discussion without the barrier to entry of having to schedule your own meeting with Brian or holding people up on line behind you.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very engaging and interesting and topics covered were very interesting \r\nweaknesses: I did not enjoy having to write the thought paper, seemed kind of meaningless, reading responses were also repetitive and boring, would have preferred writing fewer but longer and more in-depth responses.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting material, engaging professor, relatively small workload. Biweekly readings that corresponded with the material we discussed in class to provide greater insights.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not something that anyone could control, but I would have loved for this class to have a discussion section since the general class is so large!",
                "Strengths: Super interesting material and examples! I also really enjoyed the class environment--it's a large lecture so you can just enjoy sitting by friends without worrying about having something prepared to say. Professor Scholl made it feel pretty fun\/informal at times and made jokes throughout class that kept us engaged.\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would have been really helpful to have the slides available BEFORE class so that we can download\/print them beforehand and minimize note-taking during class. More importantly, it would be REALLY HELPFUL to include on the posted slides the PHOTOS\/GRAPHIC MATERIAL that we covered in class!!!!! In the first half of the semester, I did not take extremely thorough notes because we were assured that slides would be available after class. However, when we finally got to see those slides, half of them would be blank and I couldn't remember what we covered in class for those slides because I didn't have time in class to write down everything I was looking at. Even if it would be \"too difficult\" to post the full versions of the powerpoints with the photos\/videos, then it could've been helpful to have access to last year's lectures (assuming they were recorded). We never really got any kind of study guide or concrete list of topics that we were expected to know for the exams. We didn't get any practice questions for the exams either because \"we might not have covered the same exact things that were covered in previous years\". So I think the combination of slides being posted \"late\" (never available before class), many slides being blank when they were finally posted, and a lack of delineated expectations for exams left me a little confused throughout this class. I felt better about the final exam because I wrote extremely thorough notes during the second half of the semester, taking note of the photos we saw on slides and basically copying down every word Professor Scholl said. \r\nAdditionally, it would have been nice to receive our midterm exam results BEFORE the course drop deadline, and our final paper results BEFORE the credit\/d deadline!!!!",
                "The way it is taught. The lectures are jam packed which is great, but it is impossible to study for. The professor says during class \"don't take notes it'll all be uploaded\", but the slides are not in their original form and don't include things like in class thought experiments which are like half the class. Even the TAs during the study sessions weren't able to answer questions because they said they didn't have access to the course information in its original form. It is a little ambitious to think we can remember small niche sub points within every topic just because we learnt it once in class. My TA was amazing though.",
                "Weaknesses: The professor is not understanding. He teaches the class in a very disorganized way and is not kind. The grade distribution is so strange and they dont make any accommodations for sickness or covid.",
                "This course covered a broad range of topics and provided a good introduction to students who want to learn more about cognitive science. However, the course is disorganized and hard to follow along with. There is not much of a clear connection between the concepts taught in the course, and the readings are all over the place. Additionally, students were given little to no feedback throughout the semester on their reading responses and overall comprehension of the course material. The first actual test or form of practice that students were provided with was the midterm, and students weren't even given the option to look at previous exams for practice and had no way of knowing how they should approach their study plan. It could be improved by making clearer connections between topics, giving students feedback and allowing for more personalized learning(there were no discussion sections), and allowing for practice before exams.",
                "-there should have been more tfs so that the number of students assigned to each would be less and more attention would be paid to those students\r\n-Professor Scholl was an awesome professor and he made the content more interesting than it actually is.\r\n-there could be more midterms or tests for students to know their academic standing other than 1 midterm and 1 final\r\n-there could have been more constructive feedback provided to students",
                "Strengths: pretty low workload, engaging and entertaining lectures, prof Scholl is very passionate about cognitive science, guest lectures were cool\r\nWeaknesses: lack of feedback (which is understandable in a class so large but it still a weakness), prof scholls complete lack of respect for religion (read Christianity because its the only religion hed talk about). Everyones entitled to their own beliefs but dont be disrespectful to those who dont believe the same as you",
                "I think the class slides should contain more notes and that the exam questions should be less focused on the less significant topics we cover in class",
                "This course is very interesting, but it was a bit difficult to follow. The lectures are very fast and though the slides are posted online, they are often the bare bones and dont include all of the information given during the lecture. This, in conjunction with the fairly substantial amount of reading without much guidance on how or what to study or what would be on the exam made it really frustrating to try and re-engage with the material after the fact and prepare for the final assignment or exams. I went to the review sessions and the review sessions were Q&A based, so it was only based on questions we had, which I think often made it much more difficult because we didnt know what to ask and the questions would get very obscure and specific and it was very very difficult to connect everything and properly prepare. I also felt that the TFs disagreed with each other or were also not given access to a sufficient amount of information in regards to exam review to properly give us feedback to help us prepare. I did gain good insight from the review sessions specifically focused on a couple of the problem-solving questions, but this was only a fraction of what was actually on the course. While it is difficult to get feedback from every student in a several-hundred student lecture, I think it would have been beneficial to have a poll, even if it was just once before major assignments to see if there could be specific areas that we could have additional review sections on or just to be pointed in the right direction in terms of resources.",
                "All of the information presented in the lectures was extremely interesting however, it seemed to be sort of disorganized. Although this apparent disorganization could have been due to the nature of cognitive science as a field of study, I was often unsure about the material I was responsible for.",
                "All of the following strengths can be perceived as weaknesses for a few people (and some of my classmates did complain about the very things I liked about the class, so I would qualify my recommendations.)\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nBRIAN SCHOLL: Brian Scholl is by far the strongest point of the class; he's an excellent, excellent teacher and his lectures introduce and explain concepts extremely well, following a solid structure that is peppered in with his own personal touch\/anecdotes\/idiosyncrasies. Attending class generally meant having a good time for me and my friends (we did sit towards the front,) as the lectures have plenty of jokes alongside real-life case-studies of visual illusions or Prisoner's Dilemma games. If anyone did have any doubts\/further questions, Professor Scholl would field all questions after the lecture and give each student their due time and answer.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the material: I personally appreciated being introduced to the wide variety of ideas that fall under the umbrella of cognitive science; some people don't like that it doesn't cover a lot of material in a ton of depth. I would say that as an Intro class, it most definitely provides a solid introduction to the field of cognitive science, especially to those people considering a CogSci Major.\r\n\r\nThe TFs! The TFs were really nice, and I fully recommend going to them to round out your understanding of the course content.\r\n\r\nGrading\/Courseload\r\nThe load for this class was rather chill, with only a paragraph worth of reading responses being required every week. There were two in-class exams and one 10-page final paper due before thanksgiving break.",
                "Strengths: introduces a unique perspective on the worldit kind of feels like reading a really great non-fiction book.=; Interesting readings; very clear about grading; very generous curve (but it may not be as generous next time the class is offered)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it uses a class website rather than canvas and using canvas would be easier; aspects of exams and assignments were sometimes unclear",
                "For whatever reason, the professor hates canvas and insists we use his own site. However, this site is actually awful and makes finding readings and resources extremely difficult. Moreover, grading is wonky, lacks transparency, and takes a while to get anything back. By the credit\/d\/f deadline, you only have your Midterm score back and you don't get the final or paper score back until after the class is over. Not helpful for knowing your progress!\r\n\r\nOther than those fixable admin issues, the course is very interesting and enjoyable. Would still recommend.",
                "I feel as though the evaluation and grading of the course is really hard to prepare for.",
                "This class was not the best. The content of the course was very interesting, and in theory, the structure was supposed to be engaging. I thought that the way we were assigned direct publications on the most cutting-edge research as readings, instead of chapters from a textbook, was particularly creative. The course, however, was so disorganised, a lot of the topics were poorly explained and feedback was unclear that it was almost impossible to learn anything.",
                "Strengths: successfully covers a broad range of topics in a cohesive way\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could have used a discussion section to make sure that the important themes from lectures were clearly communicated to students and to allow students to ask more questions to their TA's, the class did not have enough TA's",
                "Because there are so many disciplines within cognitive science it is very difficult to gain a holistic understanding of each individual discipline. I understand that this is the crux of introduction to cognitive science however I felt for somethings they were not given enough attention due to the lack of time.",
                "The content and the delivery of the lectures were extremely interesting and engaging. I personally enjoyed the breadth of the topics covered, as it really gave a comprehensive world tour of the entire field.",
                "The course was able to offer a lot of material in a condensed fashion through the lecturing style, though a very hands-off approach was taken with regard to reviewing the material.",
                "This course was well organized and the syllabus allowed for us to spend some more time on material that was interesting. The course did a great job of allowing us to delve into topics that interested us individually. The one thing I think was a weakness was the vagueness of the final paper. It was really hard to figure out what was expected as the criteria was rather subjective.",
                "Prof. Scholl is an entertaining lecturer, and is highly knowledgeable about the subject! The broad, interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science makes each lecture unique and different; the emphasis is on breadth, not depth.",
                "Strengths: Prof Scholl - a great lecturer whose classes were genuinely entertaining. Light workload - just a reading question before each class along with the two exams and a paper. Exams are manageable if you budget the time (maybe 12 hrs in total?) to study.\r\nWeaknesses: Your success (on the exams - 60% of your grade) depends almost entirely on your ability to take comprehensive notes. Exam and paper grading is fair though, and everything tested on the exams was explicitly taught in lecture."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student!",
                "Not if you do not have to take it. Or take it with another professor. Or if you like to be stressed out.",
                "Absolutely! Speaking as a computer science major who has taken this class, I think there this class something to be gained for everyone. This course really leads one to marvel at both the commonplace but extraordinary feats of human cognition as well as its many eyeopening and fascinating limitations. I have learned more about myself than any other class I have taken. A must-take for anyone remotely interested in the scientific evidence behind aspects of human nature and how our minds work.",
                "Yes, this was a very manageable, interesting course. Without regular assessment, it does lend itself to not studying until right up when the exams are, but this of course is a personal choice. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a broad survey of cognitive science, with the possibility of delving deeper into any given topic that Prof. Scholl addresses.",
                "no. not at all. if its taught by the same professor, no.",
                "I think it is a good intro course, however, there are better courses to take at Yale for a psychology credit and would recommend something else in that case.",
                "If you are planning to study cognitive science or psychology, take this course. Otherwise, it's not worth the stress and workload.",
                "It's interesting to learn about the field of cog sci since a lot of other fields utilize cog sci research. If you don't need it for your major, I might suggest taking it credit D and just go for the learning experience. I took it as a 5th credit and the workload was manageable. Check out the strengths and weaknesses though because there are some really disappointing parts of this class.",
                "Only to students interested in Cognitive Science or Neuroscience because I think it does provide a lot of base knowledge that is important for those fields.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in cognitive science\/gaining a very broad understanding of what the field looks like.",
                "Not really. As a prospective CogSci major, this class nearly put me off pursuing it entirely.",
                "Sure -- if you're interested in the cog sci major, it's worth checking out. If you're not looking at the major, understand that this (because it's a survey course) may not be the most efficient way to pursue topics of interest (ex. I personally really hate linguistics, but did have to sit through a week of lectures on it, which is not a fault of the course but a misalignment of my personal interest with the goals of the course).",
                "Yes, you get to learn and read about a lot of interesting topics that are relevant to anyone.",
                "I would take this class if you are able to sit in a lecture and change the way you think about things. I felt like this class moved very quickly as there was so much covered in one lecture that it was almost overwhelming. With that being said, time flew in this class because everything was really interesting.",
                "No I would not if Brian Scholl is the professor, unless you are majoring in cognitive science. If you are good luck.",
                "NO. Honestly, I advise everyone I talk to about courses to not take this class. It was not what I thought I signed up for. This is the worst class I have taken at Yale, and I am truly disappointed because it was the one I was most excited for for the semester. This class is very interesting, but overall the quality of teaching staff and the lack of resources make it not worth it. This class is a headache that you don't want to deal with. Additionally, if you get sick you will become very behind and it will be hard to catch up with the lack of recorded classes and accurate slides. Do not take this class if you want a course with adequate resources and organization.",
                "This is absolutely NOT a gut. The exams are pretty hard, and you are tested on lots of tiny details as well as things from the many readings. Take it for your major or if you're genuinely interested.",
                "Yes, it was a very interesting class and covers many topics so it is a great intro class",
                "I would not recommend it. It wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. The topics were advertised well but e.g. using fish to talk about sex and attractions wasn't the most exciting thing in my opinion. Could have been done better by using examples relevant to the audience that would make studying more enjoyable. Workload okay but readings extremely boring.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the content is interesting, but I would warn them that the organization of the course is a bit lacking and I don't really think the grade you receive in the class reflects how well you learned the material\/can apply it because the tests were not very well designed in my opinion.",
                "Yes, definitely take this course. The workload was pretty light despite the fact that it was a lecture course with 2 exams. There are no PSETs, and if you pay attention in class and don't fall asleep, you will do very well in this class.",
                "If you are interested in cognitive science and want a general understanding of the field of study it is perfect.",
                "WHAT I WISH I KNEW BEFORE TAKING THIS CLASS: Prof Scholl is funny and tries hard to make the lectures interesting. As an unfortunate result of that, no true content is really taught. I have no idea what I learned this semester, which made studying for the midterm and final not a fun experience at all. My biggest piece of advice is to voice record the lectures, because what he says is often more important than what's written on the slides (which he posts, but most are blank because he only keeps the text not the pictures). The reading responses are annoying but you can get away with not doing most of the readings. The curve is not awful and it's not incredibly hard to do decently well in this class, but I would describe the semester as frustrating because the lectures are so disorganized (you can't tell the difference between an important example and a useless tangent) and it felt like he prioritized making cog sci seem interesting over actually teaching us concrete knowledge. I personally would not have taken this class if it weren't a requirement for the major, but it's probably worth it if you don't expect to take away much.",
                "Yes! Very interesting topics for people interested in neuro\/psych.",
                "Yes! Very interesting. Obviously good to take if you have any interest in the CogSci major, but also good for general knowledge. And fun.",
                "Yes! Cognitive Science is an extremely interesting field and if you have the chance to take intro with Professor Scholl, do it!",
                "Yes! Lectures were a lot of fun and very interesting. The readings are annoying but the lectures make it worth it. You will learn a lot.",
                "Yes! I found the content interesting, and Prof. Scholl is a pretty entertaining lecturer. The workload is totally manageable and well-spaced, and it's a good introduction to the field of cognitive science. It is a survey, so we cover a lot of information and don't go that into depth in many areas.",
                "You would reap the most out of this course if you had no prior experience with psychology\/cognitive science at all. If you do, you will need to be proactive by talking to TAs or really going more in-depth into the issue at hand to make the best use of your time.",
                "Hmm idk. I was a very interesting class, but the readings were dense and harder to read and Professor Scholl does not prepare you for the exams (and takes no responsibility for his role in the class' performance). However, if you stay ahead on studying and reading, and pay attention to small detail (even if you think it's insignificant, then you should be fine.",
                "I would, but only because the lectures were interesting. If you do not enjoy the first couple of lectures, drop the course as it won't get much better. Be ready for an awkwardly structured course not designed to facilitate learning.",
                "No. Despite the fact that the course material was interesting, the course itself was a mess in terms of the curriculum. Pretty much we learn whatever the professor finds interesting\/relevant.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course, only if they were willing to accept an extremely \"breadthy\" style of class instead of going into a topic in depth. This was highlighted by the instructor too. This class was fun to take because it was so relevant to us as humans.",
                "This is definitely not a easy gut fifth class. If you are looking for easy social science credit, you shouldn't take this class. I have a few friends who ended up cr\/d'ing this class.",
                "No, unless they were planning on majoring in cognitive science.",
                "Not unless you have to or Credit D Fail. Even after this class, I cannot explain to a student \"What did I learn?\" due to the disorganized nature of curriculum. The grading in midterms and finals are all-or-nothing, which can lead to brutal unsalvagable grade situations.",
                "Yes, the material is good for any student to know.",
                "If interested then yes",
                "Id recommend the course to a student whos looking for a huge lecture class with a very light workload in terms of homework but who is willing to put in the time to attend office hours every week (as is necessary to do well in this class; this class is a gut in terms of homework but NOT an easy A in terms of exams). Id also recommend the course to anyone who finds the course description interesting; cognitive science is fascinating stuff!",
                "yes, i learned a lot of super interesting things, however you have to collaborate with other students to actually understanding the material for the exams. \r\nprofessor scholl is an amazing lecturer, but could improve a bit as a professor",
                "I would not recommend this course because it is similar to psyc 110, but psych 110 is taught much better",
                "the problems of intro classes are alike; take it only if you're really into it",
                "If you want an introduction to cogsci then yes! This is a survey course and not a deep dive, but definitely a great introduction to the subject!",
                "probably not (ubnless they were considering the CogSci major) just because I feel like I didn't REALLY gain a better understanding of the various subcomponents of CogSci, nor was it fully explained just how they all fit together in a way that felt satisfying to me",
                "Yes, I would recommend! Especially if you are interested in exploring a newer and developing field that has to do with every aspect of human nature.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning what cognitive science is about. The class helps you understand why cog sci (the interdisciplinary study of the mind) is necessary as opposed to just studying the individual disciplines within cog sci",
                "It is a required course for CogSci majors of course. It is fun, but definitely NOT a gut. Take it if you're interested in having an introduction to what cog sci as a field is.",
                "Honestly no",
                "Probably not.",
                "I would recommend if you need this class for a prerequisite. It's not an easy A like others might assume. This felt like an unorganized class for me which didn't really match my learning style.",
                "yes",
                "yes, interesting and good work load",
                "No, save yourself the trouble. This isnt a gut. Tests and essays are graded harshly. And the tests were unreasonably hard (even the TAs confirmed that they had struggled to do the test). On both the midterm and final exams, short answer questions had to be precise (if you had any wording that was off youd lose all your points or if you didnt say exactly the right thing youd not get points at all) and a majority of MC had choices that were deliberately hard to choose between. This is also one of those classes where your grade is mostly dependent on only a few assignments, so dont take it if you perform better with more assignments\/feedback.",
                "This class was really fun. It definitely takes a broad but shallow approach, so if that's what someone is looking for then its for them.",
                "yes! extremely interesting material with a great professor. exams are a bit of a surprise, though.",
                "Yes, it was enjoyable.",
                "Would highly recommend, lecture is really entertaining (Prof. Scholl is really engaging and funny), and some of the topics are fascinating. You'll see that we (as people) aren't quite like what we seem to be.",
                "I would recommend if you're into the course material or this is required. The exams are surprisingly difficult, and the final essay you write is pretty harshly graded.",
                "YES! Every lecture was interesting, and Professor Scholl was as engaging as he could be in a class that large. Some of the topics were so interesting that it made me shift course for my thesis research; now I'm involved with a new lab that wasn't even on my radar before taking this class thanks to Professor Scholl. The reading response assignments for each class could be annoying but were completely manageable, and a good way to ensure a good course grade.",
                "No, I would tell students to run away. It's not worth the frustration.",
                "Yes, very interesting",
                "Yes. It was very interesting material and Prof Scholl is a good lecturer. It was also cool to see real world applications.",
                "I would highly recommend this course as it was really interesting to learn about the mind in a new way.",
                "Yes. Taking this course made me look at social interactions and almost everything we do in a new light.",
                "OMG YES!  I almost didn't shop CGSC 110, but am so glad I did, because it was by far my FAVORITE course during my first semester at Yale! Even on my tiredest day, I was rapt with attention every moment of this class, something I definitely cannot say for my other classes. I would recommend this course hands down- you will learn so much that is relevant to daily life and how we understand ourselves, regardless of whether you are a cog sci major.",
                "No unless you absolutely have to take this course.",
                "Yes, interesting topics and lectures, and fair exams. No feedback was given on essays, the only downside.",
                "Yes, learned a lot of cool stuff. This class gave a brief introduction to many different topics in cog sci",
                "Definitely! If you're thinking about studying cognitive science, psychology, or are just interested in human behavior, this is a great class to take. Because of how many students take this course, you in a lot of ways get out of it what you put into it. If you engage with the readings and lectures, you'll learn some really cool things that you can apply to a lot of other aspects of life!",
                "I would recommend this course for the very interesting material and fun classroom environment, but be aware that you probably have to take very thorough notes during class because slides aren't posted ahead of time, many slides are blank when they finally are posted, and there is no extra study material available for the exams.",
                "Not really. For the points mentioned above.",
                "DO NOT TAKE IT. Its not a chill intro class. They are so strange and tough with the grading and the Professor is not kind or understanding.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if that student is able to keep themselves well-focused in class and if they know how to go about studying for the exam. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. As someone who has a really short attention span and can't be focused for long periods of time, this course was difficult for me. I often rely on homework, textbook readings, and practice questions to help me learn the material, and we had little of those, so I couldn't keep up very well. If someone else also has this issue with focusing, then I anticipate the class would also be difficult for them. But, if someone is able to easily keep themselves on track and not fall behind, then I think that taking this course would be beneficial for them.",
                "Yes if they are able to look for outside resources to facilitate their learning. No, if they just want a chill class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would especially recommend it to those considering a major in cognitive science or the subdisciplines of cognitive science (psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, econ). I think youll walk away from this class with a pretty clear understanding of whether you want to major in cognitive science or not. But Id also recommend it to those not considering a major in cogsci or its subdisciplines simply because understanding how the mind works is so important and cogsci has implications for all of us. My friends who took the class and werent cogsci majors enjoyed it for the most part. But it is NOT a gut. Though about half the class gets As for their final grade I think, you definitely have to study a lot to do well on the exams",
                "Yes, since we find out about the workings of the brain in a fascinating way. We learn about the phenomena present in our everyday lives but which we never questioned.",
                "I think the course itself is definitely a lot of fun, but I found the exams difficult, but not in a fun way. I tried studying in different ways, and sometimes it felt futile when I would see the exam questions and then realize that even trying the different ways of studying, I would have never known to study for that particular question. Especially when the TFs explained that they had to argue for the unfairness or difficult of certain questions, I just felt lost trying to study even though I really paid close attention during lectures and tried my best to organize the notes that I had taken. I think whoever taking this should keep in mind that the information is definitely worth learning about, but just because there isnt a terrible amount of work does not at all mean that the course is easy the decipher. Especially because you will have to keep up with this course in addition to the other courses you are taking.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the mind but I would advise against taking this course if you are a student who is unsettled by courses that lack a clear structure.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to all students, regardless of what major they're considering. It's an excellent class to take your freshman year, as it has a relatively light workload while introducing you to a very interesting field with a great teacher.   Take this!",
                "I would recommend this class, it was a great introduction to cognitive science and changed the way I see about the world, which makes it a perfect class for someone looking for something to broaden their horizons at Yale. I think it also works well as an introduction for more classes in cognitive science, but since it is very general more classes are needed to get really into detail.",
                "Yes, it's a really fun and interesting introductory course. It is not however a free course, if you want an A you have to work in the class to get it.",
                "No, I would not. Despite the content being interesting, the disorganisation ruined this course. There was next to no information on the slides, which was our main resource from which to study, and were almost always published late. A lot of key concepts were rushed through and not explained properly, which resulted in half the class piling up in office hours. The exam format was very frustrating. Instead of testing knowledge, the exams on already nebulous topics were full of trick questions that tested test-taking abilities as opposed to the content itself. I had to spend a ridiculously long time studying for tests, not because I was learning anything, but because I actually had to figure out what the content actually was. Despite doing well in the end, I never had any information about my progress and had no idea what grade to expect.",
                "I would be hesitant to recommend the course to another student. I would tell them that I learned a lot of interesting material, but the examinations and the papers were difficult. I think that the paper prompt was unbelievably vague, and that the exams did not test knowledge of the material, but rather a student's test taking ability. However, the curve is generous, so it is possible to still do well in the class even if the exams are challenging.",
                "No I would not recommend this course to a friend because I feel that you could get a more in-depth understanding of each individual disciplined with more specialized classes rather than a large impersonal introduction course",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This course really made me fall in love with the field of cognitive science and the content taught will really make you see the world in a different way. Professor Scholl is definitely a highlight of the course and made me look forward to the lectures every time.",
                "Yes, this course offers a lot of information about ourselves and how we interact with the world.",
                "Yes, this course is super fascinating!",
                "Yes!",
