    "It helped me to develop an analytical view of the international trade economic models that exist. Also, I developed the criteria to agree or disagree the statements that economists discuss.",
    "I learned how to better speak in groups and write on economic subjects.",
    "I have developed analytical skills. I now can think critically on many research papers, because I have acquired knowledge that helps me decide whether or not a statement is correct. I have learnt about many interesting topics that didn't come up to often in my mind.  I also realized that certain policies or decisions have major impacts on not only the participants, but on the whole world.",
    "I learned different trade theories and how trade can affect a country's GDP",
    "I have learnt theories in international economics in this course. Though I have heard of some of them before, I gained new understandings of them, which is of great help to my further study. The homework of this course is also beneficial. Writing review paper is a new experience for me, and my critical thinking really got practiced during the process. In addition, the papers assigned in this course are helpful. Some are classical ones and some deal with current issues. I've gained lots of knowledge and increased my reading ability throughout this course."

   "comments": [
    "As a foreign student, I read the papers at an slower pace and a few of them were hard to fully understand; that is something that I have to work on. On the other hand, I could understand all the models taught in class. I consider that my strength.",
    "The strengthens of the course are that is covers very controversial and interesting topics that make the student curious.  \r\nThe weakness of the course is that it covers much information that a student taking another course in YSS has a hard time keeping up with all the assigned reading material.",
    "too many readings\r\nIt is both strength and weakness.\r\nI personally find hard to read all the papers.\r\nHowever, when I think back, it gave me lots of knowledge.",
    "This course was very thorough and had a lot of readings. The only weakness was the time constraint.",
    "This course is carefully planned and covers lots of important theories and issues in the area of international economics. The problem sets, review papers and the final paper are also properly assigned and we received lots of guidance while doing them. We also had plenty of chance to discuss in class and express our views towards the reading material and I think it will be better if there can be some discussion among students so that we can listen to each others opinion on a certain topic, as long as time permits."

   "comments": [
    "It gives the student the criteria to read academic papers and discuss them.  That is why I recomend this course.",
    "It is hard, but I think I would.",
    "Yes, it opened my eyes in events or issues I didn't really think about in depth. It left in me a lesson: If there is no evidence, it's hard to validate it.  This for me is very important in order to correctly show my opinion.",
    "I'll recommend.\r\nI could read various papers written by famous economists. It was good opportunity to read such a nice papers.",
    "Yes I would recommend this as it is very relevant in our world.",
    "Yes, I will.\r\nThis course is a little bit more challenging than many others, which also means it involves abundant knowledge and reading materials. Students will certainly learn a lot from this summer course if they actively participated in it. The theories are delivered clearly with related real-world cases, and the papers assigned are worth reading."
