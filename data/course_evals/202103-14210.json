                "I gained an understanding of the ways vast histories of global imperialism, racial capitalism, policing, and the carceral system have shaped contemporary realities. I also gained a number of tools of historical research and analysis, including an appreciation for reading primary sources \"against the grain\" and understanding the limitations of state-authored sources while still incorporating them into historical research. HIST 272J also left me a more nuanced perspective on the productivity of including violent \"scenes of subjugation\" into histories.",
                "Instructor was very, very skilled at facilitating our engagement with primary sources and the tools we needed to analyze them! I gained so many skills in terms of comparatively theorizing what empire is in terms of the U.S. and Britain.",
                "I feel better prepared to engage in academic and political discussions about the history and impact of state violence on macro and micro scales. I also feel prepared to do deeper historical research and believe that I have built skills that will help me move towards my thesis.",
                "I learned about the ways in which state violence and imperialism has manifested itself in various forms throughout the creation of the American nation state and other international countries as well.",
                "In this course we learned about the inextricable links between the police, the military, and paramilitary organizations. These insights were really helpful in a) understanding the American Empire and b) highlighting the importance of internationalism in resistance to the state.",
                "Great class understanding pathways of violence and moments of insurgencies",
                "learned a lot about state and colonial violence in the class discussions, research paper was very valuable and interesting experience"

                "The strengths of this seminar include its global perspective, its incredibly fascinating readings, its eye toward contemporary examples of state violence, and its structure, which allowed students to lead and shape seminar discussions each week. Its very few weaknesses include that the global nature of the histories of militia and state violence created some confusion at times because it was difficult to make sure that everyone had the proper historical context about the events we discussed.",
                "Mostly see above! I think we got a lot of good chances to have robust discussions about both history and present-day political events.",
                "I think the greatest strength of this course was the structure of the assignments. Each one built on a prior one and Professor Birkbeck always took time to walk us through the requirements. I had never written a final paper as detailed or long as the one for this class, but I felt comfortable doing so because I had spent the whole semester preparing. I think the some weaknesses were the workload and the discussion. In case of the workload, it would have helped to reduce the amount because all the material was dense. The discussions tended to go back and forth between the time the readings took place and the present, and while this setup was not always a problem, it would help to have more structure.",
                "Strengths: Students were encouraged to lead the discussions, we drove much of the course, the readings were well curated and quite interesting, the emphasis on primary sources was also well thought out \r\n\r\nAreas for improvement: I feel as if the course loss momentum in the middle of semester due to breaks and content, I feel like a reorganization of the themes of the course could be useful to keep students engaged",
                "I think near the beginning of the course, it was harder to have discussions that carried the whole duration, but over time, we were able to adjust and fill the time better through small group activities before main group discussion. I think there were sometimes too many readings that didn't seem cohesive at first, but after discussion made much more sense as to why the professor grouped them together for that week's theme.",
                "The class would serve well in debates; just a two groups of the class selecting sides to argue about would spur discussion in a different way.",
                "there was a lot of reading for each class, and the readings were often pretty dense, but the assigned discussion lead helped to mitigate the confusion/forgetting the readings"
