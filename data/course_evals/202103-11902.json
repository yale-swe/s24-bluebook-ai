                "I suppose each section is taught differently, but the one taught by Dr Su Ji had in-class worksheets which helped tremendously. The structure of the class was less lecture and more problem solving which I found to be very effective in solidifying understanding of concepts. I don't think the pre-class videos were especially necessary, since the classes covered basically the same thing. However, I do admit that watching the pre-class videos would make learning from the class itself a lot easier. It's like going through the same content twice.",
                "Strengths: Well organized, daily videos and quizzes super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: fast paced, but understandable due to lack of class days.",
                "This course needs to do more practice problems during class. i felt as if i taught myself majority of the math in the class and did not fully comprehend the material till it was time to take exams. It was just really fast paced and the videos were basically the classes themselves.",
                "It starts off very quick, but the rigor of the course becomes more comfortable as the course goes on.",
                "The material moves quite fast, but the content is very interesting.",
                "The psets were difficult and took time and assistance to finish. However, they left you prepared for the tests. Additionally, support from peer tutors and professors was readily available.",
                "This could did a wonderful job of facilitating an understanding of multivariable calculus. I wish the tracing styles were more similar throughout the course, but my professor did a wonderful job of ensuring everyone knew all the information.",
                "The flipped classroom structure of the course is great. Learning the concepts through videos that I can pause and rewatch is really helpful, and then being able to apply those concepts in class on practice problems is also helpful.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The guided notes and videos on Canvas were really useful for understanding the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The PSets are extremely long. While they're useful for learning the material, they felt a little pointless overall because of how little they matter for the overall grade.",
                "I wish there were more resources to study the concepts further. I do appreciate the many hours of peer tutoring available.",
                "This class is organized well and the teachers for each section are more than willing to help you work through difficult concepts. Since this class has such high enrollment, more TA office hours, and more specificity in professor office hours, would help students ask questions about the material to gain a better understanding."

Multivariable calculus is applicable in so many situations and in so many professions, and this course gives a very good overview of the essential topics.
