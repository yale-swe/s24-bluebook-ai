                "I learnt how to think about fate and chance in incredibly nuanced and fascinating ways. We read and watched a lot of interesting things I would never have thought of reading or watching myself and I came a long way with respect to my approach to life events and choices.",
                "i learned how to hold philosophical conversations\/musings with more endurance, to really follow into an idea and explore multiple nuances or aspects of an idea that I hadn't thought of. it was a class where listening and consideration of others was really important, so i think i learned lots about social academic experiences and about how elusive human grasp of universal concepts is.",
                "This course is probably the only class I have taken at Yale (as a graduating senior) that I could say has changed my life. It has influenced the way I think about making art, about personal fate and destiny, about the value of choice and free will, the connections between aesthetics and ontology\/existence, and much more. Noreen Khawaja and Sheila Heti are two of the deepest people I have ever had the pleasure of sharing a seminar table with, and the way that their strengths, similarities, and differences mixed in this course was so, so special. This is a class I will be taking with me.",
                "I learned about how to think critically about patterns of behavior, luck, chance, and fate (how different cultures perceive it). I thinks this class was filled with multifaceted people and covered a range of topics from religion to performance to AI to romance. From this semester, I've learned how to (re)interpret situations I am in and to write more honestly about my thoughts on topics with no right answer.",
                "This course was a beautiful and safe space for the class to weave ideas of fate and chance into so many different subjects: AI, love, even RuPaul's Drag Race. I have an entirely new, open outlook with so many more questions I will take with me as I move onward.",
                "The content of each week's discussion was always different. AI. Quantum physics. Names and naming. That was itself a kind of learning for me--I came to recognize the value in seeing the chemical reactions when wildly varied issues are bonded under a series of organizing questions. The center of the discussion always had to with the unchosen, the constrained, and the predetermined. We always took seriously what I would call the \"hypothesis\" of the class: that choice, liberty, and even agency can be a trap. I gained the ability to use these questions as entry points into pretty much any piece of art, criticism, philosophy, or media. On a personal level, I was inspire to completely change the way I think about my future. Ironically enough, I came away inspire to actively choose not choosing in more areas of my life.",
                "This course was essentially about a series of things that interested the professors, which had the advantage of being free-flowing and associative. On the other hand, its not the most well-organized class and it doesnt really develop towards a central point. It really is what you make of it."

                "The material and the discussions were wonderful and enlightening, and Noreen and Sheila made the class what it was with their warmth and passion - we had so much fun!",
                "no immediate critiques come to mind; i really enjoyed the syllabus and the class and our flexibility; now i wish that we had more time !",
                "I have nothing to offer as an improvement for this course. That is not to say the course was always perfectthe instructors were up-front about its experimental naturebut that I would classify it all as a strength. The class learned together, by the end shaping the syllabus as we went, and I feel like I learned much more from this unfolding, from the slight question mark hovering over every class session, than I could have from a perfectly well-oiled syllabus. Our readings and discussions were, without fail, edifying, even if it wasn't always what I expected.",
                "strengths: the atmosphere, questions, and thoughtfulness noreen and sheila brought every class \r\n\r\nweaknesses: i think the class started off a bit unstructured and then became very regimented (tallying how many times we speak). it would have been nice to do the \"expectations of class norms\" activity on day 1 or 2\r\n\r\ni really enjoyed the class and every assignment. i think a possible improvement could be to have checkpoints for the final project and to have dates (more up front) about the essay deadlines",
                "This class was fun. I loved how play was incorporated and taken seriously. Games were used to learn, and learning was treated as a kind of malleable game. The professors made the seminar dynamic: they would introduce new rules for discussion, incorporate electric activities, and were always eager to have us reflect on our own desires for the outcomes of the class. They were also extremely flexible about our projects--they clearly wanted us to get something out of whatever we chose to do.\r\n\r\nFor a student interested in progressing through a course in linear fashion over the course of a semester, for a student who wants to understand the direct connections between readings, for a student who wants the weekly discussion to consistently dig into that week's reading, the above would probably be a weakness. And I did occasionally wish that our class discussions would center the readings more directly. But overall, I thought the class was fun, provocative, and a really safe and comfortable space to be vulnerable and develop ideas\/attitudes that we actually care about on a personal level.",
                "The professors encouraged personal experience in class discussion, which had interesting results. It was fun to have imaginative discussion post prompts, which led to some fun thinking. But I did find that we didnt always get to really discuss texts, which was frustrating when the reading was challenging and took a while."

I think that the more you give, the more you get out of this class and it found me at the right time in my life to really appreciate it.",
                "Yes! For anyone with philosophical, spiritual, or artistic curiosity (which I imagine could cover almost anybody at this school, if not the world), I think this course has so much to offer. Furthermore, the opportunity to spend time with, and learn from, the brilliant novelist Sheila Heti should not be taken for granted.",
                "yes! i would wholeheartedly recommend this seminar to anyone who wants to explore questions of why do things happen the way they do. regardless of what you study at yale, i think fate and chance can provide a warm space to think deeply into questions about ourselves, society, and humanity",
                "Absolutely, this class is unlike one I've ever taken at Yale. I learned a lot about the subject, others, and myself. The community formed amongst ourselves was so, so special.",
                "I would, and constantly did throughout the semester! I only wouldn't recommend it for students who need a high level of organization and consistency to thrive.",
                "I would! Its a very unique opportunity. Noreen and Sheila have great chemistry and discussion was often lively and surprising."
