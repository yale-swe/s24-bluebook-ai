                "Curriculum all over the place and never stops to explain the simple parts of what is actually happening.",
                "Franco went through material extremely fast, too fast for many students to keep up well enough to know what to ask questions about because they were too busy writing down what is on the board.",
                "Lots of office hours and support. But Franco makes the class more difficult for no reason.",
                "The material felt distributed in a pretty weirdly - we sometimes spent a lot of time on pretty easy concepts in the beginning of the class to then spend only three lectures on integration.",
                "I really liked the class. I thought the weekly recap emails were very helpful, and the homeworks were aligned well with the lectures.",
                "This course offers a comprehensive introduction to both analysis and mathematical proof-writing. I had written a number proofs before for various classes, but not to the rigor and maturity demanded in this class. We had three textbooks for Real Analysis and were told that any one of the three would've been sufficient for companion material. However, this very quickly stopped being the case when weekly recaps of lecture material constantly referred to only one of the books for further explanation of difficult topics, which effectively meant every student needed to constantly change books that had varying levels of insight and readability throughout the semester. In that regard, it would've been nice to have just one textbook to stay consistent. Similarly, lectures were incredibly inconsistent as far as pacing, depth of rigor and context, and no lecture notes or recordings were ever shared. For students who had to miss class because of things such as sickness, there was no way of recovering the material outside of reading through random chapters in the books or hoping a friend would share their notes. Despite all of these pitfalls, the course was taught by a professor whose passion for mathematics is very evident. While the more difficult topics seemed very fast and were hard to follow conceptually, the professor spoke about every little detail with an obvious passion for the beauty of it all. Similarly, the massive support from the ULAs in Office Hours made the class a lot more manageable.",
                "I almost wish there were a bit more about how people figured these theorems out in the first place. I know the class has a lot of content already and it'd be hard to add things, but presenting math as something that was handed down from on High or whatever can perhaps abstract away the actual process of mathematical creation.",
                "Lectures would benefit greatly from course notes, recordings, and a clear schedule of content in advance (since class was often just deep dives into highly technical proofs on new content, leaving no room for students to first understand the concepts being used intuitively). Exams are just memorizing proofs from HW and class, which can be incredibly frustrating when you have to recreate a multi-page proof from HW on an exam. Studying for the exam and my notes from class did not improve my understanding of analysis; only content I found online did.",
                "The lectures were often opaque and the fact that exams were basically based on memorization detracts significantly from the joy of learning this math.",
                "This course was definitely challenging (i.e. as with many math classes, there were definitely moments in which I felt unconfident/frustrated/was up late in the library grinding), but it was a wonderful experience -- it is definitely one of my favorite Yale classes so far! \r\n\r\nStrengths: 1) Especially if you like math, the material is super interesting! (In my opinion, this class was definitely more exciting than linear algebra.) 2) Franco is a WONDERFUL, approachable professor and a clear, careful lecturer. Perhaps the best I've ever had! If you have the chance to take this course with him, you should take it! 3) I felt like I had lots of chances to improve my proof-writing skills. 4) The tests were challenging but fair. 5) Wonderful ULAs and lots of office hours (including with Franco) for questions!\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is not necessarily a weakness, but it is definitely helpful to have a friend in the class -- it is nice to bounce proof ideas off of one another, discuss proof details when you get stuck, study for exams together, etc.",
                "The course was very interesting and the professor was very invested in it. However, there are a lot of smaller things that could help improve this class. Lectures were very quickly paced, so I often struggled to keep up. Having recordings of the class would have been incredibly helpful to allow me to focus more on the lecture and not on making sure I had pictures of everything. It would also be helpful if there was more motivation provided for some of the proofs shown in class before instead of after they were proven. I would also greatly appreciate if there was a title/theme for each class given at the start to help orient myself. Weekly review emails were very helpful for getting a sense of what was covered and where to do more reading, but I would prefer to have suggested readings and what will be covered before instead of after it happens.",
                "Great course",
                "This course was very intellectually stimulating and drove me to stay curious. I have no improvement feedback for the course.",
                "Franco is a kind and caring professor, and he is very skilled at explaining things in an intuitive way, when given the time. Sometimes during lecture it felt like we were rushing through things, and it was helpful to hear a more in-depth explanation during office hours. The exams were fair, and it felt like hard work in the class paid off. However, there are fairly minor changes that would significantly improve the learning experience. First, it would be helpful if the class followed one textbook more closely. The use of three different textbooks throughout the semester made it more difficult to follow the terminology and notation used in each. Also, there were a few times that I didnt understand how things were explained in class, and it was hard to find an equivalent textbook section to refer to. This issue was made more challenging by some notational errors as Franco wrote on the board during class (inequalities the wrong way around, changing notational conventions, etc.) Similarly, the lack of answer keys for the homework made it harder to understand the key concepts we were meant to be practicing, and the class would benefit greatly from a standardized answer key with more succinct proof examples. Classmates homework answers that were posted as solutions were often hard to understand, somewhat illegible, and conceptually unclear. Lastly, the last third of the class felt significantly more rushed than the first two thirds. It would perhaps be useful to move through the first third of the class more quickly, though I did appreciate that we were gradually eased into the more conceptually challenging material. Overall, the class is reasonably well organized and the work was fair. Franco is a good professor, but small changes would help a lot.",
                "The course is a lot of lecture-ingesting. Its strength is its rigor but its weakness is its lack of student driven problem solving during class.",
                "The midterm and final were solely composed of problems taken from class or HWs. Some of these problems were relatively complex and their solutions employed specific approaches or entities (e.g. a specific sequence), which could encourage rote memorization rather than genuine understanding.",
                "I loved the TA Luc Ta and Mengyi, I really learned a lot with them. Loved also a Saturday Office Hour. \r\nHowever, the final/midterms did not make any sense. Only things seen in class/assignment, with the exact same questions. So you could be the less intelligent person ever, but still get a good grades as long as you have great memory. The tests were not about how much you understand of the class, but more how much you can recall.",
                "Strengths: Franco, the material and the chronological aspect. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how mathematical notions flowed from one and another, and so did proof techniques. The homework was also great, and aided my understanding of the concepts. I loved how Franco would answer questions in lecture. His messages post exams were also quite sweet, and made me feel welcome to the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Getting homework solutions from students with terrible handwriting, or who write a proof 5 times the necessary length, made them unusable. Also, having a quick reminder of the theorem we are proving when we get back straight to it at the beginning of a class could be useful, there were many times where I wasn't sure of what the claim was until 3/4 through with the proof. I also don't think memorization is a good idea for exams; I would rather think through my problems than know grades solely depends on how much time I can devote to studying for the exam (which was, selfishly, not a lot of time). Similar proofs to what we've seen in class might be better.",
                "There was a lot of material so classes could be very fast-paced, but altogether were as clear as they could be. Office hours were helpful but sometimes it was difficult to get help with PSET problems. Exams were fair. Material was interesting and challenging. However, sometimes there would be one or two PSET problems that were much harder than the rest and honestly probably harder than the instructors realized they prior to assigning them, which could be frustrating.",
                "I really liked the course overall. I think it did well at covering analysis in fairly good detail. The homeworks were challenging but rewarding.",
                "The course instructed on a wide selection of concepts which were all useful for understanding higher level math, which was very helpful. The course also had many office hours and opportunities for questions, which was incredibly helpful. \r\nThe course could be further improved if the pacing was slightly altered, as we spent only the last few weeks on key concepts like the derivative and integral, we had relatively less time to discuss them compared to other concepts for which we could devote more time. Overall, however, the pacing of the course was great."

                "Franco is an amazing professorhe's one of the smartest individuals I've come across in the math program, and it'd be fascinating to take a higher-level course with him. That said, one needs to understand the expectations of this course: Real Analysis is a challenging concept in and of itself, and Franco's rendition of the material requires students to thoroughly understand it. I would recommend taking this in a four-credit semester, as it can easily take 15 hours a week of your time, not mentioning the time studying for the midterms. It was an extremely worthwhile experience to get a grasp on real analysis, but again, a time-intensive effort.",
                "I would recommend if you're genuinely interested in the matter. Absolutely do not take if you just need a QR and don't have other experience with math - it would be really challenging. Most people in this class will have to take it regardless.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in mathematics. I thought it was really interesting learning the derivation/proof for tools and concepts I'd taken as given (e.g. sine/cosine, exponential/log functions, the fundamental theorem of calculus).",
                "Id suggest taking it with Neitzke instead if possible, who I understand is more organized with course notes and clearly structured lectures. Franco would start class with a proof on the board and just jump into it, which made class hard to follow (would have been great if he told us first what we were going to learn that day, wrote it on the board, and referred back to that as we went).",

                "I would recommend this course. Franco is a very kind instructor who delivers very well-organized lectures with rare mistakes and is good at answering clarifying questions during lecture. You absolutely need to go to class though as no recordings or lecture notes are posted and exams are exclusively proofs covered during lecture and past pset problems. This being said, exams were very fair for that reason. Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class, some of the psets take a good chunk of time and office hours could be hit or miss because the TAs/ULAs didn't have solutions.",
                "If you enjoyed MATH 225 or are interested in proofs, this class is great for developing stronger mathematical reasoning, and proving calculus is highly rewarding.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to gain a solid grasp on proofs and the right way to think.",
                "I would. This class was a great intellectual challenge but left a much larger picture of math as a whole.",
                "Yes, especially when taught by Franco, it feels possible to do well if one is willing to put in a lot of effort and spend many hours per week at office hours.",
                "Yes. Its a great course for developing sharp reasoning and problem solving skills.",
                "Yes! I viewed this course kind of like a history class for math. You learn how all of calculus was built, which truly changes your vision about math. Franco is a kind professor that is devoted to his students. Strongly recommend",
                "Yes, I will. I loved also how Franco explained things with visualization.",
                "Yes!!!! It is extremely fascinating, and you build up so many logical skills. I feel like I am a much better thinker now. I would recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in Mathematics. It's a bunch of work, but totally worth it.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in math and wants to develop their skills in proof-writing.",
                "I would! I really enjoyed this class  it has confirmed my choice to be a math major. I think the material covered in the lectures and homeworks was super cool. The workload is pretty high but I would still definitely recommend it for anyone who likes math.",
                "I would more likely recommend this course to other students interested in taking upper-level math courses or upper-level courses in related subjects. It is interesting and gives excellent exposure to proving and defining key math concepts (convergence, continuity, derivatives, integrals, power series, etc.) but is challenging and requires lots of time and dedication. The problem sets take a good amount of time (especially relative to other courses), not only to complete but to fully process/understand. However, lots of support is available through office hours, which is incredibly helpful, and Franco is an incredible professor."
