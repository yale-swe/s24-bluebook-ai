                "Halsey is incredibly passionate about art, and he wants you to feel good about your work and fall in love with creating art. Additionally, this class is 100% what you make of it. You could spend 1 hour or 10 hours on a painting, so passion for art and self-discipline is extremely important, but this freedom is also so wonderful. You'll create a lot of works through this class, and this is a great opportunity to explore new styles and forms.",
                "I think its a really well structured course - every week we had something new to work on and we had crits every week or every other week. It was amazing and fostered a lot of friendships in the class.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, excellent class dynamic\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too little in class time for big projects.",
                "Halsey is an amazing and understanding and flexible professor. Take any art class with him. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: teacher was great, projects were always very diverse, still had creative freedom in class\r\nWeakness: time constraints sometimes hard to meet",
                "One strength of this course is the breadth of material that it teaches. One weakness of this course is the workload--there is a lack of standardized expectations for how much work we should be putting into each piece, and I often found myself staying up extremely late to finish projects, and then being sleep-deprived and late for class. Additionally, though we were promised that most of the class would be working on our art, what usually happened was we would spend all of class on critiques, and we were left to do all of our projects on our own time.",
                "I think an assignment or two on figure painting (portraits, people, etc.) would have been fun and usefull, as that was not touched on in the class."

You'll feel like an artist again and maybe even find a new home at the art studio when you're there until midnight finishing your work. Also, different sections of this class use different materials (Halsey has students use ink and acrylic), but I wouldn't focus on that as long as you're aware of it. I had never used acrylic before but appreciated the opportunity to try out something new this semester.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course (specifically w Halsey Rodman) to other students. Painting is fun! I learned a lot more than I ever expected, while feeling supported by both my teacher\/TA and my peers. Its a great, great class.",

                "I think it depends on whether or not you have the time to put as much energy into the work as it requires, but I did find that my painting improved.",
                "Yes. Halsey was a great teacher and I felt engaged and challenged throughout the course.",
