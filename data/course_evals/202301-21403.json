                "Strengths: Very involved teachers who are all willing to invest time into going over material and reiterate things. Fun lab work that was simple and got point across fairly well. \r\nWeaknesses: PSETS are quite long and require an investment of 3-4 hours in office hours per week just to complete the PSETS. I don't feel like I've learned Matlab well enough to go forth with building a project of my own from scratch.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the support we got from the professors and teaching assistants. However, the problem sets were a bit challenging and I wish we learned more of what was going to be on the pset in class.",
                "Strengths: really enjoyed the lab aspects, met some cool peers also interested in STEM, learned how to write a research proposal which was super helpful, also learned about some cool STEM concepts\r\nWeaknesses: the coding part was impossible, the PSETs were way too hard considering the level of instruction we were given and extremely confusing, meaning they were insanely time-consuming and leading to a lot of stress throughout the week, topics were disconnected and often confusing. It is physically impossible to do ANY part of a PSET by yourself without going to office hours and study halls three times a week and sending clarification emails on top of that.",
                "The classes were interesting and informative, however, the weekly homework was incredibly difficult. The content of the homework did not always align with what had been taught in class, leaving students in the class unable to answer the homework questions. This meant that the only way to get through the homework was to spend 4+ hours a week in study halls and office hours. Even with this, it was incredibly hard to finish the work at times. The TA's and ULA's though were absolutely incredible and did their very best to help us through these difficult psets.",
                "A thorough intro to MatLab coding would have made the steep learning curve for the programming aspect of this class easier.",
                "Strengths of the course included its attention to students' learning process, through frequent office hours and demonstrations during class. This made grasping completely new material, for both coding and lab experience, more efficient and guided. The labs were extremely well organized and a great introduction to lab work. \r\nOne slight weakness of the course is that problem sets were at times were too heavily focused on one concept (ex. random walks in MATLAB), instead of a giving a more diverse insight into a wider range of MATLAB techniques and coding tasks. Instruction on more natural\/physical science concepts would have also enriched the course even further."

                "This course, its PSETS, and its assignments heavily rely on using MatLab. For people who know how to code, and specifically know how to use MatLab, this course would be a fun challenge, albeit one that takes up a lot of time. As someone who doesn't know how to code, this course was nearly impossible. We did eventually get a bit of an introduction, but it was pretty far into the semester. I took this as a \"want to learn about research but also am taking 3 other STEM credits so can't be too hard\", and this course ended up very nearly causing me nearly as much stress as my hardest advanced STEM class. Be prepared to spend 3 to 5 hours on a single part of a single problem of a single PSET, and still not have it work. Topics were very disconnected in the sense that we had to simultaneously work on MatLab while writing a research proposal and learn lab techniques. Extremely stressful overall, at least for me. \r\nIn defense of the course, the professors and teaching assistants understood the insane challenge that this was, and gave all the support they could. That made the course go from impossible to nearly impossible. Did I learn a lot? Absolutely. But know what you're getting yourself into because I did not.",
