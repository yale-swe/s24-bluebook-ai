                "My writing skills improved, as well as my ability to read and analyze upper level papers/theory surrounding cinema and popular culture.",
                "I learned to be more critical of definitions of commonly used terms and scholarly sources. I also learned how to take a more critical analysis of films, especially in the context of where and who produced them. I also learned how to form a scholarly argument and write a college level essay.",

                "From reading the research papers and participating in discussion, I learned how to form a clear argument and how to analyze sources. I also learned a lot about popular culture and film, in the US, India, and Nigeria. I think I can now think more critically about popular culture and write better.",
                "I was able to develop several skills by taking this course that will allow me to be successful at Yale. Max Nelson curated a course that has made me more comfortable in summarizing dense readings, thinking critically about them and then successfully structuring a writing assignment that answers the prompt thoroughly. I feel more comfortable writing in a variety of different formats, ranging form creative writing to research papers."

                "Strengths: amazing teacher, interesting course content, movie screenings, engaging class discussions, perfectly balanced workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would've preferred if the class met a bit earlier in the afternoons",
                "I think the strengths of this course we're primarily centered around the classroom discussions. The combination of the interesting readings, great contributions from the members of the class, and valuable insights from professor Nelson was a really pleasant combination. The readings were fine, if sometimes long. The variety of reading and the variation is essay types was a really great choice. The amount of choice present in the essays as a student was incredible.",
                "This course workload was structured very nicely - it was challenging but not too overwhelming.",
                "I feel that a strength of the course was the open dialogue style of the classes. I enjoyed being able to come into class each week and converse with my peers and professor about the readings/films.",
                "This course was fantastic. I would not change anything.",
                "I think the biggest strength was allowing us to have a lot of freedom when deciding what to argue in our essays. Even in the essays where there was a specific prompt, it more so acted as a guideline to help us form an argument rather than restrict us to arguing a certain point of view. One weakness of the class was that sometimes the class discussions didnt feel very helpful because they were a bit too open ended and we had difficulty finding what to discuss. I think this could be improved by giving a more in depth intro to the scholarly work to be discussed",
                "Strengths: Fosters a strong seminar environment, and is very focused on learning and understanding what is being read rather than just reading it. The environment is also one where I felt really comfortable speaking and voicing my opinion.\r\nAs for weaknesses I am not sure I can point any out.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed screening the two films. I felt like seeing movies as a class enabled us to use what we had previously learned from the papers we read to analyze the movie. It helped me better understand concepts talked about in the papers. I also really liked watching short clips during class that supplemented topics certain papers addressed. Another strength is that the papers added to one another and, by the end, I could see why one paper came after another. The class was organized well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think delving deeper into the historical context the authors were writing the papers in could have added a lot to discussion. We did it with Adorno and Horkheimer, and that helped me understand the paper better. I also think adding another week to examine Nollywood, even if it comes at the expense of a week of Hollywood, would have been beneficial as the topics were really interesting to talk about. I also think assigning more movies in between the readings assigned could have been helpful as I found it very fun to apply what we had read to the films we screened. More of that would have added even more to the class.",
                "The strengths of this course are founded in Max's ability to communicate well with the entire class. The course was structured well with foundational/theoretical readings at the beginning of the syllabi that set the foundation and anchored the remainder of the course. I really enjoyed the in person film screenings and Max's expertise and thoroughness in breaking down and analyzing readings and films."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I have learned many valuable skills in this class that can be applied to not only an academic surrounding, but life beyond college as well. My writing skills have greatly improved alongside becoming knowledgeable in the field of film studies, cinematography and popular culture. The course content was engaging and left much room for personal exploration as well. Class discussions were also very fruitful and collaborative.",
                "This course is a great writing course. It is engaging with low work load and the instructor is fantastic!",
                "I would absolulely recommend this class to a student. In addition to being an interesting subject, the growth in my writing and reading skills has been extremely large and will benefit me for the rest of my time in college.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who want an introduction to theory surrounding popular culture and cinema culture.",
                "Yes, the course was very interesting and enjoyable. It made me think about film in new ways and improved my writing skills.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course. While I took it initially thinking it would be a traditional film class, I came out of it being much more critical of how people define popular culture and how the way we define certain aspects of our media and society affect our perceptions. This class helped me learn how to write essays at a college level and how to be more critical of the sources I use. It was also just very enjoyable to discuss during class about stuff I enjoyed.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, not only was the instructor amazing at teaching and leading/guiding a seminar but the material being learned is one that is often not thought about enough .The class was very in depth and made it very easy to feel engaged and excited about the material. Definitely one of my favorite courses so far.",
                "I would recommend it. I think the course teaches students a lot about popular culture and film. I really enjoyed learning more about topics such as stardom, the different film industries in the different countries studied, and spectatorship. I had never taken a film class before, and this served as a great intro to certain aspects of film. I really enjoyed discussing the different articles with classmates and watching the two movies screened.",
                "Absolutely, I'm aware that the ENGL 114 classes are many but what I would recommend is anything that Max Nelson is involved with. In few courses have I had the desire to engage with material as much as I did in this course."
