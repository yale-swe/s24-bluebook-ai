                "I learned a lot about the history of Mormonism and its interpretation. I also learned a ton about theory  this course made scholarly secondary sources less scary to me. I particularly appreciate our attention to race, gender, and appropriation in this course. Mormonism opens up questions about ~ literally everything ~  but the scope of the class allows there to be a helpful amount of focus. On a personal note, the class showed me that there can be a spiritual importance to knowing where you come from. I felt a recognition of the very human longing to know ones own genealogy as a theological and devotional practice.",

There are also a good amount of supplementary readings that talk about Mormonism from many different interdisciplinary angles.",
                "Not only did I learn so much about Mormonism, and the ways in which it is both resistant to and strangely emblematic of Americanism, I learned how to think about and discuss a topic that elicits such a strong cultural response. In short, I learned how to look past the obvious aspects of Mormonism that outside observers seize on and understand how and why it has become so controversial.",
                "I learned a lot about the history, formation, and cultural relevance of the Mormon religion. Through our deep dive into the religion, I learned how to write, present, and argue theses more effectively.

                "I have only strengths to report. The teaching was superb, the organization and pacing of each class was clearly thought-through. There was also an excellent balance of primary and secondary sources for each day of class, and a feasible amount of reading (though there were still lots of ways to participate even if the reading didnt happen for that day).\r\n\r\nI suppose if I had to add another element of the class, it would have been cool to learn more about the liturgy of the Mormon church and what a practicing Mormon might experience on any given Sunday service. But the class was full to the brim with exciting topics, ordered in a thematically-organized, dynamic syllabus. (A recently-graduated friend who asked me to send him the syllabus told me that it was literally poetry.)",
                "Lots of strengths, very few weaknesses. The professors were amazing, they were so hardworking and invested in our learning. Want to learn more about early-mormon quasi communism? They'll send you a bunch of articles, just reach out. Professors Lofton and Peters are extremely different in very complimentary ways and I loved both of them - I think having the Mormon and non-Mormon perspective was useful. The discussions were so engaging, difficult but respectful, I really enjoyed them. One weakness is that it was maybe too open-ended in the assignments - I was sometimes not totally sure what was expected from me.",
                "Maybe this is because I'm not a humanities major, but sometimes discussion was too meta and abstract for me to feel comfortable participating in. Usually it was great, though. Readings were fascinating and the professors did a great job teaching to lots of different levels of familiarity with Mormonism.",
                "The discussions were always vibrant and fun, and Profs KL and JDP do a great job of encouraging participation while not forcing anybody to speak. The class was well structured, with some small group discussions, large seminar discussions, lecture parts, media, etc.",
                "For a pioneer class on Mormonism, the course used Mormon stories to illuminate all sorts of other objects. It showed how relevant Mormon themes are to the broader world, but at times felt lacking in the substance of Mormonism itself.",
                "The material for this course was fascinating, and our seminar discussions were always thought-provoking and occasionally, completely redefined the way I understand America and American religion. I really appreciated how many of the assignments throughout the course built towards and helped us prepare for the final paper. I would barely change anything about the course, but if anything, I would have appreciated spending a bit more time on the basic tenets of Mormon theology at the beginning of the term, or even have had a short information sheet to look back on throughout the semester, because I sometimes felt that I didnt have all of the background knowledge necessary to understand certain critiques of or musings on the religion.",
                "The professors are FANTASTIC, the class work was super, super interesting and relevant to the course, the discussion was always engaging, and the reading is fascinating. This class deserves a 1000\/10 and I can't think of any weaknesses."

It was actually really well-taught over Zoom, better than any of my other classes. Having a break an hour into the session? Gamechanger. Consistently having the chance to discuss readings in small breakout rooms, each led by a professor or TF? Groundbreaking. In the first half, beginning most classes with a short lecture? Genuinely added something new and useful to the experience, while varying our mode of learning.

                "I absolutely and unequivocally recommend this class. The energy that Professor Lofton and Professor Peters bring to this course is really unparalleled, and you wont walk away seeing Mormonism (or the world, for that matter) in the same way. \r\n\r\nWhen one of my friends asked me why I liked Mormonism so much, I said that one reason was that it was clear that Professor Lofton and Professor Peters brought out the best in each other. I felt like their strengths as instructors complemented each other, leading to pedagogy that was organized yet adaptable, fast-moving yet allowing for moments of pondering in small groups, engaging in awe and admiration and yet totally willing to be irreverent. \r\n\r\nThis class was also incredibly well-taught, even over Zoom. Having a break an hour into the session? Gamechanger. Consistently having the chance to discuss readings in small breakout rooms, each led by a professor or TF? Groundbreaking. In the first half, beginning most classes with a short lecture? Genuinely added something new and useful to the experience every time, while also varying our mode of learning. I was also impressed with the level of interaction with the professors: Professor Lofton and Professor Peters made sure to meet with every student one-on-one, and then we had additional meetings to talk about our object analysis outlines, and then another meeting to share progress and check in. \r\n\r\nOn the last day of class, we all shared something that we would take with us from this class, and everyone had such beautiful and important takeaways, I genuinely started tearing up during that last twenty minutes. Mormonism cultivated a really collaborative class community, and I cant wait to hear about how it evolves in future terms!",
                "Yes! This was my dream course - high intellectual engagement, without an insane, excessively stressful workload. One note to potential students: if you, like me, are Mormon (who am I kidding, you probably aren't, this is Yale) be prepared to be challenged by this course. Not challenged in terms of oh nooooo so much readingggg but because it's emotionally and intellectually difficult in the best of ways. You should absolutely take it, but you will have to confront the toughest aspects of  your religion in a forum filled with people who, because of their backgrounds, are probably inclined to believe that Joseph Smith was a fraud. For me, it was exactly what I needed at this moment in my *spiritual journey* but you gotta be prepared.",
                "I'd recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind abstract, philosophical, and speculative discussions. If you're not Mormon, you might sometimes feel like you're just making stuff up in this class (or at least I did), but if you don't mind that occasional feeling of flying by the seat of your pants, take it!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Mormonism this class will definitely offer opportunities for discussion. My only things is that if you haven't done other religious classes\/ are not familiar with the King James Bible in some depth, some of the class discussions may be confusing.",
                "This was a fascinating course. If you have an interest in exploring Mormonism, you'd be hard pressed to find a better intellectual introduction. Professor Lofton and Professor Peters are incredible, and they truly care about their students. They give very detailed feedback, and make serious efforts to get to know all of the students and their interests.",
                "Absolutely!! Professors Lofton and Peters are fantastic, and even if you were never interested in Mormonism before, you will be as soon as you start this course. Be prepared to engage with plenty of scholarly writing, but also novels, movies, musicals, and TV episodes!",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN!! literally one of the best classes I have ever taken. Professors Lofton and Peters and fantastic, the material is fascinating, the workload is managebale, the reading is always interesting. If you want a class that will be so interesting you won't be able to stop talking about it, take this one."
