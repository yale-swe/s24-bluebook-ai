   "comments": [
    "I developed a lot of knowledge about New Haven both historically and throughout the 21st century. The course is really cool in that it goes over a wide scope, from housing to education to race to Yale's relationship with New Haven.",
    "Learned a lot about how a city works, combining theory and application. John is like a professor mixed with an uncle or a grandpa in the best possible way. He uses anecdotes about his own experience to make more theoretical concepts come to life, and he's super interested in hearing what students have to say. He, more than other professors, truly does not seem to think there's a right or wrong answer to questions (at least generally... there will be times he will challenge a response.)",
    "I learned a good amount about how city policymakers think about their jobs and about what it means to strengthen a local community.",
    "Prof. DeStefano gives a great introduction to the real world of city government and how to make political decisions when things are more complicated than in a classroom setting. I feel like I now have a great grasp on many big topics in city government (affirmative action, immigration, police, housing, education, etc.), and Prof. DeStefano gives a fantastic framework on how to view these topics when having to make choices ourselves going forward. It was a great class!",
    "The biggest take away was learning what's necessary for a successful - \"wealthy\" - city: social capital, cohesion and legitimacy of institutions. I've taken a number of classes on urban planning, city development, city activism, etc. This was the first time I walked away with a succinct, cohesive, one-sentence takeaway of what's important to a city's success.",
    "The course was a survey of contemporary issues surrounding cities  policing, firefighters, housing, immigration, local economies, etc. all viewed through the lens of Professor DeStefano's three pillars: social capital, cohesion, and legitimacy of institutions.",
    "I learned a lot about the city of New Haven in this class.",
    "A lot of knowledge about New Haven and how to think through policy issues!",
    "I learned about how our cities (and especially New Haven) have come to be the way they are through lessons and case studies on both the policies and politics of local government in areas such as education, immigration, race relations, and criminal justice. This class taught me a lot about urban renewal and how it transformed cities, and it has made me look at cities in a new way. Most importantly, I gained the vocabulary of \"legitimacy,\" \"cohesion,\" and \"social capital\" -- Professor DeStefano's major course themes -- which offers a roadmap for how to effect change and how to design better cities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings for this course were great and really interesting. Sometimes discussions for this class weren't as well formed as they could have been, the class could also be done really well as a lecture instead of a seminar.",
    "I wish we had weekly reading responses. Maybe that's just me, but i think it could help us be forced to know the material better. By the end of the class, it was clear several students were just coasting on their existing knowledge (or something not even knowledge, just thoughts\/opinions) on topics rather than understanding the readings. The readings and theory were super interesting.",
    "The readings and assignments were generally good, but the seminar discussion was not great.",
    "The only weakness was that not many students engaged with the materials or each other. Prof. DeStefano would fill in the quiet moments with his own insights, but it might have been a slightly improved class had he found ways to engage everyone more frequently (especially when people seemed hesitant).",
    "Strengths: You learn interesting history about New Haven and Yale, and a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes policy issues in cities. The more narrative readings are great. Professor DeStefano is charismatic and funny and approachable. \r\nWeaknesses: Many of the readings were published decades ago, and I wish we'd read more contemporary material on more recent New Haven issues. Also, there's almost no class discussion, professor DeStefano sometimes lectures for large portions of class, and there isn't much opportunity for meaningful engaging\/discussion on the part of students. I think this could be improved if readings connected better to present-day New Haven, present-day YaleNew Haven relations, organizations\/businesses around New Haven, because then maybe students could relate better to the material\/have more questions. I also think some nuts and bolts of policylike federal housing policies, for examplewere assumed to be known by everyone, but I think class would be more inviting\/accessible if those nitty gritty policies were at least broadly sketched out.",
    "I think it would have benefited from more student engagement. The conversation often felt like it was between a handful of students and the professor, opposed to the students with each other. Perhaps having students lead the discussion in pairs every other week, or student presentations, could help make this easier.",
    "I expected more from the course. The readings didn't feel very engaging, and my thinking wasn't very challenged. The class lacked really any real discussion component. Each weekly meeting was mostly just DeStefano talking through the readings and their relation to his time in office  these stories were nice, but sometimes his speech got old when a class discussion between students would've been more interesting. The class was not set up for students to really interact or engage with one another, nor to through out novel ideas. When students did speak, it was more along the lines of summarizing the reading. Because of this, I gained very little from the class.",
    "I believe that this class would benefit from more discussion by the class and less lecturing by DeStefano.",
    "The strengths of this course are Professor DeStefano, of course, and the readings. The field trip was a highlight as well. Professor DeStefano is a really wonderful man who is there to help his students learn. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was that I don't think the assignments and the expectations for the assignments were very clear. I don't think I got clear feedback that improved my writing from one assignment to the next.",
    "Strengths: Professor DeStefano's first-hand experience and stories; the guided tour of New Haven; engagement of the students; organization of the course around three central themes.\r\nWeaknesses: Certain weeks did not have as robust student participation as others, and certain topics were not as interesting as others. Specifically the Yale-New Haven week didn't lead to interesting discussion in my opinion, and the economic inequality week did not offer a new or interesting perspective (the value of work seems obvious).",
    "The material of this course is extremely interesting but class discussions were not well facilitated."

   "comments": [
    "This course seems at times tailored to students who are very familiar with New Haven (grew up there, etc.) That being said, it's a really interesting course and definitely worth taking if you want to learn more about the place we actually go to school.",
    "Yeah. Lectures are great. John is great. You can shape the class to be what you want it to be. John naturally seems to like students from new haven most (and if there's an alder in your class, they're gonna be the section asshole \/ favorite) but overall great class",
    "Yes, DeStefano is an interesting character and you'll gain a better understanding of what it means to serve in government.",
    "Yes, definitely! This course is fantastic and an absolute gem for anyone interested in city government and local governance. Prof. DeStefano has a wealth of experience to draw from and helps students feel like they leave the class prepared to make a difference in their own cities. I'm very grateful that I got to take this class.",
    "Take the class! You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student who already knows New Haven (or some aspect of New Haven) at least moderately well, and is interested in public policy issues at the city level. I would not recommend this course for a student who is looking for engaging class discussion.",
    "Yes! It's essential that Yalies engage with New Haven, and Professor DeStefano is an incredible resource for this. Also the readings were awesome.",
    "No. Not unless you were very keen on local politics and want to utilize the direct pathway to DeStefano and his stories about his time in office. The class is extremely practical, in our discussions were never really about theory. This is not inherently bad, and its a nice change in pace from some other courses, but unfortunately the practical discussions we talked about didn't feel engaging  for example, class time was spent discussing the hour-by-hour work schedules of firefighters in New Haven. I really enjoyed the field trip to Fair Haven, and reading some of the DOJ and Supreme Court cases was fun, but really, truly, I don't know what I left this class with. I did not learn much.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students if they are interested in cities or the way that local government works. Lots of reading although only 3 papers, not too hard.",
    "If you want to learn more about New Haven, or why local government is probably the most important tier of government, take this class. You might consider taking it credit-D if you can, because I think our discussions and the readings were more important to my learning than the assignments.",
    "If you are really interested in New Haven and in the history of urban renewal, take this class. Professor DeStefano is very smart and cares deeply about the class. He tends to lecture a lot, unless interrupted by students with questions. He also has a clear takeaway that he imparts each time, and he does not try to hide his opinions. If you want a genuine, open-ended, seminar-style discussion, look elsewhere. But this class is worth taking to hear the perspective of a 20-year mayor of New Haven and to better understand the city which we call home for four years.",
    "Yes, but beware it might not live up to all the syllabus would make it seem. The class field trip around Fair Haven is an absolute highlight of the class, but each seminar feels just like a 2 hr lecture with little participation from the class, despite the great topics we had to discuss."
