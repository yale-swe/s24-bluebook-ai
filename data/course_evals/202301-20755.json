                "The strengths of the course is through the support that Jon Andrews provides in facilitating our class conversations during workshops, as well as facilitating the structure and process of our production. The weakness in this course is probably in the fact that most of how we learn to run sets just occurs from being on student sets, which can sometimes be difficult experience for people to obtain before this course.",
                "I really loved the courseand wouldn't change much. The way that Jon structured itwhere we make one short film, based off a standard script, and then spend the rest of the semester on another filmis really conducive towards learning, and improving in film. It's the perfect class for intermediate filmmaking, and Jon is the perfect person to teach it. Really wouldn't change anything about how it's structured.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I think could be improved (though it is difficult in an art course) is the grading. I do just wish the way we were graded on participation was made slightly more clear at the beginning of the year, but otherwise was thrilled with what I got from the course.",
                "The class is very supportive of one another, and the class sessions can be very helpful. There were also some workshops that were helpful as well. \r\nWhile it is supposed to be a seminar setting, the students are really expected to learn a lot on their own. This is especially true of the technical aspects of the process for which there was little support."

            "comments": [
                "Most people taking the course probably won't have a choice, but even still I can't wholeheartedly advocate for it. The class feels like it discourages any sort of passion for creating films, making it feel like a chore, between the incredibly long class times and the demanding workload each week. If you want to go back and change some earlier aspect of your film, you force yourself to re-do hours of work before even starting the assignment that week, which usually means that if one week's assignment is subpar, the next week's will feel the same, and I fear that some other the final films may have suffered from this. That being said, the class encourages a great amount of community with the other filmmakers, making the exchange of ideas and inspiration for each other's films fun. But again, I cannot in good faith say I wholeheartedly enjoyed this class. Better formatting, with more thoughtfully spaced and planned assignments for each week, better classtime content, and more educational moments instead of just workshopping would greatly benefit the class.",
                "Yes, especially if the student is already planning on producing, writing, directing their own film.",
                "The Film Writing and Directing series of classes taught by Jon Andrews are among the very few at Yale which actually provide the opportunity to learn about film production in a comprehensive, hands-on manner. You get what you put in, but if you take advantage of the opportunity, you can develop the baseline understanding youll need to run productions with crew, talent, locations, and all the logistics of an actual set in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is already very familiar with filmmaking and is looking to experience and learn what it is like to make films at Yale."
