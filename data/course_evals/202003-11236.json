                "The topics were interesting, the readings were relevant, and the class discussions were interesting. However, it was often difficult to contribute to the discussion since the professor and a few students would be talking for most of the time. It also felt like the topics focused mostly on theoretical concepts and social systems rather than the actual psychological processes and research, which is not entirely what I expected.",
                "It is difficult to stay engaged because of the virtual format, though this is definitely not the fault of the teacher. It is also sometimes hard to be open about one's own experiences with prejudice and discrimination, though discussions about relevant personal experiences are very informative to the class. Perhaps an anonymous form to submit relevant personal experiences to be discussed in class could be useful? Unless you really want to emphasize that we should all be open and non-judgemental about our experience with prejudice and discrimination",
                "Strengths: Prof. Richeson creates a really welcoming space for approaching sensitive topics, content is super relevant to events in the real world, syllabus manages to cover a lot of different theories in a short timeframe while still allowing for good engagement\r\nWeaknesses: not really a weakness, but there is just so much to talk about related to prejudice that this class feels so short!",
                "I really appreciated that we were given the opportunity to present on each weeks topics to our classmates. It offered the ability to dive deep into the material ourselves and take ownership over what we had learned.",
                "The weekly discussions were very helpful for reinforcing course material, and each week was led by a different student group, which provided a greater level of engagement. I anticipate discussion would have gone smoother in a normal in-person semester without the technological limitations.",
                "This is THE best class I have taken so far. The literature is up-to-date and very relevant to the current issues facing our society.",
                "The strengths included Prof Richeson's incredibly generous and knowledgeable teaching style. She cares about each student and her subject deeply, and generates a passion for social psychology in her students. A weakness was that we could have heard more from hershe gets two students to lead the discussion each week, which can minimize her input (which is stellar when it occurs)"

It felt just as engaging as it probably would have been if it were in person. The class was very discussion-based rather than lecture-based, which made it a bit more interactive.",
                "Overall professor Richardson did a very good job of encouraging class activities via student-directed discussions. Breakout rooms seemed to be very good in this class in particular, but it was probably because we were all so engaged with the subject matter and interested in what others thought of the topic at hand.",
                "Con: Zoom seminars are, by nature, easier to 'clock out of.' It is simply harder to focus on a screen for two straight hours, and it's easier to get distracted. I wish we had the opportunity for a break in between. \r\n\r\nPro: I still enjoyed the opportunity we had for discussion. I think our class did a good job of engaging in discussion and we still were able to have conversations virtually.  \r\n\r\nCon: I was not the biggest fan of screensharing PowerPoints or Google Slides through Zoom because you either can't read the words very well or you can't see your classmates' faces. \r\n\r\nPro: I liked the activities we did when we all wrote on the screen.",
                "Prof. Richeson was always very caring and would start every class with check-ins, which really helped to not only foster a small community within the class but also helped for her to understand our own current (and usually very disparate) situations. She has always been caring first before anything else and was very flexible about deadlines and open to feedback along the way. It was a great class despite the circumstances!",

                "YES! An amazing overview of why prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping might occur and the effects on marginalized groups. Not only is the topic so \r\nincredibly relevant to modern society but the professor and students have so many insightful viewpoints that not only helped me learn as a psychologist but as a member of diverse communities. Just take the class it's so good!",
                "Maybe? In all honesty, I have been feeling disillusioned with psychology and I am not sure if social psychology\/the psychology of prejudice answered the questions I was hoping to answer - more of an understanding of systemic oppression and the experiences of oppressed groups and less of cognitive explanations for why racists are racists. I know not all of my classmates felt the same way about this, and this is just my opinion, but I also found it strange to psychologically analyze\/apply psychological concepts to real life events for the sake of class, when those events might have been traumatic for the people involved. For example, if I experienced a racially-motivated attack, I would find it upsetting to have my actions and my attacker's actions be psychoanalyzed by a group of strangers in a way that felt very detached, distanced, sterile, and academic.",
                "Yes. Especially given current times, yes.",
                "Absolutely. This is a class I'd been waiting to take for a while, and it did not disappoint. Prof. Richeson is a huge expert in this field, but she does an amazing job of explaining complex theories in ways that are easy to understand and make it clear how important they are to making sense of the things we experience in our lives. I also felt that she facilitated a really positive environment for self-reflection and created space for everyone to be able to work through their ideas. I am so glad I took this course, and I'd recommend it to anyone!",
                "Yes I very much recommend this course! If you are looking for a way to understand prejudice and societal organization from a psychological perspective, this is the class for you.",
                "Would recommend if you are interested in learning about social psychological models (e.g. Social Dominance Theory, Stereotype Content, Attribution Value, etc) and applying them to real world scenarios through careful research and analysis.",
                "Definitely!! This class challenges you to see the issues we are facing from the lens of a social psychologist and pushes you to come up with ideas on how to combat prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination.",
                "YES! Take anything with Prof Richeson. You'll learn as much from the way she approaches her course material as from the material itself. She is an incredibly kind, generous instructor, with a deep knowledge and passion for her subject that gets a class instantly engaged. The material was well organized and the feedback was great. One of the best psyc seminars at Yale."
