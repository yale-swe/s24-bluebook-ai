                "The strengths of this course was the faculty that taught it. The professor and the TF's were beyond supportive and kind and helpful. They made the course as great as it was. A weakness of this course may be that the mini lab reports were about just as much work as the full lab reports but were worth significantly less points.",

                "Strengths the teaching team is fabulous and the course is well organized and extremely engaging. My favorite lab course at Yale Ive ever taken \r\n\r\nWeakness the workload felt like  lot, especially having the quizzes on top of weekly lab report. The quizzes expected us to know so much information. We did not receive grades in a timely manner"
