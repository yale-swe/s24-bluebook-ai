                "This course was not at all how it was described on Canvas. I hesitate to consider this class a social science. The entire semester was dedicated to the brain and not enough to social policy or practical application. While the guest speakers were great and Prof. Pugh is extremely passionate and knowledgeable on the subject of language and the brain, this course was not well organized and incredibly un-engaging. To be fair, this is the first time this course was taught, but I felt it needed a lot more structure and development before being taught. There wasn't even a syllabus, the assignments were open-ended, unclear and not challenging, and there often was no concrete due date, which is confusing and stressful. Hopefully in the future this course will be more structured and better developed.",
                "This course provided a lot of context and updates on current research! This is amazing. Many classes will teach you about a topic but never put you in conversation with the current studies, and this course did! This course brought in people currently and actively working in the things we discussed in lecture.",
                "No real weaknesses of course.",
                "Strengths: Guest speakers, interesting papers, not too much reading, professor that's passionate about the subject\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Spent much longer on the nueroscience side of things than I expected, Professor went off on tangents a lot (related information, but off course a bit)",
                "Amazing guest speakers and knowledgeable professor",
                "Prof. Pugh is wonderful, and the involvement of outside speakers really added a lot to class discourse and our understanding of the field and its real-world implications. I do, however, think there would be benefit to having a more solid syllabus outline from the start to give students an idea of the trajectory the class will take, even if it's just a schedule of what topics will be covered.",
                "The biggest weakness was that we were never given a syllabus and homework\/papers would be handed to us randomly with no consistency. One of the strengths was the fact that Professor P brought a lot of speakers and we were  able to get a big scope of global literacy from all angles.",
                "Strength - guest lectures allowed for students to interact with professionals in field\r\nWeakness - more focus on neuroscience and less focus on policy compared to what was outlined in syllabus, organization"

While some of the information was harder science (tools used for different brain scans), most of it was easily understood by me, someone without any technical skills. I also have no background in nueroscience, so I'd say it was a good introduction to some of the topics you'd see following along that major.",
