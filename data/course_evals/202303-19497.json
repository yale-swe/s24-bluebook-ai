I learned how to write a political op-ed, policy brief, and white paper in the style of think tanks. This content has greatly shaped my understanding of education policy and prepared me to pursue roles at the intersection of education studies and political science. Anyone interested in either subject must take this course!",
                "I learned how to write a policy memo, white paper, and how to do some data analysis and use data to support arguments. I learned about federal education policy over time as it relates to K-12 education and higher education. I learned about the role of key actors in education policy, including Congress, the Supreme Court, interest and advocacy groups, and the President.",
                "I learned about the history of federal education policy and factors that impact the decision making process.",
                "I learned a lot about the U.S Federal Education system and all the factors at work in creating the policy.",
                "The knowledge gained in this course includes an understanding of how education policy has developed over the last 150 or so years, with a majority of the focus being on K12 education. Additionally, my comfortability and familiarity with US politics and ease of conversation on those topics has improved greatly. I also gained insight on my personal career goals and long-term plans, likely in the field of education, which I was uncertain about before. Skills include political writing and research skills, concision, understanding and interpreting data and research papers, and connecting political circumstances to policy outcomes.",

                "The main strength of this course is Professor Schiff. She is extremely knowledgeable about the subject area, promotes productive discourse in class discussions, and always shares helpful feedback that improves our writing. Professor Schiff is very understanding and compassionate, allowing us to take extensions on our work to produce our best material and making space in the classroom to discuss current events weighing on our minds. The only weakness in this course is that some students seemed to not really read the texts assigned on the syllabus which made it difficult to engage in balanced discussions. It was clear that some students would spend a lot of time engaging with the readings and crafting thoughtful responses on the Canvas discussion page, but this was not consistent for all class participants. This is a reflection of the students though, not Professor Schiff. She was always actively including shy participants and worked to create a wonderful learning environment.",
                "The course's strengths are that it is very well-organized, its assignments are clear and have purpose, it has the right amount of reading and writing without feeling too overwhelming, and touches on a wide range of topics without feeling overly broad. \r\n\r\nI think a weakness of the course is that it did not explore Title IX much and somewhat ignored affirmative action, including during the classes on the Supreme Courts role in education. The higher education unit of the course focused too much on for-profit higher education and I believe could have discussed Title IX and affirmative action more, although those are hot-button issues.",
                "This was a great course! The selection of readings was good and I liked how the discussions allowed us to reflect more deeply on the readings of that week.",
                "There are no weaknesses to this course. It was well taught and well organized.",
                "Strengths: This class had a unique emphasis on practical skills, such as writing op-eds, policy memos, and white papers, and we also had a week about data analysis. We also had the opportunity to meet with a former Secretary of Education. Professor Schiff also welcomed discussion about current events before each class. Overall, the class had great readings and fantastic discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: there was a week or two in the course where readings were repetitive and lengthy. I would also like to have seen a more diverse set of opinions on for-profit higher education, because we read a perspective that was fairly one-sided. In all, these weaknesses are very minor compared to the overall strengths of the course!",
                "Amazing course. Great Professor",
                "Overall this was a very strong course - the readings and writing assignments were thoughtfully selected and interesting. Sometimes class discussions became a bit repetitive, but I still enjoyed them. I also would have liked to learn a bit more about how the policies we talked about impacted students directly. I also appreciated how we were often able to bring our own experiences and interests to class discussions.",
                "Strengths: interesting and engaging content, Professor Schiff is wonderful, discussion was very enjoyable, excellent feedback on all assignments and very clear and reliable communication\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings overlapped in content and felt redundant, lack of accountability for doing readings"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in education policy or political science in general. Professor Schiff is extremely knowledgeable and caring. The assignments truly helped me learn new skills and apply the concepts I learned in class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in EDST, PLSC, or both. You learn a lot about how specific federal education policies were created and how they have changed over time, as well as how policymakers interact to pass legislation.",
                "Yes! It was a great class, and I think many of the issues we learned about are relevant even if someone isn't interested in policy specifically.",
                "Absolutely. Especially if it is taught by professor Schiff. She is the best.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is even remotely interested in education or education studies. The Federal Government plays a role in every aspect of education, and understanding that role is vital to understanding the ways to improve the education system. The subjects covered vary from constitutional law to financial reforms and things in between. Be aware that some weeks have a lot of reading, but the reading made the discussions fruitful. Great course!",
                "Yes. It was amazing",
                "Yes! It was a very helpful introduction to the ways the federal government impacts K-12 and higher education policies. It also helped contextualize education policy within the broader scope of federal policy and practices. For the writing assignments, it would probably be helpful to have a specific area of education you'd like to focus on when taking this class as the papers are very open-ended.",
                "If you are interested in US federal policy broadly, and how equity is facilitated or challenged in the legislature and the courts, this is a great class to take. Professor Schiff is the best."
