                "I learned all about the various types of media as well as how to become a better writer, especially in crafting an argumentative essay.",
                "I learned a lot about media history and how media interacts with society, power, time, and space. I also learned what all can qualify as \"media,\" ranging from fire and writing to the printing press and AI technology.",
                "Literally everything! All of it! In Introduction to Media, you learn how to think analytically, which is so incredibly valuable. You learn the frameworks through which to view everyday objects that we take for granted as media with histories and profound influences on the way society functions. You read countless fascinating academic texts and poems, watch the occasional tv episode, listen to music, view art, truly everything! The essay prompts enable you to take a deep dive exploring topics that interest you, and through revision with your TF, you improve the articulation of your thoughts.",
                "I learned a lot more about the impact of media in our daily lives; technological media isn't the only type of media that is present, but media are all around us and influencing our daily lives and practice. It was so nice to analyze topics in a different viewpoint and learn about the deeper relations between objects and media.",
                "In this course, I learned to think of things in a more abstract and defamiliarized manner. As a consequence, I've been able to think of a lot of things---not just those in the class---in a new way. The class gave me a whole new insight and perspective on media!",
                "This class was very good at developing new types of thinking and writing skills from the readings and writing prompts there were given from the class. Though it was challenging I think it was good at developing new skills in reading and writing comprehension that we had not seen before.",
                "Very much a mind blowing course. I was encouraged to think way outside of my comfort zone, especially as a STEM major. I also learned how to do readings for a course, which I had not done to the level of investigation that I had in any high school courses. I think each one provided insights and new knowledge that influenced my learning.",
                "Writing essays by compiling different works by media theorists.\r\nAnalyzing the ideas of media theorists and reading often difficult texts.\r\nInterpreting philosophy in our age of media.",
                "The course doesnt teach concrete things to memorize, instead it teaches you to think about and engage with the world in a different way. Thats not for everyone but for me it was amazing.",
                "I understand the idea of media in new way. It really changed my thinking what media are and how they function.",
                "It Was Nice to deconstruct my preassumtions of what media is",
                "How to meditate on objects, connect ideas from different media theorists, write a book review, defamiliarize myself with objects and media around me.",

                "Knowledge about media, including media that may not commonly be considered media.",
                "A deeper understanding of media studies. Understanding what a media and medium are and their diversity through different categorizations.",
                "I learned how to think more broadly about subjects that I already had preconceived notions about. This class improved my critical analysis skills as well as my writing and communication abilities.",
                "The special take that this class has on media completely changed my way of perceiving the day to day world. The papers we have read have given me so many different insights. Everything is media--the ocean, clouds, fire, bells, ships (and of course photographs, recordings, books, computers, etc)! And everything carries a message...whether you realize it or not!",
                "This is a class that expands your perception in weird ways. I learned a bunch of super random facts and a couple big ideas, all of which will stick with me for a while. The main takeaway was that I view human-made objects totally differently now--with a lot more attention and awe--than before taking the class.",
                "Thinking about media in a new perspective, asking creative questions to everyday-life objects",
                "I learned so much more than I ever imagined. Professor Peters is truly a mastermind and deserves all the accolade. Opened up a new perspective on film and challenged (while also emphasizing) various theoretical notions. I learned how to be clearer with my writing and how to look at different theories and apply them to everyday concepts.",
                "I learned how to evaluate media in an abstract way outside of their conventional forms.",
                "I really got an understanding of how to defamiliarize and study media through that lens, which really helped deep dive into certain concepts.  I also got a good understanding of the central ideas of media studies, including a history of how media has progressed through writing, video, music, and more.",
                "This course is really about defamiliarizing yourself with infrastructures. It helps you think outside the box.",
                "I learned how to understand how media affect our everyday lives. The knowledge I learned that there is a medium between everything we do or use. The insights I gain are that I will learn to interpret things in my life more in the mindset of how this medium affects what I am doing.",
                "media and mediums",

                "It was an excellent creative course with a broad survey of human innovation.  It really gave me a window into AI and how machine learning will affect creative endeavors."

            "comments": [
                "A smaller reading load would allow for increased engagement.",
                "The strength was that the material was interesting to learn about, and so it never felt like a burden to do readings",
                "This course does an excellent job making you engage with questions of media and power in ways that I have never considered before. The readings are wide-ranging both in their content and difficulty, and they spark some very interesting discussions.",
                "I wish there would be something from the lectures to look back on. I know the professor posts his slides after lecture, but they're mainly photos and don't contain any content. It helps that we discuss much of the topics in lecture through discussions, but since discussions are discussions I don't usually take many notes.",
                "Strengths: the breadth and depth of the readings and variety of well-curated course materials. By interacting with so many types of media formats, you learn more innovatively and with increased engagement. The lectures and papers are engaging, and there is such a strong support network to ensure that students are learning and succeeding. \r\nWeaknesses: it can be a little tough to stay on top of all of the readings because there are generally a lot of pages to read per week, but if you dedicate chunks of hours at a time, it's possible to read\/view\/hear every assignment.",
                "John Peters is a fantastic lecturer. The readings assigned are interesting and deep. The mindset taught by the class is extremely valuable. Section was engaging and fun. One of the only weaknesses is that the sheer amount of reading, especially for an introductory course, is a bit overwhelming. As a result, many students (myself included) didn't do all of the readings. If the readings were about halved, or if I knew what readings were going to be most important for discussing in section, I probably would have done more of them, but because I didn't know which ones to do and because there were so many, I would often skip a lot of readings, and sometimes all the readings, for a given day.",
                "I don't see sometimes how the concepts relate to the lectures. I also wish the professor had more office hours because I was never able to get to know him. The lectures connected a lot of the course concepts between each other and helped us recognize the impacts of the readings in a larger context.",
                "The course was very engaging. Professor Peters and my TA, Marcus Alaimo, were brilliant. \r\nNo weaknesses (perhaps too much reading).",
                "The class is very broad and abstract. It could benefit from some more depth into social media, and current news media. But overall it is really interesting and the ideas are fascinating.",
                "It worker well as a intro course, buts its hard to keep track of what is happening the first few weeks. Its all over the place",
                "good sections",
                "Read a lot of unique and interesting readings and the prompts really allowed me to write about stuff that I loved",
                "This course was good as it offered a wide variety of material that related to the core subjects in media theory. The workload of readings was high, but was only an issue when there was time committed to some readings and they were rarely discussed.",
                "Loved lectures! Sometimes people werent prepared for section. The papers were fun to write",
                "The paper topics were very interesting, and the readings were interesting too! The final exam was listed as taking only 3 hours but took nearly double that even for students working as efficiently as possible.",
                "great class. super facinating.",
                "Sometimes this course spoke too abstractly about each lesson and I was left to piece the subjects together in a way that would make sense for media studies. But I enjoyed that it pushed me to analyze media more intensely and to think about the world around me differently.",
                "Everything is just impeccable! Fascinating readings and lectures, great professor and TFs. 10\/10.",
                "Strengths: I think JDP is the best lecturer I've ever had. The syllabus is totally wacky but you can get a lot out of it, and the ideas do end up gelling in the end. Weaknesses: The students--most people were taking the course for the writing credit, and it's very hard to be motivated when everyone around you is just there to get through the class. The class could be better organized to have more accountability--I wish I were forced to do the readings more often.  The writing assignments are extremely open-ended, which is weird for a big intro class. I think this course would be better suited to a small, upper-level seminar format. As is, it could use more structured assignments and prompts.",
                "Strength: Prof Peters is an engaging and entertaining lecturer. TA sections are very well organized.\r\nWeakness: If you thought this was a gut class, it really isnt",
                "Very strong class structure, but would be helpful to have more detailed lecture slides posted.",
                "This course is extremely unengaging. It was extremely unclear on how to do well.",
                "The lectures were generally pretty brilliant.  They always had a good flow and kept me engaged and interested in the materials.  In contrast, some of the more academic readings felt sort of pointless or unfocused; plenty of the readings were quite interesting, but some of them just felt like there needed to be more guidance on what to focus on, especially when it came to section.  When we read some 100 pages a week, it sometimes felt hard to figure out what to take away from the readings.",
                "The lectures are super engaging and the readings are great. Sometimes the structure feels a bit random\/disorganized.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it really taught material that is outside of the mind and it helped you critically think. The professor taught the class well and talked clearly. There are no weaknesses to this course.",
                "Strengths: lectures were really fun, both the professor and my section leader were super interesting and engaging, the lecture content was also really relevant and well organized to provide the best introduction to media theory. Weaknesses: perhaps slides could be slightly more detailed for review, and a couple of review sessions would be nice",
                "The lectures for this class were varied and always incredibly engaging. At the same time, I sometimes felt a little bit confused as to the intended take away for a given lecture, as the structure of the lectures was quite free flowing.\r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this class was the lack of engagement in section. Some students treated the class a bit like a throw away and would show up to section having not attended lecture or done the reading. This lead to somewhat stunted section meetings, and I found section a bit discouraging for that reason. My TA was great though.",

The professor is very funny and makes the course enjoyable as well. The writing assignments are very creative and engaging, and you receive great feedback from your teaching fellow.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! You'll learn from one of Yale'sand the world'sgreatest professors about fascinating topics. Your mind will expand with every lecture. You'll get to engage with fascinating course materials. And your wonderful TF will guide you through everything and work with you to make you a more articulate thinker.",
                "Yes! I loved both the professor and the teaching fellow and I learned a lot more about media as a whole.",

                "No, I think I would have appreciated more guidance about the expectations for understanding on the lectures. My TA was excellent but I heard some of them were not. I also, despite recognizing that this course was intellectually stimulating, do not see how I could really apply anything media studies related to actual life situations or career activities.",

                "Yes, but you can only really make the best of it if you do the readings and attend the lectures (which are very interesting and we sometimes even clap at the end). I wouldnt take this if youre only looking for a writing credit.",
                "yes good writing credit",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. Even though its a required course, I would take it regardless. Peters is a fantastic professor.",

                "YES! YES! YES! A hundred times over. Professor Peters made this course wonderful, and one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Each lecture was fascinating, and felt like a mixture of a ted talk, a podcast, and a little adventure, all at once. This class makes you think about media in non-traditional ways, and I feel like I see the world around me completely differently now. The readings are all fascinating and entertaining. My TF was amazing, and I have heard great things about all of them. But, again, Professor Peters is what truly makes this class incredible: with his sense of humor, little funny comments and insights, his vast knowledge of many cultures and languages (which he flawlessly interweaves with the content of the course), and just his neverending desire to teach (and learn from!) his students. I loved loved loved it!",
                "Amazing course! Definitely recommend, especially as a writing credit",
                "Yes yes yes!!! Truly an amazing professor and all of the TAs are remarkable too. If you like any form of media(books, TV, Film, Music, etc.) this class will teach you to look at it all differently. It will inspire you to try new mediums and to seek the common ones in a different way.",
                "No, it is ridiculous that this is a requirement for the film major.  Lectures were hard to follow and work was busy work with little guidance on how to do well.",

                "Yes, this is one of my favorite classes at yale! I loved learning about media theory and defamiliarizing myself with so many objects and interactions that i encounter on a daily basis",

If you don't want to think outside of the box or like a straightforward or easy to follow lecture, I don't think you will enjoy this class.",
