                "A strength of this course would be how awesome the professors are at facilitating discussions within the class. I also thought it was amazing that they were able to have so many guest lecturers in one semester.",
                "I really appreciated the \"leminar\" (lecture\/seminar) to explain core concepts but also having room for discussion. I just wish that we engaged a little bit more with the readings.",
                "I think Drs. Beitel and Cutter did a great job in putting together a syllabus that managed to balance going in-depth with being digestible by someone who doesnt have prior knowledge about psychology. While several of the readings were a little long, they were engaging and not overwhelming. Overall, I feel like I got a solid introduction to the topic of Native health, specifically psychologically. This isnt a weakness, but I think it would be great to bring in more guest speakers in the future!",
                "Because the class size was small, I would have appreciated more time allocated for discussion of the readings instead of the entire class time being used for lecture. However, the lectures were very informative, and I still appreciated the format of the class.",
                "I think the course itself could be less of a lecture and more of a discussion seminar because of how few people were in it. We did discuss in class sometimes but I found myself bored because the class itself tended to be a lot of listening and reading.",
                "I think it would be helpful to provide in-class essay writing for first and second-years especially."

                "I would recommend this class! Id recommend it no matter what somebodys level of knowledge is, either in regard to Indigenous life or psychology. Both professors are thorough and really engage the class in a way that allows for valuable learning. This class was small, but even within that we had such variation in how familiar we were with these topics, but our professors were patient and made the information accessible.",
                "Yes, I believe Indigenous student especially would find this course helpful even in their own personal lives. I learned a lot about mental health and treatments specific to Indigenous people and it is an important field of research.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is important to note that the class does deal with heavy content, but it is important to understand how institutionalized mental health is practiced in non-White communities. This class has been eye-opening in reshaping my conceptions of societal norms that influence mental health norms. I appreciate that the class is cross-listed with ER&M and Psych as I feel that these fields are much more connected than individuals may think and that Psych often approaches situations without considering the historical context the way ER&M does."
