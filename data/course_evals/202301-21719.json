                "Class time was dedicated to speaking practice and really helped me get more comfortable with Korean pronunciation. However, I think the class could be better structured, as the course schedule provided at the beginning of the semester is difficult to follow. For instance, assignments are due the day after they are listed, while quizzes occur on the day of, and homework assignments are recommended work to better get the material but with no due date. Additionally, the modules and test handouts are also quite scattered and difficult to follow. I feel like it would have been nice if assignments were posted on canvas, and if the professor clarified quiz dates at the end of class the day before.",
                "It was very useful having a daily schedule and printed task handouts. I also like that that speaking and listening was focused on in class. The frequent quizzes kept me motivated to study everyday. The schedule was sometimes a little unclear, but for the most part, it was well structured and the expectations were clear.",
                "Strengths: Emphasis on organic conversation (i.e. rarely spoke directly for a script). I also feel like I learned significantly more Korean this semester than I did in L1.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course could be a bit disorganized. Often deviated from the syllabus and students often did not know when things were due",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would not take this course simply to satisfy a language credit, but I think anyone can really learn Korean if they are willing to put in the work. I personally got a lot out of the course. Students and the professor are very kind and supportive."
