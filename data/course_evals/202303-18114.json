                "Strengths: potential to be asynchronous for the first 8 weeks which was very helpful for me and all the tests are online and 106 has a final project instead of a test\r\nWeaknesses: being online, I did not learn as much as I could have maybe if I went in person",
                "Strengths: professor is easy to understand and helpful, content is taught in an intuitive manner and sequence that makes sense, practical",
                "Strengths: first half of the course was at your own pace, the workload of the class never felt too much, the second half of the course was also very relevant to my studies. Weaknesses: clearer rubrics and grading scales might have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: R was cool to learn.  A great way to start programming.\r\nWeaknesses: Fast-paced",
                "I really enjoyed the second half of the class where we learned R as it was very well geared to beginners and I felt I learned a lot in the 4 weeks we had it",
                "strengths: very accessible for first-time coders like me, the pace was a really good balance of accessible but still quick-paced.",
                "The strength is that it is engaging, and the weaknesses are that it feels unorganized and is arduous at times. It can be improved by having more office hour opportunities.",
                "Umbrella:\r\nStrengths:\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n106:\r\nStrengths: Students were appropriately pushed given the assumed background of no experience with R. So the homework wasn't overly difficult, but also not super easy either. \r\nWeaknesses: The time is just so short that you don't really get to learn anything and the connection to statistics is very weak, so I'm not really sure why they're combined this way. Students are given some resources to learn R during the umbrella class, but at that point you're essentially teaching yourself so why take the class? No separate rubric for grade weighting was provided, so assuming the umbrella course is applicable, the final project is weighted especially heavily given the limited abilities of students.",
                "The independence",
                "I wish 106 was recorded and posted online because I was sick for a couple days and because the course is so short missing two classes makes a difference. Also, it would be helpful to have the class on Zoom anyways with the prof's screen shared on Zoom, even for those in the class, because then we can follow along on our own computer screens which is easier to see and keep up with. We did this for only the first class (because of technical difficulties with the projector) and it was a bit disappointing that we did not continue the rest of the class in the same manner.",
                "Strengths: Both halves of the course are very well structured and I learned a lot from both JDRS and Wooster. JDRS's office hours were super helpful for Psets and general understanding and he was a nice, knowledgable, welcoming teacher. I think the asynchronous nature of S&DS 10X is a strength, but you just need to be careful to stay motivated so you do not fall behind on the lectures. Overall I appreciated the asynchronous nature of S&DS 10X. On the other hand, Wooster's S&DS 106 class was only in-person; Wooster has an engaging, hands-on lecture style and I definitely felt that my engagement increased in the second half simply due to being forced to go to class every week. I think asynch worked for S&DS 10X and in-person worked for S&DS 106. Also, the large selection of office hours were helpful for the course.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more time to learn about the coding \/ 106 stuff. We learned a lot for the time we had, but five weeks is not that much time.",
                "The option for asynchronous format was both a strength and a weakness as it gave the flexibility to choose our own schedules as long as we didn't fall behind. Better communication with professor would be beneficial- it sometimes took weeks to receive a reply."

                "Yes I would, as this was a great deal of learning in one class.",
                "Umbrella course: Yes, it teaches important concepts about statistics that help with understanding not only within the STEM world, but across all fields.\r\nS&DS 106: Not really. If you want to learn R, you should probably sign up for another class that teaches it separately since you don't really learn a lot. The statistics application within R is also very limited given students' lack of knowledge. Overall not really worth the chaos of switching.",
