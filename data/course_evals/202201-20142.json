                "The course material is excellent. The books and films were fascinating, and I learnt a huge amount about the position of migrants and \"transfuges de classe\" during the course",
                "Strengths: fascinating corpus, great discussions, reasonable amount of reading per week (first time I've felt like I've been able to do all the readings because they're a manageable length), Professor is fantastic, and she is really good at directing the discussion to keep it lively\r\nWeaknesses: not many, but maybe the cost of the books/ a lot aren't available for rental",
                "I thought the timeline for assignments in this course was incredibly fair. I also really enjoyed how the assignments encouraged us to draw connections between the class and other areas of interest, I wish more classes encouraged this.  The instructor was incredibly thoughtful and really went the extra mile even organizing events outside of class. Only strengths!",
                "This is a fantastic course. The readings (and films) are fascinating and work well together. Mme. Cadieu is great at facilitating discussion, and the papers cover a wide range of writing (and thinking) techniques.",
                "While the course is great for practicing reading, it felt that my speaking skills stayed relatively the same before and after the course. Since many students are around the same level, it would be helpful if the professor corrected us to help us learn more.",
                "this course is founded in a balanced corpus of francophone texts & movies about related topics of social mobility, immigration, gender, race, class, and sexuality. this syllabus provides many voices and approaches to complicated issues of social mobility and identity. \r\n\r\nCadieu also weaves in historical and contemporary theoretical articles as well as interviews with the authors on the syllabus that add depth and context to our readings and discussions.\r\n\r\nthe only change i can think to suggest is that Cadieu provides feedback on the presentation prior to the student presenting. for example, having the student submit their presentation notes / outline a few days beforehand would ensure that the student presents the best possible material since it would have to be formulated and organized beforehand. however, Cadieu could also allow students to pair up for the presentation as pairing up would hold each student accountable since they would be creating and presenting together. there is such strong support for the essay writing (students can send their drafts to the French ENS tutors and Cadieu gives feedback after) but the presentations feel a little like freefall, especially since many students present before ever having written an essay for the class or received feedback. \r\n\r\nthis course because it is one of the best courses i have taken in my 8 semesters at yale, hands down."

I also feel like I read contemporary French books for the first time, after mainly doing historical literature and things like that. It is a really good course.",
                "Yes! If you speak French, please take this class. Amazing professor who offers a lot of insight that you might not be able to get elsewhere. The course material was typically very engaging and interesting. You'll get lots of opportunities to read texts and see films that you otherwise may not have considered. Social mobility and migration are such important topics that we all should be pretty well-versed in",
                "Yes! This is an excellent course. The themes are extremely pertinent especially during this time in life at a place like Yale. Fantastic course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking to improve their French who has some interest in mobility and migration.",
                "I would recommend this course to students already interested in the subjects. The texts are interesting though sometimes feel repetitive.",
                "YES YES YES i cannot recommend literally any class taught by Morgane Cadieu highly enough, she is one of the most amazing professors i have ever had and her courses always encourage thoughtful critical analysis and engagement with peers, text, and professor."
