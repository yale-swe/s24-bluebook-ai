    "Introductory Microeconomics",
    "Economic knowledge about how the world works",
    "I thought it was interesting to put basic economic ideas into graphs and played around with them.",
    "I learned the basic foundations of microeconomics.",
    "Applied psychology! Very interesting models of human behavior in economics.",
    "I didn't know anything about economics before taking this course. This course taught me how to analyze and understand basic market functions and the behavior of consumers and suppliers. I understand so much more about how the economy works.",
    "A thorough introduction to microeconomics",
    "Basic Econ",
    "In my first economics class, i learnt the basics of microeconomics and feel now like I have a much stronger understanding of why things of our daily lives are the way they are.",
    "A little math, ability to think critically about economic problems to apply multiple econ strategies",
    "I learned of the basis of microeconomics, like factors of production, the perfect consumer, supply and demand, bounded rationality, and market structures.",
    "Market structures, how to approach basic economic issues.",
    "I gained an understanding of basic neoclassical economics and the laws of supply and demand.",
    "Market structures such as monopoly, duopolies, monopolistic competition, oligopolies. We learned a lot about factor markets and about labor and capital. Lots about consumer behavior and rational consumer choice.",
    "Gained a very solid foundation into the fundamentals of consumer and producer microeconomic theory as well as how it all tied into the broader economics picture.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into many different aspects of economics and a lot of real-life examples."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of extensions of the material made in class but that often kept us from fully going in-depth on the curriculum and from finishing the book. I felt as if a lot of the concepts had to be more self-taught.",
    "We often went off topic in class with the consequence that we didn't finish the material in the textbook and often didn't go into great detail on the chapters we did learn. I had to teach myself a good amount.",
    "It was fun and decently taught",
    "Improve the explanation of the mathy bits.",
    "Strengths: The course material builds over the course of the semester, so it's easy to build connections between old material and new material. I like that Tolga made a point of giving examples along the way and critiquing each economic model.\r\nWeaknesses: Everything was so theoretical and based on many assumptions. Although, the examples definitely helped. I guess my quarrel is with microeconomics in general.",
    "The particular section that I was in was weird because it was supposed to be a seminar but we ended up having about 40 people in the class. This was a weird size: the point of a seminar is to be able to have small class discussions. I thought the content was good and I liked the textbook that we used.",
    "Strengths: great textbook and interesting information\r\n\r\nWeakness: Tolga oftentimes rushes through material making it difficult to understand. I learned through the book",
    "I think the textbook was very clear and much better than the one used for the lecture class. The seminar format really helped me understand the material by keeping me engaged in the class. I liked the psets and i never felt like we were doing extraneous or irrelevant work. I also think the video lectures available online were very helpful.",
    "Tolga is a fantastic teacher, thorough explanations and interesting anecdotes",
    "It feels like a high school class with a lot of problem solving but no meaningful projects or work",
    "The material is sometimes covered too quickly and it becomes easy to forget, but other than that it was a great class. It would be great if more practice problems could be given.",
    "strengths: professor is fun and friendly, textbook feels mostly accessible \r\nweaknesses: lectures and textbook sometimes did not match so it was difficult to determine what was needed to be understood; math was done extremely quickly during class so people who couldn't do the math as quickly as everyone else struggled hardcore; class size, despite seminar status, made it too difficult to access professor personally and ask questions",
    "More time spent on applications from the book",
    "This seminar ended up being over enrolled so it ended up being more of a lecture. Tolga was good at teaching the material but sometimes it was hard find time to ask questions one on one (his office hours were always full)",
    "We learned a lot during lecture, but sometimes Tolga would digress and talk about his stories, which would leave 10 minutes at the end of the class to rush through complicated concepts. I think if he saves the stories and applications until the end, it would be a lot easier for students to keep up.",
    "I think the class is well organized and Tolga has obviously practiced the delivery of many of the lessons year after year. However, he sometimes struggles a bit with time management and isn't able to finish the lessons fully. Overall I don't necessarily feel that I gained a huge amount to knowledge or an understanding of\/way of looking at modern economic issues. That may be something that you need higher level classes in order to grasp.",
    "The curve in this class is absolutely brutal (although it is just the normal econ department curve; it's the class's small size that is the problem) and takes some of the enjoyment out of it because you can feel the competition between everyone. However, forcing everyone to work incredibly hard was also a strength of the class; I do feel like I learned a lot.",
    "The class was well-taught and well-structured. I just wish that more study tools were available at times, as often the textbook examples didn't match what we were covering in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Its such a classic yale course",
    "Yes. It can be a bit dull and pseudo-sciency at times, but I learned a lot about basic economics and what makes trade tick.",
    "It's a good intro course for getting into economics. It's very theoretical and makes a lot of assumptions, but the ideas are interesting and self-consistent when you put them into graphs.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn microeconomics in a smaller classroom setting.",
    "Yes! A great introduction to economics - but difficult so beware",
    "Yes. No matter what you want to major in, this class is a good thing to take. Understanding the basic functions of the economy can help you understand a lot about policy and make rational decisions about your own finances. It's a really good and useful QR credit. Tolga is also just a great guy. If you can get into his section, take it with him. I suck at math (placed into 110 and didn't take it) and I was fine. All you need is basic algebra and the ability to take simple derivatives.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction and I think a good way to determine whether or not you are interested in persuing econ further",
    "Yes because it is an interesting QR",
    "Yes, it is a must to understand much of the world around us.",
    "Yes, but that it's difficult for students who haven't done math in a long time. Econ is an extremely interesting topic and Tolga makes it fun with his stories, but econ still seems to be an exclusive major at schools like Yale.",
    "This class gave me a great background on microeconomics, a class I had never taken before. I would recommend it to anyone who had never taken an economics class before.",
    "Yes, it is good to know the general info this class taught",
    "Not unless you need it",
    "Yes, but the grade is curved based on your seminar class, which can be stressful.",
    "Yes, good foundational course in Economics. Tolga is also an amazing professor.",
    "If you're a prospective econ major and need intro micro, this is a great option, or if you really want a very good foundation in econ. Otherwise stick with the lecture, as it will be less stress grade-wise.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was incredibly educational while also never being boring due to all of the real-life applications."
