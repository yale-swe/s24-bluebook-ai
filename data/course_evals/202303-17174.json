                "We worked our way through about 16 chapters of Susan Shelmerdine's Latin textbook. By the end of the course, we were able to read pretty lengthy stories in Latin written by our professor, and we could even read a little bit of authentic text. This class is great for starting off an education in Latin grammar!",
                "Having never taken Latin before, and only Spanish, this class proved invaluable for me not only in introducing myself to the language, but to the nature of etymology and derivation, as well as to philosophy of language. The course speeds through several declensions, verb forms, etc, as well as some classical history. I learned much about Greco-Roman culture, and I gained the skill of translation as well as of composition."

                "It was well structured. Definitely picked up in difficult in the last month",
                "I think this is a great course! It is an intensive introduction to Latin, and I am not sure how it could be improved.",
                "Its strengths are its regularity and I am unaware of any weaknesses, only perhaps the exponential speed at which the intensity increases within the last two to three weeks of class.",
                "I really liked how small the class size was, because everyone go the opportunity to participate every day and ask questions. I also enjoyed the frequent quizzing because it kept me engaged with the material.",
                "Strengths: I am very fond of James's teaching style: rather than having submittable homework assignments, we have 2-3 micro-quizzes every week, which start at the beginning of class and last about 3 minutes. The quizzes are always announced the day before and are a great way to ensure that no one falls behind in the curriculum and vocabulary (and also that we all arrive to class on time!). James also provided us with a lot of reading practice and even gave us Latin composition exercises (wherein we translated English sentences into Latin), which I all found to be great ways to practice our Latin.\r\nThis class didn't have any weaknesses to me. The one thing I will say is that, since I already read ancient Greek, the grammar was very familiar for me, so the class was a little bit slow for me. So, that's just something to expect if you already know ancient Greek and choose to take this class (as a Classics major, for instance).",
                "The course is strong in that it gives students a quick but dense introduction to latin and Greco-Roman history, as well as to the skills of translation and composition. Its daily structure and frequent low-stakes quizzes were also a plus for helping make the course manageable.\r\n\r\nIt is weak in that it could expose us to more classical and literary history beyond just the grammar."
