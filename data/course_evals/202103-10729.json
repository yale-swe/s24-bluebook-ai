Assignments often required us to ponder further research questions for a given topic and I believe this drastically improved by ability to propose interesting and relevant research questions. Finally, the class provided the class with me with many insights which allowed me to become aware of these relationship dynamics within my own personal relationships.",

The knowledge was very applicable to my life, and I learned a lot that I now use to look at my interactions with a new lense. It was just what I expected out of the class, and I was always very engaged with the content because it was super interesting.",

I also learned a lot about how psychologists conduct relationship research",

I think everything i learned in this class is so much more useful than the topics I learn in others. everything could be directly applied to bettering my life or my friends lives. also, it really made relationship science seem as important as it truly is and now I am seriously considering relationship research.",

First, we talked about what different people bring into relationships: attachment styles, self-esteem levels, and beliefs in destiny vs. growth. Then, we discussed what people are attracted to and different aspects/phenomenon of relationships (communal relationships, social support, positive illusions, etc.). After discussing sex and consensual non-monogamy, we talked about how relationships help with self-growth and discovery. After the midterm, we discussed the stresses and strains that relationships face before relationship dissolution (whether that be breaking up or the death of a loved one) and life after closeness. We then had a few lectures which were more freestyle in discussing other interesting aspects of relationships--motivations, symbolic social bonds, relationships and health, and identity in relationships. \r\n\r\nSome of my personal takeaways have been the importance of showing gratitude, self-expansion, and being vulnerable (balanced with self-protection) with others.",

I learned a lot about romantic, platonic, and familial relationships as well as gained a lot of insight into the psychology behind everyday interactions. This class is not supposed to be a self-help course, but it equipped me with a lot of skills to use when forming new and maintaining old bonds with others. It also provided a lot of tools for introspection of my own patterns and behaviors.",

                "This class made me cryin the best way possible. My most vivid memory of the course was a lecture Prof. Hirsch did on gratitude that left half the lecture hall bawling and the other half rushing outside the lecture hall to call their parents and tell them \"I love you.\" The course gave me many personal insights into my relationships and how to navigate my personal love life. The course went over extensive up-to-date research on relationships science, giving me broad knowledge on relevant studies, some of which are still ongoing.",
                "This was a great class to become more self aware as well as aware of how others think and behave in regards to relationships. We learned about how various things affect relationships that you might not initially think about (stress, socioeconomic status, etc.) and how to better create and maintain healthy relationships.",
                "Theory and studies behind the science of relationships (romantic, friendship, etc.).",

Why relationships work the way they do, what makes relationships healthy vs. unhealthy, why are we attracted to certain people, and considering how attachment styles affect all of this. And especially concepts that aren't immediately obvious but still really important, like how relationships affect personal health. I also found it really insightful to be critical of studies' research methods and how certain populations are oversampled and how this affects relationship science and our understanding of relationships.",
                "We learned about the lifecycle of a relationship, from beginning (relationship initiation phases) all the way through breakups and divorces. This class was not a self-help class (as described in the syllabus). However, I had found the research we learned about to be applicable to my life and relationships.",
                "I learned about the psychology of attraction and the initiation, continuation, and dissolution of relationships.",

I gained insight into the science behind a lot of my thoughts and actions, which has helped me gain control over them. I also learned how to read research articles critically which has been helpful in other classes.",

Also, the teaching staff was super accomodating and it was obvious that they were looking out for the wellbeing of their students.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the way in which it teaches you think critically about research. A weakness of this course is that sometimes labs, although highly interesting, were not incredibly relevant to subjects being discussed in class.",
                "- very organised lay out\r\n- hard exams",
                "Everything about this course was AMAZING. I would keep it the way it is.",
                "Strengths - lectures, they are amazing and so engaging!\r\nWeaknesses - the assignments were kind of pointless and they were also graded very strictly when they didn't tell us what they were looking for",

                "Strengths - The material was very interested and applicable to our daily lives. Dr. Hirsch is a wonderful speaker and the lecture slides were very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses - I think the material could be a bit intuitive at times, but overall very engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course were both the content, itself, and the homework assignments. The classes were interesting and enjoyable because I learned so much, and the homework helped to expand my education even more. I found a love for data manipulation and collection through those assignments because it involves an aspect of creativity. The weaknesses were solely that lectures were sometimes boring, but that was very rare.",
                "Strengths: Very flexible format and extremely well organizedthe lecture and notes are detailed, and the exams relaxing. Hirsch really cares about her students and giving us optionswe also had the option to watch recordings, a free late day for written assignments, and taking the final virtually due to COVID circumstances. Writing assignments every other week were also relaxed and fun!",
                "Strengths: Instructions for assignments and exams was very clear, and the course was incredibly organized. I really appreciated this throughout such a tumultuous semester returning from online learning. And Dr. Hirsch is such an engaging lecturer!",
                "Assignments should be more related to the material we're studying",

                "Strengths: Professor Hirsch is fabulous. She's very accommodating and understanding of student needs -- she really tries to make students' lives a little easier by posting slides ahead of time, allowing open-note exams, having clear and manageable homework/essay assignments, etc. She's also a really engaging lecturer and explains concepts super clearly. Weaknesses: there were a few guest lectures throughout the semester. While they were interesting, and I do see why Professor Hirsch would include them, it was also a bit difficult to adapt to each lecturer's individual style.",
                "strengths: the organization, the spaced out due dates, the midterm/final exams were some of my favorite exams i've ever taken, the readings were only ever relevant and the textbook was so interesting, professor hirsch is an incredibly lecturer and brought in amazing guest speakers. \r\n\r\nweakness: i truly cannot think of one",

                "A strength of this course was that it was offered in multiple formats (remote, live, recorded). Both a strength and weakness of this course was that the workload was light. Because we had fewer assignments, this class was not heavy workload, but that also meant that each assignment was worth a lot of points which occasionally caused some stress.",

I felt excluded when it was implied that only asexual people aren't actively having sex all the time, while in reality there are people who chose not to for religious reasons\r\nSometimes I got points off in assignments for things that weren't outlines in the assignment page\r\nFrustrating when there were wifi problems on midterm",

However, there are times where it gets confusing how things are related to one another, for example, which points are subpoints and which points are main points. That being said, if one goes through their notes after the lecture, it becomes a lot clearer. Perhaps it would be useful to have a slide outlining each lecture's topics and the beginning of the class. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, the homework assignments were more interesting in the beginning but became more annoying than informative in the second half of the course. The first half of the course consisted of reading research papers and answering reading response questions while the second half of the course consisted of conducting a (very) simple lab \"experiment\" and writing about diversity in research. I don't know how much the \"experiment\" contributed to learning the course content. It could have been more interesting to ask us to apply what we were learning in class to real-life experiences similar to what we need to do on exams.",

                "I hope the research assignments were more engaging and not just completing questions as if on a pset.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Hirsch is great, the content is interesting and well organized, we got to have guest lecturers, the lectures are live-streamed and recorded in addition to in person and the notes are posted, the larger assignments are clearly laid out and the exams are in class and open book. \r\nWeaknesses: This isnt technically an intro course, so you will also need to take intro psych if you need it for a prereq.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures and material, manageable workload",
                "Strengths: Prof Hirsch is great! She's a very engaging lecturer and you get to think a lot about the relationships in your life. Also, professor Hirsch is so incredibly thoughtful and understanding that she will not only try to make lecture relatable but understands that being a student is a tough job in itself. \r\nWeaknesses: If you've ever taken a psychology course before the material may get repetitive. A lot of the lecture material can be quite obvious (i.e. gratitude is great and so if being emotionally supported). However, Prof Hirsch always ties in really interesting psychological research findings, and so I think you should go in expecting to be more in awe of the research and how it is conducted rather than the results themselves. A lot of the results are self-explanatory but how they quantify that kind of research is quite fascinating.",
                "This course is a large lectureand at times I felt the assignments were a bit impersonal and too easy (not as much deep engagement or challenge that I would've preferred, but that, of course, is my personal preference). The strengths are the engaging way that Prof. Hirsch crafts the lectures to break down the readingsshe is an absolutely amazing lecturer! Another weakness is that textbook readings are long and at times feel repetitive to lecturetherefore most people I knew saved textbook readings for last minute the night before exams.",
                "I thought the way it was done was solid, maybe some more in class activities or discussions could make it more engaging but it's tricky with covid.",
                "I wished the course got a bit more specific - while I did enjoy seeing the studies and theories  sometimes it felt like we were just seeing proof for things we already inherently knew.",
                "The course was amazing! The only issue I had was that I thought the assignment grading was verryy nitpicky, and I took issue with some of the things I was marked off for (like not including certain things in my answers that the questions didn't really ask for).",
                "The class is quite engaging. Professor Hirsh is amazing and genuinely cares about our wellbeing. Exams were very doable. I wouldn't call it a gut but its about as gutty as a psych class can be in my opinion.",
                "I think this is a great intro course in that it assumes no prior knowledge. Lectures were recordedd, which meant you didn't have to come to class. However, I would have hoped for more transparency in grading sometimes (we had a substitute TF for some time and it felt like they were grading harsher than what I used to from this class). \r\nThe professor is incredibly kind, articulate, and understanding, though! She offers a grace day, which is a single opportunity in the semester where you can turn in an assignment a day late for any reason. It was really reassuring to know that I could take advantage of that day if I had an emergency or had a lot going on.",
                "I think the content of this course was very interesting and relevant to students' lives! I liked the structure of completing the homework however I felt the homework was a little bit disconnected from the actual material we were learning.  think a weakness was that the lecture was honestly too long. Especially in the second half of the semester, I felt that I knew the general ideas and themes of the lesson within the first 20-30 minutes and the last 20-30 minutes of class especially felt extremely repetitive/redundant.",
                "Strengths include the professor. Jennifer Hirsch was the best professor I had this semester and I am so grateful for that, as first semester of freshman year is a huge adjustment. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "The course is very organized and the work is evenly distributed throughout the weeks which made it easy to keep on top of. Expect an overview of a TON of relationship science research, but none of it was particularly mindblowing.",
                "The course material is great and Professor Hirsch is a clear lecturer. \r\n\r\nTo keep class engagement during lectures, I would've liked to see more activities/partner discussions/demonstrations of principles with student participation."

                "Yes!! Very interesting stuff, and all of it is very applicable to basically any kind of human social relationship.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it provides students with a much greater conception of the underlying dynamics which drive all kinds of relationships as well as why individuals often act the way they do within relationships.  The studies discussed in lecture are often highly interesting and represent creative efforts which have furthered the study of relationships.",
                "yes but it is not a gut !",
                "Yes! This course has been my favorite course I've taken at Yale so far. It is so well designed, so perfectly facilitated, and taught by a wonderful professor. Dr. Hirsch is committed to keeping the course updated as new research comes out, and she lectures in a way that makes following the content really easy. If you have any interest in psychology or relationships, this class is PERFECT, and you should take it!",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much in this course, and it actually helped me intellectualize my own relationship and feel more adept at facing relationship struggles. Prof Hirsch is a gem, and makes class interesting and fun to attend. Just cause this is a gut does NOT mean you should not take it. I actually learned a lot, and since there wasn't too much material, I was able to engage with it fully.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Hirsch is a gem",
                "yes!",
                "If you are interested in learning about why we interact the way that we do with others, then yes! I thought it was an interesting course, although the theories and concepts that we learned felt rather intuitive and were not groundbreaking. I wouldn't go into the class expecting your mind to be blown, but it is cool to learn about the studies that back up relationship theories.",
                "I would because it is both a fun, interesting, and important class. The things you learn in this class translate into your everyday life which is super cool.",
                "Absolutely!! The course is extremely well organizedthe lecture and notes are detailed, and the exams relaxing. Hirsch really cares about her students and giving us optionswe also had the option to watch recordings, a free late day for written assignments, and taking the final virtually due to COVID circumstances. Writing assignments every other week were also relaxed and fun!",
                "Yes, if you want a really easy 5th class or (honestly) a gut. It's an organized and interesting gut though, so no shame in taking it! I left the class with so many new lessons learned and was excited to share things I had learned with my friends and family outside of the class.",
                "Yes!! Prof. Hirsch is a gem.",
                "Yes! Professor Hirsch is amazing and presents the topics in a way that invites real learning but also isnt inaccessible to non-psych majors.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would. The material is interesting and it is not an overwhelming work load. The professor is very approachable.",
                "I'd highly recommend this class to any Yale student! It's a very manageable course for students with heavy workloads, and the class is super interesting and relevant to students' everyday lives. Professor Hirsch is an absolute gem, the TFs are helpful, and the class is overall a really enjoyable experience!",
                "YES, if you care about relationships or find them at all interesting this is the best class ever. I think so many more people need to be taking this because it truly just teaches you so much about humanity and then just really draws you into relationship science and as someone who is not really interested in research this class has made me VERY excited about the prospect of research. also professor hirsch is an incredible and caring professor and mentor",
                "Yes!!! Its a great 5th credit. You have to do some work but the exams are open note and the labs are pretty straightforward.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed Dr. Hirsch and the material we covered in class was very interesting.",
                "Yes for sure. One of the best courses at Yale",
                "Yes! It's great because it's super applicable to life and a fun way to learn psych",
                "Yes. Although Professor Hirsch is clear that this is not a self help course it is extremely interesting to apply what we learned to your own life.",
                "I would recommend the course if you are looking for an easy but interesting class. I think that a lot of the conclusions and topics that are taught are quite obvious when they are talked about during lectures. However, there are some interesting and new takeaways that can change the way that you look at and understand relationships. Professor Hirsch is a great lecturer so classes are enjoyable to attend and listen to.",
                "Yes! Amazing class. Really interesting research. Very up to date. Applicable.",
                "I would recommend this course to others, even if it has nothing to do with their major. It is something I think everyone should take before graduating from Yale.",
                "Yes! It is overall a great intro course, has interesting material, and the professor is lovely.",
                "Yes, definitely. A lot of useful material in it which is applicable to real life, even if you aren't interested in psychology.",
                "Yes, I would just give the warning that the TF's aren't great and are REALLY nit picky for assignments in a way that makes assignments a dread because you know they're going to take dumb points off.",
                "Yes! It was excellent!",
                "yes definitely content was super engaging loved the teacher and it wasn't super hard to understand",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! The lectures are extremely interesting and engaging. The content of the class is extremely applicable to our every-day lives, and I felt as though I gained many skills outside of the class.",
                "Yes 100% a lot of fun and you learn a lot about yourself and your relationships while also having fun assignments that are nice and enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend for an easy, fairly interesting class.",
                "Yes; the course is extremely interesting and can be applied to the real world and your individual life easily.",
                "Yes! It's not a huge workload and also a very interesting introduction to relationship psychology",
                "If you put literally any effort in, you will get an A. Its also legitimately the most fun and interesting class Ive ever taken. Super relevant to real life and you learn some instantly applicable stuff to relationships (from friendships to romantic relationships). I dont care who you are or what you want to major in, take this class.",
                "I would recommended! Dr. Hirsch is a great lecturer and I learned a lot about relationship science. Be advised that labs do not mean you will be in a lab but are assignments that you work on online.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for those new to psych and for those with more psych experience",
                "Yes! Especially if you need a slightly easier course that is still really interesting. I will say don't go in expecting to be a relationship expert, and if you are a psych major you may find this class a bit repetitive.",
                "I would absolutely recommend! This course is life-changing, as the first course I took at Yale, this has given me so many insights into my romantic, platonic, and familial relationships that I wouldn't trade for the world. Workload is light, content is engaging, and the professor is nice and understanding and charismatic.",
                "This is a great class if you want a chill course where you'll learn useful and interesting content. The assignments were not stressful and the content was super helpful in better understanding the self and also your relationships.",
                "This was a straight-forward and solid psyc lecture. You get out of it what you want to.",
                "Yes absolutely! The material is very interesting, Dr. Hirsch is a great professor, and the workload's light. The material is relevant to everyone's personal life so it's cool to look at your life and your own relationships from a different perspective. And for anyone wanting to learn about a new field, relationship science is great to explore.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! I think this class is a must for every student at Yale and relationships -- professional and personal -- play a role in all of our lives!",
                "Yes, this class was excellent and I am very glad I took it!",
                "Yess. Its such a wonderful and interesting class and Professor Hirsch is wonderful.",
                "Yeah its pretty straightforward material. It is more work than people usually say it is and sometimes the grading is a little more specific. Some assignments I would spend a fair amount of time on and do worse than another assignment I would finish quite quickly. If youre okay with that, as well as having a final, final project and an assignment over Thanksgiving Break then go for it.",
                "yes very interesting material",
                "I feel like this is one of the better psych lectures offered at Yale. It is interesting, the workload is manageable, the lectures are as engaging as they could be, and the assignments and exams are fair. Personally, I didn't learn anything mindblowing or brand new, but I don't regret taking the course.",
                "YES!! If you are lucky enough to get in, definitely take this class! You will learn so much, the content is really organized, the assignments are straightforward and interesting, and Professor Hirsch is not only an amazing lecturer, but also very understanding and kind! (They are super strict with deadlines though lol)",
                "Yes, it's a fun psych elective that covers interesting topics that are applicable to daily life.",
                "Yes. A very enjoyable, interesting class that does not take up too much brain power :)"
