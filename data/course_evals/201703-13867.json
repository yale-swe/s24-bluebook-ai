    "I learned college level writing and yale writing expectations",
    "In this class I learned how to speak with confidence, and write with a clear purpose.",
    "In this course, I was introduced to college writing and encouraged to break the formulaic molds I had learned in high school. I also was challenged in my perception of what makes the sacred and the secular. I developed my ability to read and understand complicated philosophical texts.",
    "How to write an academic parper and evaluate arguments",
    "I learned how to critically analyze difficult texts and write college level essays from a research paper to a personal narrative. I also gained insight into the state of secularity in America."

   "comments": [
    "too much focus on reading other people's writings as opposed to spending more time improving our own",
    "It was a great, well-organized introductory English course.",
    "Strengths would be the teaching style, where it is a small seminar style class. Weaknesses would be the reading, where I think it should be more varied.",
    "The course was strong in its structure. I felt like every class had a distinct purpose and the section did not feel institutionalized in any way, although it was a part of a bigger course. I felt like there could have been more of a balance between the writing exercises and discussions of the section topic though.",
    "The teacher didn't create an engaging environment for the students nor did she choose interesting texts. Despite the goal of an engaging writing based class on an interesting topic, most of the real skill development was outside of class writing papers, without assistance from the teacher.",
    "Lots of interesting readings",
    "Class discussions allowed us to develop a better understanding of the texts and the revision process became optimized throughout the semester. Successful peer editing on google docs made the process of revision go a lot smoother."

   "comments": [
    "If you are intrigued in the section topic then yes, if not then its annoying discussing the same topic over and over again.",
    "I would recommend this course if writing is not your forte. It helps you learn how to structure your essays properly, and how to clearly have a purpose in your writing. This specific section, also let me think critically about the affect of religion in our lives, and Felisa is a great professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to first-years looking to fulfill a WR credit. However, there a lot more interesting ways to accomplish the same thing.",
    "I would not recommend this at all. Take 120",
    "It is really important to know how to write well",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it facilitates the development of college level writing and analytical skills."
