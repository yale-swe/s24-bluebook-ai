                "My vocabulary of Spanish words and phrases expanded a lot, and my listening, reading, and speaking skills got better throughout the semester. I learned about Latin American legal systems, which was interesting because they are very distinct from the American system since they use civil law instead of common law.",
                "I gained lots of knowledge about the legal system and laws in Spain vs other countries. I also gained knowledge on current event and crisis in Latin American countries via podcasts.",
                "I think this course gave me a great introduction to law in general, comparative Latin American law and comparative Latin American politics while also significantly improving my Spanish speaking and writing skills.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! I improved my listening and writing skills a lot.",
                "really improved my spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills",
                "This is a great introductory law course, especially given that Yale doesn't have a Pre-Law major. The material is accessible and well-taught. I'm glad to have gotten a comprehensive overview of law, especially in Latin American nations.",
                "I learned about legal codes in many countries and advanced my Spanish speaking abilities",
                "I mainly sharpened my Spanish writing and comprehension skills. The weekly podcasts / writing assignments (if you seriously do them) helped me improve my Spanish skills. Though I didnt practice my Spanish speaking much outside of occasional class participation.\r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about social and political issues in South America. Professor Carreras did an amazing job at picking weekly topics on different countries (check the syllabus to see if they interest you).",
                "I learned how to get faster at busy work. I dont feel like the homework was conducive to learning/thinking about the material (a lot of easy comprehension questions rather than fewer thought provoking ones), and classes were mostly pretty dry lectures about legal vocabulary.",
                "I learned about current events in Latin America and how they tie to their respective laws and regulations.",
                "I learned about some general legal concepts and principles in the Spanish-speaking world. We would read sections of actual legal code from various countries in class. The biggest advantage to this class Spanish-wise is just getting practice reading, writing, and speaking Spanish.",
                "I learned about laws in the Latin world and how they tie into current-day news events. I also learned how to read, write, and speak about complex legal topics in Spanish in a way that allows me to make my own critique on topics.",
                "I learned to quickly read and write in Spanish, and I was exposed to a variety of current events occurring throughout the Spanish speaking world."

                "I learned a lot from the classes that were lectures about different aspects of legal systems (nationality, crimes, etc.), but it would've been nice if these classes could incorporate more student participation and practice speaking. I found the classes where we discussed a podcast that we listened to for homework less useful-- we had already listened to the podcast and answered the questions before coming to class, so I didn't really get anything out of going over the questions again. Additionally, the grading of written homework assignments felt very erratic and inconsistent.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, podcasts were very relevant and educational!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes HW would take a long time to do, inhibiting me to actually enjoy the podcast, as I was constantly worried about other HW I had to do on top of these longs assignments.",
                "I think this course does a great job of creating interesting class discussions around topics are genuinely interested in. However, some of the lectures felt disconnected from the homework. As well, the homework often felt like busy work. Also I rarely understood the feedback or the grade I got on my assignments.",
                "I thought it was great learning about current events in Latin America and around the world. It was a good way for me to practice my Spanish and reading comprehension",
                "This class is what you make it. If you take advantage of the opportunity to speak spanish  your skills will improve",
                "Strengths  Feel very comfortable participating; Professor Carreras is kind\r\nWeaknesses  LOTS of writing, especially with the podcast assignments.",
                "Strengths are that the subject matter is interesting. Weaknesses are that it was poorly organized and ended up not covering many of the most interesting parts of law.",
                "Weaknesses: You dont practice speaking much, you often wont know the assignments until the week of, you wont have much transparency on how anything is graded, the weekly assignments can sometimes be needless busywork, you dont really learn many tangible things about law \r\n\r\nStrengths: You can seriously improve your Spanish if you put effort into the weekly assignments, you can learn about interesting social/political issues in South America that arent widely covered in US media, you will have a relatively consistent workload (2-4 hours a wee).",
                "Strength is that it is relatively little time commitment. Weakness is that I dont feel like I learned a lot and it wasnt a very engaging class. I think making the homework assignments less like busy work and more about a deeper understanding of the material would help. I also think less vocal-focused class time and more discussion would help.",
                "I think it was a very interesting class overall. The weekly assignments can be a bit much (especially when there are multiple), but it gets less heavy towards the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: The curriculum is flexible and varied. We read a lot about current events from all over the Spanish-speaking world (super current: the syllabus is filled with articles from within 6 months of when the course starts). Sra. Carreras is really sweet.\r\nWeaknesses: the class lacks an overarching theme. It does not feel like it is leading up to anything by the end of the semester.",
                "The course material and class dialogue were always interesting and a definite strength of the course. The biggest weakness I can think of is the fact that office hours times were not flexible. Unless you were able to stay after class and did not have a scheduling conflict, it was difficult to get detailed feedback on assignments.",
                "Strengths: the amount of reading and writing really forces you to develop strong Spanish writing skills, which I found very useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class itself wasn't very engaging or organized. While it was advertised as a class to understand more about Spanish legal systems, the class often became a series of 18-person lectures, while our homework and graded material did not require us to understand much about Spanish legalityrather, our homework revolved around podcasts and assignments about Spanish current events. The class sometimes felt disorganized and instructions were confusing, since the syllabus, Canvas page, and oral instructions all gave different due dates, while the syllabus did not align with the pace of the class. Our homework assignments, which were either written responses to articles or fact-based questions to podcasts, felt mundane: the sheer quantity some weeks (two 2 page responses and sometimes 80+ questions to answer per week) became exhausting and frequently overwhelming. The questions, especially, felt arduous and took immense amounts of time while not particularly improving my Spanish ability. As a non-native speaker, ot was also difficult to understand the professor, since she spoke quickly and quietly."

            "comments": [
                "I would hesitate to recommend this class to other students. I took this class because I wanted to practice my Spanish, I wanted to learn a bit about Latin American legal systems, and I wanted a lighter workload class. The classes were not designed to get students to practice speaking in Spanish, so I don't feel like I got to practice Spanish in class as much as I would have wanted. That being said, I think my reading and listening skills did improve. We learned a bit of content about the legal system, but about half of the classes were spent talking about random podcasts or news articles about something that happened in the Spanish-speaking world, and it was unclear how these discussions of current events were supposed to relate to the legal concepts we were learning about. I also would caution that this class is not as light of a workload as its reputation would suggest-- you have weekly assignments that take on average 3-4 hours to complete. One major reason that I would probably not recommend this class is that the professor was quite disorganized and did not respond to student emails. A syllabus was posted, but she told us early in the semester to ignore the syllabus, and she would post our homework on Canvas. But she sometimes did not post the homework until a day before it was due, which is quite inconvenient when it takes 3-4 hours to complete. When I emailed her with a question about the homework, she would never respond to my emails. She also once cancelled our class and then, an hour before it would have met, sent a canvas announcement un-cancelling our class, which was also quite inconvenient.",
                "Yes, it was a very insightful course and I learned a lot of new things. Class is also structured in a fun way to engage with the professor and peers, having presentation, games, and discussions.",
                "I think for students who are really interested in law and politics as well as improve their Spanish speaking and writing skills. However, there are some weeks where the workload is quite heavy.",
                "Yes! It was a great course",
                "yes",
                "Yes, especially those pursuing a certificate in Spanish.",
                "Yes, if they take initiative and try to understand the readings independent of the class. I never fully grasped the actual content.",
                "If you want a way to practice your Spanish reading and writing and some speaking , this could be a good class. It isnt as gutty as some may say  i spent about 3 hours at least on the hw a week , with occasional 5+ hour weeks. But these assignments were on interesting topics and helped improve me reading and writing.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a legit Spanish gut, this may not be it (Im not sure that a Spanish gut truly exists). To get an A or A-, youll have to participate consistently in class and do about 3-5 hours of Spanish work a week.",
                "If youre very motivated by the material, you can get a lot out of this class, but that would require a lot of outside work (ie actually listening to the assigned podcasts and thinking about them, rather than searching the transcription for answers to the insane number of silly homework questions about tiny details).",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in current events in Latin America and law. If you are trying to find an L5 Spanish class, I would recommend this one.",
                "If they want an easy Spanish class, yes. If they want a class that is engaging or intellectually challenging, no.",
                "Yes! Professor Carreras cares a lot about her students' success and learning process. I began the course having never written an essay before in Spanish, but the coursework helped build the ability to write a ten-page final (and having a lot of fun doing it). I also really enjoyed how our study of written law was combined with podcasts that made us think about the current applications of these ancient laws.",
                "It's a doable L5 Spanish credit; though the workload can be a bit demanding, the homework assignments don't require you to understand the in-class content. If you're a Global Affairs major or need an L5 credit, this class works, especially for non-native speakers. I'd make sure to look at other classes, though."
