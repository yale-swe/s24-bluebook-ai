                "Strengths: access to darkroom, time to print in class, access to equipment, provided paper for us to print with, Lisa and our TA made themselves accessible.\r\nWeaknesses: would've loved more critiques of work, to get feedback on how photographs could've been improved, but I did enjoy the supportive nature of the critiques we did have",
                "we had so much freedom to take whatever photos we wanted, and freedom throughout the course to make what we wanted of it, which I appreciated. Improvement: very difficult to understand the reasoning behind given grades.",
                "Strengths of this course are that you learn a totally new skill in a relatively stress-free environment. The only thing I can think of to improve is making the first half of the course where we learn how to use the enlargers, the darkroom, how to develop & print film happen in the first couple of classes instead of extending this for several weeks."

                "Great course if you are interested in learning the film photography workflow, and you have time to spend in the darkroom.",
                "Yes! Take a photo class at Yale, it's such a great experience to have access to a darkroom space, to be in the company of other artists, and to learn from those in the art department. I really enjoyed this class and made a lot of pictures that I'll walk away with to add to my portfolio but also that I just like in general.",
                "Yes, it's really such a cool thing to know, to develop film.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! One of my top favorites, a class where you come in excited to be there, and you come back after class for hours on end excited to do your work and make new things! Relatively stressless if you give yourself enough time to print and develop in advance of big critiques. The critiques are focused on improvement rather than tearing your work apart. You have a real opportunity to learn without any fear of judgement or people trying to be smarter than one another - a unique class for this place."
