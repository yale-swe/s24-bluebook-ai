                "Participating in Anthropology 542: Cultures & Markets in Asia in the fall of 2023 was an enriching experience that greatly complemented my research direction.  The course's comprehensive content provided me with a deep understanding of the complex interplay between Asian culture and markets, knowledge that is directly applicable to analyzing the impact of Chinese state-led propaganda on perceptions and daily interactions at the Wanbao Rice Farm in Mozambique. For me, one of the main strengths of this course was the in-depth exploration of cultural dynamics in Asia and their interrelationship with economic activity, especially in the agricultural sector. This insight has been invaluable in my research at the Wanbao Rice Farm, allowing me to critically examine how propaganda influences employees' understanding of project goals and their cross-cultural communication skills.\r\n\r\nThrough the course's focus on real-world cases and its encouragement of critical thinking, I developed crucial analytical skills. Taking into account the broader socio-political context and the underlying motivations of Chinese propaganda, I can now approach my research with a more nuanced perspective.  The course also enhanced my methodological skills, particularly in qualitative research.  Engagement with various research methodologies has equipped me with the tools to effectively analyze oral history records, media reports, and documentaries. These skills are crucial for my project, which aims to uncover the underlying motivations behind the Chinese government's narrative and its impact on the value judgments of Chinese employees at the Wanbao Rice Farm.",
                "I learned about new anthropological approaches to understanding how agents throughout history have interacted with and through markets. Professor Siu emphasizes searching for  encounters in unexpected places, especially over ocean-based connections. The course was super interesting and has great readings!",
                "- Gaining knowledge about a connected Asia in the past and present from an anthropological perspective\r\n- Learning with a prominent and mature scholar and being deeply influenced by her critical humanitarian attitude\r\n- Having some access to the social and cultural theories that inform anthropologists in their research\r\n- Being exposed to the research methods anthropologists use to explore the answers of their questions",
                "This course provided students with relevant knowledge and critical thinking skills. These included carefully compiled theme-based readings that covered large areas of the discipline but provided succinct examples by researchers and practitioners using the skills learned in class."

I would not have believed it was possible to learn as much as I did had I not been there."

                "Yes!",
