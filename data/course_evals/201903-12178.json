   "comments": [
    "This course was interesting in helping students think critically about how to analyze historical analogies.",
    "I felt I improved my historical reasoning and critical thinking skills. I also practiced synthesizing the arguments of multiple authors through the weekly short response papers.",
    "General American military history",
    "Learned about how historical analogies influence foreign policymaking.",
    "Learned about various lessons that can be taken from major American historical events.",
    "An understanding of the uses of the past in examining current policy issues. More broadly, excellent insight into the problem of US foreign policy in the 20th and 21st centuries.",
    "This course deeply reshaped my understanding of the relevance of history to foreign policy decision making. It also was a meaningful exercise in critical thinking as it required students to extract common lessons from a series of disparate historical events. This course stoked motivation to take additional history courses at Yale and to understand contemporary events in a historical context as opposed to considering them in isolation. Lessons of the Past also provided students with comprehensive instruction on how to utilize Yale archives.",
    "Research skills, historical content, and a different point of view on american foreign policy and critical reading of history.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a clear idea of the ways in which history should not be used by policy-makers. Along the way, my peers and I got to read an assortment of fascinating books, learn about (debatably successful) mini-methods, and engage in thoughtful discussions. Also, I had never used the Yale Archives prior to this course and, through our midterm and final papers, grew extremely familiar with this resource."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course is the small class size. The intimate seminar allows for good discussion. The weaknesses of this course, however, were the discussions themselves. They often were disconnected, and seemed to never reach an insightful point or conclusion. There is also a large amount of reading to be done each week. It was manageable to complete the reading but quite frustrating that we would only discuss one or two of the five assigned pieces in class.",
    "Seminars were generally engaging, though sometimes a bit unstructured. Both of the paper assignment were meaningful and somewhat different than anything I'd written before because of the emphasis on lessons from the past.",
    "Was very confused by this course-- I never really figured out what the \"thesis\" of the class was, and the readings were all over the place and seemed outdated\/easy to discredit. Both the readings and the discussions were usually overly generic and I don't think I learned anything about substantive policy. The guidelines for the assignments were unclear. That being said, the archival piece of the class was fascinating and I really enjoyed writing the final paper.",
    "The course was fairly monotonous and the discussions got a bit redundant. It would have been nice to switch up the structure of class or conversations a couple of times.",
    "Strength--> amazing readings on creating effective interventions\r\nWeakness--> American-centric history and historical lessons and absolutely no discussion that questions the need for American intervention to begin with",
    "Really great course: as we mentioned in class, the readings could be re-ordered and re-shuffled, and more specific examples (perhaps from the perspective of countries other than the United States) could be introduced. But, overall, a really great class that I found both useful and fun.",
    "This course could include a greater degree of diversity. However, the professor was extremely generous with his time outside of class in office hours and his insight and I appreciated that.",
    "I particularly enjoyed this course because it gave students a distinct opportunity to understand the history and lessons of American foreign policy. The discussions in this seminar were among the most engaging and rewarding I have had at Yale. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement would be to potentially consider lessons from foreign policy which pertains to other countries. American foreign policy lessons are incredibly relevant and I believe they should remain the primary emphasis of the course. However, I imagine case studies from Britain and previous world hegemons would add another intriguing dimension to the seminar.",
    "it was an interesting course on a different topic, but a wider focus would help its goal",
    "Absolutely loved the readings and subjects addressed by the course but would have appreciated having more structure to our discussions. While my peers were incredibly insightful and had lots to share, at times, I found myself hoping to hear more from Professor Brenes and the way in which he grappled with the questions we were discussing."

   "comments": [
    "I would hesitate to recommend this course to another student. It was interesting at times and the readings can be quite insightful, but often the unstructured discussion left me more confused as to whether or not I had learned anything in the past two hours. This was a frustrating feeling to have more often than not, especially with a class that has a reading response every week as well as a ten page midterm and a twenty page final.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to those interested in US foreign policy. Discussions tended to be theoretical and sometimes quite meta, but I really enjoyed the critical thinking that approach required.",
    "Not really? I still don't really know what the point\/takeaway he was trying to get across was.",
    "Sure if the student wants to only gain America's perspective on approaching global affairs. The readings are amazing but the class was not entirely organized in a way that answered the questions raised in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Absolutely: although some of the readings are a little iffy (and Professor Brenes might change those), the class was very interesting and genuinely fun to be in. Professor Brenes is clearly excited about the material, and is a strong seminar leader.",
    "I would given that some of the reading material is changed and there were more guiding questions and perhaps group work during the seminar to change up the format a bit week to week.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a desire to understand American foreign policy. This seminar convinced me that historical thinking is a prerequisite to shrewd analysis of contemporary foreign policy. Furthermore, learning how to conduct archival research is a useful, intellectually rewarding process.",
    "I would recommend this course, since it helped both expand my knowledge of US history and start seeing what historical research looks like",
    "Yes! I think that with a bit of structure, this course has the potential to be one of the best at Yale."
