The first half of the course was focused on grammar, vocabulary, and basic readings not unlike any other language course at Yale, while the second half of the course was more focused on reading and interpreting actual Old English texts and poems. We made use of some online archival tools, such as the Old English Corpus, and the final project was very open-ended and allowed us to read up on secondary sources and criticism of an Old English work of our choosing. We were also exposed to the linguistic and historical forces that led to the formation of the Old English language to supplement our learning on the language.",

                "Strengths are interesting course material and passionate professor. Weakness is that it might not appeal to those who don't want to learn an outdated language.",
                "I think the course was very well structured -- Prof. Thornbury always made sure we were aware of the content that was being covered during lecture, the focus on weekly assignments, and any resources or deadlines that we should know of to help us along our journey towards understanding and interpreting Old English (which is pretty much a completely new language with its own set of rules). The weekly assignments along with weekly quizzes at the start of the course, though it took a bit of time, in retrospect were a very important part of learning and practicing the language. If you are interested in learning and reading new languages, I would recommend this course especially if it counts towards a Major requirement; however, I personally struggled to stay motivated to translate long OE poems\/texts during a semester of completely remote learning. I think focusing on less works in total while focusing more on the historical\/linguistic context behind each work would make each text more valuable and accordingly, more interesting to work through. The remote format took a blow to every course I took this past fall, and Zoom lectures are generally a bit tougher to stay engaged in during a long period of time. That said, this course was a two-hour long lecture, and towards the latter half of the semester, this became a bit overwhelming. I think if the course were split into two lectures or if the lectures were shorter, that would improve general engagement levels. I would also suggest each lecture to be focused on material outside of translation so that each lecture expands our knowledge of a text rather than reviews\/corrects our translations (though I did appreciate that aspect).",
                "Professor Thornbury is a great instructor and is very dedicated to helping students understand the material and succeed!",
                "Strengths: lesson modules were clear and witty; Prof. Thornbury as well. The most fun parts of the course came towards the endwhen we finished learning about grammar and started reading actual texts in OE. Class is low-stress, but you learn a lot!\r\nWeaknesses: seminar meetings could sometimes drag on, especially if students had not come with their translations prepared and were just working through it for the first time in class.",
                "Strengths: course materials designed specifically for this class, interesting assignments, fair grading, predictable workload \r\nWeaknesses: the only Weaknesses I can think of is that I would have had an easier time absorbing the material if the class met more than once a week",
                "This course was incredible. The only improvement I could imagine would be splitting the graduate and undergraduate sections in order to form a more tight-knit group, but I understand that this would also be somewhat impractical.",
                "I think if this class had met more than once a week, my engagement would have been much higher. Thornbury is a great teacher.",
                "There is very little instruction in class.  It is mostly going over translations done for homework and getting feedback.  As a result class can seem useless if you didnt get as much from the textbook as the professor expects.",
                "Dr. Thornbury's textbook for the course, which she wrote herself, was such a wonderful, essential resource during the course. Dr. Thornbury herself is so knowledgeable and always gave very helpful, clear explanations in response to student questions. \r\n\r\nThe only critique of the course that I have is that the pace was occasionally a bit too fast in its introduction of various grammar concepts. On the other hand, if you have knowledge of Latin or German, the course might not have seemed as fast-paced."

I'm not sure if I can pinpoint any specific practices  outside of the typical lecture, share-screen framework, but I think for this course, the format worked well for information sharing and teaching but not as well for engagement and discussion generation.",

While this sounds wonderful, I know it would have made my life easier to have done so earlier, and thus I believe that a few short quizzes near the start of the course with slightly less emphasis on productive written assignments may have been useful. Otherwise, Professor Thornbury's system of randomized speakers worked really well over Zoom, and I was impressed how much she managed to create a seminar feel with so many students in one virtual class.",
                "Thornbury's cold calling really kept me on my toes and incentivized work.",

                "This might sound extremely redundant, but I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning Old English -- Old English being a new language with its own grammatical rules, syntax, and specific canon texts. That said, I think it is important to note that actually learning how to read Old English texts comprises a bit more than half of the course, so be prepared to do a lot of translation work, to wrestle with specific cases (dative, genitive, accusative, etc.), and to feel a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of words you don't initially recognize when picking up a new OE work. However, Prof. Thornbury is very understanding of each person's comfort level with a text, and she has a wealth of resources and pointers if you reach out to her. Though the class shifted towards interpretation towards the latter half of the course, translation remained the point of focus and difficulty. If you enjoy that kind of work, you will enjoy this class - especially if you want to take an English class that's not too focused on generating ideas surrounding texts. There's no real expectations for you to understand the \"point\" of the text, and you don't even have to get every translation right. This class just gives you exposure to texts written in a language that a small circle of scholars are very passionate about.",
                "Its a great course! I fully recommend if the subject interests you.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend if you need the medieval credit for Englishthough seminar meetings were often slow, I think in a normal semester, actual class time would be a lot more engaging. The final project is a fun opportunity to do research on an area that you're interested in. Professor Thornbury is great.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes! Even if you're not a medievalist, Old English will be interesting to any English major, anyone who likes learning languages, people with a casual interest in the period. I will say that by volume you will read less medieval literature than in other classes, since you have to spend a lot of time learning the language first, but I also know that this might be a pro rather than a con for some.",
                "I think if you're a fast learner when it comes to languages, this is a good fit. Otherwise, I'd recommend a different class for the Medieval requirement.",
                "If you are interested in old languages or old literature, I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "Dont do this if you dont have at least a general interest in language.",
                "Yes, if you want to understand how to read and write in Old English. If you're looking for an easy course to fulfill your Medieval requirement for the English major, this course might not be for you. If you're genuinely curious about Old English and are willing to put in the work, however, this course is really rewarding because of how much you learn from it. Professor Thornbury is also a very patient, kind, and witty (!) teacher, which makes the process of learning Old English all the more fun!"
