            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were mainly the high accessibility of the professors. They responded to emails quickly and were willing to provide in-depth feedback and discussions of papers and presentations. The weaknesses were twofold. First, there was less emphasis on engagement with the philosophical significance rather than understanding than I would have appreciated. Secondly, the central theme of the course, while highlighted well in the syllabus, played less of a role in seminar discussions then I would have liked.",
                "I thought the reading load was a little bit heavy -- I felt like we weren't able to touch on the reading in enough depth in class.",
                "The course is great. At first, I was wary of the dual-teaching method, but it ended up being really productive, offering a more engaging front for discussion. The readings are relatively short, but powerful, and the class presentations are generally strong guides for discussion. This course was overall a pleasure, and I can't think of any particular weaknesses.",

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in Ancient philosophy and culture who has taken a course or courses in the subject. I think someone expecting a straightforward philosophy course might be less satisfied than someone hoping for holistic engagement with the time period and thinkers.",
                "Yes! If you get the chance, it's a great way to revisit many of the ancient philosophers covered in the introductory courses. You will encounter Plato, Aristotle, and Seneca, but also strange and fascinating documents such as the Orphic Gold Tablets and funny biographical information from Diogenes Laertius. Each of these authors is incredible to read, and the \"divine\" focus of the course, even if it's not your interest, is broad enough for the course to cover the classic bits of the great philosophers. If you want to learn about metaphysical theories behind the relationship between humans and gods, or the role these theories played in the ethics of ancient philosophy, then this is the course for you. If not, as long as you have an interest in philosophy from this time period, you'll find it rewarding.",
                "Highly recommend! This course is fantastic for those who want a greater contextualization of the common ancients (Plato, Aristotle, \"Stoicism\" etc.) The class provided me with so many more thinkers of the ancient world, and complicated the picture of the assumed classics (Symposium, Republic, Nico Ethics, etc) that I really can better appreciate the nuance in those works, and compare them with others of equal and even greater value. FANTASTIC CLASS!"
