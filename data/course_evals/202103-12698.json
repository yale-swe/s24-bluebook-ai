                "Completing heavy readings loads quickly and effectively; applying readings to real world events;  thinking critically about a wide variety of strategies in war, institution building, and organizing",
                "General knowledge about the field of grand strategy, feedback about our independent research projects, and three subject modules: US\/China relations, strengthening multi-racial democracy, and the future of Afghanistan.",
                "I learned what Grand Strategy is, and how to apply it in real-world contexts. This semester, we continued to build on our theory base by completing a 'module' about a real-world issue. I was with guest Professor Heather McGhee, who was wonderful. She's had so much experience fighting for an inclusive multi-racial democracy, and getting to discuss the readings with her was a delight. She was also pretty personally helpful, too.",
                "This was an excellent continuation from Studies in Grand Strategy I in which we focused more on practice than theory; I felt that the two halves of the course fit well together, and knowledge\/skills from the spring semester remained highly relevant. This semester, I was part of the \"Multiracial Democracy\" module and felt that it was extremely well-suited to my interests and career plans. The content of our module included public opinion and narrative, protests\/demonstrations, litigation strategy, and other aspects of movement-building and organizing.",
                "I really appreciated the module-based learning with practitioners for 6 weeks. I learned about our final briefing topic, with my teammates, and did quite a bit of research in the process of working on it.",
                "The knowledge and insights gleaned from Professor Gage and Professor Brenes were vast. The majority of this course was new information to me. I had never read many of the authors (Thucydides, Clausewitz, Machiavelli, Alinsky, Gandhi, Piven-Cloward, Rustin, Ransby, Kurtz-Phelan, McGhee, Stewart, Wolfson,  McAlevey). I had never studied the Cold War or Vietnam War-much less the many wars and revolutions that preceded those. \r\n\r\nGaining the skill of preparing a strategy brief was a challenging and rewarding experience."

                "Strengths: organized well, impressive practitioners lead course, great professors, comprehensive reading about case study\r\nWeakness: not much introductory content for case study (it is assumed you have a base understanding of topic)",
                "The first few weeks with the practitioners were exciting, but a bit too broad, which wasn't entirely conducive to constructive class discussions. The smaller modules were fantastic. It was very special to have such close access to a high-level practitioner, and the practitioner truly wanted to contribute to our intellectual development. My only other criticism is that group projects are always shaky, since the work is rarely split evenly. But, overall, this course was a fantastic experience.",
                "I think the readings were a LOT  200 to 300 pages a week, easily  which was both a strength and weakness. You learn a lot if you choose to meaningfully engage with them. You can also probably not learn a lot. I think I mostly engaged with the readings and as a result, feel like I can apply various lessons about organizing, movements, and narratives to modern problems.",
                "I think this course has many strengths  it is well-designed and well-structured (the two-semester format works very well; the progression of topics and assignments is conducive to understanding and applying the materials; etc.), and I feel that the professors do a great job in selecting the student cohort. I learned as much from my peers as I did from the course, which I think is partially the purpose of the program. However, I do think the syllabus could be diversified, especially in the spring semester, as many of the authors of color that I read were only in my module.",
                "The readings and lectures do a great job of revealing many elements of the various issues and incidents covered, but the Professors and guests are certain to remind students that even the best account omits details. The challenge of distinguishing the essential from the superfluous lie with the relayer. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the year-long course worked well to inform me and give me ample time discussing ideas in a group setting before the final presentation. Splintering into groups to take deep-dives into the subject matter of our briefs worked well to facilitate research and deep thinking on my group's issue."

                "ABSOLUTELY! The Grand Strategy program has been my favorite academic experience at Yale. This semester, I did not know much about the case study group that I was assigned to, but the practitioner and the professors were incredibly supportive. I was able to learn so much in a relatively short time, and it was great to be in-person with my classmates after a virtual first semester. Definitely take this!",
                "Definitely. If you get in, the Grand Strategy program is an incredibly special experience and will open up unforeseen opportunities. The second semester is really where this course shines.",
                "Yes! It is definitely a substantial reading and workload but I felt that it was worth it. My cohort was fantastic and I am so grateful to have met such an incredible group of students, and Professor Gage and Professor Brenes are both incredible. I cannot say enough good things about both of them as instructors.",
                "Absolutely. This course exposes students to a myriad of historical perspectives and styles of shaping a narrative to steer grand strategy. The instructors take care to present issues in a well-rounded fashion and do not seem to steer students towards conclusions."
