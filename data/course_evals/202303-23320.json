Importantly, even in situations where I had a clear prior opinion, I was still able to look from the other side's point of view with more patience, nuance and understanding than I had previously. \r\n\r\nHelped me think about how I would approach difficult foreign policy decisions in the future - in particular, how previous / recent events and domestic politics might bias me towards a direction for a different situation, and how important it is to take into account the context of every situation."

Our discussions were great, but I liked it when he spent time at the start framing them.",

                "Absolutely! Professor Malley is an incredible addition to the Jackson School. This was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale because it spurred difficult but respectful conversations. I learned so much from the professor and my fellow classmates!",
