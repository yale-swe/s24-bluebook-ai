This made the end of the semester more stressful than it would have been if one of those assessments was simply placed during finals week",

For example, someone who volunteers to participate in class frequently will get more speaking practice, and thus likely see a greater improvement in their skills, than someone who rarely volunteers to participate. Overall, I think this class is a great way to hone your reading, writing (especially this one), speaking, and listening skills in Spanish. It is a lot of work though.",
