                "The philosophy lectures were very interesting and  helped me interact with the course material in a more meaningful way. Sometimes I would have benefited from taking part of them before having done the reading, however, since it would have facilitated the learning process (especially regarding Aristotle). I really appreciated the freedom of our seminars where everyone could bring their ideas and questions to the table for us to elaborate on together. The students were encouraged to be curious, philosophize, and develop ideas and critiques of their own, which was great. I would have benefited from a bit more structure in our discussion seminars, regarding which concepts/ideas were the key-take aways from each particular text. Towards the end of the semester, we started writing more arguments and ideas on the board, which was great, because it ensured that everyone left the classroom with a common minimum understanding of the content which made it easier to remember what we discussed / prepare for the finals.",
                "The course covers a lot of interesting texts and ideas. However, I would have liked to have had more of an introduction/basic explanation of the ideas and concepts covered first, to then better understand and participate in the discussion. As the ideas were quite complex, it would have been useful to understand them better before discussing their merits or flaws.",
                "Strengths:\r\nGreat selection of texts that gave a snapshot of the history of western philosophy. Interesting lecturers and welcoming discussion sections where I felt that I could offer my ideas without judgement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome discussions were hard to follow and seemed to get a little off topic. Could be improved by providing a clearer roadmap for the discussion.",
                "DS covers broad swaths of material - that's both its strength (scope) and weakness (depth). The format of both lectures and seminar discussions helps compensate for this - this felt especially true for the philosophy section, which lends itself to abstract discussions or focus on evaluating particular arguments (at least from my experience). I very much enjoyed our seminar discussions, but felt that the lectures also played an important role in giving an overview of the entire reading.",
                "This course does a very good job for how broad and complex the material it covers is. Often times what we discussed in class pertained to a fraction of the material we read, so long readings did not always feel super rewarding."

                "I would recommend this course to another student, however they should be prepared that some of the reading is very dense, and concepts are hard to grasp. That being said, once you somewhat understand a concept, it is quite fun to talk about the ideas.",
                "Yes, gives a great overview of western philosophy. Despite reading many texts I still felt as though I had a nuanced understanding of the philosophical arguments made in each. Also gives students a great introduction to interpreting and analyzing philosophical arguments.",
                "DS is highly interesting and rewarding, if you're the kind of person who is interested in the material and knows in advance that you're in for a lot of work (though it's manageable if you enjoy it).",
