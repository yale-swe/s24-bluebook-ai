                "The first half of the course covered a lot of basic knowledge about DNA and RNA structure, transcription, and translation. The second half of the course went into more depth about homologous recombination, RNA splicing and processing, and RNA modification. The last couple of lectures on the applications of molecular biology and genome technology on health and medicine were very interesting.",

                "I learned about the central dogma and how it has to be revised to incorporate all the epigenetic, genetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modifications that occur within the cell once a gene is transcribed. I also learned about many of the methods that molecular biologists utilize to edit and modify the genome. I learned about the large scale structure of the genome, DNA repair mechanisms, RNA and protein structure, epigenetics, biotechnology, RNA processing and translation, and many different types of noncoding RNAs and the roles they play within the cell.",

                "The entire course was well structured, organized, synthesized contemporary information into the already existing curriculum, and was taught in an exemplary manner by well-informed and accomplished scientists. That said, the course covers a lot of material and the exams were pretty arduous.",
                "It was insanely hard to review and memorize concepts. The class is super dense and every lecture is well-structured, but just takes a LOT of time to review and understand. I wished that there was more professor-held reviews.",
                "One weakness is the pacing of the course, in that some lectures felt a lot more rushed than others. We had really great TAs who were really wonderful resources throughout the course. One of the strengths was the weekly molecular biology lunches with some of the scientists who have done outstanding research in the field.",
                "I wish this course had more office hours as one of the two office hours offered overlapped with section for this class. I also wish we received practice problems throughout the course to work on applying our knowledge.",
                "This class was VERY dense. I did not expect it to contain so much information each week, and that made it quite difficult to digest.",
                "Strengths: the course goes very in-depth, so you come out of the course with a large understanding of many of the mechanisms and pathways that underpin much of transcription, translation, DNA repair, and other processes that are central to the maintenance and reading of the genetic code. Both Dr. Pyle and Dr. Isaacs are great teachers who can communicate information very well in a manner that breaks down complex topics in molecular biology and makes these concepts understandable.\r\nWeaknesses: the length of the exams is one of the weaknesses of this course; the exams feel like they are designed so that students cannot finish on time. The questions are almost entirely free response, and since the class covers a lot of detail, the exams are likewise very dense in the material they cover. As a result, the exams will take a lot of time to study for and you should not expect to know the answer to every question tested. The good news is that the class is heavily curved, so even if you get a 67 or 72 on the exams (which is a common occurrence in this class), as long as you are around or above the median, you will probably end up getting an A- or A.",
                "This course is very well taught and extremely interesting. Professors are always willing to help if needed. Molecular biology lunches offer an opportunity to discuss course content was other experts in the field as well.",
                "Strengths: the content of the entire semester is organized in a methodical, logical, and generally in a predictable progression. I found the topics covered in class to be very interesting and appreciated times when the professor connected the topics to recent developments in the field. The weekly papers helped me solidify my understanding of the content presented in lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are very fast-paced, and it's not entirely clear which information is most relevant until you take the first exam to get an understanding of what is expected. Most students would have liked the exams to have been shortened given how much detail is demanded for each question (perhaps doing something like offering students a sample response would have gone a long way in helping students gauge what is most relevant.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures. It was clear what we had to know for exams. Some of the research articles we read enhanced my understanding of the course content. Weaknesses: sometimes, the discussion section papers could be a little too technical and removed from what we were covering in class. It would have been helpful to review challenging course content during discussion section.",
                "strengths: lectures were interesting and the professors both taught well\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more opportunities to engage with course content would have been nice. we covered a lot of ground and I enjoyed learning about all of the topics. it would have been nice to have more ways to engage with this content. the weekly discussion sections were an excellent way to see the applications in scientific literature of what we learned. still, this course would benefit from giving students more opportunities to interact with and apply knowledge learned, besides on exams.",
                "The class was well organized, the professor and the TAs were very available.\r\nThe class was very intense, I would suggest to probably slow down a little in the pace.\r\nAlso, I would assign the readings well in advance (together with the syllabus, rather than week by week) in order to give more time to the students to read."

The exams are also insanely long (20 pages long) and they don't try to change it or adjust it to make it easier for students at all, despite feedback in sections. Take at your own risk.",

While the exams were a little painful to study for at times, you do end up learning a LOT about how the genome is structured, maintained, read, and edited. The professors are great at communicating information, so you come out of the class really feeling like you know a lot about DNA, RNA, proteins, and everything related to them.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend, because the course cover a range of topics and that are very relevant in current technological development and research.",
                "Yes. Despite the workload, I found the knowledge I gained from this course to be very rewarding and interesting.",
