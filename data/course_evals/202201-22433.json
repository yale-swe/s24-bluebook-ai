                "Id say the most important skill was close reading for a seminar setting. Ive had seminars where people ramble on without referencing the text, but for this class, the professor/section leader would very often ask for a specific passage to support your interpretation. This will definitely make me a better seminar participant in the future. I also gained a familiarity with the dialectical method and an introduction to Marxist terminology/frameworks. These ideas are quite complicated, so a major part of this was learning how to clearly write about very difficult passages. I feel this had made me a much better writer overall."

                "the reading list was generally fantastic and I really feel like I have a much better understanding of the main currents of Marxism, especially how they relate to individual experiences of the worker. while three papers at first seemed like a lot, they were each very manageable and I much prefer that to one big paper that is very high stakes and stressful. \r\n\r\none thing that I think could be improved is grounding the readings in intellectual history a little better. it would be nice to have some secondary source material - even if very short - to accompany the primary sources. this would be especially appreciated for more difficult authors like Hegel",
                "The primary strength of this course is immersing you in euro-centric 19th and 20th-century literature regarding alienation. This is also its primary weakness. Baudelaire, for instance, had very little relevance to the course and his inclusion felt to be a bit of a reach. In his place, afro-centric orators and theorists like Frederick Douglass and Angela Davis, who operated within the western world during this time frame and challenged mainstream definitions of alienation (Davis defines slavery as alienation's most extreme form), would have been a meaningful component of the class. I've attached links below that expand on this. In addition, indigenous perspectives on the ecological rift were frequently referenced in discussion sections but not included as necessary readings.\r\n\r\nhttps://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/16854eeo122\r\nhttps://archive.org/stream/AngelaDavis-LecturesOnLiberation/AngelaDavis-LecturesOnLiberation_djvu.txt",
                "The two strongest points of this course are the readings and the one-on-one interactions. Each philosophy passage that we read had a profound influence on my world view, and the literature passages were fantastic as well. Talking with my section leader and with Professor Campe about these passages in office hours was thrillingthey are incredibly knowledgeable, and would always connect my ideas to other elements of German philosophy. As far as weaknesses, the main one was organization. The syllabus mentioned several literary readings, but we only spent significant time on two of them. I would have liked to see more planning to incorporate this literary aspect. Some of the class sessions fell flat a bit, too, because of this lack of organization. We switched to student presentations on the readings 2/3 of the way through the semester with four students presenting per reading, and this generated more questions than we could possibly address. If a single student presented on each reading, this would likely run much smoother."

                "if you are curious about Marxism you should definitely take this course. it introduces you to foundational ideas that you will begin to see everywhere in literary theory, political theory/criticism. I took it following Marci Shore's European Intellectual History, and it provided a really nice deep dive into some of the authors we looked at more briefly in lecture. at points the flow of the course can feel a bit random, especially in the latter half when you move quickly from early 20th century Western Marxism directly to the 21st century and developments in ecological Marxism, but Prof. Campe gives you a lot of freedom to explore ideas on your own so if you're curious about anything you can definitely write about it",
                "A great survey course that exposes you to the thought of a range of important thinkers. The assignment structure gives you the chance to construct a small research project.",
                "Yes. For the readings on the syllabus and for Professor Campe, it is absolutely worth taking. I would advise anyone considering this course to make sure they can do their due diligence, though. The readings are quite dense and deserve very meticulous examination. Also, Id advise everyone to go to as many office hours as possible!"
