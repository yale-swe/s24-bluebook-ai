                "Lectures were not very useful. The assessments also felt a little cookie cutter. Each person was working on a unique research projects, so it should be up to the adviser to choose what needs to be done by the student. I often felt like the assessments for the class and going to class took time away from my research",
                "Strengths: the professor is great, the course content is helpful for the most part, and it helps set you up for a good final report/presentation for your research by the end of the semester. The feedback on the various assignments throughout the semester was very informative as well. \r\nWeaknesses: by the middle of the semester, much of the content is not too helpful, I find myself wanting to work on my actual research. In the end though, the in-class exercises we did turn out to be helpful and informative to our final presentation/paper. \r\nIn general, the course content lends itself most well to projects that introduce a new \"product\" or advancement to existing technology, and not well to pure 'research' or measurement projects.",
                "Wish it was on zoom more",
                "The course was rather enjoyable. I loved the research portion of the course, and this experience largely depends on your advisor. I was fortunate to have an excellent advisor who was very engaged in the research I was doing and helped me a great deal as I encountered challenges in my research. I also enjoyed the lecture portion of this course with the presentations and final report. Dr. Venkadesan does a great job, offers abundant feedback at every turn, and truly works to help you achieve your best possible presentations if you put in the effort. His individual feedback on drafts were the areas where I learned the most about synthesizing and presenting information. I rarely do this in any other engineering course, so it was definitely worthwhile. If you work hard, it is very possible to perform excellently and learn a great deal of practical lessons in this course. The final report can also be a very rewarding experience.",
                "The professor is extremely organized and the course is structured well.",
                "There was some interesting content taught about how to best conduct and present our research work, but I felt that the lectures were bloated and contained a lot of redundant information."

If so, you can present your project/research for credit, and you can get a lot of help/resources from the prof and his slides/recommended books. You really need to be on top of your project to avoid a lot of unnecessary stress, of course.",

There are few engineering classes which give you the opportunity to interact with and present in front of others. This course was unique, and it was an enjoyable experience.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking to get credit for research and/or are doing you senior project, but the course itself does not add much other than required presentations and a paper to the research experience."
