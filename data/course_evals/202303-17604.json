The weakness is that the teacher was unclear in what she wanted students to express in their essays. The teacher did not teach students to engage with students about historical writing, but most of the class grades was on essays.",
                "There was too much reading. I get that college courses have a lot of reading, and the number of pages assigned for this course may actually be less than pages assigned for more advanced courses. Coming out of high school, however, the level of reading can feel daunting, and I know many students who struggled to find time to read everything. In the beginning, I very much struggled to keep up. In the end, I was completing the reading with ease. This was progress, and I'm happy about that. Nevertheless, I know it was difficult for many of my classmates and, at times, for me, to keep up."
