Dr. Berk is a FANTASTIC professor and its so sad shell be leaving Yale. She made students feel so confident and welcome in her class, and this class was one of the few spaces on campus were students could confidently come to class ready to have conversation with their peers and not feel anxious about their knowledge level or skill. Learned a ton about the topic and have a ton to take away for other classes!",
