                "I learned more about the Roman emperors than I ever thought one teacher could know!  And developed a lot of Latin translation skills along the way too",
                "I learned how to translate better and analyze the texts on a deeper and contextual level.",
                "Greater skill at translating and analyzing Latin poetry, including synthesizing common themes and connections across different works, authors, and time periods. Knowledge of the evolving relationship between poets and monarchs in ancient Rome and the fascinating and complex ways poets addressed monarchy and the monarch himself.",
                "I learned much about the historical context and circumstances under which the poetry we read were written. My skills in translation improved greatly, as we had to adapt the different writing styles and vocabulary of a range of authors. One will read authors from the Age of Augustus all the way through the Theodosian Age. Both Professor Johnston and the students in this class were very knowledgeable, so I always found class discussions engaging and insightful.",
                "This class was very good practice and a challenge for my Latin skills, but most of all I learned a lot about the history and politics of Ancient Rome."

                "The strength and weakness of this class are the same: I have read a lot of Latin poetry, and the sheer amount at times can be challenging. But I do feel that my Latin skills have improved significantly. There are also clearly-outlined expectations, and exams are graded fairly.",
                "Strengths: the choice of the Latin passages were really interesting, and I learned a lot about the history of the emperors along the way. Weaknesses: I often couldn't finish the passages either because they were long or because of senioritis.",
                "The in-class discussions were very valuable the discussion boards helped answer questions about the Latin efficiently. The amount of material required to the study for the midterm\/final felt like a bit much and many times we weren't able to discuss all of the readings in class, so perhaps the course could have been slowed down a little.",
                "The workload was at times high, and we did not manage to discuss important parts of passages we had translated for homework in class.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professor and the material. This class could benefit from variation in class structure.",
                "This course was very engaging. Many of the readings were lesser known but very interesting, and discussions were great. We dove deep into a lot of Latin I probably wouldn't have otherwise seen. The translation homework could be quite demanding and time-consuming, as expected for a high-level Latin seminar.",
                "Both Professor Johnston and the students in this class were very knowledgeable, so one would always find class discussions engaging and insightful. Professor's teaching was clear and interesting, and we read range of authors that people may not normally read in a Latin course. The environment of the classroom was relaxing, so people could speak up easily. However, the preparation workload is extremely high (Latin poetry, supplementary readings and commentaries), and I often found myself spending twice as long preparing for this class than I did for other classes.",
                "The class discussions were amazing and this class was consistently one of my most enjoyable to be at. Every poem had tons of cool things to talk about. The actual homework was fine, but felt like a lot of work, and I felt it difficult to feel like I really had a thorough grasp of the Latin text most weeks. I think the pace of the class could perhaps be a little bit slower, since I was having trouble keeping up on the Latin and we always seemed to run out of time for our discussions on every poem; I would love to have had a little more time to analyze and appreciate each poem before moving on. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this course."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other Classics majors\/prospective Classics majors. Professor Johnston is great, and this is a demanding but rewarding Latin seminar.",
                "Yes, Professor Johnston is a very knowledgeable professor, and one will come away with much insight about Roman poetry and the monarchy. However, I would only recommend this course to a student who is very experienced in reading Latin (AP Latin or higher) and is prepared to take on the huge reading load this course requires.",
                "Absolutely, especially if Professor Johnston is teaching. This is a truly fascinating and enjoyable dive into Ancient Roman history and poetry and the connections we can make to today. If you think you can handle reading a lot of Latin, this will be a great class. I wouldn't take it in a super packed semester though, since it is quite a bit of work."
