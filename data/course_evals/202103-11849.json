The course focused a bit more heavily than expected on slightly more \"out-of-left-field\" concepts, with a high emphasis relative to other curricula on linearization, optimization, related rates, and similar processes.",
                "Learned some new maths that I hadn't gotten to in high school, but it was a pretty straight-forward class",

                "The weaknesses of this course are that the quality of education depends heavily on who your instructor is, if you choose to learn from attending the course and not on your own.",
                "I think our instructors explained things pretty theoretically at times which made it hard to understand new content. There was also no introduction into what we were learning: he would jump into content immediately. But I liked that we did practice worksheets almost every class. Those helped me apply the concepts that we learned.",
                "I think more collaborative work.",
                "Strengths: Assignment and exam policies were clear -- grade cutoffs were posted and their implications were discussed, and it was clear when and how we were supposed to submit each week's assignments. Course instructors were flexible in terms of students' general understanding, and tutoring and instructor office hours were helpful. The content was challenging at times but the course seemed to be designed for students to succeed, with sometimes challenging but doable problem sets, weekly worksheets which fortified small concepts, and study guides which were helpfully aligned with general exam topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: With so many sections and instructors, all professors will not be the same in terms of teaching quality. Sometimes I felt that my section instructor was focusing a bit too much on simplification or choosing problems that were a bit more challenging than was needed to teach concepts, and it wasn't always clear what the purpose of each step in a problem was (although questions were very much welcomed). The focus on concepts that seemed somewhat random (ex. Newton's Method) was slightly frustrating at times, and the purpose of differential equations could have used a more thorough introduction.",
                "I like how the course was very similar across different teachers\/sections, it made it easier to talk with other students. I wish that there was a little more flexibility with the ximera assignments -- sometime's I'd complete one right before the 11pm deadline and it would not count it as done, but since they were were so few points I didn't care much.",
                "The strengths were the amount of peer tutoring support there was. A weakness was that the lecture time itself was a bit poorly organized and I had trouble following the material.",
                "More structure and a more detailed syllabus",
                "Pretty good pace, I feel like I learned a lot. I think that the PSETS were more \"tricky\" then they were in terms of gauging skill levels. Maybe just a bit more available practice would make the course even better.",
                "The Psets were difficult and frustrating. I thought the course was strong in providing extra help outside of the classroom to help students who are struggling in the course.",
                "Some weaknesses of this course was that some instructors were not as good as explaining some concepts as other instructors, which forced students to have to learn some material individually or during office hours."

                "MATH 112 is a step in the math sequence required for many majors, so many students will end up taking this course regardless. With that said, I think this course is well-organized and content is for the most part presented clearly. Students were able to ask many questions and the format of the class helped with learning concepts. After talking to a few other people in MATH 112 and MATH 115, even if you took AP Calculus AB in high school, the jump to MATH 115 can still be a bit much, so if you want to re-fortify math concepts as you also adjust to Yale this course is a good way to go.",
                "Yes! I have already, it's a great course to get back into math after a summer\/ gap year off, and the workload was just right to practice the concepts without over-stressing.",
                "I would recommend this course as a pre-requisite requirement, but perhaps just go straight into Math 115 if you are deciding between the two.",
                "Yes, especially for those who have already been exposed to some of the course material. It goes a bit deeper and is more rigorous than a typical calculus class, so it would be worth taking. May not be suitable though for students who are more humanities intensive-STEM adverse.",
                "Yes. I think calculus is an important concept to understand and learn for future plans.",
