                "American Energy History has by far been my favorite course at Yale. Not only was it a great introduction to history courses here at Yale, but it also facilitates better writing and a greater knowledge of energy and environmental transitions.",
                "This course was instrumental in improving my historical writing and analysis skills, especially with primary sources. Although I am a history major who took DS and has taken many history seminars, Professor Sabin's focus on basic writing skills was uniquely helpful. I left the course with a solid understanding of American energy history and the importance of energy sources and transitions in shaping American culture and political economy. I think this should be a required course for any environmental history major, because it offers a solid foundation in using the lens of energy (and often the environment) for understanding broader historical phenomena.",
                "I developed a good knowledge of the impact of energy transitions throughout America's history, including the economic, social, and political implications of the development of different industries and fuels. I also learned how to properly construct an historical essay, and analyze primary sources",
                "More knowledge and appreciation for the complexity and fuckedupness of energy throughout american history -- just amazing content in general",
                "Learned to write a history paper that looks backward to interpret events through a particular lens. Explored iterations of energy throughout American history, touching on energy's effects on democracy, feminism, human-animal relationships, and international relations. Presented new paradigms to understand the world through scope of environmental history.",
                "Better understanding of how energy systems have played a role in American History.",
                "I learned about the history of energy sources, especially regarding their use in America. The course related energy sources to politics, economics, and other social events that happened in each time period.",

                "Writing skill improvement.",

                "I gained a significant amount of knowledge about American energy history and the policies that shape our energy reality today.",
                "I improved my writing and my historical analysis skills. I also learned a lot about the history of American energy",
                "I learned about how different energy sources rose to prominence across U.S. history, their impacts on people and animals' lives, the ways in which they were regulated and promoted, and conversely the ways in which they were replaced by others or fell from popular grace. I got good practice writing deliberate and focused topic sentences.",
                "A great understanding of energy history in America. This class was incredibly interesting",

                "I LOVED this course. I learned so much about the history of energy and the environment, starting from the 1800s onwards. We used history as a case study(s) , and then drew conclusions about the nature of energy transitions from what has actually happened. I feel like I've learned so much that could be applied to environmental issues today and how/when we will transition away from fossil fuels. The class weaves discussions of science, culture, and economics into the history. If you are debating taking the class, take it!!!",
                "I learned about the impact of energy and energy system in the United States and how they influenced American culture.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of energy in the US as well as other general US history that I had never learned before. I learned a lot about how to explore the connections between energy forms as well as energy in cultural, political, and economic contexts.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is great for people who want to learn more about energy production and how energy transitions have come about if you have no prior knowledge. Dr. Sabin's interactive model requires you to interact with the readings a little bit (although not too much), but his lectures are definitely kind of dry and can feel long at times, despite only being 50 minutes.",
                "The strengths of this class are Paul Sabin and his teaching staff (the TFs were amazing!), a rich and interesting curriculum, and a connection to current events through music, discussion, and our class trip (energy tour of New Haven). I do not have any weaknesses to note.",
                "Strengths: This was a phenomenal course. I loved Professor Sabin's teaching and lecturing style; while slightly off-putting at first, the small table-based lecture definitely increased my engagement in the course and was helpful in synthesizing my takeaways from the readings with my classmates'. As mentioned prior, I found the focus on writing to be incredibly helpful. The readings are consistently excellent, and I rarely found that there was busy work for the class. \r\nWeaknesses: Very few. My biggest complaint is that Professor Sabin scheduled 3/4 of the discussion sections during the same seminar block on Thursday afternoon, which made it very difficult to make the class work for my schedule (and the schedules of many others).",
                "Professor Sabin and the TFs are phenomenal. They are understanding and want to be the best source of knowledge for their students. Weaknesses may be that the classes are very short and sometimes it seems like a ton of information is crammed into 50 minutes. It is very interesting content though.",
                "This course is well-structured and planned, and has different mediums for learning, such as the in-class sessions which involved a mix of lecturing and table discussions, section discussion, primary sources and readings, and online teaching units. There was also a class trip to see New Haven's use of energy and its history.\r\nA weakness is potentially the length of class time - because it is a short class the lectures always felt a bit rushed and this could be a bit stressful sometimes as slides and information would be passed through very quickly",
                "The class was really just amazing all around -- great lectures, readings, TAs. I think if anything, the sections could have been a bit more organized, but other than that, no real complaints.",
                "Strengths: highly involved teaching fellows who provide students with great deal of feedback; low reading load with articles on a variety of interesting and unconventional topics; ability to choose any topic for final paper; class discussion which was more engaging than traditional lecture format; open note final exam\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no clear narrative throughout the course-- felt disjointed week to week; Prof. Sabin could benefit from reducing number of slides, sometimes did not remember why he included a slide which led to awkward break",
                "Overall a very engaging class with well-organized lessons. Overall I didn't understand why we had a final exam, though. It was a very challenging exam-- 5 essays in 3 hours (three 600-word essays and two 1,500-word essays). Seemed contradictory to the \"active learning\" style of engagement that we had all semester. Seemed like a bit much on top of the term-long research paper assignment.",
                "There was a fair amount of work for the course, especially with all the readings and blog posts. I think a weakness was lectures because it was mostly just going over the readings with a section type of feel.",
                "n/a",
                "Organized and engaging - interesting!",
                "Ended up liking the format of the course being a seminar style lecture.",
                "Too much work plus a final on top of a semester long paper was a lot of work",
                "The Professor and TFs were fantastic. However, the canvas and the communication about assignments lacked clarity and had to often be fixed by students.",
                "The strengths are the format and workload. Maybe a weakness was some lack of objectives for each lecture that would be helpful to outline and go over.",
                "Strengths-- the readings are well organized and the slides are very clear. Prof. Sabin, however, I felt sped through the material too quickly in lecture, most of my learning was formed outside of lecture itself. The field trip was really cool as well.",
                "This class was very well organized in helping us write papers.",
                "This course has so many strengths and it was really enjoyable! The only weakness is that there are some small writing assignments that are sometimes tedious",
                "Weaknesses: readings were very white-male-writer centric. More writing by BIPOC, women authors would strengthen the course and round out its diversity of perspectives better. The course could also be even better and sharper if, outside of the whale oil unit, the different forms of energy and regulation discussed included information on their impacts on the non-human environment.\r\n\r\nStrengths: great coverage of a large time period and a wealth of energy sources and debates within that. Critical perspectives on justice and the social, political, and economic aspects of energy transitions.",
                "The leminar format was great for interactive learning, and I found that the workload was reasonable and kept me very engaged with the course",
                "Strengths: well-developed subject matter with a natural progression in topics, really fascinating readings, active teaching style\r\nWeaknesses: a little scattered sometimes, occasionally a lot of readings, skips quickly through some subjects and assumes a little background knowledge in others. The final exam AND final research paper was also a bit overwhelming, but the gradual building of a research topic was nice.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and lectures in this class. It adapted well with COVID restrictions, and I always learned in section with meaningful discussion. One suggestion I have is the structure of preparing to write the final essay. I think the first half of the semester writing assignments made sense, but I did not find that the assignments leading up to the final essay helpful. I would have rathered assignments that focus on an argument instead of writing on an individual source and trying to fit it into my final thesis. I did think this course was a little white-washed, however. Ideas like teaching that the environmental movement started in the 70s, etc is a poor representation of the rich environmental history that the US has had.",
                "I enjoyed the primary sources we got to read, and the course being structured around a large paper was very helpful. Professor Sabin was also a great and very engaging professor. I do feel that we could expand some topics to a multi-day discussion, as I feel that large issues like the 70s oil crisis were important on the exam, but we did not spend very much time discussing them.",
                "One of the distinct strengths of the course was the readings. Professor Sabin did an excellent job in only ever assigning one or two readings which were GOOD quality and engaging. Only a few times did I feel like the readings were too dense. I learned so much from the readings, and then we used them actively in class, so there was an incentive structure built in. If I didn't have the time to do readings, I was sad, which is a very good feeling!",
                "I believe my writing can be improved in the sense that I can be clearer in what I want to present to the reader.",
                "This course was really great. I loved the content and the way in which it was delivered, as well as the teaching staff.\r\nOne improvement could be consistency of minor assignments-- the due dates and times were always different, which sometimes made it difficult to keep track of from week to week.",
                "This class was amazing! The lectures were interesting, and section was a great place for discussion and asking questions."

                "Yes, yes, yes. This class has meant so much to me, and I am forever grateful for the things I have learned! Again, Paul Sabin and the TFs were also great facilitators of learning.",
                "YES! Take this class. Take it if you're interested in history, the environment, energy systems, global politics, Indigenous rights, environmental justice, and many other areas of study. I have found that very few people understand the history of American energy, and yet it is absolutely essential for understanding so much of what has happened in this country. TAKE THIS CLASS!",

                "Yes I would, especially those who are looking to fulfill writing credits or learn how to properly construct historic essays. It was a really fun class with a good mix of students and majors. Professor Sabin is a gem and all of the TFs were really chill and made section actually fun",
                "Yes! Great lectures and some of the best course readings I've had (disclaimer: I'm a stem major). The class is really eye opening from an environmental/energy history perspective and teaches about a million crazy things that feel like it should be impossible that I haven't heard of them before. While section was a bit disordered and the readings aren't great on getting a diversity of sources, I think this is a really good course overall.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for a student new to writing at Yale that wants to be guided through writing a paper in environmental history. I wrote on a rather unconventional topic, and I was supported throughout the whole process. It is a fairly basic writing class, so I think it is up to you to infuse difficulty/challenge/nuance if you're an upper-level student taking the course. I did feel that I learned a lot about environmental history throughout the course. For example, it was quite unique to learn how electrification of household appliances led to women's isolation within the home and augmented the cult of domesticity.",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student. The readings and work were very interesting on a week-to-week basis. I would caution anyone against taking this class as an easy WR credit though. The workload is definitely higher than I expected. Weekly readings and responses with a few essays/special assignments mixed in. Then there was also a 10-12 page research essay due during reading week in addition to a really long final exam (three 600-word essays and two 1,500-word essays).",
                "Yes - very interesting material and a good WR credit.",

                "Yes, I learned a lot about the inner workings of the energy system and the complex political scene behind the grid.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in history and energy, this is a great course for you.",
                "I would! This class was a great synthesis of my interests, and I believe that I have a much greater thematic understanding of American history and the current energy crisis.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to any student interested in the environment and American politics.",
                "Yes! It was amazing and one of my favorite classes. I learned so much about energy and American history through a unique lens.",
                "Yes; energy policy and history are fascinating and having a grasp of this history is very helpful in understanding the state of energy, climate, and regulation issues and discourses today.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy learning about the impacts of energy in America and the cultural and environmental impacts",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially if you have a speculative interest in energy, environmental studies, or history. It really just showed me whole histories I had never learned about and provided crucial context to understand today's energy landscape. Very accessible to non-EVST or non-STEM people.",
                "Id recommend the fascinating subject matter and methodical approach Professor Sabin uses to teach the practice of historical research.",
                "Yes! The writing I did for this course honed my skills and gave me a lot to think about for future semesters, and working towards a final paper at the end I think will help me in my senior thesis.",

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend the course. You learn so much that can be tied to environmental challenges today. The examples and history you learn will ring around in you head in the best way. AND the readings are great. Absolutely take this class!",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were interested in American energy and the politics around it.",
                "Yes! American Energy History was so interesting and well taught. Professor Sabin and the TAs make the course very engaging which allows you to learn and understand the information more deeply than traditional lectures. The course provides a good overview of US history through the lens of energy, which has shaped a lot of our society today. Professor Sabin also does a great job tying in current events, making the course feel more relevant.",
                "I recommend that every student take this class! My analytical writing skills grew dramatically over the course of the term and I came away with an entirely new perspective on American history. This class transformed the way I thought of the American energy landscape, showing the power of energy transitions as a driving historical force intertwined with capitalism, industrialization, labor unions, women's rights, US foreign and domestic policy, and cultural transitions. Professor Sabin is an amazing professor and the class has a wonderful lecture-seminar hybrid feel that kept all of us deeply engaged  with the material.",
