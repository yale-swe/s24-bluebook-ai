                "Strengths: Useful readings, vocabulary, grammar, and exercises.  Essay assignments were helpful, and I learned by doing.  Weaknesses: Assignments and details for each class were never set in stone.  Each unit was determined based on a recent news piece, but that meant we didnt know the homework for the next week until Saturday/Sunday.  It was hard to get ahead, and sometimes assignments would change mid-week.  Also the grade cut-off makes no sense - only 96+ would be considered an A.",
                "I think that this course is good in its flexibility and covering chapters in the textbook most relevant to current news. It was a bit too much of a workload at the beginning, but the professors listened to our input to adjust the workload.",
                "Some of the practices are a little repetitive but helps memorization, not much discussion in class, quizlet vocabs might be hard for some",
                "Strengths: diversity of homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses: final project was assigned pretty late, a lot of the course grading was not transparent, very hard to predict the grade you will get at the end"

                "Yes, I would. Even though it can be unorganized, and you might start off the term thinking it will be the hardest and highest workload class ever, it wont end up being that way!  I learned a lot about how to read and write news, which will help me stay more in touch with Chinese media and my family.",
