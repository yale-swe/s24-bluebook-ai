                "I learned a lot of niche information about America's history of public health, and believe this class incredibly comprehensive.",
                "Gained insights into how public health has evolved since the late 18th century up until the recent COVID situation.",
                "How to write a history paper",
                "I learned about the history of US public health from 1793 onwards. Topics included the yellow fever epidemics, the cholera outbreak, slavery and disease, disease during the Civil War, immigration, race and public health, eugenics, birth control, mothers and babies, child labor, the New Deal, malaria and World War II, vaccines, environmental poisons, smoking, civil rights, Indian health, feminist health activism, welfare rights and population control, AIDS, disasters, and COVID.",

                "Lot of main events in history that affected the public health of America since 1793",
                "History of many topics related to public health",
                "In this course, I developed a solid understanding of the evolution of public health in the U.S., tracing its history from early epidemics to current public health challenges. The course honed my skills in critical analysis, particularly in examining the complex relationship between medicine, society, and policy. I gained valuable insights into important social justice issues within healthcare, such as environmental justice, enhancing my awareness of the multifaceted factors influencing public health. The course also improved my research and writing skills, thanks to thoughtfully structured readings and an in-depth research project. The expert guidance of the course staff was instrumental in this learning process, facilitating engaging discussions and providing a nuanced perspective on the complexities of public health history and its contemporary implications.",
                "I learned about important public health events that occurred in the United States since its founding in the 18th century. Through these events, I learned about the history of racism and classism in American public health, and I now have a new perception of how these issues manifest themself in the public health system today.",
                "I learned about pivotal court cases throughout US medical history that will be useful in my future.",

                "Important events in the history of Public Health in America that have influenced numerous efforts and changes in addressing the various challenges facing our society.",
                "An amazing introduction to an extensive history of public health! I learned so much about synthesizing information from the interesting readings. We worked with the TFs to figure out how to pull information from various sources throughout the course of the class. Fascinating content and great skills for future history class assignments, whether it be an exam, an ID, or a research paper."

                "I like that the teacher was very involved and she knew the content very well. I wish they did better at going slower during the lectures or maybe cutting some unimportant content out.",
                "The lectures were pretty boring at times and there wasn't much variation between them. Also, the ideas felt kind of simplisticnot much nuance or challenged presented as far as the themes go. The strengths were that the selected readings were pretty interesting and it felt like we covered a lot! It's a big time period to tackle.",
                "The lectures are designed well, and the TF is amazing at leading her discussion section. Sometimes material is hard to connect and follow, and the slides are very long.",
                "The course is an excellent elective for anyone with an interest in history.",
                "Strengths: TFs cared. Weaknesses: having a final exam (30%) and a paper (40%). Professor never held office hours and did not send us any communication whatsoever on her own. Her only communication with us was telling us to wear masks. Holding office hours and generally providing advice for expectations for the essay or exams directly from the professor would help. Also highlighting key themes of the course would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Really detailed and it gave me through understanding of public health in a context i otherwise would not have gotten elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the information was slightly disorganized and i found it hard studying for exams because of the constant jumping around in timeline.",
                "None. It was great.",
                "Strengths: The course material is very interesting and gives an in-depth overview of US public health from 1793 to the present. I learned many new things and truly have a better understanding of US public health now. Weaknesses: The course lectures covered a lot of material (40+ slides worth with lots of text), which in itself is fine, but we were not told which of it was likely to be tested. This resulted in a lot of material that we had to study in depth for the exams and wasn't conducive to learning.",
                "The course is well taught by Dr.Rogers.",
                "Strengths were that the content was interesting but the weakness was that the flow of the lecture was not great and a little all over the place.",
                "Strengths - not too much work throughout semester, good lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lectures no recorded, lecture slides sometimes difficult to follow outside class, has both final paper and final exam so lot of workload at end of semester",
                "The lecture was a barrage of information without much organization or connection of central themes in public health. \r\nI think it would have been helpful to have to turn in a first draft of the paper for comments earlier in the course, or have there be two smaller writing assignments instead of one large research paper. I liked the structure of the midterm and final where we could choose between a few different prompts/ids since the course was very heavy on memorization.",
                "The primary strength of the course lies in its engaging and thought-provoking content, particularly its focus on healthcare disparities, which illuminates crucial aspects of public health. This focus not only enhances the course's relevance but also encourages critical thinking about societal challenges in healthcare. Another major strength is the final paper, which requires extensive research and exploration of specific cases. This assignment enhances learning by encouraging students to delve deeper into particular aspects of public health, thereby solidifying their understanding through practical application.",
                "The lessons were thoroughly taught, and I appreciated how they emphasized the interaction of public health and the social hierarchies and injustices that exist in our society. The readings provided for the weekly discussion section nicely complemented the lectures and provided students with a better grasp of the material. I appreciate the low workload of the course, but I believe it was challenging to have the final paper and the final exam due within a week of each other. It was also slightly stressful to have all of your grade depend on two exams and a paper. I might prefer if there were two papers and two exams split up such that none were due right on top of the other.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics and lecture slides are posted in advance.\r\nWeaknesses: No guidance on how/what to study for the midterm/final exam even though they're 2 out of 3 of the major percentages of your final grade.  Final paper and final exam. The ID's for the final exam covers the entire semester making it quite difficult to study/review since the lectures are lengthy.",
                "I think that the course could have been more engaging in person. The discussion sections were very useful and productive though.",
                "I really like the class overall, and the readings were great. However, I think the lectures slides were sometimes not super well organized, and I would have liked if there were review sessions held before the exams given the amount of material.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses. Professor Rogers is an amazing lecturer. The class pulls from a lot of information but does not go above anyone's heads. The TFs really work with you, and the conversations I had during my discussion sections were invaluable."

But I think there are more engaging HSHM courses for those looking to take an elective course from outside the major, and much more interesting history courses to fill your time with if that's what you're looking for. In other words, don't take this class just for fun.",
                "Yes, it was a good class for history.",

                "If you are genuinely interested in public health, this would be a great class to take. Class grading is very lenient and unlike other history classes you dont need to know the exact date of an event you can write a general period for your exams.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. This course was very interesting and teaches you a lot. Just be prepared to memorize a lot of names, laws, institutions, and dates for the exams.",
                "Yes I would",
                "not really. It was really hard to stay engaged in this course given that the lecturer wasn't that great. Tests weren't that fair in my opinion. It was all just memorizing every bit of lecture material and you had no idea what was going to be on the test. The IDs were all over the place and not relevant to the core material discussed and the grading was super subjective. If the TA didn't like your answer you weren't given points even though they didn't even have a guideline for what was right and wrong to say. Post exam feedback also wasn't clear at all. Overall, this class is okay if you want to just memorize a bunch of historical facts and dates, but not great if you like structure. This class would have benefitted more from essays than exams in my opinion.",
                "If you want to discuss public health today, this is not the course for you. This is a history course. The topics and readings are interesting though.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to other students, including those majoring in STEM fields! The course's engaging content and its focus on the historical patterns in public health make it not only informative but also intriguing. It provides valuable insights into how past public health challenges have shaped current practices and policies, offering a unique perspective that is beneficial regardless of ones major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in public health or medicine. The course provides helpful insight on the mistakes and successes of the public health sector from the past so that we may learn from these in our efforts going forward. The course also has a very light workload, making it a low-stress learning environment.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I would. I think the material was very interesting and is important to any student pursuing medicine.",
                "Yes I would. The class was super interesting and gives you a nice overview of current and past topics in public health which I think is vital for anyone wanting to go into health/medicine.",
                "Sure! I'd say it's important to engage in the material of the course on your own beyond what the teacher provides because it that way you can really gain a deep and meaningful appreciation for the plethora of ways the course can be a springing board for applying what interests me.",
                "Absolutely! Good for anyone who just wants to learn about public health or is interested in pursuing a career in the field or in history. Truly not that challenging, whether the individual in question be a first-year or an older student. That said, make sure you are paying attention to the little details. They are likely to be questioned during exams."
