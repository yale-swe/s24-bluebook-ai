                "Actually test us on things that we have learned. So many of the quizzes tested us on topics we hadn't yet covered in gen-chem lecture which hurt our grades (as compared to people who had already taken gen chem).",
                "This course was well organized and had clear weekly assignments. It could perhaps have benefited from clearer lab instructions, however; there were lots of day-of-lab changes to the lab manuals which were slightly confusing. I'm sure that could be fixed for next year. Everything was a strength.",
                "Professor Cooper did a fantastic job of keeping the students occupied and engaged with the material. Obviously, this course would be better in-person, but we did the best with what we could.",
                "For future online sessions, please give all the data in one file and\/or folder. Getting data in separate announcements, excel sheets, Microsoft word files, AND live sessions was an actual pain and incredibly messy. Not to mention, made it harder for everyone.  Also it would be nice to see where we went wrong on the quizzes, so making those available would be great.",
                "Strengths were that Prof. Cooper handled the virtual lab session very well (his demonstrations through the Zoom call were very useful) and Hannah was very helpful in providing feedback on our work. Weaknesses include that we had a lot of additional assignments (in addition to lab reports), which felt overwhelming at times (especially since everything was virtual).",
                "I think once weakness of the course was how sometimes students did not receive clear feedback on what they were doing wrong and how they could improve. I would recommend opening up the quizzes to view wrong answers and adding explanations for the correct one. One strength was the live virtual lab where we could see the lab play out in real time.",
                "The strength was that the professors put in their best effort to give the virtual students the best experience possible given that we were unable to go into labI appreciate the commitment to structuring the virtual lab in such a way that would allow us to virtually learn lab skills. However, the weakness is that often there was a large amount of unnecessary and tedious work added into the virtual experiencefor example, we were asked to copy down digital data files in our lab notebooks that would not be necessary in the in-person lab setting and ultimately didn't add anything to our learning experience.",
                "A big weakness: the lab manual usually just feel like a big step-by-step instruction manual. Sometimes you don't really know what you're doing, but you just follow what the manual says. It makes it hard to actually understand the procedures and why they work.",
                "I don't really think that there is any way to run a virtual lab like this in an effective way. The course wasn't great, but I don't see how it could have been, and the professor did a good job given the situation."

                "The online quizzes and online submission of lab notebook pages were very successful, and I think those could be kept even when virtual learning has ended. It really made the assignments easy to turn in. The online pre-lab lectures were not bad, but also not excellent -- I don't think the change in format affected their quality for better or for worse.",
                "I think this class did the best it could during the pandemic. It is hard to do a lab virtually, but they made it work!",
                "After some trial and error, we ultimately settled on a virtual format that I feel was very successful. Dr. Cooper had us walk him through the procedures of the lab, so we were all able to ask questions and learn from mistakes. In a way, I feel like I learned more from the virtual experience because we were being taught the entire time. Of course, watching is different from actually doing, but I don't think we were really taught proper technique in in-person lab anyway, so I'm kind of glad I missed out on the more stressful parts of lab like fending for yourself, freaking out about how little time is left, and watching your friend get scolded for breaking a beaker.",

                "I wish there would be a little more discussion of the concepts in the lab reports after they had been done, but I get the sense that student engagement was pretty low for this course so it may not have been fruitful. The labster simulations felt like an enormous waste of time, and although I understand what the rationale for assigning them was, it still just felt like busy work to pad out the course time."
