Yes, I learned a bit about archaeology, but I also learned so much about Egyptian history, the important pharaohs, architecture, Egyptian culture, religion, burial practices, agriculture, military organization, etc. This course in some ways functioned as a survey of Egyptian history seen through the lens of archaeology, by describing historical events and then using archaeology to back it up, which I thought was a perfect way to go about it. There was almost too much to cover, though, and I do feel bad that we did not quite make it all the way to the Ptolemaic period, though I am not personally disappointed as this is not my favorite era of Egyptian history."

                "Strengths: Professor Marouard is very kind and interesting, had well-prepared, well thoughout-out lectures. He also provided good readings on Canvas which I think improved my understanding of the class. The workload was not too heavy and seemed reasonable, and was also very accommodating for COVID issues.\r\nWeaknesses: It was too bad that we fell behind the schedule, and I wish we had had more options for discussion and interaction with our peers. I did ask a few questions, but perhaps there could have been a few classes where we all read the same article(s) with different viewpoints on a topic and then came to discuss them. I know this is very difficult over Zoom, though."

                "Take this class! Professor Marouard is so interesting, and it is such a great survey of Egyptian history which to my knowledge has not existed in such a comprehensive form at Yale in the last few years, if ever. Even for non-humanities students, there are still lots of facts and descriptions to memorize, and you have to recall particular pieces of evidence which support each claim, so it is very intellectually stimulating regardless of your major. You also put into it what you get out of it; the weekly workload is very low, so you could just attend lecture and you will still learn a TON of material, but by doing the readings and even looking things up on your own time you will be better able to synthesize a lot of the broader themes, which for me was a fun thing and improved my understanding of the material."
