Such a perspective expanded my understanding of the nature of literary experiment, why writers use it. The emphasis on black themes also challenged the idea of a curriculum or a canon, forcing us as a class to consider the questions themselves but also what these questions meant for us, given our positionality and place.",

In order to combat the depictions of the Black individuals through these accounts, Black academics engage in critical fabulation, which provides a counternarrative to the degradation of the black race by white people"

                "This course was very well organized, and our class discussions were really good",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the syllabus. Having page numbers helps with pacing yourself, content warnings help protect yourself, etc. A weakness is that the content can be (generally) very traumatic as we were reading slave narratives and slave owners journals and other texts that discuss the dehumanization of Black people. I found that aspect of the course draining at times and wish we spent more time on healing or temperature checks rather than viewing the texts with such objectivity.",
                "I wish there were more graded mini assignments that could give me practice writing. Hadn't written in around a year when the course started and felt like I needed to catch up.",
                "Strength: good mix of types of and mediums of materials we studied \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: took discussion sections a while to reach a truly engaging level",
                "While reading-heavy, the size of most of the readings and structure of the course meant that it felt like all of the texts got sure, thorough discussions, and all of the readings themselves were unique and fascinating. The class was clearly organized, with a detailed syllabus. The course gears itself toward discussion, often freewheeling, covering the broad range made available by the writings, taking intense, novel turns.",
                "For those who are new to Black history, the books that are read can be slightly convoluted and hard to follow. However, the shorter material read and discussed is extremely interesting."

The texts for this class were fascinating and thoroughly studied, leading to lengthy, intense discussions between students and the professor."
