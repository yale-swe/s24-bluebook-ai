This course developed my critical thinking skills, as I was required to respond to specific prompts about beauty and art. Because this course focused on the singular topic of beauty, my skills were able to develop at a quicker rate than they would in a class with broader, or more topics. With each assignment I felt that my analysis and depth was improving.",

We worked a lot on honing our writing skills, especially writing in active voice. A wonderful learning experience!"

The readings assigned were very interesting and diverse, and I loved being pushed to think about beauty in different ways.",

I loved the workshopping models and the individualized time taken to work by oneself or with partners. I've made a great friendship out of the class, and this is a testament to the close relationships we are encouraged to build with one another in order to ensure greater writing skills."

The content is interesting, the discussions are great, and we all loved Ms. Jones. You get out what you put into it, and I have become a much stronger writer for having taken this class."
