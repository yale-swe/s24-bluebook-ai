I think the most important part of knowing and understanding history is being able to apply it to current day standings, and we learned lots of things in this course that can be applied to current day.",
                "I learned about political ideas that developed in Britain in the 19th century",
                "intricate understanding of british history. further ability to analyse readings.",

                "This course could have shorter readings or have the longer readings spaced out more; there were times where reading the excerpts took over two days with a good amount of time dedicated to reading each day.",
                "Semmel's lectures were very good. The primary source readings were interesting and complemented the lectures nicely. Section was useful and interesting but it was more about answering the TA's questions than having an open discussion.",
                "Its very engaging. You know when a history class is fun that the teacher is doing a good job making the course exciting and interesting to listen to.\r\n\r\nNot a strong weakness I can think of",
                "I think the writing might have been split up better to have two smaller essays at the beginning and end of the course",
                "content ties together very well. covers topics across all regions of history within the timeframe. the course could do with cutting out the novel",
                "The major strength of the course is the engaging lectures by Professor Semmel.",
                "strengths: well organised thematically and chronologically, very engaging, readings were interesting, sections were great, Dr. Semmel is a very intelligent and clear lecturer. no weaknesses.",
                "The strengths are the lectures - Professor Semmel lectures in a very organized format and each lecture is based on a greater theme, while being vaguely chronological. This helps sort out and divide information. Sections, readings, and assignments were generally strong and fair. My only critique is that some of the weeks readings got a bit long/dense, and for some assessments terms got quite specific (ie it felt like you had to know a lot of little details). Overall this was a great course and I enjoyed sitting in class every week."

                "I would recommend to any student interested in British history.",
                "Absolutely - if youre interested in taking a shorter survey class this is a gem. most history courses arent primary-source based, but this one is, which really allows you to engage directly with the arguments of the time. the course also covers a period of great change in Britain, which is fascinating to learn about. If you are interested in political history at all you should definitely take this class.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in history and specifically British history, I definitely recommend this course. It was a solid and clear lecture with a great Professor and TA. I would probably only take it if you do enjoy British history/political history, because it was quite detailed, but as someone with little background knowledge on the period I very much enjoyed it.",
                "Yes, but be prepared for a course that almost solely focuses on British political history. If this interests you, it's an amazing course. If you're interested in more cultural or other types of history then this is not the right course for you."
