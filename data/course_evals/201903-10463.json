   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the lecture study guides are a strength of the course. A weakness is that sometimes professor Irish did not explain things well when students had questions about the material. I also wish that she uploaded the pdfs as 1 slide per page. The HW assignments were a little bit confusing as to what they wanted from you, and I wish she would have explained more in class before the HWs exactly what we would be expected to do.",
    "strengths-prof lin, teaching fellows, prof irish, all doing their best\r\nweakness- organization and feedback bit delayed",
    "It is well taught and very reasonable to understand.",
    "A strength was that the material was generally explained clearly in class and Professor Irish always answered everyones questions.",
    "The organization of this course is a definite strength, between the clearest lecture slides yet in the bio sequence, study guides, and constant review sessions. However, one area of the course is lacking in such organization, and that is the sections. I wish that the sections had been used as concept review instead of reading papers as it felt too rushed to actually understand the papers. I didn't realize how little I knew about biological methods until I struggled a bit with the methods section of my grant proposal, so I wish we had spent a little more time on that in the papers in particular (or maybe earlier than Lecture 12 in the class).",
    "There is little to no info on the slides besides pictures so it's difficult to study for quizzes unless you take very good notes.",
    "The course coordinator does a great job. The lecture was pretty boring but I like the structure of quizzes and final.",
    "Felt rushed at times",
    "The course did a good job of surveying the large topic which is genetics and development.",
    "The HW could have been more content based rather than the proposal that we did.",
    "The material is generally interesting, so lectures are often enjoyable. The weekly quizzes can be annoying, but they usually weren't too difficult. Sections felt slow at times, but the papers were a good way to apply the material learned in class.",
    "Very well organized with homework assignments, study guides, and weekly quizzes, quizzes are weighted heavily and can be very challenging",
    "discussion felt useless and the information was not helpful to understanding the course, sometimes class felt too long and was hard to stay engaged towards the end, so maybe finding ways to make the material more engaging could help. otherwise the pace was good and i was able to get help if i needed it",
    "The course was very good.  Professor Irish did a good job preparing lecture slides, and the cumulative nature of the homework assignments was very fulfilling.",
    "A obvious strength of this course was Professors Irish and Lin being very open to feedback from students and willing to accommodate any and all lack of understanding when questions were poised in class. I think that in terms of improvement a bit of restructuring of the HWs would be helpful. I often felt as if I needed to understand the entirety of a disease's development and progression (which was super exciting as I love this) but then was responsible to articulate some vague connected to a transcription factor that may not even be directly regulating my development process of interest in the way that the HWs questions asked us to write about. This often led to me losing numerous points on some HW, despite having spent significant amounts of time (way longer than I've ever had to for other biology courses at Yale).",
    "A strength of this course was that it was very easy to follow along with, but there were not a lot of application practices. I didn't feel like I was prepared enough to take the exams or quizzes no matter how much I went over my notes.",
    "The course itself was logistically organized well but the lecturer's response to student questions during lecture often left us more confused. Furthermore, the homework assignments, while graded quite nicely, were the most excruciating assignments I've ever done. The homework required several searches into a scientific research database with a very weak introduction into how to read scientific literature and many of the papers included terms that we, as intro bio students, would most likely not know. The intention and purpose of the exercise of writing a research proposal was clear but it felt more like a tedious homework than actual practice for future research proposals.",
    "Strengths - lecturing was clear, section was helpful\r\nWeaknesses - focusing on specific cases that didn't seem so important",
    "strengths: study guides and clear lectures\r\nweaknesses: discussion section material seemed to only peripherally relate to lecture content",
    "The homework was not well explained and I didn't gain much knowledge when doing it as a result. I think it would be more productive to have a different type of assignment or to have better directions for the existing proposal.",
    "The lectures did not seem coherent in that we seemed to skip around a lot. Additionally, the professor seemed to struggle with understanding questions and answering them in a way that made things clearer. Also, the assessments were not difficult conceptually, but rather in that the wording could be interpreted in many ways and made things complicated for no reason.",
    "I thought that the class was pretty well organized with the lecture slides being easy to follow. I also thought that discussion sections were useful in understanding\/supplementing what we learned in class.",
    "The strength of the course is the homework assignment. While the assignment is at times stressful, it also allows for creative, independent and novel thinking. Allowing students to design their own experiments challenges them to think through something that is interesting to them, and more broadly, potentially useful outside this course. Many students are interested in science because they are interested in doing this kind of creative thinking, not just in answering questions on a PSET. Its very special that bio 103 gives students this opportunity so early in their scientific careers.",
    "Strengths: good content and the readings went well with the coursework\r\nWeakness: teacher assumed that students knew certain things (which can be demeaning for students who do not have that same\/ideal background)",
    "The course could be organized in a more logical, cohesive manner- it felt like we were always jumping around, and we ended up covering some topics twice while we skipped over some and never returned to them. The course tries to cover so much that we never got to go in-depth about any particular topic, so I came away feeling as though I didn't gain any deeper understanding about any of the topics.",
    "Strength: pretty organized\r\n\r\nWeakness: grades were a bit subjective depending on TA",
    "Quizzes are hard and worded strangely. Give more time on quizzes as well as give more practice problems",
    "I think the course was too ambitious in that it tried to cover too many things in a very short period of time. This approach may not be the most effective way of learning?",
    "The course is well taught and I learned a lot; I have little negative input to offer.",
    "I think the exam and quiz questions were meant to trick us but other than that good course! Sam lin is the best!",
    "The class could have been a lot more engaging if it were shorter and more interesting lectures and teachers were more inclusive about help.",
    "The homework assignments were a major sources of frustration because I didnt feel like I had the necessary knowledge to be sifting through many dense scientific articles.",
    "Fairly interesting topics; but I believe a weakness is the long class periods.",
    "Great professor and amazing coordinator",
    "Strength: wonderful course coordinator and very interesting topics\r\nWeakness: very fast-paced and difficult exams",
    "The research proposal was not given with much context or any guidance. Had to figure it all out by myself with limited feedback.",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course is that it requires students to take initiative and explore independent projects that are highly applicable. However, it seems that the rigid format of the course and especially of the grading\/homework instructions does not yield itself to independent thought.",
    "I found sometimes the guidelines for the homeworks were not clear, and often had me confused.",
    "Strengths of the course include breadth of material covered and interesting case studies. Weaknesses of the course include the research proposal.",
    "This course was organized well when it comes to teaching the material, but I felt that the homework assignment seemed at many times futile and disorganized. In composing a research proposal one needs to have a firm background about the topic that they are writing about and a good mechanistic understanding of the underlying concepts that drive the trait that is discussed in the proposal. When asked to write a proposal about anything of interest to us, in a way that seems hasty, disorganized, and very much out of context, then that proposal is not going to be a good representation of holistic scientific understanding of concepts and biological mechanisms. Nonetheless, I still believe that the course taught me a lot and prompted me to engage with researching of scientific concepts and ideas.",
    "Faster feedback on homeworks",
    "If found some of the quiz questions to be much harder than what was discussed and prepared for in class and sections. The strengths was definitely the teaching and organisation of the class. The proposal was great practice and a very valuable way to engage in what we were learning. Getting one on one appointments with peer tutors was hard as they were usually busy.",
    "This course could be better organized, the lecture material was lectured in a very confusing manner, and we often did not have enough time to go over all the slides.",
    "Strengths - lecture slides provide well-needed visuals to guide understanding of material; lecture study guides really help streamline studying and re-inforce major topics for quizzes and exams; quizzes keep you on top of the material each week. Peer tutors and Professor Lin are an amazing and very helpful resource! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes I felt like lecture content was not explained well enough. Textbook readings were not very helpful.",
    "Interesting content, however, not taught the best. Sometimes difficult concepts were brushed over or rushed",
    "For strengths, lectures linked genetics and development really well. For weaknesses, the lectures were sometimes confusing and didnt completely engage the class. Answers to student questions were often vague and didnt answer the actual question.",
    "Weakness: the professor was not always clear or responsive to questions. The PowerPoints were sometimes just diagrams without explanations and then the explanation in class was not sufficient to understand them.",
    "This course has good foundational content but it could have been taught better. The lectures were generalized to the point where examples were vaguely introduced but not explained, and did not help establish the concepts. The quizzes were much more specific and often times, I didn't feel very prepared for them. The research proposal felt like a completely different part of this class which did not have much of a connection to the class concepts as a whole.",
    "I thought the class was kind of boring. A lot of material was not explained it depth, very surface level, and then the quizzes would ask more complicated questions than what we learned",
    "I feel like we could have gone  into a little more depth for some topics but overall  I feel like we had a great sweeping overview  of the subject",
    "Not very engaging awkward presentation of material.",
    "Love sam lin and the weekly quizzes",
    "This was a solid course. It could be improved with better pacing\/more time for classes.",
    "I feel like some of the questions on the quizzes (and on the exam) were a little ambiguous -- that is, sometimes, I felt like more than 1 answer was correct. I believe the questions should asked in a more direct way.",
    "I really liked all the teachers, including the professor, TAs, Tfs, peer tutors, and sequence coordinator.",
    "Strengths: experimental techniques were interesting, last two lectures on cancer and biotech were quite interesting, lectures were generally easy to follow\r\nWeaknesses: too much information and not enough time to fully understand it, study guides were not that helpful, research proposal was hard to get started with and didn't really help me understand the course material better, discussion section papers were hard to understand and not explained very well\r\nThis course could be improved if we had problem sets instead of the research proposal so we could better prepare for the quiz questions.",
    "Strengths: concise and clear lecture slides",
    "One major weakness is the discrepancies between what is covered in class and what is expected of students to know for assessments. There were numerous times when topics not discussed in lecture would pop up on our study guides for weekly quizzes with minimal explanation, which is not fair to students. The textbook readings assigned for additional help with lecture topics were also frequently poorly matched - the pages of reading would often cover entirely different topics than what the corresponding lecture covered, which made things confusing and also made it difficult to find explanations (better than the ones given in lecture) to confusing things in class. Prof. Irish is also not very good at answering questions directly - it is often frustrating being in class with many students asking very relevant and helpful questions about things that were often poorly explained, only to have Prof. Irish not answer them directly and verbally maneuver around what the students actually are trying to get at.",
    "Discussion sections were good. I wish there was a stronger connection between the course and the book. The lectures covered concepts too broadly and were not in depth enough compared to 102. We would often use words in lecture that were not defined, and people would have to raise their hands to ask questions about these ill defined words and concepts.  Piazza was important to fill the gaps left in class.",
    "provided fundamentals of concepts. lecturing was not great. not a fan of the structure and 6 slides per page is too many to print out. would be nice if slides were printed out for students.",
    "the lectures were all very dry, the quizzes and final exam at times did not provide enough information for us to answer conclusively, and the instructions for the homework writing assignment could have been much clearer. but peer tutoring and office hours with Professor Lin has always been a strength",
    "the quizzes were way harder than the material learned in lectures. Also the PSETs were useless.",
    "Have homework assignments that relate more closely to the course material.",
    "There is a lot of systematic support within the course for students who want\/need it.",
    "This course was great because it focused on concepts, rather than memorizing facts. A weakness was that the homework assignments could have been graded more quickly.",
    "Strengths: \r\nMaterial is interesting\r\nLectures were given at a reasonable pace\r\nWell organized \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nDiscussion sections did not review information from lecture\r\nSome discussion section leaders did not speak English very well and were difficult to understand.",
    "This is overall a good course, and Professor Irish is a wonderful teacher. She is able to explain the heavy amount of material very well, and Professor Lin is, as always, incredible. My only distaste with the course is that the homework is a step-by-step process of writing a research proposal, instead of a problem set that is linked to the course material. While we have weekly quizzes, I feel like having the homework directly related to the coursework would ensure that the content is understood.",
    "Strengths: ample support is provided in the course, namely the peer tutors (shout out to Seth!!!) and the lecture study guides\r\nWeaknesses: The homework is not related to the course material or only tangentially relevant- thus I think that the course could be improved by changing the homework to more relevant content",
    "The course is not very difficult and most is covered in lecture. Writing the proposal is easy but you dont gain much value from it.",
    "The course could be improved be creating more practice problems for students to prepare for the quizzes or to go over more difficult examples in lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture study guides were not necessary\/helpful",
    "Psets are not really related to course material\/what's on the quizzes.  Good class structure, however.",
    "Strengths: interesting content. Weaknesses: not taught very well, and discussion sections are not meant for further understanding material.",
    "The peer tutors and Professor Lin were amazing and helped me learn the material. Professor Irish is a clear lecturer.",
    "The structure of the homework assignments gave me great insight into the experimental methods and processes that we learned in class. Although the timing of grading gave us little time to correct our homework assignments, they themselves were useful review.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, meaningful homework, fair quizzes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Explanations not always as clear as they could be",
    "The course poorly evaluates students' performance, but the instructors are enthusiastic and mostly competent.",
    "I think the scientific paper could be better organized to allow for students to possess more freedom in their scientific research. A lot of students just threw in inquiries regarding transcription factors and the like because it was mandated in the assignment when, in actuality, they wished to explore other pathways sourcing a disease or development process.",
    "the material is pretty interesting.",
    "Prof. Irish is great but sometimes goes pretty fast. Enrichment is a great resource provided for people who aren't as comfortable with the material, and Prof. Lin is really understanding and works to help explain things to make sure everyone understands. Quizzes are weekly and helpful for getting you to learn material in increments, instead of cramming."

    "I think that this was an interesting Bio module. That being said, I would only recommend it if you need it for a major or for other mcdb\/mbb classes later on. I dont think that a nonmajor should take this.",
    "yes, the content is actually really interesting",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would recommend this course since it is part of the into bio sequence and also the material is interesting and important to understand. I also thought the research proposal assignment was helpful.",
    "This is the best part of the bio sequence so far. It starts from scratch and builds up to a thorough understanding of developmental biology, and all the pieces relate comes together clearly at the end. Professor Irish does a great job of explaining the concepts and then testing on those instead of route memorization (though sometimes that's difficult when we aren't given that much time to complete a quiz).",
    "If you can skip this course, skip it unless you feel you are weak in bio. It's not a bad class, don't take it if you feel like you don't have to.",

    "Only if required",
    "Only if required, otherwise, take other another more interesting course in genetics.",
    "If you are pre-med and or mcdb then it is one of the easier and well rounded of the bio sequence, but if you're not stem, don't take it.",
    "Yes, I think the material is very approachable and interesting, but if this isn't for your major, there are more interesting science classes to take.",
    "If interested in biology, yes. The information is very interesting, but is fairly challenging.",
    "yes, the professor was so much better than the prof we had for 102 (mooseker), and overall I learned a lot of good information, and it was the first time in the bio sequence that I could apply what i learned to real life conversations and situations",
    "Yes.  It was very well structured to make it not feel overwhelmingly difficult, but I still feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Most likely it is part of some requirement for you to take this course, however, I think that it is awesome. I am slightly biased as I really enjoy learning about heredity so genetics was simply great for that factor alone. If you approach this class with an open mindset (not one of being required to take this class) it will be a great quarter. Although the quizzes are tricky sometimes, this module has by far been my favorite so far.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was very easy to follow along and learn the content.",
    "Most likely you're taking this as a major or pre-med requirement. It's also a pre-req for a lot of upper level bio courses so you kind of have to take it if you want to do any life science stuff.",
    "Yes - it is a good introduction to genetics and development",
    "I would! a well-run and organized space to facilitate student learning",
    "Not unless it is required either for their major or for the pre-med track. Otherwise, I think this class is too much of a commitment. It wouldn't be worth it to me to take this class if it wasn't a required course.",
    "Most people take this course simply because it's a requirement. Otherwise, no.",
    "I would recommend it for a basic understanding of the two subjects, but not if you already have basic understanding of them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has taken the first part of the bio sequence and enjoyed it. Its an interesting class but cannot stand alone.",
    "not really but most people need it",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a very broad overview of genetics and development. If you are looking for in-depth knowledge about any of these topics, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, Professor Irish is so far the best professor I've had in the biology sequence. I highly recommend 103 with her as the professor.",
    "No",
    "Yes. Professor Irish was a great lecturer.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "I would recommend this course to people interested in biology; it is a good course.",
    "Yes it is a requirement but a good class",
    "Not really unless its a requirement",
    "I would recommend this course if one is considering a major within the natural sciences as it provides you with a an understanding to see whether you like it or not.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, very interesting for developmental biologists and for future scientific researchers",
    "If required for major.",
    "I think it is necessary for many endeavors at Yale and managed to compress a lot of useful and interesting information efficiently. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I feel like I have a much better understand of genetics, and would feel much more confident now working in a lab setting, for instance.",
    "No, not unless it is required because of the trickiness of the questions and the research proposal.",
    "This course is part of the introductory biology sequence, so it is highly unlikely that somebody would take this course if they did not need to. Having said that I think that the course provides a good foundational background of genetics and developmental biology, and I know that it made me more interested to learn more about those two areas.",
    "Yes its very interesting and you learn good skills for a future in a stem career",
    "Yes, you learn very important basic concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they had to take it for a requirement. It is definitely better than 101 and 102 in terms of content material, but the course is still dry and not very engaging.",
    "Yes, definitely! It is extremely interesting and a great introduction to genetics! This class has helped me realize that I am very interested in this field!",
    "Yes I really enjoyed this biology module compared to the others. Super interesting in my opinion",
    "The content was interesting but hw teaching quality was not very consistent. I wouldnt take it unless you need the intro bio sequence or if youre really interested in development.",
    "Only if you have to take it",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it is required to take higher level biology courses. However, I wish the class was more organized and more rewarding as a whole.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course unless you are majoring in something that requires bio",
    "Yes, it offers a solid intro to genetics and development",
    "You are probably taking this as a requirement but if you are not I dont recommend it unless you care alot about genetics and developmental biology",
    "Yes bc of sam lin",
    "Yes, it is a foundational biology course.",
    "Not if you are not required to take it. Otherwise, if genetics really interests you, take it.",
    "Yea I would. If you need it for evst I would take this over the other prerequisite",
    "Yes, if it is required as a prerequisite or if you want an introduction to genetics and are up for a challenge.",
    "Yes, if you have to.",
    "Its alright, but don't take it unless you have to. It is biology that you can learn from a textbook. The best thing about this course is the opportunity to write a research proposal.",
    "no.",
    "sure, this is a good intro to genetics, but it's dry",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, it taught bio concepts that aren't learned as commonly in other classes.",
    "Yes, this course is very good as it improves your critical thinking skills.",
    "You have to take this if youre PreMed",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone was pre-medical or a biology major.  I do not think it is a good class to take if one is solely interested in biology, because the workload is demanding.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if it is needed or might aid in a major. While the material is interesting, there is a large courseload and the content itself is difficult.",
    "Yes- I honestly think this course is worth taking even if it is not a requirement because it lays the groundwork for so much elementary science knowledge.",
    "Its required; so take it. You do cover a lot of material but the beauty behind it is masked by pretty boring lectures and disengaged TAs and assignments.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is interested in developmental biology and has the time to commit to doing many hours of studying and homework a week.",
    "Yes, if it's required for MCDB or pre-med.  Not as a general science credit.",
    "Only if they need it for their major -- more interesting bio classes exist",
    "Yes, please take this course if you plan on doing any form of biological science in the future or if you are interested in how the body is formed.",
    "Yes, this course gives you a good overview of genetics and development.",
    "Yes. Overall a good class",
    "It is required. If not, I wouldn't take it.",
    "Absolutely, Prof Irish is amazing and the material is especially useful for anyone interested in scientific research.",
    "yes, I actually liked it,",
    "Only if you want to be a bio major or need to take it for a requirement. It's not worth it otherwise."
