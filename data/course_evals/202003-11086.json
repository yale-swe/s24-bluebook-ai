                "Strengths: Pretty much everything. It was a very well organized course. \r\nWeaknesses: If you take the course online and not everyone's mic is muted during conversation it can be hard to hear or ask questions to the professor.",
                "The constant engagement is very good for reinforcing the language and writing systems. Homework exercises were actually useful and not redundant. The clinic section is also very good because you get to practice speaking and can learn more 'actual' Japanese rather than just formal stuff.\r\n\r\nCould be interesting to include more videos and listening to native speakers. There was some of this and obviously you won't understand much at L1, but listening to actual conversational Japanese rather than textbook conversations designed for learners is helpful.",
                "Strengths: Good pacing, reasonable workload.\r\nWeaknesses: lots of printed-out assignments. For virtual learning, this isn't great, and investment in a tablet for note writing purposes is recommended."

                "This was the only class that actually had a functional hybrid learning system, where we had mixed in-person and remote attendance for whoever was on campus. It was very useful in engaging with the class and I definitely got to know my classmates very well through meeting them in-person. \r\n\r\nI think some of the homework and tests could be better suited for online work, especially because on-campus people didn't have access to printers for the first couple of weeks. This is pretty minor though, and hopefully won't be required soon.",

Even if you don't speak\/read\/write Mandarin this is a very accessible class and you will have no problems with reading and writing the scripts. Everyone I've spoken to loved this course. If you're thinking about Japanese for your language requirement or even just for fun, DO IT.",
                "If you're new to the language and are really interested in learning it, I would recommend this course. In one semester, you learn two whole writing systems and some of the third, as well as enough grammar to maintain a basic conversation.",
