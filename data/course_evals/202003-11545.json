                "Strengths: The professor was very clear and thorough during lecture. Exams were explained clearly and allowed ample preparation.\r\nWeaknesses: There were mini psets that were only opened after lecture and due the morning after the next lecture. This was difficult for the mid-week psets when I was busy because you only had 2 days to do it. Maybe in the future it would be better to have weekly psets so one could work on them over the weekend or when they have more time.",

                "Professor Tarhini did not know the prerequisites of the course nor the required material for future courses. He taught based on his coast guard academy curriculum of a similarly-titled course. He was completely unresponsive and the amazing TA basically ran the class. In addition, he did not go through examples. He scrolled through PDFs of problems that he had completed instead of completing problems in front of us. The class was not conducive to learning. I read the book and watched the recorded lecture at x2 speed in order to learn, but still had to attend class live for participation credit. The whole class arrived and turned their cameras off (apart from 2-3 out of 27 students). He was not engaging at all. Please hire more Yale full time professors for engineering department.",

                "There was not much structure for the exams. Typically exams took way longer than expected",
                "I think the class has strong TAs, but the live lectures are a bit slow and hard to understand. We go over problems, but the professor never writes anything down, so it's hard to follow.",

                "Had three ish question psets about the lecture due the morning after the next lecture which helped solidify and make sure you knew what was happening in each lecture. Taught kind of from a book and I personally learned a lot online through other sources of information but overall was fine all around. I think different students learned different ways in this class but for me this method worked best. All in all what the course was what you would expect.",

The first few weeks at least were all things we had learned in physics.  The homework was very relevant and extremely helpful for learning the material.  The office hours system was also very helpful.",
                "Course is just fast enough to be a decent but not overwhelming amount of work. A lot of time was spent going over examples in-lecture, which I'm not a huge fan of, but I think if there was less to go off of as reference the class would be infinitely more difficult.",
                "The live lectures were nice in that we could engage, but at times it was difficult. It might have helped to have more breakout rooms to help with discussion and perhaps a different time slot as for many of us the lectures were right at dinner time.",
                "The lectures were well planned out and easy to follow. I liked how Professor Tarhini gave a lecture on the concepts and then did many example problems during each class, instead of just one or the other. The multitude of example problems (and the extra ones on Canvas) were really helpful for doing the homework and studying for exams. I would have liked more class participation, but that is really hard to enforce. Professor Tarhini did a good job engaging the class and giving opportunities for student responses but it would have been nice if more people would have participated too.",

While Professor Tarhini seems that he would have been a great lecturer any other semester, the zoom format made it much more difficult to follow along with him.

                "Having lectures recorded was incredibly helpful. Professor Tarhini did well with screen sharing problems and solving them on screen and annotating the lecture power point as he gave it. He continuously put in effort to engage the class and get student responses. Often a student would chime in, but it would have been nice if more of the class was participating, but of course that's hard to enforce.",

Overall the content was good to know but slightly repetitive from some of the content pot in mechanical design.",

I needed to take 280 for my major anyways, but a few people were in the class just to learn. Don't take it as an extra class if you already have a super-high workload, though. It's interesting but a bit time consuming, like most other MechE classes.",
