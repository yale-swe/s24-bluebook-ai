                "Admiral Weigold and INDOPACOM were able to connect us with really impressive people for us to interview and chat with. These were people I would have no access to otherwise. Teamwork was also a big strength of this Capstone",
                "Strengths: Admiral Weigold's network of speakers who came to lecture and support us with our project were high-caliber and insightful. \r\nThe communication of INDOPACOM when we asked questions through electronic communication. Project's problem was of timely nature and relevant to current affairs. Instructor's willingness to mentor and give great advice on client-consulting issues. \r\nWeaknesses: Due to extremely conservative COVID restrictions, students were unable to receive the full experience of the Capstone project. It appeared insensible that certain teams were allowed to travel domestically, while some who also had domestic clients were unable. Expectations of INDOPACOM and project's scope were slightly broad.",
                "The strength is Admiral Weigold. A weakness may have been that perhaps there should have been more guidance from both the client and Admiral Weigold.",

                "I would recommend Admiral Weigold's capstone program because Yale does not offer many opportunities for students to work directly with government partners such as the Department of Defense. As the largest employer of the U.S., understanding the DoD's mission and its personnel is critical in all domains of politics, national security and economy. I highly recommend this course to anyone who also searches for an excellent, transparent mentor like Admiral Weigold.",
