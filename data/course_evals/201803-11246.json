    "The capstone project has been one of the highlights of my time at Yale -- it combines every key aspect that makes a course great: an amazing professor, teamwork, learning new knowledge and skills, and truly collaborative teamwork. I learned new software (Twitter data analysis), new history and politics (Russian and Soviet propaganda), and new facets of how to work with a client on a deadline. Additionally, the chance to present in front of Yale and non-Yale audiences honed my public-speaking skills. The capstone is a significant part of why I chose the Global Affairs major, and I wish it were available to more students at Yale. This was a critical and fascinating experience."
