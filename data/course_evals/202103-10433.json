                "A much more comprehensive understanding of Goethe's Faust, to be sure.",
                "This course was an excellent exploration into a single text worthy of an entire semester. Through this class, I learned how to engage with a text beyond a typical undergraduate read-through, ask questions that a particular text is inclined to answer, and \"find my own voice\" with a text (as stated by the professors). Faust itself is exciting and rewarding enough to read, even without Professor Hagens and Wetters guiding the class, but this class' particular engagement with the text made exploring the text worthwhile to my writing\/thinking skills as well.",
                "This course greatly developed my close reading skills; students are required to read large and complex assignments for each class which are then discussed in great detail. I also learned skills regarding the application of texts to one another. For the second half of the class, we read various literary theorists and philosophers who used Goethe's Faust as a proxy by which to analyze modernity, technology, class, or other realms of philosophical inquiry. This was a novel methodology for me, but one which I enjoyed and was introduced well by the professors.",

            "comments": [
                "It felt too much like a graduate course at times, with us talking very sweepingly and generally about material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professors. Hagens and Wetters each carry their own engaging, thought-provoking takes on Faust, and their direct engagement with students on their midterms, in-class projects, and finals assure that students can take away more from this class than they could with most other professors. \r\n- Course roster. Including undergraduates and graduates in the course facilitated learning for undergraduate classes more than I could have expected prior to taking the class. The questions graduate students raised offered thoughts that I would have otherwise not have been able to engage with during my time at Yale. Having two professors and an excellent TA for a seminar made the class all the better as well. \r\n-Projects: Students engage with professors across three projects, all of which are able to be in dialogue with each other. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Meeting time. I believe that meeting once a week ultimately hindered our discussions. Only having two hours to discuss a whole act from Faust, Part II left many questions unaddressed entirely. Further, there are so many topics to discuss in Faust that compete for the class' attention, so in-class discussions cannot be prepared for in advance beyond the knowledge that we're covering a certain part of Faust. Not a huge problem at all, but it's the only thing I can think of.",
                "Strengths: The professors and TF were exceptionally passionate and engaged about the material, meaning the discussions were always eye-opening and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is expansive and can be overwhelming and times. The professors provide very open-ended assignments, meaning that students must be very engaged with the readings and meet with the professors outside of class in order to conceive of a paper project that is manageable and relevant.",
                "The idea of the course, to focus on Faust II and take students through some of its reception history starting relatively early on was great. Nonetheless, an extra week to explore Faust I might have helped prepare us for the main part of the course."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students! Odds are that everyone interested is aware of a \"Deal with the Devil\" story of some sort, so this class will be interesting to anyone who is willing to actually do all the readings. That is, this class DEMANDS that you get all of the reading done (which is admittedly not too much), but taking the class otherwise will be pointless. Regardless, if you are interested in taking a class that gives you a taste of graduate-level discussions, class projects you are genuinely interested in, and a text worth your time, I recommend trying this class out.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student who was very interested in Goethe and Goethe's Faust. It would be risky to take the course if one had not had previous engagement with the text, as there is no avoiding heavy engagement with the text. However, if one is interested in Goethe's Faust, this course is a fantastic way to expand one's understanding of the work and its continuing relevance."
