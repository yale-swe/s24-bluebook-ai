                "Birdwatching with Prum was fun! It's tough to evaluate this course imagined as a non-pandemic course, I just know that it wasn't the perfect class for the recorded lecture format. I think the in-person excitement is probably the most important thing about this course in a typical year.",
                "This was a fantastic class. No comments.",
                "Strengths: AWESOME PROFESSOR. Rick Prum is a legend within the bird community who has made a few seminal discoveries in ornithology which you get to learn about throughout the semester. Enjoyable class with interesting lectures. Appropriate workload, the right amount to keep you excited about the material. Good overview of a lot of different topics. Weaknesses: 9 am on MWF.",
                "I thought this class was really strong, no suggestions.",
                "The course was well-structured, and you will learn a lot of interesting things! Professor Prum is amazing and is very passionate, and I found the course very engaging. There is a lot of content, but it's well worth it.",
                "Great course, weakened significantly by the online format. Professor Prum is fantastic, and the structure of the course is reasonable.",
                "Strengths: This course was fascinating! Dr. Prum is a great lecturer who makes the material very interesting with lots of stories and anecdotes. The workload was reasonable, and made engaging for the most part. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One thing is that the work felt really biased towards the end of the semester, especially when combined with the associated lab. Having two papers due within a few days of each other, as well as the class final very early in finals period was a lot to deal with at the same time as every other class having final papers due. This was obviously an unconventional year though, and the lab papers were a new type of assignment so some difficulties were to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe term paper also felt a bit sudden. I think it would have been nice to dedicate some time to discussing it earlier on. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that I would exactly call it a weakness, but the lectures are organized in a really conversationally-flowing way that naturally came around to stories and whatnot. This made them engaging to listen to and is preferable to dry bullet point lists. But at times it did make it challenging to know that the notes I took were adequate.",
                "The material was really interesting, and the professor was very enthusiastic and engaging. I also really liked the in-person birding events and would have liked more of those.",
                "Considering how many topics we covered, the class was very well-organized. Each new unit built upon the last resulting in a comprehensive summary of the biology of modern birds. While there were a few challenging concepts to grapple with, Dr. Prum had no shortage of analogies and helpful graphics in his powerpoints to ease any confusion. The term paper was valuable in that it encouraged us to delve deeper into topics we found interesting, but, especially towards the start of the project, I felt as though I did not exactly know what was expected of me. Some more direction, especially for those who have never written a review paper, would be useful. While it is only a weakness if students are not engaged with the content, the lack of assignments for the first half of the semester might make students who don't review the material to slip behind before the first exam."

                "Yes! You will learn a lot about birds and Professor Prum is so enthusiastic about the subject! This course was a great experience. There is a lot of content, but tests were changed to be open-book, so it wasn't much of an issue for the COVID edition of the class - otherwise, prepare for memorization and the need to take notes very carefully. That being said, the content is fascinating and bird-related facts were definitely a non-negligible component of my conversations with my friends this semester!!! Highly recommend.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student. I took it as a non-science major and it was a lot of fun immersing myself in the field. Professor Prum is the selling point of the coursehe's passionate, interesting, and a really sweet guy. The semi-regular birdwatching expeditions were also really cool, and gave the class a more practical dimension",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in birds or looking for a fun science credit!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has even a vague interest of birds. The class covers so many aspects of their biology that there is bound to be at least a few topics that will captivate just about anyone. I would also strongly suggest to take the lab along with the class, since it attached the general information we learned in class to specific examples across the lineage. But be warned that you won't get your first grade until the midterm and the last few weeks can get very hectic with the final and term paper to take care of. That being said START THE TERM PAPER EARLY and you'll be perfectly fine."
