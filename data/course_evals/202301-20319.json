                "A strength of this course was that it was very well organized, and the class material + psets were similar to the exams.",
                "Strengths: this course is very organized, and Rachel is such an amazing professor! She makes math easy and entertaining! \r\n\r\nWeakness: none",
                "I loved Rachels teaching style and the way she ran classes. I do wish there was slightly less supplemental material. It often felt redundant",
                "This class was amazingly taught by Professor Diethorn (sad to see that she will be leaving). I think the review sections could be structured better and more standardized, especially for the final when the content is only being reviewed once.",
                "explores are very confusing before class",
                "I loved the smaller class size and the structure of the course.",
                "It was a very well organized course that sought to provide students with resources to help them.",
                "I thought the course was very well organized and found it easy to learn the content. Most assignments helped further my understanding but there were a couple of small assignments that were kind of useless",
                "Strength: I loved how Professor Diethorn would carefully explain concepts in a way I could grasp. After learning the volume under the curve so many times, this is the first time understood how to set an integral for different equation boundaries. The professors are generally all nice and welcoming to people just starting math, and I would encourage taking this course as a refresher of math concepts or as a first math class. The cheat sheets we can bring for midterms and the final are also extremely helpful as well.",
                "I feel that this course with my specific teacher did a good job in conveying the information for students to understand it. I feel that the lectures were engaging. As for weaknesses, I feel that the deep delve into \"why\" for certain concepts helps learning but sometimes they go on too long and take away from the actual application practice during lecture and requires even more work outside of class to fully grasp it.",
                "I really liked the course in most aspects. However, the daily explorations were really painful. I never felt like they helped me learn. It was always a drag to force myself to complete them.",

I think that math 120 would have been too difficult of a math class for me to take since my Calculus BC skills were a bit weak, and the intensity of the course would have been challenging to handle. Math 115 was more suitable to take as a first math class for someone who was not that strong in Calculus BC and had not taken a math class in a while.",
