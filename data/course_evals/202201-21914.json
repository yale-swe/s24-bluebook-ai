                "There was very little instruction regarding the actual dissection part of the class. As someone who had never done any formal anatomical dissections before, I would have appreciated a bit more formal guidance.",
                "I really liked the final practical style. It could be improved by having lab reports instead of practicals.",
                "The instructor and TAs were always present and engaging with insightful answers and assistance",
                "Strengths: The course covers a lot of ground and has many fascinating dissections\r\nWeaknesses: While this wasn't really in the control of the instruction team, the dissections were often very difficult to carry out in the time we had/with the specimens we had to the level of quality where we would be able to see the structures we were meant to see. This meant that for the lab practical, we were often trying to answer questions based on things we hadn't seen ourselves or had seen only very roughly. There was also almost no anatomical introduction to the dissection labs beyond diagrams and lists of terms; I ended up having to figure out a lot of the homologies, functions, and naming conventions by myself through Googling while reading my notes before the final. I think more in-depth lab handouts with explanations of function/homology, or longer pre-lab discussions from Professor Moyer, would have done wonders in helping us appreciate what we were seeing.",
                "Strengths: very patient and helpful teaching team. We would ask so many questions during lab and they were always happy to help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: studying for and taking the exams is very difficult. Its hard to transfer everything from in person dissections to photos, study from these photos, and then transfer this knowledge to in person specimen that are different from the ones we originally dissected."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone taking the lecture as well",
                "A biology lab with real specimens is a wonderful experience that many people probably haven't had, and this lab certainly gives a great selection of such experiences. Do be prepared: there is somewhat of a learning curve in figuring out how to study for the practicals. The 50-55 questions on the two practicals, with at least 80% of them having 1-word answers, made up 50% of our grade, so one question missed could mean 1% down from the final, uncurved grade. Outside of that quirk of the grading, though, the class was a lot of fun and I'd highly recommend it to anyone taking the comparative anatomy course (E&EB 290)",
                "Yes if you need to take it. Exams are difficult, so Id you just want to dissect some vertebrates and learn about them for fun, maybe consider credit/d/fail!"
