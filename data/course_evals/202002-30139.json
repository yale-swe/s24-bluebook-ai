   "comments": [
    "I gained knowledge of green technology and the interdisciplinary nature of climate related problems and responses.",
    "I learnt a huge amount about the different kinds of green energy systems that are in use and currently being developed. The course gave me a better understanding of the overall lifetime impact of these systems, and the difficulties implementing them compared to existing technologies.",
    "The most widely used green energy technologies.",
    "This course was very useful, especially for my engineering background. It provided me with knowledge about every renewable energy source available globally in a detailed manner, including topics on their technological, environmental, and economic aspects. In addition to that, the course gave me insights on how renewable energy will contribute to the energy sector in the future. A new skill and concept I learned from this course was Life Cycle Assessment of renewable energy technologies, where greenhouse-gas emissions are analyzed from every phase in their lifetimes, not only during the operational phase.",
    "I developed the ability to apply concepts of sustainable energy infrastructure to my concentration (political science).",
    "An understanding of renewable energy systems and their pros and cons.",
    "In depth understanding of multiple renewable energy sources. Discussion in an interdisciplinary manner (economics, policy, etc).",
    "I learned a bit about different green energy technologies, and how they can be applied.",
    "I learned about different renewable energy sources and learned how to compare and contrast different renewable energy techniques. We learned about life impact assessments for many different energy sources."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes instruction for assignments was not particularly clear, however, professor and TA were willing to speak to students about confusion and generally did not seem to prioritize arbitrary things like length and spacing. Occasionally, more specificity would have been helpful especially as students tried to meet expectations.",
    "professor could be more engaging - I was often bored and zoning out in class.",
    "The course is well-structured and dedicates lectures to a specific topic or energy system, making them easy to follow. The assignments are regular but not overly time-consuming, and the overall structure of midterm and final project is very manageable. I particularly liked the final project as it gave us an opportunity to apply what we learned to our own majors and fields of interest, which gave the class a personal touch. One potential tweak to the course is that it would help if assignments and modules were uploaded to Canvas earlier, so we could get a better sense of the class structure and potentially look ahead. On a similar note, feedback on assignments could have been given earlier before the midterm so we had an idea of where to improve.",
    "The prerecorded lectures cover basically the same thing as the synchronous sessions. Maybe the prerecorded lectures or the sessions can be designed differently?",
    "This course provided me with many benefits, equipping me with new and useful knowledge which will certainly be an asset for my future plans. A strength I observed of this course was its ability to adapt to the multi-discipline students by not focusing on the equations and mathematical parts, but also discussing about policies and economic parts. \r\nAn improvement to this course would relate to Canvas' limitations. Nearing the end of the course, we were supposed to submit our final papers a day after the last class. However, Canvas would not allow our teacher and teaching fellow to add a submission after the last class, causing confusion between the students. In the end, the professor and teaching fellow allowed us to submit the final papers by email the day after our last class.",
    "Strengths: broad overview of the strengths and weaknesses of different green energy systems was taught!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really dont believe there were any. Truly an interesting and engaging course!",
    "Interesting topic, good work balance, not the best professor.",
    "Very interesting material, sometimes lecture was a bit monotone because breakout rooms were not utilized.",
    "This class needed a lot more organization, and a big update. Most of the material was from before 2011, which seems like a problem in a course about such quickly-developing technology. The recorded lectures were exactly the same as the lectures in class, which was frustrating. The expectations for assignments were also very unclear.",
    "I think the actual lectures could be slightly more engaging but the actual material was vey good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's boring and the prof isn't super interesting, but the material is helpful and important to know and it was a really easy gut science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who has distributional requirements to fulfil, or even just an interest in the future of green energy. The class was thought-provoking but not overly challenging, and inspired plenty of discussion within the class. Professor Khalil is a wonderful lecturer and explains the concepts clearly. I am really glad I took this class!",
    "Not entirely sure. A good gutone big take home midterm and one final project, both very long but not hard. The professor is really knowledgeable and passionate and genuinely wants to facilitate good discussions. But most people take this class as a gut so the questions being asked are not high qualityfeels like therere people asking mindless questions, which is kind of toxic",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students, especially students with interests in renewable energy and sustainable development. Any student with any background or major would be recommended to take this course as it did not focus on the mathematical parts only.",
    "Absolutely! As sustainability and tackling climate change move to the forefront of political debate, every individual should have a baseline knowledge of the myriad of green energy solutions out there. This course provides students with the conceptual framework to understand the merits and drawbacks of many of those solutions and encourages us to apply that knowledge to our respective fields of interest.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the topic and doing your own research on most of the topics. The workload is very managable and there's not a ton of math required. Professor Khalil is very bland and although he attempts to help students, there appears to be an evident gap in understanding at times. Most of the lectures are literally copied and pasted from his old course and he has not updated anything for current values.",
    "Yes, overall it is an interesting course that is very applicable as energy policy is constantly changing and evolving so I think it is very valuable information to learn.",
    "No. Professor Khalil means very well and is a sweet man, but this class was a bit of a disaster. I'm a humanities student, and took this as my last science requirement. It's the first stem class I haven't enjoyed. Most of the material was from before 2011, which seems problematic in a course about such quickly-developing technology. The recorded lectures were exactly the same as the lectures in class, which was frustrating. The expectations for assignments were also very unclear. Most of the students had no idea what was going on at any given time. The work load itself wasn't all that much, but it felt a bit like busywork.",
    "Yes, because it is an insightful class and I think the material is very important"
