                "The lectures and textbook were useful but it was often hard to connect the topics between lectures. I found it hard to be completely engaged in the class given that the quizzes could easily be made up for with Marknotes.",
                "I liked the homework + practice session + quiz format as a less-stress way to still learn a lot.",
                "Professor Brinda was definitely the highlight of the course. He was super attentive and very considerate. The material was well paced.",
                "Strength: The quizzes and marknotes were great for me. I really liked this approach and definitely think it should be used in the future\r\n\r\nThe biggest strength in my opinion is that Dr. Brinda's approach has really allowed this information to stick in my head. Far too often, I learn material for a course that then fades quickly since much of it boils down to memorized sometimes esoteric information. I do not feel this to be the case in this course. I think I have gained a strong and (hopefully) lasting understanding of linear models.\r\n\r\nWeakness:",
                "This course is without weakness from the professor. Prof. Brinda teaches with a trident that is comprised of 1. his teaching, 2. his book \"Visualizing Linear Models\", from which the course content is extracted, and 3. the Marknotes software - an online, complimentary, mathematics practice tool that follows the course content exactly. Together, these three components function to teach a student Linear Models as optimally as possible. This course has no hesitation, this course has no stumbling block, this course has no laziness.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that this course is easy. The goal of Linear Models is to teach a student to become an expert in linear modeling theory, and it will do so, if you work with its seamless components. There are weekly assignments that are based off the lectures, and there is an end of term exam. These are challenges, but you will be well equipped.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is that the TA's are overly stringent on grading the assignments. This is a mathematics course, not a programming course. The assignments are in R, and while you can get every mathematical item correct, a coding mistake can reduce your grade. Listen, we'll get over that - but I was searching hard for a trivial weakness. The course is near perfect.",
                "i really like the professor and his hand writting notes and quiz everycourse. it really helps me to participate more in class and understand better by marknotes",
                "Really great course. It can help solidify your previous knowledge as well as help you learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: very methodological approach to building up what a linear model is. We got a TON of background, but it was all very useful background. By the time we got to actual linear models, we had all the background info we needed. I know Prof. Brinda was concerned that we didn't get to linear models soon enough, but I think the pacing was great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Marknotes had its flaws. I love the idea of practice counting as a significant portion of our grade, but the Marknotes system made it difficult for me to advance to later problems. I go more into depth with this in the Marknotes-specific survey.",
                "Having required weekly practice sessions helped me engage and feel like I understood the very complicated topics in the course.",
                "Absolutely loved how the course consisted of daily 30 minute practice instead of exams and midterms. I didn't love the quizzes in every class, but I supposed that they helped me learn as well.",
                "This course is comprehensive and I learned a lot. But I also have two suggestions for the course. 1. To be honest, at the beginning of the course, I don't know why we need to learn projections first, and I think it will be better if you could provide an outline about which part are you going to talk about in which day.",
                "This class is probably the best S&DS course I have taken as a third year in the major. This class combines fundamentals from MATH 222/225, S&DS 241, and S&DS 242 to produce a class that makes you realize how all of the concepts from various classes can be used together. \r\n\r\nI do not think there are any substantive weaknesses of the course. The quizzes and practice sessions were fair. The lectures were amazing.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets were well designed and truly applied our knowledge from class onto problems.",
                "Strengths - it's easy but you still learn a ton of material. Marknotes was a good idea. Weaknesses - not much really",

                "This course is truly amazing. Strengths: it facilitates learning in a non-stressful environment, Brinda is a brilliant lecturer, Brinda's textbook is amazing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brinda is a gem and should be the only person teaching this topic. His book is very well-written and a good resource for following along with the lectures. His exam was also very fair; he was very clear about which material would appear so that students were not overwhelmed. \r\nWeaknesses: The weekly practice sessions (done via Marknotes, an online flashcard resource) were a bit of a mess. They were supposed to progress along with the lectures, but everyone I know got stuck on the flashcards from the beginning of the semester. Also, since there wasn't a course examination until the end of the semester it was easy to not hold yourself accountable to learning the material.",
                "Strengths - Dr. Brinda is a great lecturer and very accommodating and the textbook is super helpful (since lecture is a bit confusing)",
                "Strengths: Dr. Brinda was so amazing as a professor of this course. The material is sometimes pretty intimidating especially if you aren't very comfortable with linear algebra, but Dr. Brinda is very good at explaining things in a way that is understandable. Another huge strength is Dr. Brinda's philosophy with learning. He believes in \"spaced repetition,\" in which we engage in low-stress, low-stakes weekly practice sessions that encourage slowly mastering topics over time. I believe this really worked and led to a relatively low stress class while still enabling us to learn a lot. Also, the homeworks were very interesting and were a great connection to topics covered in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class up until the final was a little bit too easy to get by without doing too much... 75% of the grade (and about 90% of the class up until studying for the final) was very low stakes and not too difficult, so it's completely up to the student to stay on top of the concepts and make sure that they are learning everything. It's entirely possible to complete this course up until the final without ever really internalizing any of the concepts, but the final itself was very difficult and you definitely need to have been on top of things during the semester to do well.",
                "Dr. Brinda is the best professor I have ever had and it is not even close, his ability to communicate complicated concepts is outstanding. I had a really good math background so the first few weeks were not new stuff to me, however I found his insights into the spectral theorem and the singular value theorem to be really enlightening",
                "Very accessible to all students. 50% of the grade being quizzes and review sessions gave students a lot of confidence and made it more likely to enjoy the material without worrying about the final grade.",
                "Professor Brinda is an amazing lecturer and its clear he cares about his students and quality of education.",
                "At times, the course felt a bit too easy. Furthermore, the practice problems became a game of memorization instead of application of knowledge after a few sessions.",
                "Strengths: it is a relatively low workload but high-learning and engagement course. I found the amount of learning relative to the amount of out-of-class time dedicated to be an incredibly high ratio, much higher than most other courses I have taken.\r\n\r\nNot sure I can *really* think of weaknesses other than possibly the following: I might've preferred not to have quizzes (but still have the study sessions), because I would've preferred to learn more material during those last minutes. But this is not such a strong opinion.",
                "Strengths: Brinda is great, a really likable professor who tailors to students' needs\r\nWeaknesses: The whole new learning experiment this year with Marknotes failed miserably on my end; technical glitches made it impossible for me to see questions beyond chapter 1 and as a result the class's structure revolving around the system deeply impaired my learning.",
                "Dr. Brinda has a very engaging but also organized way of presenting the material. I learned a lot from the way the course (and his book that accompanies the course) is structured because its almost like building a world from ground up. I appreciated the pace but maybe if youre very familiar with the concepts youll find the course a bit slow.",
                "The strengths were that Prof Brindas lectures were engaging and the structure of the course facilitated a deeper understanding of linear models. \r\nOne weakness was that there werent any assessments for a grade until the end of the course, which made it hard to gauge how familiar you are with the material.",
                "Great course structure to help students learn and retain the material",
                "fast pace learning of material should be changed",
                "The quiz and practice session structure was a really helpful way to stay on top of the content. Dr. Brinda presents the material in multiple ways which is also great for learning. There were some small software glitches in the practice session program at the beginning which discouraged me from using it at times but overall the class was great.",
                "Overall, this course was a joy to take. The buildup of topics was natural and easy to follow. The implementation of spaced repetition (i.e. practicing a topic repeatedly with increasing time intervals) was a great idea and was very effective for the earlier topics. However, the spaced repetition disproportionately emphasized earlier topics; my classmates and I didn't get enough practice with later chapters because of the heavy focus on earlier material. There could have been more practice exercises as a whole (e.g. in the textbook, in the homeworks), particularly in the later chapters.",
                "Strengths: Brinda is a great guy and pretty good at explaining things. Weaknesses: I felt like I wasn't sure exactly where the course was going a lot of the time, like I picked up random understandings but didn't have a great holistic improvement in understanding.",
                "Prof. Brinda really cares about the students learning the material rather than trying to take a class for the grade. As a result, we had daily quizzes and weekly practice. However, it was all very low-stakes and designed for students to master the material because one could make up for lost quiz points just by doing more practice (and learning the concepts that they're struggling with). All of the lectures and homework are beautifully designed to connect together and further one's understanding of the topic. When we tied everything together and summarized the course during our last class, my mind was blown by how beautifully everything fit together and by how much we have learned throughout the semester.",
                "I think the course was very helpful. I appreciated the thorough review of linear algebra concepts. The practice sessions were helpful. The assignments were reasonable. I don't think the quizzes were that helpful, they usually just covered concepts from practice sessions before I'd been able to practice them enough. But I appreciated that we could make up the points from them with practice.",
                "Strength: we can do practice every day on marknotes to consolidate our knowledge. I can't think of any weakness of this course.",
                "This course is perfectly structured and organized.",
                "Brinda is very friendly and a good lecturer, but the structure of the course made it difficult to stay engaged. Much of the content I felt I had to teach myself, but given that the quizzes were easy to make up through getting points from practice questions, I struggled to stay motivated in learning the content. That said, Brinda was generous to give students access to makeup pointsI just wish the practices facilitated learning a bit more.",
                "strength: daily quizzes that reinforce learning of the material from the previous lecture, review of linear algebra and probability which is helpful for students like me who have skipped a prerequisite(s) or took them a while ago. Also, highly organized course. \r\nweakness: I wish we had a midterm so we had a better sense of what's expected on the final. But then again, the professor gave a comprehensive review of high-yield topics.",
                "This course is amazing! Dr. Brinda makes the workload extremely manageable (think 5th or 6th class) but you still get so much out of the material. I've rarely found a course with such low workload where you still learn so much interesting material.",
                "The practice sessions are not particularly helpful. Other than that I think this is a great course",
                "Interesting material, logical and easy-to-follow path through the material, minimal workload (just enough to engage with the material without being bogged down in work)",
                "Strengths: Professor Brinda is a great teacher in person. He explains the concepts in a logical manner. He also wrote a book for this course which helps reinforce the material in the exact same way. He also cares about making sure that we learn in as low of a stress environment as possible. We have quizzes in every class, but if you lose points on the quizzes, you can do extra practice problems in the week to get all points back. This allowed me to actually just enjoy the learning. Also, the exam was before reading period, helping break up the heavy exam days. The PSETs were also relatively shorter, taking about an hour a week, but showing an application of the material in practice. \r\nWeaknesses: The online practice problems are a very good concept forcing me to practice multiple times a week. However, there was a bug in the system that only let students run through Chapter 1 questions, so I didn't have as much reinforcement for later chapters. I had to study a little extra before the final to make sure I knew the material.",
                "Strength: practice session",
                "Strengths: very chill course. homework, quizzes (that you can do test corrections for), and an in class final exam.",
                "Almost no weaknesses, it is very well designed.\r\nVery proper design of assessment",
                "Strengths: Brinda is a generally clear lecturer; the homeworks are are of reasonable length; the daily practice sessions are nice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is not particularly riveting; there isn't a lot of context given at the start of lectures, so I often felt lost about the point of what we were going over; the practice sessions often did not line up with current material; end of semester felt rushed",
                "This course was great! Brinda is one of the best professors I have had at Yale, and I think the rest of the students agree with me. The material was presented in a comprehensible way where we could learn while not being super stressed. I thought the daily quizzes would be annoying, but they were super helpful and kept me on track. I enjoyed the homework: it was very applied and not super difficult. The only weakness would be to get to the modeling earlier and maybe include a project so that we can use the knowledge in an open-ended and applied setting.",
                "The strength was Professor Brinda. All the courses he teaches are the absolute best, and he truly defined my S&DS experience.",
                "Strengths: Brinda lectures slowly and clearly, although I did not understand everything. He puts in a lot of effot to make sure the course is not too stressful -- for example, with the marknotes practice sessions, which I was very grateful for. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was easy to fall behind on material since the psets were relatively easy to finish, and the practice exercises weren't working for a large part of the semester, so I ended up learning most of the course right before the final.",
                "The course was great in encouraging individual learning and practice of mathematical concepts, the professor was engaging, and I thought it was great that we could make up points we lost on quizzes through practice. I generally thought having us do practice sessions was a unique and great idea that should be continued, since it had great potential. The only thing I would say is that quizzes were too easy since they didnt require work and often could be guessed- as a result I often got good grades and didnt have to do as many sessions despite not knowing the material as well. I think I wouldve gotten more out of the sessions if I had a harder time on the quizzes.",
                "very organized course, really enjoy the exercise component of it, very clear lecture notes, very engaging instructor and fair content especially coupled with a textbook written by the instructor himself",
                "The Quiz/Practice Session format was amazing, so I hope he brings it back for future iterations of the course. I definitely feel like I learned so much more and much deeper by doing the practice sessions, and it was so satisfying when I got a quiz right based on having done the related practice exercise.\r\n\r\nPsets were pretty good and reasonable, and I could almost always figure out what do to next on a pset by referring to my notes from the associated lecture. One of the most direct and unconfusing lecture-homework connections I've ever had in a course.",
                "The strengths of the course were with its professor. Brinda is a master of his craft. The weakness is the marknotes, which were not sufficient practice for the course.",
                "Really liked the spaced repetition practice that helped me (someone with a weak lin alg background) understand what was going on\r\nWish there was a bit more math on the weekly assignments so we felt more prepared for the exam",
                "Strengths: very good classes, good teacher, interesting subjects.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the homework was a little bit too easy, I would prefer some more challenging homework as it helps with understanding the material.",
                "Background lectures are extremely useful, as I learned to like linear algebra after hating it! The use of review sessions instead of midterms is interesting and helped my learning. I would encourage homeworks to be more related to class content.",
                "strengths- Prof Brinda is amazing, psets and exams were straightforward, quizzes and practice sessions were helpful, grade breakdown made the class less stressful than other S&DS courses, accessibility of live-streamed lectures\r\nweaknesses- material is difficult unless you do a lot of linear algebra review or took linear algebra the semester before this class",
                "I like the teaching method of Dr. Brinda. He is very fair to students, which I believe increases engagement because students feel comfortable with the professor.",
                "very detailed very organized",
                "Regular daily work made this class well structured, as well as managable weekly assignments rather than large sporadic ones.",
                "The daily exercise and quizzes are really useful to help us consolidate what we've learned.",
                "Its too heavy in theory and not enough application. I would have loved to learn how to apply linear models for real world cases of analyses. It was too heavy on the exercise solving problem which is not helpful at all considering that this is a 300s level class, not a graduate class",
                "The instructor is very familiar with the course",
                "The lectures were really engaging, there was a good mix of practical and theoretical material, the practice sessions were kind of annoying.",
                "Strengths: daily practice sessions made class low-stress and high-retention, final exam was fair, lectures followed textbook closely\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of linear algebra for first few weeks was confusing",
                "I think that there should be mandatory problem sets with explanations that are a bit more well-developed than they are now.",
                "Wonderful lectures and I think the idea of marknotes is great. I just really wish the entire grade for the course wasnt essentially dependent on one exam and that the homeworks were more difficult. The difficulty of the homework questions did not seem proportional to the difficulty of the exam.",
                "very good and interesting course"

                "If you are good at math, yes.",
                "Would recommend! I think this is an important course for S&DS majors to take, and Professor Brinda is a great professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that enjoys linear algebra. It was important to have a strong background in linear algebra in order to succeed. Brinda was a great professor!",
                "Yes if you are interested in a more theoretical approach to linear modeling that will go in depth on a lot of the background surrounding it.",
                "Yes, this is a very informative course and a nice classroom experience.",
                "Yes, certainly. The course provides a much needed background on linear algebra and then gives a really good understanding of how linear regression work.",
                "If you have any mathematical inclination, please take this course. If you don't have a quantitative flair, but it for some reason you want to see pedagogical brilliance, then take this course. But please remember, you still have to work hard.",
                "yes, very good professor and teaching method",
                "Yes! You can happily learn everything without too much pressure.",
                "YES! This was the best S&DS course I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes!! Very solid S&DS elective. Brinda is AMAZING, although the concepts were very difficult through his teaching style and assignments I felt like I was understanding them. This was a very stress-free class which I appreciated.",
                "Yep! Definitely recommend the course with prof Brinda - it was honestly really enjoyable for a math class, and I would definitely take it again if I could!",
                "Of course, this course is useful and interesting",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. There is so much fascinating material covered in this course. The combination of linear algebra and probability theory/statistical theory leads to extraordinary results that are mind-boggling.",
                "Professor Brinda is one of the most empathetic and engaging professors I've had at Yale, especially among STEM departments. He was responsive to student requests and expressed a lot of care to ensure students were learning.",
                "Take it!! Easy class if you're pretty ok with linear algebra, probability, and statistics",
                "Certainly!!!",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE IF IT IS WITH BRINDA. I cannot recommend it enough. It caused concepts from all my previous statistics and math classes to come together in a mind-blowing way.",
                "I would recommend this course if it counts for your major! The psets did not take up too much time and Dr. Brinda is great!! Be sure to stay on top of the practice sessions though, because it's easy to fall behind on the material.",
                "Yes, if Dr. Brinda is teaching it. The class material is pretty hard, and without Dr. Brinda's lecture style and style of grading/teaching, it probably would have been much harder.",
                "YES! this class is fascinating, I think Dr.Brinda is not going to teach at yale next semester which is really sad since he one of the best professors i have ever had. However the material is really cool. If Dr.Brinda is not teaching it I would only recommend this course if you have taken math 230 or 225. You have to have a good theoretical linear algebra understanding to get the most out of the course. Professor Brinda reviewed these concepts and he did a great job at introducing and reviewing important concepts in linear algebra, however I have heard that when other profs teach it they simply assume you already know about the svd and spectral decomp. If you are good at linear algebra and have taken an intro stats class(maybe stat 220 which covers more theory than stat 230) you will love this course. TLDR YES take it!!!",
                "Yes! Again, I gained a pretty comprehensive + theoretical understanding of linear models! I've taken many classes that apply or give more shallow theory related to linear models and really appreciated the opportunity to really build the intuition + motivations for linear models from the ground up. This course has really helped me feel more solid in many of my other math / S&DS / econ classes. Brinda is amazing!",
                "Yes! It's a relatively chill statistics class, and Professor Brinda is fun to learn from. Very kind and understanding professor, and he teaches linear algebra concepts in a more intuitive way.",
                "Yes. Brinda is very deliberate in his teaching and quite witty as well. With another professor, I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or not.",
                "Yes, absolutely take this class w/ Prof Brinda if he is teaching it. I heard from (admittedly unreliable) sources that he is leaving Yale; if someone else is teaching it I would advise to shop, but not necessarily take. The reason for this is that Brinda makes the class really good, rather than the material doing that itself. In terms of how interesting the material is, I think it's not necessarily more so than other S&DS electives. But with Brinda it is great. (If he isn't leaving and is teaching some other class, definitely shop that).",
                "Yeah I'd say go for it. Really important core stuff for the stats major that will come up in many other classes, and a good class for nonmajors to understand how modeling works. (Also the workload is really chill.) The class this year was kinda defined by Prof. Brinda's new learning \"experiment\" of sorts where instead of traditional psets we did very technical homeworks in R and then did problems from the textbook in a flashcard format on an online system called Marknotes. It was unusual to say the least, and I can't say I like it from this one experience, but I think the format does have potential to facilitate learning well if the kinks of the online server are fixed (for me and multiple other classmates, the flashcards only ever showed chapter 1 problems). It doesn't seem fair for me to make a judgement about something when I didn't experience it the way I was supposed to. Nevertheless, the class in this form was horribly designed for learning and without the Marknotes system working the time I spent on the class was wasted on concepts I already knew or figuring stuff out on the fly on an R script. I definitely understand stuff a lot less than I would have in a more \"traditional\" class, and my grade on the final test reflected that. The class is very generously graded overall though and you can make up for any lost quiz points (there are 10 minute open-note quizzes every day at the end of class) with more Marknotes sessions, so I was never stressed about my grade. Brinda's end hope is for us to learn just as much (or more) without the typical academic stress: the latter part was certainly true this year, and with some technical fixes the first part could ultimately be true as well.",
                "Yes!! Can only speak about Dr. Brindas iteration of the course but also given the material is so foundational if youre pursuing statistics you should take it!",
                "I would recommend this course, and reocmmend to be self-engaged with the course, since you can get by in the course without too much work",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, but only with Prof Brinda",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with Dr. Brinda. The content is really useful for anyone interested in statistics and data science. It also reinforced my understanding of some core concepts of linear algebra and statistical theory.",
                "Yes! This is a very useful course particularly for students studying statistics / computer science / any subject that makes use of modeling. It develops an important intuitive perspective that will help make models less of a black box and more of an intuitive process.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course to another student. The teacher is very insightful and the lectures are very informative and useful.",
                "If they were looking for a fairly low-stress course to brush up on their linear algebra and apply it to linear models, sure. If they wanted to significantly change/ improve their understanding of statistical methods, probably not.",
                "Yes Yes Yes! You have to take it with Professor Brinda. He is so good at lecturing and making sure that all of the lectures, readings, and homework work together to further deepen your understanding. Taking the course is like being molded by an expert craftsman. Although you might not understand what is going on in the moment, when you take a step back and review the concepts, everything comes together to form a beautiful masterpiece which is this class.",
                "Yes, it's a reasonable amount of work and you learn a lot that is necessary for more advanced statistics.",
                "Yes! This course explains the linear model from a geometric and linear algebraic point of view. Very easy to understandHighly recommended!",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is both applied and theoretical.",
                "If they are interested in linear models, theoretical statistics, or if (in my case) they are required to take the course!",
                "Absolutely! Brinda is an amazing professor and he makes sure that students understand the material.",
                "100% Take this course if you want to connect your knowledge of linear algebra and probability to learn really useful modeling skills. Brinda makes this course uber accessible and it was a great course this semester.",
                "Yes. Great class for understanding linear models",
                "Absolutely! The course material is really interesting, and Professor Brinda presents everything so clearly. A must-take stats elective.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. Its low stress and very applicable to real world situations. In other classes, you learn what these models are, but don't know how to actually apply real imperfect, data when building them.",
                "Sure! This course is not that hard and its really useful!",
                "I would, but just know that this course requires you to actually study and make sure you understand the material. Brinda sets the course in a way where you can really slack off. It comes to bite you back in the end when you are preparing for the final exam.",
                "Yes\r\nIt is well organized and assignments were well designed",
                "Not really...it's not a bad class to fulfill an S&DS distribution, but I do not feel I gained much from it other than the background of linear modeling.",
                "If Brinda is teaching it and you are interested in Statistics, then definitely. One of the best S&DS courses I have taken.",
                "Only if for some reason Professor Brinda's the one teaching this course sometime in the future.",
                "Yes, with some reservations. Although the workload of the course isn't very high, the material is hard to understand. I think the lectures require reviewing (or previewing) in order to actually understand, but since the homework required coding knowledge and not so much theoretical knowledge, it was easy to get by without understanding. The class was not stressful at all (at least until the final), which I was grateful for, but the material also felt a little unmotivated. I can't say I particularly enjoyed this class, but as far as S&DS electives go it was still pretty good.",
                "Yes! Its a great course to get a stronger background in linear algebra and the statistical methods we use all the time",
                "yes would highly recommend, especially with Professor Brinda",
                "Yes",
                "If you need to complete a requirement for the S&DS major, either as an elective or for the methods requirement, I cannot recommend this course highly enough! One of the best there is if Brinda is teaching!",
                "Yes, Brinda is one of the best professors I have had in my academic career.",
                "Yes absolutely! Dr. Brinda is great and the assignments are fun and low-stress",
                "Yes, very well organized course were math and linear algebra are central.",
                "Yes if it fulfills major requirements.",
                "Definitely- one of the best classes I have taken in the S&DS department, and I found the theory-focused lectures and application-based homework to be very useful. The quizzes at the end of each class and online practice sessions we had to do weekly were also really helpful in reviewing content.",
                "Yes, I would. This course provides an interesting perspective through which to look at statistics.",
                "yes",
                "Yes Brinda is very reasonable, clear professor who really works from fundamentals up",
                "Yes. I really learned a lot in this course.",
                "You probably have to, but if you can avoid it, Id highly recommend so",

                "Yes. Really interesting material",
                "Absolutely. This is a low-stress way to truly learn and understand linear modeling.",
