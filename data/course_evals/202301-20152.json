                "The course is really well taught and Prof. Wittenstein is great at facilitating discussions on relevant topics. The themes of the class were very relevant to what's happening in the world right now, while also providing a good amount of history and context. Taking a class with law school and other grad school students was a unique learning experience! The courseload wasn't too high which helped me devote a lot of time to preparing for the class and participating in it. The guest speakers were super insightful, and Prof. Wittenstein encouraged a critical, impartial analysis of all the topics we covered."

It has a reasonable workload, interesting readings, and is taught by a thoughtful professor who takes the time to engage with his students. If you're a technical person, it will give you a foundation in the policy side of cyber; if you're a policy person, it will brief you on the technical. Further, the mix of undergrads and graduate/professional school students gives the class a depth of perspective. In my view, a must take class.",
                "Yes.",
                "100%. The class content is timely and very interesting and assignments, especially the simulation, was a lot of fun. The course also grants you access to the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum which is an amazing opportunity to meet academics and practitioners in the cyber field. Would highly recommend anyone interested in cyber issues take this course.",
                "Yes! I thought the events were very helpful",
                "Yes I would! It is very well taught and a unique experience in terms of the diversity of backgrounds of the students in the class. Prof. Wittenstein is a great professor and has a lot of experience that one can learn from.",
                "YES! Best class I've taken at Yale. There are so many ways outside of the classroom (talks, visiting professionals, events, office hours) to engage in the material.",
                "Best class Ive taken",
                "I would recommend this course to others. Professor Wittenstein is a fantastic professor that is dedicated to helping his students learn and develop. This course is designed to introduce computer science concepts to law students and law concepts to computer scientists. This course does a fantastic job of performing these tasks."
