However, this course goes so much further than that. You can expect to reflect and meditate on how one can be a better physician, but also how one can lead a more meaningful, satisfying, and generous life. In short, you will come away from the course with a greater understanding of yourself.",

                "Dr. Morrison set this course up with a focus on his students. He arranged numerous field trips, guest speakers, and other experiences that highly enriched the content of the class. His lectures were fascinating.\r\n\r\nIf I were to make recommendations on how the course could be further improved, I would say that a slight tweaking of the syllabus might be necessary. I think instead of a collection of short passages from the authors some weeks, we would have benefited in just reading the works in their entirety. I think much of the secondary source material could also have been cut.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, no major weaknesses to note.",
                "There are so many strengths that cannot all be enumeratedthe quality of the lectures, the enthusiasm of Professor Morrison, all of the captivating class trips, the deep insights that we explore, the readings. This has literally been my favorite class at Yale so far.",
                "Dr. Morrison is stellar.  He is invested deeply in his students' growth, and getting to learn from his reflections on the writers we read as well as on his own experiences in medicine was the absolute highlight of the course.",
                "There are so many strengths to this course (starting with Dr. Morrison first and foremost). The lecture topics, nature of the assignments, field trips, guest speakers, and readings are so well curated and thought out. If I had to give a little bit of criticism it would just be that there was not as much time for class discussion regarding the readings; however, Dr. Morrison gives such amazing insight in his lectures that it would also be remiss to say that I would want them shortened.",
                "I loved all of the readings, lectures, guest lecturers, and field trips, as well as the general course workload. I do kind of wish there was a better way of getting to know the other students and engaging with the reading, so maybe having a discussion forum that we'd have to post on a few times?",

                "Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this course definitely take it. While it may seem like a pre-med course, anyone can benefit from the lessons in the class. The course does focus heavily in philosophy, which can be challenging at times, but the life lessons gained from the readings are profoundly enlightening. Dr. Morrison is also a delight to have as a professor. He is so incredibly passionate about teaching and compassionate to his students. He also continuously finds ways to make the course interesting with amazing guest speakers and field trips.",
                "Yes, absolutely",
                "Yes, I loved this class a lot. Never have I been able to find such a balance of my interests in literature, care, and biology. All the lectures and field trips were so fun and really helped me think about practicing medicine in new light.",
                "Yes!!! If you can get in, do take it, its one of the few classes at Yale that intersects these important fields, and any aspiring physician would do well to learn more about the art of medicine beyond just the science"
