                "Mark making, drawing ellipses to aid with figure drawing, noticing line\/shadow\/highlights in observation, compressing shallow space",
                "My drawing skills, especially drawing with charcoal and graphite, was well-developed after taking this course. The sketchbook practice and drawing from life sessions really helped me to practice my skills and think deeply about how I can convey ideas visually.",
                "I'd developed an understanding for utilizing charcoal and ink in traditional drawing.",
                "I learned how to use different media including graphite, ink, and charcoal. Figure drawings, subtractive techniques, shallow and deep space, and many other types of mainly observational drawing.",
                "I was able to learn a lot from this course with regards to how I observe the world and interact with it, given the often life-inspired compositions that we worked with. I was also able to refine and develop my art skills, which is something I seek to continue doing going forward.",
                "I learnt so many new drawing techniques, even having done drawing classes before. The critiques were one of my favourite parts of the course. It was fascinating to hear what everyones perspective was on each others work and it allowed me to see so much more than if I had just been looking myself. It was enriching to look at other artists work both in class and in lecture.",
                "I learned how to use pencil, ink, and charcoal in additive and subtractive ways to draw still lifes, outdoor scenes, and figures. I learned a lot about process and improvement in general.",
                "Deep space, shallow space, figure drawing, linear perspective, mark making. Got much better at drawing from starting out with an interest in drawing but little to no prior experience.",
                "I really enjoyed my time in this class! I've learned and grown a lot as an artist and drawer by keeping a semi-daily sketchbook, discussing my artistic ideas with others, and sharing feedback with my peers. It's been a great experience exploring drawing in depth with perspective, shallow and deep space, and subject matter.",
                "I have improved my visual thinking and ability to point out and describe what I see and appreciate about a work of art. Hearing Professor Dang and all of my classmates critique each others work, and observing how many ways there is to understand and analyze a single work of art, has been illuminating and informed the way I view art and approach my own artistic practice. More practically, our continuous training in a wide range of drawing techniques has made me much more comfortable with observational drawing using both pencil, charcoal and ink. When I at the end of the semester approach the same motive as before the course started (e.g a figure, a still life) I am able to create a finished drawing faster and I feel much more confident in how to independently structure the drawing-process.",
                "I learned a bunch of drawing techniques and was introduced to several mediums. I think the biggest takeaway I got from the course was redefining what I considered art.",
                "I had never used charcoal before taking this course; however, by the end of the semester, I found myself incorporating various tools for each of my drawings and had grown comfortable and familiarized with each medium. Despite differing drawings backgrounds between students in the class, the environment cultivated by Rachelle and the students was very supportive.",
                "I learned a lot in this class! I learned about drawing techniques like hatching\/cross-hatching and contour\/cross-contour; how to use different drawing materials (graphite, charcoal, and ink); how to approach drawing deep space and shallow space; concepts of one- and two-point perspective drawing; and what to keep in mind for figure drawing. In general, I learned a lot about different techniques and styles and important things to think about when planning\/making a drawing. I definitely gained the vocabulary to talk about drawings and art in general.",

                "I honestly loved this course, though I do think lecture slides could be a tad shorter",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is very organized. All of the aspects of drawing - tones, perspective, and figure drawings - are all taught throughly and practiced completely in this course. Also, the lectures are really helpful. I think it would be great if some assignments have more freedom and exceed merely drawing from observation.",
                "This course allows a student to practice figure drawing and solidify a nice reflection on basic aesthetic concepts such as tone, depth, contrast, light and dark, perspective, etc.",
                "Strengths: The course really allows you to dive in and practice a wide variety of styles of drawing. The assignments are wonderful, and the critiques are very uplifting but also provide a great space to learn more about how to improve your artwork.",
                "Dang is a great teacher, she is so supportive of everyones work and makes you feel like you have an important and values place in the class. The assignments allowed me to progress and explore media and subject matter as I developed my skills. Classes were really fun and engaging. I loved having in-class assignments. No weaknesses!!",
                "Nothin' but strengths. I loved this class. I learned so much from my peers, watching them draw and hearing them explain their process. Rachelle was amazing, so supportive, kind, encouraging, and really drew out the artists we could be. The workload was consistent, never too high, and just enjoyable to do.",
                "Strengths: Rachelle was an amazing teacher. The class itself was a fun atmosphere and it was great how every single person's art had so many positive traits and interesting insights to uncover. I learned a lot and noticed a huge improvement in my drawing capabilities from the beginning of the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing. It is of note that no one ever actually \"critiqued\" in a negative way during the critiques, but rather just made positive comments -- but this seems appropriate and fitting for a Basic Drawing Class.",
                "I sometimes felt that the lectures were a bit too long and a little bit less engaging. I would've liked for there to be a pairing with drawing, while learning from the lectures and being inspired by some of the artists we were exposed to in class.",
                "1) There was a good balance between lecture and drawing-time, with a clear focus on the practical work, informed by what we had observed together during the lectures and our group-critiques. The focus on \"learning by doing\" and prioritizing creation in all its forms rather than abiding by strict analytic methodology was inspiring and really important for an Introductory drawing course. I liked that we had a lot of organized drawing-time in class, when we could receive feedback from our instructor and learn from one another.\r\n\r\n2) To me, the group-critiques where we had prepared work during the week to be critiqued together in class was the best part of the course - not only did the knowledge that everyone was going to observe your work an incentive to focus and produce something good during the week, but seeing how differently my classmates interpreted the same assignment and developed as artists was inspiring, while helping me get closer to understanding the \"essence\" of art as an indubitable form of self-expression. \r\n\r\nThis was a really great course, but if I have to give some feedback it would be a slightly more technical emphasis on how to \"scholarly\"if we would like to do so!go about learning how to draw e.g the figure or motion or light. While no type of art is superior to another, having a good foundation in technical skills from which to build is still really helpful when growing as an artist. We were provided some more technical advice e.g when we learned about how to create an illusion of shadows\/light in forms or that we can simplify the human form into cylinders, but a few more worksheets\/concrete points of more technical guidance would have been lovely.",
                "I enjoyed the practice that we would do in class and the artists that were mentioned in the lectures. However, I feel that lectures usually felt long. I took inspiration from the work shown in class and feel that it would've been a much better use of time to just read or look at the lectures before class or only focus 10 minutes on it. The critiques were really good. Seeing others' work is how I took inspiration for my work most of the time.",
                "Strengths: exploratory approach when learning to use different drawing mediums, supportive environment, freedom to draw according to one's own interests.\r\nWeaknesses: None that come to mind.",
                "Strengths: all of the materials were payed for and provided. The lectures at the beginning of class are helpful to give us ideas of what to pay attention to and how to approach our own drawings. The homework is quite manageable; you can spend as little or as much time on an assignment as you'd like, and the assignments are very open ended (I almost wish the assignments were more defined to challenge\/motivate me). Rachelle is super kind! A bunch of the homework must be done at the YUAG, which is both exciting and logistically sometimes difficult.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we don't always have a lot of time to draw during class, because presentations take up a good chunk of time. The presentations are often helpful but can also put people to sleep. We also don't usually review our homework assignments (which can be good if you don't have time to complete them right away), but it means that you don't get feedback on your progress until the midterm and final reviews.",
                "strengths: you get a lot of practice in to improve your drawing. The professor is also extremely encouraging and I was able to explore different ways to draw (figuratively and physically) which was really eye-opening and fun- the class was also very welcoming to students of any art background",
                "I think going over more fundamentals would have been nice beyond light and shadow values",
                "I think this course was really strong for me in teaching fundamentals, and as I have never taken an art course before this class, I don't think I know how it could be improved"

I think this is a course that fits everyone - including students with experience and without experience in drawing because the teaching was so detailed and the instructions are very clear. I think everyone would have a great experience in taking this course.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anybody, including seasoned artists! Although one might be tempted to take advanced drawing, this course is actually very open-ended with its prompts which allows those more experienced to take a step back and review how far they've come in the creation process. I never tried charcoal in the past, but now that I have I find it influencing my line work and painterly style.",
                "100%, especially with Rachelle. She cares so deeply about her students and is very invested in their personal growth.",
                "Yes absolutely. It makes you look at things differently. The critiques will really open your eyes and you will learn so much about how you view things and how others view things. You can put in as much you want to get out of it. The workload is good and it was a class I was always looking forward to attending because the energy of the class had such a buzz.",
                "Yes! It is incredible as a self-learning experience and as a an experience to improve your drawing. It was so cool to gain some fundamental drawing skills. I loved this course and I'm sure you would, too.",
                "Yes!! Take it with Rachelle if you can. You will improve your drawing tremendously and make pieces you feel proud of. Also, despite the wide range of skill levels, Rachelle takes each person as they come -- and she pays equal attention and respect to everyone's art.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because you learn so much as a drawer and an artist. You start think about the process behind your work and the intentionality of the marks you make. From making inventive marks to exploring different kinds of spaces, there were many ideas that I've learned during my time in Basic Drawing, and I hope other students get to experience the same thing too.",
                "Definitively! This course enabled me to think and work creatively throughout the semester on an almost daily basis, which served a reinvigorating contrast from completing problem sets or writing research papers. It allowed me to use art as a veichle to confront the emotions and thoughts that were already going through my head, provoked by what I was learning in other courses or from things that was happening in other parts of my life. Some of my most peaceful and creative hours of the semester were the ones I spent working on my final project or thinking about composition while drawing sculptures in the Yale Art Gallery. The habit of doing observational drawing on an almost daily basis has made me so much more comfortable with my skills using both graphite and charcoal, so that I am ready to continue to learn independently.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Though it may be intimidating if you give yourself enough time to work on the assignments, the process becomes really enjoyable.",
                "Absolutely! This was such a fun class, I always looked forward to completing the homework assignments, and I felt that I drastically improved my drawing technique over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot in this course. You get out of it what you put into it to a large degree--if you don't try on the homework, you won't learn as much. The flexibility of the class is nice, as you can put in more effort when you have the time and less when you're super busy. Rachelle is very kind and flexible, and the TF, Hunter, was a great person to talk to about drawing as well.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to get into art! The class is facilitated to allow students to explore different ways to draw and experiment while also getting a ton of in-class and outside practice in.",
                "Good way to start with art",
