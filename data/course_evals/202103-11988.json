                "There isn't any progress report or way to measure how the class is going. The first and last grade I will receive in this course will be the final grade. I have no idea how it's going to go. I wish that the midterm paper had more structure and more of a rubric.",
                "Professor is amazing. Weakness was that the class time was long",
                "Everything was pretty good in terms of learning the dance. In terms of improvement, I would give a little more direction with the readings. Some of the readings were very long and we weren't sure what exactly we were supposed to get out of the reading.",
                "Very fun to have a class in which you get to stretch, move your body, and experience a new form of dance. Strong class in that it really prioritizes the dance and choreography and getting comfortable with movement. Weakness may be a lack of clarity about assignments/syllabus, but that didn't really impact the enjoyment of the class.",
                "Only strengths!!! Truly one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Coulibaly created a wonderful and supportive environment.",
                "It was very difficult to hear the professor speaking with his mask on.",
                "Out of all my courses this semester, I got the most feedback from this one because Professor would always provide suggestions and/or comments either during class or on assignments outside of class. I wish we had more class bonding activities because at the end of the semester I still did not know a lot of the other kids, considering there were only about 20 of us altogether. Lastly, I think it would've been nice if we had incorporated more videos (and less readings) into our class curriculum.",
                "The time dancing in class is very instructive and interesting. The discussions were also interesting and I appreciated the flexibility of the written assignements. The academic vs dance breakdown of class time was perfect.",
                "The professor is the course's greatest strength. He was passionate about his work and also very patient with us when we had difficulty learning some of the dances."

What a privilege it is to go to class twice a week and learn from Professor Coulibaly in such an encouraging environment. West African dance is certainly challenging and I feel like I've stretched myself as a dancer and scholar through this class.",

                "Yes! Very fun and enlightening course that is different than anything else you will take at Yale.",
                "Yes yes yes!!! I would recommend this to anyone interested in dance, as well as simply anyone. It was a class like no other, and it energized and brightened my day after each class.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you think you are someone who \"can't dance.\" That was me at the start of the semester, Professor Coulibaly gives very good and personalized feedback, as long as you are willing to learn. Very fun class.",
                "Yes!",
