                "It was incredibly interesting to read some of the earliest conservative and liberal thinkers and learn the values that were typical of classical conservatism and liberalism. As we moved into thinkers of the modern period, it was fascinating to see which conservative and liberal values have endured time and which haven't. By taking this course, you'll get to discuss in-depth some of the most influential conservative and liberal thinkers throughout history, and Prof. Collins does a great job of putting thinkers into conversation with one another. This course also proved to be a helpful introduction to the French Revolution, which I had not yet studied up until this point, and highlighted the key tensions between supporters and detractors of the revolution. By the end of the course, I felt like I could confidently explain to someone what conservatism and liberalism are, how they have changed since their origin, and the merits and demerits of both."
