                "I enjoyed that everyone presented the class readings.",
                "Strengths: I loved the student presentations each week, and the selection of readings. The class felt well paced and the discussions were super engaging. Lots of opportunities for student participation!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: few/none.",
                "This class was uniquely set up to be almost entirely student run. Students presented a summary of the readings for the first half of class and then led discussion for the second half of class based off of the discussion posts students had posted. I think this set up was awesome for student engagement but none of us really knew that much about neuroscience so I think more of an introduction about some of the language used in the papers could have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: really good discussion that we could take in all kind of directions. Interesting papers and you only have to lead one discussion class, so its pretty low pressure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Stephanie is super nice but pretty harsh about deadlines (so be sure to submit everything on time!) Because there is no lecture format to the course (it is really based on discussion), you have to be really prepared for each class to come having read the papers and with your ideas, ready to share. Also, the weekly discussion papers are pretty long (generally around 600 words).",
                "Strength: great science credit for non stem people, fun content, super understanding prof",
                "I thought the course was very engaging, and the professor was attentive and helpful. However, sometimes I wished the professor would be more involved with teaching the material herself. All sessions were student-led, which was a great educational experience; nevertheless, I think all of my knowledge is very shallow and probably not very precise, thanks to this aspect of the course.",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor and structure. I felt like Stephanie was always welcoming and available to answer any of our questions. Additionally, we had a nice spread of papers to discuss and I felt like the response papers and discussion questions were a great way to help us think deeply about the content. One weakness of the course was that the discussions were usually skewed to one certain topic and made it a bit difficult to participate if you did not have much knowledge about that certain question topic. However, since discussions were student-led, this is something difficult to adjust.",
                "Strengths: I loved the discussion format of the class, and how we were engaging with scientific research from a more critical perspective. Rather than treat this as a information-regurgitating memorization course, we instead tackled it like researchers who were criticizing and praising the strengths of weaknesses of the individual studies. I also loved Stephanie as a professor -- she's incredibly down to earth, warm, and great at triggering conversation without dominating it. A natural seminar discussion leader. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the student presentations were rather unengaging and regurgitated content onto the slides with word dumps. There was a noticeable lack of engagement from the student audience when watching their peers. I think providing more pointers on how to present scientific research in an engaging way, I think, would be a helpful skill to practice in this class. Alternatively, splitting up the format of the class to become a short 10 minute presentation, followed by a 15 minute discussion, and then the next part of the presentation, followed by another discussion, could have broke up this monotony."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think the readings were super current and Professor Lazzaro was very knowledgable. The discussions after each student presentation were always fun and interesting. The only downside is that the class was on a Friday but honestly, I looked forward to going most times.",
                "Yes! Professor Lazzaro is the kindest and the class was super interesting. Memory is a topic that everyone should learn about!!!",
                "Yes I would but only if they are committed to doing the readings and participating in class! Stephanie is a great prof and the papers were super interesting. You don't need to be super well-versed in neurobiology to get a lot out of it.",
                "YES!! Take this course with Steph, shes amazing. The content is super doable for non stem majors so if you need a science credit, take this!",
                "I would recommend this course because it gives an excellent overview of human memory and the lessons are entertaining as every week a different group of students present the material.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as the structure is very clear and the professor is very supportive. I enjoyed this course and it has easily become one of my favorites at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! This was the PERFECT final course to wrap up senior year, along with the perfect science credit. While the workload wasn't demanding, there was still a decent amount of critical thinking required to fully engage with the material, but not so much that it was overwhelmed. I enjoyed the freedom to connect the research to more topical things like policy, research proposals, and so forth -- it really made this course more engaging overall. I also felt like we learned just enough scientific background to understand what was going on, without going too much into the details, which I appreciated as a non-sciences major. I think Stephanie picked some great readings that weren't too jargon-filled in scope and were easier to engage with while still being really informative."
