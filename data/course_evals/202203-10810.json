I am also equipped to answer questions that range from sketching graphs with only certain given information, to finding the optimized area, to understanding the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration. I learned many theorems that guide how I will look at math in the future and these theorems are now instituted in my mind.",

                "The practice exams seem to be far off than the actual test but there was sufficient time for exams. The way the material is taught ranges through different professors and I found the different approach very confusing at times. The class is twice a week but the time is longer than other courses, which for me was a distraction and focus issue. But the professors do want you to pass and is there for you during office hours.",
                "Strengths: you very thoroughly cover rate of change and similar applications\r\nWeaknesses: the class is not very engaging. There could be better activities in class that engage their students. Activities for Think-Pair-Share could be improved.",
                "Taught well. Nice teacher.",
                "It was structured",
                "Tough course due to curriculum, tests seemed a bit tougher than psets and in class examples.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it definitely prepared the student for the upcoming challenges they may face as a STEM major in terms of truly understanding the basis of calculus. In addition, the strengths this class presented was that it went over a lot of material within a short time, but this material was supplemented with good practice. The weakness of this course was that review session could have been a bit more informative in terms of what was gone over as usually the review sessions were just going over textbook questions.",
                "I feel that this course was taught well and that there wasn't much else to do to improve it.",
                "Lectures strictly in an a powerpoint format made it difficult to learn effectively. Peer tutoring system was very helpful.",
                "I enjoyed the level of participation required in class.",
                "Continuing to work on my studying techniques",
                "weaknesses: word problems",
                "My strengths of this course having some background information in Calc as well as my work ethic. However, being my first semester at Yale, I found it difficult to translate my knowledge on exams and felt like I was not performing my best on exam day.",
                "Teaching in class wasnt very applicable to problem sets however it helped me learn the basics",
                "The strengths were the high amount of review sessions and fairness of exams. Weaknesses were the lack of clarity in some instructors teaching and unclear feedback on problem sets.",
                "The strengths of the course are the manageability of  the workload and exams. The weakness is the weight that exams have compared to the weekly problem sets. The course can fix it by making the problem sets and the exams weigh a more equal amount."

Take this course only if necessary, but if not, I would actually try on the placement exams and place out to Math 115 or above where it is just concept focused without much theorems and proofs.",
                "Yes. It provides a good foundation for math derivative skills. It also does a good job leading you into Math 115 at the end of the course. It is definitely NOT a gut class and takes some work understanding the material.",

This is a good class to go over the foundations of understanding and becoming better equipped for harder math classes to come. This course is also facilitated by peer tutors and TAs that make the process of learning much easier.",
