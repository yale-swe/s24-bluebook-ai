I am also equipped to answer questions that range from sketching graphs with only certain given information, to finding the optimized area, to understanding the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration. I learned many theorems that guide how I will look at math in the future and these theorems are now instituted in my mind.",

The way the material is taught ranges through different professors and I found the different approach very confusing at times. The class is twice a week but the time is longer than other courses, which for me was a distraction and focus issue. But the professors do want you to pass and is there for you during office hours.",

                "Tough course due to curriculum, tests seemed a bit tougher than psets and in class examples.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it definitely prepared the student for the upcoming challenges they may face as a STEM major in terms of truly understanding the basis of calculus. In addition, the strengths this class presented was that it went over a lot of material within a short time, but this material was supplemented with good practice. The weakness of this course was that review session could have been a bit more informative in terms of what was gone over as usually the review sessions were just going over textbook questions.",

Take this course only if necessary, but if not, I would actually try on the placement exams and place out to Math 115 or above where it is just concept focused without much theorems and proofs.",
