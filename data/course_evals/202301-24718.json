Professor leaves detailed comments on all of you papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because you're not held responsible for memorizing any of the content, so it's very easy to disengage",

It's very easy to just never go to the lectures (or even watch them) and do well in this class, since all the assignments are take-home. If you know that you're the kind of person who would do this, you might want to look for a class that would hold you more accountable.",

                "I personally would not recommend this course. The professor grades way too harshly and it's hard to do well in the course without prior knowledge of primates. A few slip-ups with terminology here and there in your essays will cost you dearly, and he's generally not forgiving of these mistakes."
