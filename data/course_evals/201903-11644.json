    "Strengths - Interesting activities in class, interesting readings and homework assignments, and great opportunity to practice and improve the language\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Very few that i can even think of! It was a great class and Igor was great",
    "The course was great. I really enjoyed. I just wish it had more music.",
    "Maybe more grammar review, or more worksheets",
    "Very easy environment to communicate.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot. I think it was a nice balance, because while the workload was never  too large, it was consistent, and being forced to sit every day and do a little bit of writing, reading, and thinking in Portuguese was really wonderful for my language skills.\r\n\r\nI think the course could benefit from a little bit more of a focus on the culture of Brazil. The textbook we used was one that I enjoyed, but it focused on Brazil from a travel\/tourist perspective rather than as a local perspective."

    "Yes! Great class, not too much work, but definitely felt like I learned a ton. Take this if you want to keep practicing your Portuguese!",
    "Yea obviously its portuguese",
    "Yes! If you want to improve your portuguese, especially your written portuguese, this is the correct course to take.",
    "Yes, its a fun way to learn a new language",
    "If this class works for your learning style, it's amazing.",
    "I would. I think the class is really helpful, and I learned a lot of Portuguese from it. Particularly helpful if you are interested in spoken communication rather than grammar. The daily structure makes up for the relatively low nightly homework levels. It is easy to underestimate how much time is taken up when you have something to do every night."
