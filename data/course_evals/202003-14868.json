                "This course was very strong overall--we read trxts that kept us informed and offered interesting and new perspectives. The only critique I could add were that there were very minimal non-white\/non-male authors in what we read, and those we BIPOC and\/or non-male authors we did read often felt glanced over or barely discussed in class.",
                "Can't really identify any weaknesses -- this was a great course. My personal preference would be more class time devoted to the 21st century, but again thats just a personal preference. The strength of the course is definitely Professor Stout, even via zoom he made the seminar very engaging and not nearly as painful as some of my other remote classes.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and unique course topic, great professor that was intimately familiar with the material, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am surprised that this class did not grant a writing credit considering there were 30 pages of graded writing. I have no real complaints with this class, though.",
                "The syllabus and reading assignments were well planned and thought out. We covered so much material while still being able to go to great depths. I wish we had been able to spend less time talking about the general history of each American war studied during seminar and more time on primary source documents or looking at certain case studies. I think this could be achieved through assigning a general YouTube video on the history of a given war each week so as to also avoid not assigning more reading.",

I especially would recommend this course to students with little or no background in American military or Christian history. One of the most engaging seminars I have taken at Yale (even via zoom). Very reasonable workload.",

                "Yes! Prof. Stout is incredibly knowledgeable on this topic and obviously loves discussing it with students. It was truly an honor to go to seminar even over Zoom and both learn from and try out new ideas and arguments with him and my peers.",
                "yes, but mostly because the content was niche, and my niche, so I'd recommend it to people who want to learn a lot about this topic"
