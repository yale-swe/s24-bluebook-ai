    "I gained a better understanding of how classical composers worked, and what sort of patterns and guidelines they employed in writing new music.",
    "I learned how to approach composing larger pieces such as a minuet and trio. I also learned how to better analyze music. I also learned a lot about the classical style and how to identify characteristics of it.",
    "I learned about counterpoint and how independent voices can interact. I learned about phrase models and the harmonies that tend to be in each part of a musical phrase. I learned compositional techniques for keyboard writing based on sets of variations that we analyzed in class. I learned about the structure of various musical phrases, including sentences, periods, sequences, etc., and how to apply those in my own compositions. I learned about binary form and composing for a string quartet. I learned functional bass notation and some form-functional theory."

   "comments": [
    "More feedback in terms of grades would be nice, we were only given 1 grad throughout the semester. I have no idea what my grade will be because of this, making it difficult to navigate the decisions associated with the (atrocious) CR\/D\/F system at Yale.",
    "The class size was really great because we got a lot of personalized feedback. However the material was not always presented in a clear manner and it was sometimes hard to visual what Aaron was talking about because he was very abstract. Also he would lecture without visual aids which was really difficult for people like me who cannot hear music by just looking at it.",
    "A strength of this course is that it is focused on student composition, giving students opportunities to apply harmonic progressions and other theoretical elements from class. I learned the most from feedback from my peers and the instructor on my compositions. The small class size gave us a chance to work closely with each other and analyze the merits and flaws of our own compositions and those in the textbook.  A weakness is that class time was sometimes too lecture-focused, making it ineffective and not very engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this with the understanding that you will be mostly expected to know a lot of music theory, and you will not learn many new concepts. Instead, you will dive into model composition. It is enjoyable, and fairly straightforward. Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend it with a different teacher. Aaron was really sweet and well meaning but he was not the best teacher. The information and the skills I learned will be really useful so I am glad that I took this class despite the negatives.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to students who have an interest in theory and especially composing. The workload is very reasonable and the content is quite interesting."
