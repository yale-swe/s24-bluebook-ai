            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the lectures and design prompts were fascinating and incorporate Black and Indigenous architects, design practices, and histories that are rarely talked about in core/western canon-centric architecture and urbanism classes. Some amazing guests came to talk about their own practices in architecture, graffiti etc. and it was awesome to be in a cross-institutional space with both undergrad and grad students in a range of design majors from two schools. \r\nWeaknesses: This is partly tied to this being the first time the course was taught and having to navigate a cross-institutional and virtual setting, but the reading assignments and logistics sometimes felt disorganized and confusing. Changing groups for projects every 2 weeks was an adjustment, and I appreciated that later the course moved towards keeping the same groups together longer for multiple projects.",
                "1. I think an established folder on Google drive from the beginning would have helped make the course run a lot smoother. It could be pre-populated with readings for the week and folders to turn in student work. That way we could bypass the tedious uploading to two different blackboards and Canvas, and just keep everything in a central location. This would help reduce the amount of emails that went out last minute and the confusion between students and faculty. \r\n\r\n2. if the folder system was created above, the students could easily do the readings before class, and during class we could break into breakout rooms to discuss among ourselves. This would save time for not having to do readings together in class, and allow us to hear more from other students in class who have really insightful perspectives.",
                "This is a course that was severely disorganized and punished students for its own disorganization. The every other week project structure made it hard to generate a worthwhile thesis on anything, and the professor was quite curt and frankly rude during crits, attacking students for not creating projects that fit into their understandings, despite the vague prompts we received week to week. I feel like the TA put in more work.",
                "The discussions were great, and I liked how the flexibility of the syllabus allowed for an iterative/responsive learning within the context of the studio itself (new projects building out of/making reference to earlier projects). The groupwork model meant that discussion was ongoing throughout the design and reflective process, and also helped us form a community within the class."

                "The fact that this course was taught between two universities during a pandemic in incredible. I think this model, and cross communication can continue into next year, and I think it's an example of how Zoom can be used as a really powerful tool.",
                "The group exercise every other week was very draining. Meeting new people over Zoom takes more time than I think the professors accounted for, which between 3 other students in the group didn't leave much time for actually creating a meaningful project. I would have preferred maybe 3 or 4 larger projects over the course of the semester that we got to develop more. Spending more time with each project would also give us familiarity with our group mates. In addition, the exercises were often critiqued as if we had weeks to work on them...it was often difficult enough just to find two times a week to meet. \r\n\r\nI think the guest speakers were the most interesting part of the course, but it often seemed like either they or the professors weren't really prepared for them...? \r\n\r\nFinally, the usage of Figma instead of Miro at the end was kind of bizarre. It didn't seem like the professors were even that familiar with the platform and yet they were trying to teach us how to use it."

                "Yes, although I think it depends on the student. I would definitely recommend taking this for the content and the design questions - I learned about so many different artists and histories that never appear in other architecture courses. However, it took some getting used to the structure of changing groups bi-weekly and preparing the projects on a short timeline. In total, the workload is not too much and because of the frequent projects, there is no larger final at the end. However, the work is asymmetrically distributed in that lecture weeks have almost no outside prep and pin-up weeks require outside meetings with a completely new group and the development of a project in a couple of days.",
                "yes, I would recommend to other students, and I think that Dark Matter University should continue to have a big presence across Yale.",
                "No, not in its current form. As a new class with visiting professors, I was really excited, especially because it was taught with Howard students as well. All the Howard classmates were lovely, as were the Yale students as well. I feel like we bonded through the struggle that was this class. Vague prompts with harsh criticism, no consistent weekly readings or organized syllabus, and professors that were disorganized and made students pay the price for that disorganization (multiple times throughout the semester, we received angry and passive-aggressive emails from the professor about missing assignments, only to receive a follow-up email that he wasn't looking in the correct submission folder). Also asked rather personal questions about a Black women student's hair in front of the class. The professors also seemed specifically critical of women of color, and Black women in particular. I really wanted to like this class, because there is a wealth of Black and Indigenous history and design methodologies that I'd love to know more about, and I'm sad that my experience of learning was tainted by the mess that was this class. I would have liked to see more intention and grace and compassion for students, especially during a pandemic.",
                "Only if it becomes more organized. It was not only clear that this was the first time this course was being taught, but the first time that either professor had led a seminar (or at least it seemed that way.) Prior to this course Yale devoted I think 0 of its courses to Black and/or Indigenous architecture, so this course sounded so cool from the get-go, but I think between the disorganized nature of it and Jerome's harshness and unreasonable expectations (especially for students in a pandemic!!!) I was disappointed. I did leave with a lot of references, articles, and book titles I definitely want to look more into, but oddly the structure and nature of teaching for this course was not inclusive. For example, calling students out for not having their cameras on or being late or needing extensions...this is an elective course where most of its students are already spending a lot of time on their architecture projects. The last thing we want is to be berated in a class where we're hoping to feel seen.",
