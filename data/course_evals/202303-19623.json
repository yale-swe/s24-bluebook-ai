                "strengths: Professor Back is such a kind and approachable teacher who creates a relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. Professor Back also gives out a lot of dictation quizzes, which I heard other teachers don't do. At first, they may feel tedious, but they proved to be extremely helpful for someone like me who was starting out in Korean. By taking these quizzes, I was forced to memorize how to spell and write out words in hangul accurately.\r\nweaknesses: the quality of the textbook materials and curriculum is not that high, and features outdated character personalities such as Andy, who is this annoying and creepy guy. Additionally, it's not a weakness per se but Professor Back always ends class 3-5 minutes after the scheduled end time, which made it stressful for me to get to my next class that starts right after Korean class.",
                "Strengths: This class was really well organized and very fun. I truly looked forward to coming to this class every morning despite it being on the other end of campus. I also felt like I was learning a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is quite minor but the daily nearly dictation quizzes got a bit cumbersome at times."
