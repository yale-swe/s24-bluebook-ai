    "The American comedy history and race culture is presented by videos, presentations and discussions.",
    "I gained a cohesive and enlightening understanding of the different forms of stand-up comedy in America, their intersections with race, and how different mediums such as the stand-up comedy and the situational comedy have had differing reactions and differing tools to get their messages across. In particular, I learned a lot about racial discourse in the U.S. and how these have manifested in popular culture, through caricatures, celebrated comics, scenarios and controversies. What I found most beneficial about this course was its unpacking of the theory of comedy, such as superiority theory and incongruity theory, which helped me gain a better understanding of why the things we find funny are funny, and how comedy has deep-seated roots in history.",
    "I gained great skills in discussing and understand how race interacts with many comedic platforms in America. Through the professor and discussions in class I began to gain insight on the different ways race and comedy clash.",
    "Through this course I was able to critically examine the continuation of blackface and minstrelsy as predominant features of American media. I feel that I came away from this class with not only a throrough grasp of various social issues, but the ability to apply them lucidly.",
    "I learned so much about the role humor played in generating and perpetuating racial dynamics throughout US history."

    "The workload and content is just fine for a 1-month summer course. The instructor is very kind and easy-going. It is a proper course for international student to know about how US culture is like and help with our understanding for this country.",
    "Race and Comedy in the U.S. benefits greatly from a tight curriculum and a relevant set of readings. By watching a comedy special each class, we are able to make our own observations on the spot regarding the intersections of the readings and how they are applicable to what we are consuming. I think the assignments are well spread-out over the 5 weeks.\r\n\r\nAt times, we were unable to fully unpack some of the films and segments we watched in class. A possible way around this is to get the students to watch the films\/tv specials outside of class, so we are able to work around certain time constraints pertaining to especially long films.",
    "Strenghts: AWESOME Professor! He made coming to class so entertaining and enjoyable. The class discussions were very engaging and lively, especially for a morning class. The material we watched and used in class was very interesting as well. Course was really well planned and thought out.",
    "Professor Laguna selected a wonderful syllabus that dealt heavily with both academic texts and contemporary film and comedy. The relationship between these two bodies of source material was seamlessly executed.",
    "Discussion questions posted in canvas were a great strength, lots of different perspectives highlighted in the syllabus, and just generally fun material"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I would recommend it to international students.",
    "Yes. The course provides a relevant look into a form that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's society. The sitcom and the stand-up comedy are making comebacks in various forms and this course provides us with the tools to better understand how race and comedy intersect, as well as how one might interpret unsavoury ways of presenting or discussing ways. To take this course is to gain a greater understanding of ludic theories, of comedy, of humour and of culture.",
    "Yes in a heartbeat! It was easily the best class that I have taken during my time at Yale. Professor Laguna was incredible and the curriculum he designed for the class was super interesting and engaging. It was a really fun class that I looked forward to attending.",
    "Yes! Hilarious and informative",
    "Absolutely. Living in the United States and, more specifically, New Haven, everyone needs to be cognizant about the characteristics of the racial dichotomies we discussed in this course.",
    "1000%! Very fun and interesting ER&M course, I'd especially recommend for people interested in\/majoring in Theater Studies"
