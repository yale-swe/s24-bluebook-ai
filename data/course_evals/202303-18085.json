Weakness is confusion about seminar vs lecture. KDJ gives a lecture in this class, and while these are very freeform, the students don't talk.",
                "The material is amazing  these are some of the most fascinating, thorny, beautiful books I've read in a long time. And Professor Jackson, aside from his obvious (and remarkable) expertise in all things Machado, clearly cares deeply about the novels.\r\n\r\nThe course often took the form of a seminar-sized lecture, so I did wonder about the need for the optional section held on Wednesday mornings. I felt that there could have been more explicit opportunities for participation/exchange in the classroom itself. Mostly, though, I feel lucky to have been in this course, and to have gotten the chance to engage with these texts  and with Professor Jackson's knowledge of them."

It pretty much starts and doesn't stop, and you're reading at least 100/200 pages per week (which is a lot, especially if you're trying to work with the original texts in Portuguese). But, at least in my mind, it's very much worth it."
