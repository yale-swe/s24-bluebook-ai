                "Strength was that everything was well structured and clear with a nice format of prerecorded videos, live lectures, quizzes, and homework.",
                "Having the pre-class videos was really helpful since sometimes it can be hard to fully comprehend concepts that just get brushed over in lecture. Having the coaching sessions also helped when I was not doing well.",
                "The focus of the course is interesting for anyone who has some affinity for mathematics. However, for someone who has never taken multivariable calculus it can be overwhelming at times, especially if your other courses do not allow you the time to visit office hours or peer tutoring sessions.",
                "Strengths: the pre-recorded videos were really helpful; the content is arranged in a very well-organized manner; the problem sets help to reinforce concepts and practice them.\r\nWeaknesses: with textbook readings, recorded lectures, and live virtual class, it sometimes might feel a bit redundant.",
                "The psets were very useful for understanding the material.",
                "I feel like this course is too difficult. Most people who take this course are freshmen, and this really isn't the course to take if you want to transition to the college lifestyle with ease. It was just simply too difficult. The content in class was super fast paced, and while I understood it most of the time, sometimes it's just so hard because the teacher just has to move on. It's too fast, and too difficult.",
                "A lot of this class involves self learning through watching external videos and reading. This could either be a disadvantage or boon depending on one's perspective. I was grateful to be able to work with other students and collaborate with each other, something my other classes sometimes prohibit.",
                "The recorded lectures were wonderful. There were no problems that I had with the course.",
                "The ability to learn was greatly hindered by the virtual mode of learning. It's hard to think of a means to improve this, but it would help if the lectures were more steered towards elaborating on the videos rather them repeating them. It is good that there were a lot of office hours.",
                "I thought the order of exposure to topics was very logical. The only weakness I believe was connecting the mathematical ideas more to real-world phenomena to improve understanding."

I feel like this is wrong - we are living in a tough time and I already heard this course was super difficult, and it really did not show any leniency. Professors did not really advertise office hours and I feel like they have to understand how difficult it is to learn this course online.",

Concepts were generally very easy to follow but in some places lacking rigor (We never covered higher dimensional definitions of limits). The weekly psets weren't too bad, and it was fun to have a lot of friends taking the class. Your experience (and enjoyment of) this class will depend a lot on your instructor.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially as a freshman unless you are fine with spending hours upon hours on Math 120. I spent many days just doing math all day, and I felt like it was hard to focus on any other classes. I truly loved math in the past, but this course was just too difficult and too fast. The exams were nothing like the problem sets - especially the second one. It was the first time I severely failed a midterm, and it basically ruined my grade. We are not exposed to enough practice. Honestly, I feel like the course should be easier and there should be two problem sets a week. Even after completing the problem sets, I still feel I don't fully grasp the concepts.",
                "I am neutral on recommending this course because it is truly dependent on how the student is like. Personally, I would have preferred a more involved approach to learning but someone else who thrives in a self-studying environment could enjoy this class.",
