                "I learned a lot more about oil. How it's produced, but especially its role in society, politics, and culture. We spent a lot of time critically thinking about different narratives people associate with oil like the resource curse, oil as money, blood for oil, and peak oil. Not to determine whether they're right or wrong, but how they are used and by whom. I left this class with a much more nuanced understanding of oil, the different ways people conceptualize it, and what effects that might have in the world.",
                "A widespread set of theories and approaches to oil and capitalism.",
                "In many ways, this class is aptly described by the title: culture, power, oil. Throughout the semester, reading ethnographies, articles, stories, and so on built a foundation upon which we as a class could analyze the intersection of culture, power, and oil in modern society. I decided to shop this class as I was intrigued by the title, even though the workload looked high. Fantastic decision. The class brought together a group of people with diverse interests, which made for great discussion and in depth comments. I learned a ton in this class, and it piqued my interest in environmental issues today. If you are interested in the environment, politics, economics, or anthropology, I highly recommend this class.",

                "I think the course was really effective in the points it tried to get across, and by the end what Rogers said was true: we learned a bunch of different ways to think about oil and not necessarily one large \"oil is great\" or \"oil is the enemy\" narrative. I really appreciated the complexities of the material. And I really appreciated how it wasn't just the professor constantly talking, but that everyone felt they could contribute and said really really interesting things--I feel like I learned from my classmates as much as I did from Rogers.\r\n\r\nI'd say that it'd be ideal if the midterm wasn't a separate bundle of readings, though. It was assigned ahead of time, but I spent so long going through the readings that when it came down to it I had significantly less time to conceive of and write my midterm paper.",
                "I really enjoyed the diverse selection of texts for each week's topic that allowed us to have multiple perspectives and ultimately nuanced discussions on the subject.",
                "A major strength is the reading list. Although there is a lot of reading, you don't have to read all of it cover-to-cover because you aren't assessed on how well you know all the material. Instead, I think it is meant to give you a toolbox of different ways to think about oil to apply to new situations in the midterm and final essays. However, this contributes to a drawback of the class which is that the reading list might be too much. It's tough to know which parts of the readings are important, and I feel like I wasted some time trying to unpack peripheral stuff before realizing that wasn't the point of the piece. I really appreciated Prof. Roger's reading guides for certain readings to help me focus my time and I hope he can do that for more of the readings the next time around. I know that several classmates and I showed up to class sleep-deprived because there was just so much reading to do for class. Also, I can't believe we didn't cover oil and climate change! Another strength is the class is a true seminar. Every class, we just get together, talk about the readings, and develop our understanding of them together under Prof. Roger's guidance. Prof. Rogers gives students the space to talk for the most of the class, but he was certainly present to provide insight. He was a great seminar leader.",
                "Strengths are definitely the readings that are well crafted for discussing oil/capitalism. Some of those books were really really interesting, and getting to take another class with Prof Rogers is always a plus.\r\n\r\nA weakness was that at times, the direction of conversations or the overall goals from each class felt unclear. There was so much reading to get through, that a lot of it went un(der)discussed and what we did discuss sometimes felt incomplete. I'd say if we could have more clear \"packaging\" of the topics discussed it might lend itself to better conversations down the line. At the end of the class it felt like people were drawing from their own background knowledge or jargon to fill discussion time.",
                "One of the things I noticed throughout the semester is that Professor Rogers wants the students to drive the discussion. Often in class, he will allow a moment or two of silence to pass, waiting for someone to make a comment, rather than switching the conversation himself. I really enjoyed this, as it pushed us to think that little bit harder about the issue at hand. I enjoyed how much time we spent discussing the readings, and I loved the books that were assigned. As someone who sometimes struggles to get into books, it was refreshing to dive into these ethnographies. One weakness I observed came at the start of the semester. When we split into groups of two to analyze readings and summarize them to the class, the discussion was a bit dry. Making sure that the class isn't spent going in a circle and redoing the readings essentially may buy some more time to open new discussions.",
                "Strengths: very interesting course topic w/ experienced professor in the field, awesome selection of readings, great class discussion every week facilitated by Doug.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Only meets once a week so its a lot of reading. Also might have been more helpful to have more feedback on assignments."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Anthropology changes the way you view the world and your own social identity as a human and doing so through the lens of oil is a very interesting and engaging topic that surprises you at each turn.",
                "I would recommend it if you are passionate about anthropology, economics, politics, and/or oil/energy. I feel like this class presents oil in a unique way compared to environmental science or political science classes. This class is all about the role of oil in society, politics, and culture, the different stories that people tell about oil, and what effects those stories might have in the world. It will help you critically think about these stories when they inevitably appear in your everyday life. We also learned about how oil's social, cultural, and political connections to concepts like freedom and the American way of life make it that much harder to eliminate from our energy mix. There are only two assignments, the midterm and final essays, and there is no homework besides doing the readings for class. However, the midterm and final essays are substantial and the readings are long, so I would just be mindful of that.",
                "It's a great course if you're into the topics and appreciate a class that really pushes you work wise and \"thinking wise\". I definitely feel that I learned a lot and grew in just the semester (as Prof. Rogers always is able to do). Expect a lot of hands off discussion and for you to feel just as confused as you might have begun the class feeling, but if you take away a fraction of what is discussed you'll be much better off. The final paper is an independent research opportunity, and it's very much self-guided, picking an appropriate topic is super important for you not to drown in the paper lol. Prof Rogers is definitely not big on making the conversation have some overall goal, and instead prioritizes student led discussion/\"conclusions\", take that as you will, for some people that's awesome and thanks to a solid makeup of undergrad/grad the discussion flows.",
                "Yes. While I understand that the midterm and 16-18 page paper may look daunting on the syllabus, ignore your fears. The material is stimulating, the discussion is great, and getting out of your comfort zone is the best way to learn at Yale. If the name of the class intrigues you, take it. But be prepared to read, as you have to show up prepared for class.",
                "Yes, 100%. I'm not an anthropology major but consider myself very lucky to have taken this course in my senior year. Do yourself a favor and try to get into the seminar. If you're even remotely interested in the social, political, and anthropological effects of oil, take this course.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in oil or anthropology it is a very interesting take on both of these. Would highly recommend to students who have not previously taken anthropology clases, as the professor and materials lend themselves to helping students learn."
