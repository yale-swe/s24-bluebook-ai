    "Tarek is a beast. First he teaches you how the immune system works. Then how to harness that to help people. Really interesting subject, and taught by a guy who really loves teaching and loves his students. Do yourself a favor and take this course if you are a biologist, BME, ChemE or anything remotely related to biological or chemical science. Oh and by the way, you're learning from a guy with like 12 nature papers on this topic.",

    "Absolutely. Tarek doesn't overload you with written work, which is so nice. If you want to learn, you learn. And frankly, you learn a ton. There were some weeks where I was snowed in with other work...not a problem! I just caught up with Immuno readings the next week. The final project is also pretty awesome. He encourages everyone to take it to lab. Huh, novel idea. Let's actually apply our ideas! Makes this course great."
