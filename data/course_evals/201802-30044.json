    "Just the sheer rush of being condensed into a 5 week course seemed very limiting in what we were able to cover reading material wise and things were often adjusted on the fly depending on the workload of the week and how many people were able to completely finish the reading.\r\n\r\nOverall the material itself was compelling but the discussions tended to be less so because people weren't preparing.",
    "Strenghts: Understanding tasks and my passin.\r\nWeakness: Understanding sophisticated readings."

    "I would highly recommend this course, it taught me how to think analytically and I definitely improved my speaking and writing skills.",
    "Yes. This course is really helpful for especially for the freshman studenst who are not experienced paper-writer. This course teaches students very detailedly about the how to wirte different papers and the citation issue, which is really useful for all the subjects. Also, this course is more interesting than pure writing class because it involves topics in photography and art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this topic with this professor as there was a clear passion reflected in the discussion\/lecture. It helped me to more critically appraise photographs and the subjective lens through which I view them."
