                "This class teaches you the vocabulary and gives you the skills to write and discuss film in an academic setting. You also watch many of the movies which are essential to the basis of film studies, and you read much of the film theory which is really important to the field,",
                "This course was a great introduction to film analysis. Through this course we learned about necessary vocabulary to discuss films as well as were introduced to various directors and film concepts ranging from editing to genre and saw an average of 2 films a week as case studies of that weeks subject matter.  After taking this course I feel more adept at using film language in describing content and techniques of films.",

More importantly, I gained an understanding of how to watch and analyze films, both through the lens of the thinkers and essayists we read in/for class and through the lectures and section discussions. I had seen some of the films we watched for class, but watching them in class was an entirely different viewing experience because fo the insights and novel modes of viewing we picked up in class.",

Film academics have just decided to use complicated French and Latin words to describe all of those parts.",

            "comments": [
                "Lectures were bad. Very hard to take notes/focus. Most of the slides were just clips or pictures with no context aside from the lecturer speaking very quickly about them. Not many had to do with what he was talking about specifically. His explanation of core film techniques was bad and not helpful. Made the class needlessly difficult to study for. Having both a final exam and a final paper was really stupid, especially since each was 35% of the grade (70% total), so basically the whole class was riding on two assignments, which was unfair and disorganized.",
                "Strengths: Professor McKay was very dedicated to the material. The subject matter is interesting and also clear to understand. At time it was not very engaging though. The course is also a lot of work which was not very clear to me once I enrolled. Lecture, discussion section, and the screenings all amount to upwards of 6 hours a week for this class.",
                "This is a wonderful class! The lectures are very inspiring and insightful, and my section was interesting too.",
                "Professor Mackay is very passionate about the course's content, and it shows in his lectures. The class meets twice a week, plus a required 3 hour (sometimes more) Tuesday night screening, and a discussion section, so it's an unexpectedly high time commitment. 70% of the final grade depends on a 50 minute final exam and essay/project, despite students putting so much more time and work into discussion sections and papers.",
                "Sometimes the lectures were repetitive. The readings in this class are extremely dense and complicated, so further explanation of key points would be helpful. I think the screening were definitely a highlight - I loved watching the films. Its a really unique experience to get to see these films in a theatre each week.",
                "There was a lot of interesting material, but I felt as if it could be presented in a more engaging way. I also thought the powerpoints were not as helpful and the analytical skills to be learned could have been explored more deeply in class.",
                "The format of the course was excellent and conducive to my understanding; I love the way a foundation in what a film is is placed before the more theoretical discussions. The film screenings are also very engaging.\r\n\r\nSometimes it felt as though the readings could use a little more explanation and contextualization.",
                "The screenings are amazing, lectures are very interesting. Some readings were confusing and not explained well during lessons.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor and course was extremely organized. Lectures are super interesting and insightful, so it's a pleasure to go each time. Weaknesses: Lectures, screening, and discussion section makes this course a relatively big time commitment.",
                "The films screened weighed heavily on homogenous narratives centering white cis-gendered men. I was under the impression that given this was an introduction course the films screened and used as case studies would convey a holistic representation of not only the western canon but other diverse people's cultures and experiences. Although there were some films that were representative of affinities and cultures outside the western canon, the disparity was overwhelming and under discussed in section and lecture.",
                "This course is, while admittedly kind of boring, very insightful about the history, making, and impact of film. A massive way it could improve is to not have the final paper and exam add up to 70% of the final grade. Or to not have both a final exam and paper in the first place.",
                "Good course. I would have changed some of the films, namely Star Trek and Far From Heaven, but I guess I understand the choices. Really liked the many interesting film facts scattered throughout the course such as the foreign movie posters and the story of the production of Citizen Kane. Hard to fit everything into one course, but prof did a good job of adding a little of everything. No one did the readings lmao, and a lot of the important readings were assigned for the same week, which wasnt great. Better to do fewer readings so students actually read them (sorry were illiterate).",
                "I think the strength of this class was the depth that the professor went into in the lectures. At the same time, the lectures were sometimes very abstract and didn't follow a super clear narrative, so it was difficult to follow along and take notes.\r\n\r\nI suppose a weakness of the class is that the films and readings chosen sometimes felt somewhat pigeon-holed by the professor's interest and weren't exactly what I expected to watch given the description of the class.\r\n\r\nThis class was very time-consuming due to the required screenings which often exceeded their allotted time. The professor was also somewhat unclear with the expectations of assignments.",
                "The weakness of this course is how much material it has to tackleno matter what its impossible to encompass all film in one introductory course. There is not really any way to accommodate that and it's a challenge that many introductory courses face.\r\n\r\n A great strength was Professor MacKay, hes really funny as an instructor and is clearly very passionate about the teaching material.\r\n\r\nI wish we could've known more concretely ahead of time what type of exam we were expecting to see",
                "There were times when I felt frustrated with the course because I wanted to spend even more time on the given subjects, but generally, as an introductory course, I thought that it was good at covering the basics. I was particularly disappointed in the sound and animation weeks, as they are my favorite subjects in film, and felt like they were very rushed.",
                "The lectures moved pretty quick but the concepts were very important",
                "-less film theory, more film technique",
                "The strength is in the subject of the class. If you enjoy films in a nuanced manner, this class is for you. The weakness is that this 1 credit course takes up so much time. Between screenings, two lectures, section, and homework, it can add up.",
                "Strength: lecture hall is pretty\r\nWeakness: too much reading theory not enough talking about films",
                "I really liked this course. The strengths were the lecture-viewing-lecture format, where students were introduced to the week's material in lecture, shown films, then applied the first lecture's learning to the week's films. Also, the professor was available via email or meeting after class, which was great. The weakness was the order of the material-- i.e., talking about the technical/purely historical subject matter first was a less engaging start, and turned off some interested students during shopping period",
                "Lectures are a little boring and there are almost no modern films, so the class is actually seemingly taught as an into to film history class instead of evaluating the impact of modern films.",
                "Strengths: both guest lectures were the highlights of the course for me. They were both really interesting, and even if I don't particularly care for the film vs digital divide that was the focus of one of the lectures, I still learned a lot about it and came out of it interested.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class leans very heavily into the academic side of film studies. The movie list is *very* academic, with all of the greatest Intro to Film hits -- Citizen Kane, French New Wave, Soviet stuff from the 1920s. Perhaps I am glad that I have seen those movies, but none of them were very good, and there aren't many crowd-pleasers to balance it out. The readings are chosen for their historical and theoretical importance and therefore lean old and tough. I wouldn't call Professor MacKay a charismatic lecturer; he's not bad by any means, but he does nothing more than delivers the material quickly and efficiently.",
                "I think a strength was the depth of the class, and how specific we got with film techniques, but I think the class fell short when it came to breadth. Most of the films shown are Euro-centric, and it would have been nice to have more insight into Asian and African film culture.",
                "Strengths - the range of films shown (especially the experimental films) truly brings you a fresh perspective to films. A deep dive into various schools of filmmaking is also appreciated. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - screenings can often get boring and so there's a tendency to fall asleep. Film production itself is also glossed over, and many of the slides mostly contain clips from films rather than concepts we can refer back to."

                "Only if you are serious about being a film studies major. If you enjoy film analysis and you know you want to pursue film studies after college, by all means go for it! Mackay is a fantastic lecturer and he provides deeper insight for critically thinking about movies. However, if you like film or film studies but don't want to major in it, I would look elsewhere for a film class. Even if you love film analysis channels on YouTube but are not a film studies major, I still would not recommend the course. In FILM 150, a lot of moviemaking techniques you'd learn at typical film school (like lighting systems, camera angles) become unnecessarily theoretical. Regardless, if you do take the class, be prepared for conceptually difficult reading and writing. Discussing theoretical film topics will break your brain. Most importantly: Be wary of the TA you choose! It's really the TA that will make or break the fun of the course for you.",
                "No. But it's a requirement for the major.",
                "Yes! This course was a great writing course and a very interesting course to be introduced to film.",
                "Yes! It is a great class to learn more about film and become a more insightful film-viewer, and also a great place to start Film Studies.",
                "Only if you're very interested in film and the film major or are interested in a serious introduction into film history, as the class is a serious time commitment.",
                "I definitely would. Its challenging but not impossible. Its a great class for a wide variety of majors because it makes you more educated on film techniques and methods that you can easily recognize outside of the class.",
                "I would recommend every Yale student take a film course if the subject interests them, but not particularly this one.",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting and allows one to gain a broad overview of film studies, which can help them determine if it is something they would like to study more of.",
                "Yes if you love movies.",
                "Without a doubt. As a STEM major, I wasn't very sure about how I'd feel about this course, but it was super engaging and interesting. If you have any interest in film, you should definitely consider taking this course.",
                "Yes, I would. It is very interesting to learn and write about film.",
                "Yeah, sure. Lot of work with the film screenings, and you might hate movies while youre taking it, but then afterwards you realize you actually learned a lot and developed a lot of useful skills. In all seriousness, though the class was occasionally disorganized and confusing in terms of expectation, it was pretty rewarding and not too challenging",
                "I think this class was a great introduction to film studies, and you should definitely take it if you are interested in that field of study.\r\n\r\nIf you are taking this class simply as an easy writing credit, it may not really be for you. The type of writing expected was not the same as an english class, and the required screenings mean the class was pretty time-consuming.",
                "I think that this course is pretty manageable and really doesnt have too many assignments. The weekly readings and screenings add up but its not crazy. I think if nothing else it gives you an opportunity to watch so many films which you probably wouldnt see otherwise, and that in and of itself is pretty cool.\r\n\r\nThough, if you're really looking to thoroughly improve your writing this might not be that course.",
                "Yes! Great intro to film. It really exposed me to thinking about film in ways I never would have considered before.",
                "Yes, anyone who wants to study film needs to take this course",
                "I really enjoyed this course, but anyone considering this class needs to make sure they are committed, and that they truly have a passion for film. The class covers a lot of film, a lot of which are old and not excited for the average viewer. The class also takes up a lot of time. I personally really enjoyed this class, and the movies we watched were fascinating, but I know others who really didnt like the dense and antique material that was covered. Review the syllabi and make sure this class is something youre passionate about, not just a casual fan of.",
                "Maybe",
                "Yes! Mainly because I took this course as a bit of a lark and realized I love film studies and am taking another course form the department next semester and others might have a similar experience.",
                "Yes if they like old films and studying films, but not if they are just an average movie enjoyer.",
                "If you want to take this class, take the class. If you're on the fence or just want to try watching movies for a class, take a different film class. It's a classic intro class; unless you're the person who has only seen Boss Baby and is now watching a second movie, a lot of this class is teaching you the language to communicate the ideas you already have about the ways movies work, which is important to have if you want to study film more seriously but not entirely necessary to enjoying movies. There are ways to make this class more interesting, such as showing more crowd-pleasing movies (I didn't love any of the movies we watched this semester) or assigning more interesting readings (the readings are very historically and academically important, but also very dense), but this class doesn't do them. So you get the intro class familiarity with the field, but since this isn't a prereq to other film classes, I'd recommend taking those instead.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are considering becoming a film major. This is definitely not a film production class, so you won't be making any short films or learning about the process of filmmaking in detail. I personally loved this class for its focus on close readings of films and the film terminology I have now become familiar with. There are also a lot of interesting films shown at the weekly screenings, which are crucial to see if you want to go into film!",
                "I would recommend this for an introductory film class. It was easy to follow and gives you the skills to look at film more critically.",
