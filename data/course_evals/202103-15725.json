But, I think for many people (especially those with no experience) the workload and the pace of this course can be very draining.",

                "Yes definitely 100% Chinese at Yale is one of the most well taught departments here. All the instructors are so kind and helpful. They want to see you succeed, and the intensity of the course makes it so that you actually learn the language by the end of the semester.",
                "Definitely. On the strength of the curriculum and the intimate class sessions, I think the possible gains in language ability outweigh the deficiencies in support and make the high course load worth it."
