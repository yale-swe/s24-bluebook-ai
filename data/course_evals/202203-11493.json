                "tons of homework",
                "This course is impossibly difficult with Stone as a professor. His lectures are disorganized, communication is severely lacking, and some of the psets were so difficult the peer tutors had trouble figuring them out. The first pset of the year wasnt graded until November. The class was a mess.",
                "Strengths: none\r\nWeaknesses: the professor literally has incoherent lectures and is an absolute asshole.",
                "The content is very useful for aspiring engineers, however, the professor was demeaning, did not encourage asking questions, and did not teach in a way that promoted learning. Talking to the students that did best in the course they all shared that they were teaching themselves the content because they didn't understand his lectures, and that's coming from people who get near perfect scores on assignments and tests.",
                "Strengths: Fast-paced, we covered a lot of material\r\nWeaknesses: hard to understand material, many people just read out of the textbook, late release of PSETs",
                "The course material is interesting.\r\nHowever the biggest weakness of this class was the professor. All of his slides were screenshots of the textbook translated into powerpoint slides. His teaching style was terrible because it consisted of him reading off of his slides (which, as mentioned before, were just screenshots of the textbook) and then working through an example form the textbook that had already been worked through in the textbook! His ability to answer questions or provide clarity was extremely poor- at best. For the most part, he just made you feel stupid for asking questions. The grading on the exams was terrible because he did not give any partial credit- and again, if you approached him with questions about your exam, his responses were always condescending. I can not think of a single positive for this class other than that I am done with it forever.",
                "This course had the worst pedagogy of any course I've taken. Never have I seen an educator scoff at questions during lecture, or get mad at the class for not recognizing mistakes on the board sooner. This course could have been taught better by giving each student a copy of the textbook and weekly psets to work through at their own pace.",
                "Strengths: syllabus was well-designed and the material was definitely packed and interesting, good textbook, generally fair exams \r\nWeaknesses: unfortunately, Professor Stone's lectures. After a while, I took to the textbook as opposed to lectures. I found the lectures confusing, unengaging, and very hand-wavy. Important steps were skipped, assumptions made, and challenging topics were moved through very very quickly.",
                "I fundamentally believe that this entire course could have been taught in 2 weeks. The material is relatively simple, the class was not engaging, and I felt little need to pay attention in class as I could get all that I needed by skimming the textbook.",
                "This course covers a lot of important material but the instruction felt very confusing and rushed. I wish we did more engaging work and had lecture notes or additional review material.",
                "I really wish Yale would prioritize hiring professors that want to teach. Prof. Stone put in a good faith effort, but he would rather not.",
                "I think that there is a lot of content--difficult content--in the course and it was not super clear to the professor that students found it challenging. We were often belittled for asking \"silly\" questions but also scolded for asking too few questions. I thought that some topics were rushed into without explaining much of the basics, and algebra steps were skipped (even in the book) so that it was often difficult to come to a final answer without any model. The book utilized for the course explained some topics not expanded upon in class but also gave vague steps\/ explanations. A benefit of the course was that our class was super collaborative and it was easy to communicate with others about troubles and questions. It was more of a peer-driven course. However, PSET feedback and solutions were rarely provided in a timely manner that I often had to email the TFs to post solutions before an exam. I think that overall, exam prep could have been way better as merely providing content a day or two before midterms and the final was not sufficient. I also think that a formula sheet would have been beneficial as there were numerous equations to memorize but the professor did not feel like it was necessary to list some of them.",
                "The professor was terrible",
                "The course structure was fine. The course could benefit from some better organized, more thorough slides.",
                "I think the lectures were more on the theoretical side, with an emphasis on proofs, which meant that implementing the formulae in problems took a lot of self-teaching from the textbook. Had there been more guidance on how to solve differential equations, problem sets would have taken less time and preparing for exams would have felt less difficult. \r\nThere was a lot of help from TAs, but I would have benefitted from professor office hours.",
                "Strengths: theres a lot of content you could learn\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt love the structure of this course. Its one of the classes where the instructor changes every semester, and every instructor is inconsistent from semester to semester. It would be nice if the course could be more standardized for all semesters even if the professor has to change. Compared to another class I was in (PHYS 180), the resources provided are also very limited. I had seen the resources provided during an earlier version of this course with a different prof, and the different was staggering.",
                "The lecture materials, review slides and pset questions were all taken from the textbook. There were very few efforts made to synthesize content, and sometimes class just felt like a textbook recitation instead of actual teaching. Meanwhile, the exams asked difficult questions that diverged from typical textbook questions. This disconnect felt very frustrating and made it hard to succeed. In future, it would be nice if maybe the psets asked challenging questions but the exams were a bit more standard. It would also be nice to have clearer notes and lecture slides that weren't just textbook screenshots. I also think the exams should have been less time pressured.",
                "Textbook is superb. Course structure should follow textbook, and it did. Only issue was the professor",
                "This is differential equations; it's a hard class due to the nature of the content. The teaching fellows were very helpful. The exams felt unfair due to the difference in difficulty that students were led to expect compared to the actual difficulty. Everything wrong with this iteration of the course can be attributed to the professor.",
                "I think the way of explaining the concepts really made it hard to understand. By this I mean that I have a problem learning from straight examples rather than first learning a theorem.",
                "Strengths: the order of material is logical and the problem sets are comprehensive and very similar to material on the exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too focused on mathematical derivations which are just slugging through algebra, not enough in physical interpretation which is much more important for engineers and scientists"

                "No. Not with Professor Stone.",
                "No. A thousand times no. A million times no. Never put yourself through the pain of this course. Not if it is taught by A Douglas Stone. He is literally the absolute worst professor I have ever had at Yale, and that is saying something. On the first day, he goes over a rudimentary air resistance differential equation, a problem I have seen in physics many times. By the end of the class, I don't understand the problem or solution anymore. He goes over another example problem, which I fail to understand as well. I look over at a girl I just met, and she says that she went over those exact two problems that morning in her physics class, and she doesn't understand anymore. His lectures are completely incoherent, and persisted this way throughout the entire semester. The only way I survived his class was by completely ignoring his babble and taking notes on the textbook\/lecture notes from a past teacher.\r\nFurthermore, he is an actual asshole. He constantly condescends to the class, making comments on if we 'actually understood', we would be able to catch mistakes that he is making as he explains content we have never seen before. When my friend approached him after the first midterm as the TA had failed to grade 2 pages of her exam, he instead berated her for 7 minutes because she had made a simple algebra error, calling her 'stupid', 'ignorant', and that she obviously was 'not cut out for applied physics' because she had made this small error during a high-pressure exam.\r\nIn terms of psets, he will often post half-finished psets and then add 2-3 more problems 2 days before they are due. He does not provide TAs with solutions to any of the problems, so they will often be figuring out the solutions at office hours, and ULAs hosting office hours will not have solutions and be unable to help with the material. There is a lack of communication between the teaching staff and the professor, and little to no review material is posted for the exams except for sparse slides and a topic list. The midterm averages were 65% and 67%, and he said this 'seemed about average' and he didn't see any reason to change his teaching style going forward. Initially, he said he would not curve the exams.\r\nOverall, this class dramatically diminished my mental stability and caused me increasing frustration throughout the year. It is the worst-taught class I have ever taken at Yale, and Stone should be reevaluated. He is not fit to teach this class or any class and should just stick to research.",
                "no, the professor was awful",
                "I would recommend it if needed for higher level courses or your major. I definitely learned a lot. Not sure how useful it would be to an English major, for example.",
                "No unless the professor is changed. The course material is genuinely interesting and useful, especially if you are an engineer or an applied science major. But in its current design, with the current professor, you are better off taking a different class.",
                "No. Never take this course with Professor Stone. Postpone taking it at any rate to avoid him as a professor. The grading scheme was also ridiculous and lopsided, as even psets would be graded far worse than odd numbered psets. This course was a joke, and I may elect to retake it with a different professor in the interest of actually learning the material.",
                "If you want to learn ODEs and PDEs and are willing to put in the time to learn on your own, then yes. Do not, however, take this course thinking that you will learn in lecture. You will need to put in time and either read the textbook or go to office hours. Lecture is not helpful. Take the course if you genuinely want to learn ODEs\/PDEs and are self-motivated to do so.",
                "No. Again, you could self-study this entire course in 10 hours.",
                "This is a necessary course for engineering and while I did enjoy the content sometimes, it was very difficult to do well on the exams.",
                "I would not recommend this course to someone who does not have to take it. The content is difficult, the PSETs take over 4 hours to complete, and not all of the TFs\/ peer tutors are super useful. Perhaps if there is a teacher famous for their amazing teaching style, I would recommend the course but I do not think it is worth the hassle for those who do not need it.",
                "Yes - with a different professor",
                "Most certainly not. The professor was horribly disorganized, unprepared for class, and most significantly not a good teacher.",
                "I would recommend the course to any scientist and engineer, as this content is really foundational in many fields. However, be ready to put in a lot of time into understanding and implementing the course content.",
                "If you arent required to take this class, dont. Take the MATH version if you can. This class made me seriously consider switching majors out of STEM completely (something I had never considered) which eventually led to some brief thoughts of what if I just dropped out of college. I dont think I was actually ever at that point, but the fact that it crossed my mind definitely scared me a little bit.",
                "If youre taking this course, its likely because you have to. It definitely is a reasonable requirementthe study of differential equations is essential to physics and pretty much every engineering discipline.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a toolbox course, which teaches you to recognize different types of differential equations and has you practice the different tricks you need to know in order to solve them. Some of these tricks are formulae you need to remember, and some are a bit more like puzzle skills somewhat alike the tricks needed to solve integrals. (And mind you, you will also be doing a lot of integrals in this course.)\r\n\r\nOverall, the course sufficiently introduces the skills you need to succeed in any higher level course that requires proficiency in solving DE. However, the effort\/pain it will take to do so will vary significantly with the professor. Professor Stone provides error-ridden lectures that are so monotonous that even the most engaged students will struggle to stay awake. The textbook he followed was superb, and eventually I found it a much better use of time to listen long enough to figure out what section he was covering, then tune out and read it for myselfor eventually just skip class entirely and spend a few hours covering the material on my own time. This took more effort, but yields better understanding if youre able to hold pace and keep yourself accountable.\r\n\r\nA better teacher would significantly improve the experience. Some of the material is challenging and unfamiliarand not all easy to teach yourself. Unfortunately this class has seen many professors that leave that as the only real option if you want to learn the material.",
                "Yes, the content of the course is very essential. Please take it with literally any other professor.",
                "I do think I learned some more personal aspects of myself through this course. I would not deter students from taking the course.",
                "I would say it depends on who is teaching it. Some professors make the course very intuitive and connected to physical problems, and others not so much. Make sure you look at who is teaching the course, because that affects how much you can learn and understand."
