   "comments": [
    "Definitely learned a lot about perspective in history. Learned to evaluate who's providing information, and what agenda they might have in presenting history in a certain way.",
    "I developed my analytical thinking and writing skills for the humanities, and learned a lot about the history of film, particularly as it interacts with the history of the US at large.",
    "I learned to critically exam films with the historical context. My critical thinking and writing skills are improved by taking this course.",
    "Not only did I gain a much better understanding of the intersection of 20th-century political history and film history, I acquired much better appreciation of how films not only depict specific time periods but reflect the times in which they are made. This course is also amazing in its ability to teach crucial analytical skills and the ability to incorporate primary sources into your writing.",
    "I learned all about how different impulses and themes in American history were reflected and portrayed in cinema, from its initial advent to the modern day.",
    "In Film, Video, and American History, I strengthened my historical and filmmaking skills. I became a stronger reader and analyzer by scrutinizing historical films and primary sources. In doing so, I also made connections between Americas sociopolitical climate and its media. I strengthened my grip on recent cultural phenomena (notably, the Reagan Era and the War on Terror). Hearing my classmates brilliant ideas about films as a product of their era expanded my ideas of the American identity and the nations treatment of racial and gender minorities. Moreover, I developed a more complex comprehension of cinematography by learning about directors techniques and terminology. While I have previously struggled with paying attention for elongated periods of time, the class's many readings, movies, and responses allowed me to increase my endurance for academic work, which will be useful in my future endeavors. Overall, I will certainly apply my newfound knowledge in my future studies and movie-watching!",
    "I learned about the historical context of film in the United States. I learned how to use primary and secondary sources to evaluate the context of the reception of films and I learned how to critically analyze themes and messages in films.",
    "Writing and presentation abilities.",
    "Since this is the first film course I have taken, the most significant skill I learned was how to analyze the art forms of film and video in the context of the historical periods during which they were made. My prior experience in history courses primarily involved examining and contextualizing primary and secondary documents. Through this course, I discovered that by comparison to historical textual research, film reveals a more complex account of specific time periods due to its subjective nature that can be influenced by many different biases and current events. This class was especially helpful in teaching me to integrate secondary and primary sources in my writing more seamlessly. Film, Video, and American History is also very effective in exposing the institutions and events that lead to Americas unjust racial politics. Our discussions about many of the films we watched, such as \"Within Our Gates\" and \"Selma,\" inevitably revolved around representations of race and civil rights, often relating back to the modern Black Lives Matter Movement."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought it skewed heavily towards earlier film history. It took us 4 classes to cover beginning of film up to the start of WWII (about 35ish years), but then it covered Regan era to present (40 years) in 1 class.\r\nI'd say it could be improved if it were distributed either more evenly or perhaps even skewed towards more recent history.",
    "This would have been a lot better if it was taught in person, not as condensed, and more lectures at a shorter length. 3 hours at a time on Zoom is too much. Overall, however, the course gave interesting insights into the history of film. Writing discussion posts about the films could have been better as it did not feel like there was much interaction between the posts. Additionally, I did not feel like there were many enjoyable\/quality films on the syllabus. The last three were fine, but many of the others were mediocre or just flat-out boring. I would have preferred to have spent a lot more time on the second half of the twentieth century instead of the first, as the overall quality of film tends to increase over time.",
    "Strengths: The topics included in the course discussion are diverse and intellectually stimulating. The discussion environment is open and encouraging. This course is well organized, and the instructors are articulate and knowledgeable. The student received immediate and detailed feedback. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course is too short. The time spend on each film genre was brief. However, the intense schedule is understandable for the summer semester.",
    "Consistency. What the professor said we would be graded on was not what my TA actually graded us on.",
    "This course seemed to struggle with defining what its focus was on. It consistently switched between a focus on film history and a focus on American history. This switching led to confusion about what exactly the course was about. I believe a focus on American history and how this was reflected in the films of the time would be a better angle for the course.\r\n\r\nThere also seemed to be a discrepancy between what was said to be graded on papers and the weekly screening reports and what was actually graded. Assignments were returned by the TF graded for elements that were either not mentioned on the assignment page or were said to not be required. These discrepancies led to a lack of confidence in what was needed to succeed in the course.",
    "(1) Professor Jacobs was also very understanding of the challenges we might experience given the fact that this course is being taught online. (2) The syllabus is incredible! Not only were the readings especially interesting and thought-provoking, the syllabus was incredibally diverse. So many film professors teach \"Great Films\" and then only screen white, male directors. But that only reflects the historic biases of academia. In desiging this year's syllabus, Professor Jacob's has selected great films that are made by women and filmmakers of color. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness exemplified by her selection of films and I think the rest of the Yale Film Department could learn a thing or two. It's one thing to talk the talk, but having your syllabus reflect your values is walking the walk. \r\n\r\nUnder Professor Jacob's leadership, this course is kind of perfect.",
    "Strengths: \r\nWeaknesses: the readings could be made much more relevant to class, as half the time we did not discuss the readings in class or in discussion section, and it felt like they were a bit too removed from the topic of classes. there was also a lot of material condensed into single classes, and it felt like we were speeding through the material instead of sitting in it and enjoying it. a possible solution to the speedy pace of the course could be to assign readings covering the topics we skipped over\/brushed over, in order to give students a fuller picture of the material\/the history we learned about.",
    "I enjoyed all aspects of the course and would not say that it had any weaknesses. Despite the virtual platform presenting students from actually being there, I felt like everyone was engaged and active during discussions. I enjoyed the classs three-part structure (presentation, lecture, discussion), for it kept me active and alert during classes. I also enjoyed the chronological structure of each class that made the course very interconnected and a good representative of shifts in American society. Additionally, switching the programming every hour or so was a genius move that kept students engaged for over three hoursa task not as easy as it may seem! We had adequate breaks, and I was grateful that Professor Jacobs stayed on during the breaks and after class to answer our questions. I would not offer any suggestions to improve the class, for I do not think that it needs to be altered at all.",
    "The course material is very interesting and the films were very well correlated with the lecture material. I think the class being taught online made it more challenging to focus on lectures, but overall the material was engaging.",
    "Very effective teaching style with good amount of participation.",
    "Some strengths are definitely the professors - Carolyn and Melinda are wonderful teachers - as well as the overall format of the course. I enjoyed the student presentations as they allowed everyone in the class to stay engaged as well as learn something new related to the lecture for that day. Discussion section was also a great opportunity to further discuss the film we screened for class and to help gain a better understanding of the greater culture and context from which the film was produced. I think one weakness was the fact that it was a summer class; as with all summer classes, we had to cover a semester's worth of content in just 5 weeks so we definitely moved fast and didn't get to go in depth about certain topics that both students and the teachers would have liked to. Nonetheless, it was still a very enjoyable class and I definitely learned a lot in just 5 short weeks.",
    "Strengths: So many. First, lectures were engaging since Professor Jacobs encouraged our input and analysis of the materials she presented. The feedback I received on papers and other classwork was also impressive. Melinda Stang, Prof. Jacobss Teaching Fellow, was my section leader, and she provided thorough, personalized feedback about each of my assignments. Even though Professor Jacobs did not directly grade my work, she also reviewed my assignments and provided constructive secondary feedback. Professor Jacobs and her TF also selected films for us to watch that melded very well with the current Black Lives Matter Movement, so many of our discussions focused on race, allowing this central and painful foundation of American history to take center stage. Prof Jacobss teamwork with her Teaching Fellow was also a strength. Although Prof Jacobs was the primary instructor, she welcomed Melindas input during lecture, and their friendly relationship created a positive atmosphere in our class. The student presentations were also a plus since our peers presentations provided a different perspective on the topics we discussed due to their personal experiences. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any."

   "comments": [
    "Very much! Excellent intersecting class. If you like good movies or american history, this is a great class.\r\nVery thought-provoking.",
    "Yes, it was an engaging survey of American film history.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the topics in this course are broad. The course can be a great humanity course for students not only limit to film students. The learning environment is supportive.",
    "I wouldn't likely recommend this course. The focus seemed to be uncertain and the content has been better covered in other courses. The TF was somewhat pretentious in section and asked clearly leading questions. Grading was inconsistent with what was said would be graded.",
    "In a heartbeat! This course is the best that film classes and history classes can offer. The close analysis of cool films combined with the comprehensive education in these films' historical context made this course really enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend! This course is really interesting, as you get to see how history and film are reflected into each other, and the films screened every week are really interesting to watch. Professor Jacobs is also really sweet, and she makes coming to class super enjoyable! She actually listens to the points students make during class, and consistently addresses them\/adds to them in some way during discussions!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! I would tell them that it is a fascinating and dynamic course where they will complexity their understanding of American society by examining the media produced throughout the 20th century. I would especially advice my fellow film geek and history buff friends to sign up! I would tell them that the course requires an engaged, eager, and earnest student who is willing to put in the work and excited to learn. I would encourage them to actively share their ideas in class to stimulate the discussion and think of the films in relation to one another.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think you get out of this course what you put into it and if you are willing to put in good work and challenge yourself, then you will learn and grow a lot.",
    "Absolutely! I thought it was an engaging class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was such an interesting class - it is very cool to study recent American history through the perspective of film and video. I have never taken a film class before, but both Carolyn and Melinda did a wonderful job making all of the material super understandable and engaging for all students, regardless of experience. It was a great opportunity to see and learn more about films that you wouldn't necessarily think about - I got to see black and white and silent films for the first time which was super cool.",
    "Most definitely. If you enjoy films and are interested in history, especially the history of social and political movements, this is the course for you. The analyses and group discussions surrounding what the films we watched say about race, gender, and equal rights were fascinating and very accessible for students who are neither film nor history majors. Additionally, I honestly enjoyed the papers we were assigned, particularly the reception assignment which required us to make an argument about how a particular film was received at the time it was released and what that response revealed about the time period. Besides the coursework, the atmosphere of the course was very welcoming and conducive to learning because of how well Professor Jacobs and Melinda, her TF, work together."
