   "comments": [
    "This course is mostly review and development on topics covered in L1 and L2. We added some vocabulary and some grammatical concepts and practiced becoming more comfortable speaking.",
    "We reviewed much of the material in second semester first year Russian in a deeper way. We also learned more about time in Russian",
    "Learned more about russian language and culture",
    "Russian L3 skills but due to cramming a whole semester into 3 weeks, we missed a lot",
    "A lot of important knowledge for getting around in Russia - asking for directions, food and medical vocabulary, verbs of motion.",
    "A significantly improved knowledge of Russian, and a lot of vital language skills needed for actually living in Russia. I was disappointed at first that the whole class wouldn't be in Russia, but I think this portion was absolutely necessary in order to live there."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The intensity of the course was a strength meaning we learned a lot in a short period however we needed to practice more our speaking and vocabulary.",
    "Very tight knit environment, very easy to get help",
    "The course has way to much homework and overall, too much material to be learned. Most of the class just couldn't absorb 3 months of Russian in 3 weeks and just adding homework didn't help. Because we had to spend so much time on homework we did t have time for studying for the weekly quizzes or tests.",
    "Strengths: important content that was very useful upon arriving in Russia. Julia is a good teacher and can explain the material well. Weaknesses: testing on Canvas encourages dishonesty among students, which is very disheartening. Course is also a LOT of work. Lastly, the class often felt more like a culture class than a language class. It is fine to teach us about Russian culture, but I wish students with all interests and motivations for taking Russian would be respected and valued in the class - which they were not.",
    "Strengths: Immersion, speed of instruction, dedicated students\r\nWeaknesses: at times not rigorous enough, gets a little off topic especially in the last week when people are getting tired"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is essential for becoming more comfortable speaking and listening to Russian, as well as solidifying grammatical concepts.",
    "Yes if you are serious about Russian this is a must take! Its a strong foundation for future studies!",
    "Definitely!",
    "I don't think this course is designed well so if you actually want to learn the material I would stay away. If you just want to take class in Russia you'll have to suck it up for the first 3 weeks in New Haven but know you will not have any time to yourself those three weeks and you will hate your life. Once you get to Russia it's a little better but still not great.",
    "It depends. If you really want to learn Russian, this course is a good way to do it. However, it is a TON of work - you need to be very committed (and, in my case, sleep very little) to succeed. I also didn't enjoy the classroom environment.",
    "Yes; if I knew a student was doing Russian at Yale, I would 100% recommend they try to do the St Petersburg program. It was one of the best experiences of my life, and the New Haven portion was excellent, from the classes to the experience of living off-campus in the summer"
