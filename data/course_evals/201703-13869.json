   "comments": [
    "I learned how seminar classes are set up and discovered that I am not good at speaking in them, especially when the content is very philosophy-based. That said, I learned more about myself as a writer and ways to improve my writing.",
    "My writing and ability to read long, complicated pieces of work improved immensely in this class.",
    "How to formulate a strong argument, the workings of a good academic paper, how to write a research paper.",
    "I improved my writing skills by learning how to form a cohesive, specific argument and carry it throughout my essay. Furthermore, we dealt with a lot of difficult texts in the class which helped to introduce me to academic writing styles. I was pleasantly surprised by the broad range of philosophical subjects we covered in this class.",
    "Knowledge on Afro and Queer Pessimism; philosophies of Camus, Nietzsche, and other classic pessimists\r\n\r\nHow to write analytically, critically, and creatively\r\n\r\nHow to discuss in class effectively",
    "I learned a lot about social issues and how to approach them in a way that we don't often see (A pessimistic approach).  This course truly was insightful.",
    "By taking this course I was able to learn about the many aspects of society that at contingent upon pessimism and how it works to move people forward. Together, the class took an excursion through the classical views of pessimism ranging from Nietzsche to Herzog and then used that to evaluate and understand modern forms of pessimism like that of black pessimism and queer pessimism. I was able to develop an eye for good and bad arguments, and even come out with my own analysis of the literature. Amongst the expository works we read, works of fiction we're also sprinkled in to emphasize the universality of the issues at hand. Overall, this course made me more aware of the issues society faces today with racism and homophobia through the understanding of pessimism in these movements.",
    "I got better at interpreting difficult literature.",
    "In English 114 I learned how to effectively communicate an argument by going deep into a single text. From there, we learned the comparative method which drew from our earlier paper. I learned how to write a research paper and how to use Yale's resources as references."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The feedback on essays helped me to shape my writing style and grow in a technical sense. This specific course was very philosophy heavy to begin with which made it extremely difficult for me, especially in discussion.",
    "There were a lot of really long complicated readings in this course that were really hard to get through, but the discussions in class were always interesting and helped clear my confusion.",
    "Topics discussed were engaging and multidisciplinary, mixed use of academic readings, novels, poems, films, was great, and varied approaches to class discussion kept class interesting.\r\nI think the class could be improved by discussing more directly how to write well, rather than just learning from feedback.",
    "Strengths: challenging; discussion-based; research involved\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could use more instruction on classic pessimistic philosophers before the first few readings",
    "This course requires a ridiculous amount of reading, but that is a consequence of the topic, which I believe is interesting enough to merit the extra reading.",
    "The weakness of this course is simply the vast amount of reading that was to be done. Otherwise I believe this course was fun and engaging. The topics we're current and there was not one day where the discussions the class had on the reading would not be insightful.",
    "Sometimes was too challenging of readings or we werent given enough time for the long and dense readings. We usually had good class discussions. There were many occasions where he assigned multiple big things to be due on the same day, which were unreasonable.",
    "The course includes four major essays with the prompts ranging in specificity. If you are someone who does not like analytical writing, do not take this course. The course pushes students to use evidence based arguments, and instructors are helpful in guiding students through this process. One aspect of the course that may be considered a weakness to some is that students are expected to understand the readings entirely before coming to class so that no time is wasted reviewing the content. We jump right into a discussion related to the text and in later papers you will be expected to draw both from those discussions and the texts themselves."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend an English 114 class in general since I think it is useful to develop college writing skills. I did like some of the things discussed at the end of this course, but because of the content at the beginning, I'm not sure if it would be my first instinct to recommend this course. It would depend on whether or not the student really liked English, philosophy, and discussion.",
    "Absolutely. This course gave me a solid foundation for writing papers that will be a necessary skill for the rest of my time at Yale. It also engaged me on topics of issues in our society that all students should be engaged with at some point in their time at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. This was my favorite class this semester; the subjects taught were interesting and challenging, Professor Bell is great, and I noticed that my writing improved a lot.",
    "Yes because I not only became a better writer and speaker in class, but I learned so much about engaging topics some of which I had the opportunity to research on my own as well",
    "I highly recommend this section of English 114 to anyone willing to put in the work.  Tacking this on as a way to get your writing requirement out of the way might not be the best idea if you have a heavy course load. This is not a Gut, but it is a fascinating course.",
    "I already have! I've recommended this course to every student who likes to read and engage in discussions on controversial topics. The professors feedback on our writing was also the best I've ever had, he took the time to evaluate all my lines of argument and pointing out places that they could be improved or altered, he asked questions that changed my way of thinking, and pushed us to be better writers overall.",
    "Depends on the type of person you are. People who really like philosophical thought and English courses in general would probably like this course. People who get lost in deep readings probably wont.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student, and especially those who want to improve their writing skills in a supportive, intimate environment."
