The class is a mere extension of concepts from intermediate micro\/macro but both lacks economic intuition and mathematical learning. Maybe it would have been different if in person. The professor spends time on his own research which, while cool, was sometimes difficult to follow. At the beginning, the first concept was really interesting. Throughout the course, we could have discussed economic agents and their decisions as opposed to hand-wavey proofs that barely scratched the surface, but only got any of this insight in discussion section or with other students.",

After equilibrium, coverage of the leverage cycle, mortgage payment\/pricing, a little bit of financial pricing in general. You'll also have to learn some of the basics of Python for computation.

                "The problem sets and tests were properly sized and interesting. Not too challenging but not easy. The online notes were great. Only issue was lecturing. Don't know if because of iPad but lectures were hard to follow and writing was frequently illegible.",
                "While the professor is kind enough to give us the notes, it is very math notation heavy, and I had to spend so much time deciphering what it means. It would be much easier if we can have a simple example in class, or we worked through the problem together, rather than being presented it on the notes. The few times we did do that, I grasped the concept immediately, but whenever the problem\/model was just on the class notes and we just talked about them without thoroughly and step-by-step going through it, I was confused.",
                "Dedicate more time to more mathematical concepts.",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Geanakoplos' focus on his own work. They are interesting models, that I may never have had a chance to learn, and certainly not learn as deeply, if it were not for this class. The personal anecdotes, and Geanakoplos' thoughts about the specificities of the models, taught me to think about general equilibrium in new ways. Geanakoplos' models made me think about what changes could enhance Walrasian Equilibrium. Unfortunately, these other great parts of the course made the discussion of Walrasian Equilibrium quite short. In the end some of the discussion of Walrasian Equilibrium felt like a repeat of Micro Theory, except tatonnement and stability were new to me. I do not know what could be done to fix this, however, because each other part of the course feels crucial. Most importantly however, and although as a Math major I am probably in the minority when I say this, I took this class to get a proof based view of economics. As a result the first half of the course amazing. Although Geanakoplos did a great job to explain the ideas behind the proofs in the second half of the course, it would have been nice to do more proofs in this course.",

                "The strengths are that the material itself could potentially be interesting or engaging. When trying to study, researching other institutions version of the course lent great insight. However, these potential strengths were grossly overshadowed by the lack of total learning in the end. When exams came, many students scrambled through notes and recorded lectures to find answers as opposed to really understanding the material in the course, because of the incredibly poor structure.",
                "The class felt very erratic and all over the place. We jumped from topic to topic very abruptly, and it often felt like we were just learning models because Professor Geanakoplos came up with them. The caliber of the student in the class was very high, however, which made the class engaging and fun.",

He is also very good about encouraging questions to make sure people understand what is going on. The course definitely ties together theory and actual events pretty well, and shows how and why certain things happen in the economy. This includes phenomenon such as inflation, trade, leverage, price booms\/busts, and certain aspects of mortgage pricing. The problem sets are pretty computation-heavy, even though they could definitely be more proof-based. \r\nWeaknesses: Lecture could be hard to follow at times, and the notes weren't always easy to comprehend. Slightly more proof-based work may have deepened understanding; there were very few problems that lay between completely theoretical and completely computational."

Don't come expecting the rigor of a math course or the conjectures of econ.",

That being said, if you want to do econ research and you are good at math, definitely take the class because the Professor is so smart and definitely interesting to listen to.",

Please find something more interesting to do with your life. \r\n\r\nI would definitely not recommend the class. The lectures were Geanakoplos reading aloud from his lecture notes, with tons of skipping around and rushing through sections. No one ever had any clue what was going on. For two classes he actually wrote the math out on a tablet and people seemed to be following better but then he decided that was too hard so he was just going to go back to talking about his lecture notes in front of the class. Everyone was confused and too scared to ask questions, and even though he claimed that he loved questions, everyone was intimidated to do so because he often acted like we were idiots if we didn't immediately understand his convoluted explanations. I learned everything in section but the time in section was only less than half than was in lecture (and in a fast-paced course), so there was no way to get through everything during section. He completely rushed through the interesting half of the class on Arrow-Debreu because he claimed we had seen most of it before (but not with this much mathematical rigor!) so that he could show off his new ideas and try to convince us of things that we didn't really understand because his explanations were incomprehensible. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets were graded on completion and there was no feedback provided. Since the answers were not always just numerical but could involve proofs or explanations, this was very unhelpful, especially given that the solution sets were often incomplete, littered with errors, or contradicted information provided in class or section. Also, halfway through the semester, Geanakoplos started posting them on Thursday due Tuesday, and I know that almost no one would have started them before the weekend anyways, but I felt it was inconsiderate to not give us the full week.\r\n\r\nThe exams were absurd. Midterm was a 24 hour take home designed to take 3 hours, but it took almost everyone at least double that. It was a random Wednesday in the middle of the semester, so if you had anything else going on you were screwed. The final was even worse. We had basically three days, and it was supposed to take 6 hours. I spent probably 18 hours on it, and I know students who spent more. Friends in the class said it was the worst three days of their lives. The problems were never-ending with ~10 subsections. The subsections were also often incomprehensible and it would be almost impossible to tell if there was a question buried in them and you had to spend time figuring out what he was actually asking (example: \"Can you see how you could imagine a continuum of homeowners lying anywhere between completely rational, and completely inert (never prepay)?\").  It also had a problem on something we barely covered and two unnecessarily long problems on stuff from before the midterm that we had already been tested on so there was no point in including them in the final. \r\n\r\nThe class also claimed to teach Python but we learned next to nothing and in the second half of the semester, Geanakoplos would show examples with incomprehensible Excel spreadsheets and then expect us to be able to replicate whatever he was doing on problem sets and the final.",
                "This course is a must take. The material feels too important for one semester. If only there were one semester focused on general equilibrium and a second semester focusing on Geanakoplos' research.",

The econ\/math community does get closer with this course but as a whole, major improvements are necessary so students are both challenged and learning. The challenges in this course came from the disorganization, not actually the material itself. If it had been the other way around, the class would have been far more fulfilling.
