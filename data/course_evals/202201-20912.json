At each step, we learned why this step was implemented that way, how it could be attacked, and how it functions within the larger \"internet\". Definitely feel confident in explaining how data is transferred around the world and what complications may arise.",

                "The specs to the projects could be pretty vague at times, but otherwise things were pretty good overaall.",
                "I think this course was well done. You will learn a lot. However, it is graded HARSHLY, especially with exams which leads to unnecessary amount of anxiety. Anurag is a great professor and tries to be accommodating whenever he can. The course seriously lacked enough support staff (only a single ULA :( ). The slides for this course are some of the best I have ever seen!",
                "Strengths: professor is great, explains stuff well (though he does move fast), and you learn a lot. Psets and homeworks are not too challenging and are good applications of what you learn in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness, but the exams are tough and a time crunch. Study hard for those. The material is also likely not the most exciting if you do not think learning the process of data transfer over the internet will be interesting.",
                "Strengths: good content\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be very helpful to rewrite the specs for the last two programming assignments (right now, we have to read through a huge number of Ed discussion questions to figure out how certain features are meant to be implemented)",
                "prof anurag is a really great lecturer, and in particular this course has been probably the most interactive lecture ive ever been in. theres constantly opportunities for questions and comments in class. it covers a LOT, so its sort of like a firehouse of information. one weakness, however, is a lack of support (theres only one ULA and two TFs, and they have very few OHs). expect to be doing projects pretty much entirely on your own",
                "A lot of conceptual knowledge is covered in each lecture which is both a strength and weakness. I felt like I learned a lot but at the same time the pacing was quite fast and the problem sets would only cover a subset of what we learned in lecture. So the tests became the only form of assessment that tested everything.",
                "Strengths: really high engagement of the class - Anurag has a pretty strict participation grade that makes people actually engage and ask\/answer his questions. I have never seen this in a CS class and this is really effective (I do think Anurag was a bit mean answering questions at first but got much better over time). Another strength is the amount of content covered. This class was really in-depth and one of the first classes I have taken (besides OS) that got into a lot of detail about the course content. Anurag is really really smart and explains concepts in ways that are manageable to understand as a undergrad. I feel like I actually learned the entire stack of the internet. Another strength is the psets were just enough. Not easy but not insanely hard and there were only 3 coding assignments (10-15 hours each). Also, the exams were graded in one night which is crazy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the exams are really tough (our first exam was probably one of the hardest exams I have taken at Yale). Anurag zooms through content, so you have to ask questions to slow him down. The ULA was also condescending.",
                "The problem set grading felt extremely arbitrary. While I know it was based off automated tests, I often received far poorer grades than I expected. It would have been nice if there were a few more public test cases, as often I would erroneously think that my code's behavior was valid but would be surprised to learn that it had some flaw that caused many private test cases to fail. I understand this is mostly on me, but it was frustrating that even after working on a problem set for a long while and doing much to validate proper behavior beyond the public test cases, I would still get very bad problem set grades.\r\n\r\nAlso, releasing pset grades two days before an exam and making regrade requests due on the day of the exam was quite unfortunate.",
                "Its very fast paced",
                "There weren't enough office hours for the psets that required writing code.",
                "Good class all around, I enjoyed",
                "I wish there are more public tests in the coding projects",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, excellent PowerPoint slides for following along, and an established schedule early on in the semester for planning ahead\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Extremely difficult exams that did not reflect any classroom or homework practice, some project specs were difficult to follow, very hands-off office hours help, not enough examples for homework completion",
                "Psets and Canvas quizzes both lack in specification, to the point where every assignment required dozens and dozens of EdStem questions to clarify various aspects. A more thorough or comprehensive specification for these assignments would have been helpful. There's also very little real-world application, with most questions focusing on implementation details.",
                "The problem sets are well designed and the course content is very well structured. By the end of the class I was surprised at how much I had learned and how good of an understanding I had of how the internet works!",
                "Strengths: Lectures were pretty engaging, homework helped to understand content\r\nWeaknesses: Content was too detailed sometimes",
                "Strengths: Excellent interactive lectures where the Prof is not afraid to take questions, interesting psets that aren't too difficult\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures have a ton of content, midterms can be a little too difficult but Prof was working on this",
                "Exams and homeworks are either mechanical or memory based, not really understanding based. Lectures are good and Anurag explains things well.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot of material \r\nWeaknesses: I found the projects to be a bit too difficult."

                "Yes and no. This course is great. It is one of the better CS courses offered at Yale and shows you the practical applications of the theoretical CS skills we gain at Yale. Anurag is clear and very knowledgeable in his field (he is leaving Yale tho and not sure if he will be back to teach again). He makes great slides. Also, Seung-Seob (the coinstructor\/TA) is probably one of the most responsive people on this planet and was up until 2 am answering questions on one of the programming assignments.... SHOUT OUT TO HIM! I do wish the programming assignments were clearer (maybe a walkthrough session from TAs\/ULAs or even the professor himself???). Additionally, the homework assignments were kinda hard. They covered analytical applications of the theoretical concepts we learned. The analytical side of things weren't really covered in lecture and you would be left searching online for concepts required to answer many of the things being asked. The internet became my go to resources over the course of the semester because there were minimal opportunities to ask the ULA, which I often prefer over TAs. The grading in this course is exceptionally harsh and the exams were stacked against you. You can know all of the content and still fail the exam. They are really hard and make up for 50% of your grade which leads to a highly anxiety inducing experience. This anxiety is amplified by the fact that the professor is extremely vague with how he will end up curving the course. He releases raw grade information as well as statics and histogram of grade distributions, but this is of little help when almost everyone is scoring around a 60-70. I wish he curved scores on an assignment by assignment basis. This would make everyone much more confident with their grades and standing in the course. For future students: although I am unsure if the course will remain the same without Anurag, the first programming assignment is the hardest, but must work at a basic level because you will build onto of it in assignment 3. The second assignment was by far the easiest once you got through the learning curve of understanding what is happening (the spec is kinda unclear). The third assignment was the second easiest. Use that information to plan accordingly.",
                "Exams are tough, psets and homeworks are fair and don't take significant time. Learned a lot, but if you do not think you want to learn about networks, the class will likely be dry for you. Professor is a great lecturer.",
                "Yes if interested in networking",
                "i would as a tough but rewarding CS elective! definitely worth it to shop for a bit. it covers a ton of material but you really do learn a lot (probably more than you need to know, honestly) about the Internet. lectures are pretty fun but mandatory (not recorded, unfortunately). just be warned, its a hard class with minimal support. you might want to take it with a friend",
                "Yes, you need to take this class. You will learn a lot in a setting where the professor is invested in your learning. This is probably one of the most worth it courses in Yale CS.",
                "Yes, it is extremely interesting and provides a glance into the internal workings of protocols that we tend to, but shouldn't, take for granted.",
                "Yes, I think the content of this course is important for all CS majors to know.",
                "Yeah - Id recommend if youre curious about how the internet works. Its not too hard, either; just three homeworks and 3 coding problems (although the coding can be time consuming if you dont think before you write)",

                "Yes, the knowledge is a must know a requirement for CS major, especially if going into system related",
                "I would be hesitant to recommend this course. It is very hands-off and easy to fall behind. \r\nWhile I met the 323 requirement, I did not have the necessary Python coding experience to complete the projects. They would take me a lot longer than most of my peers and there were limited test cases provided. Likewise, the material was cool to learn, but the homework and assessments felt very removed from the lectures. I would have appreciated some guided practice for the homework and a review session or two for the assessments. \r\n\r\nI know some students did really well in the course, but I sense that they are used to the hands-off teaching and self-learning processes. A lot of them were\/had been my ULA's in different courses.",
                "Yes! I honestly think this course should be required for all cs majors, you will leave feeling so much more competent and truly understanding how the Internet works!",

Any CS major should have some idea of the concepts discussed in this class. The psets are not too difficult but towards the end of the class, they get a bit more crowded, so managing one's time is important.",
