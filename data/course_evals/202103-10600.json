                "Strengths: studio classes, coaches, pieces, groups, fantastic course!\r\n\r\nA workshop or class on chamber rehearsal techniques may be helpful at the beginning of the semester.",
                "Wonderful class-- chamber music at Yale is the best, and I could have it no other way!  It's a beautiful journey, diving deep into one piece of chamber music with colleagues over the semester, and you grow close to your group because of this shared experience.  \r\n\r\nI wish, though, during studio classes, we could hear more from other coaches.  Wendy is the main commentator on every group during class, and she does a great job of giving helpful feedback, but I would love to hear more from other coaches.   Sometimes, I feel like they don't get enough time to give any detailed comments.  Perhaps for each group, Wendy could switch between the coaches to be the main commentator (have a different coach make detailed comments, come up to the stage like Wendy would usually do). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would love to play more repertoire from composers of color and/or modern composers.  I feel like there are so many pieces of chamber music that challenge us as much as any of the classic rep does.",
                "No Weakness",
                "I really loved both my coaches and appreciate the time they gave to us. I think it would be cool to have guest professors come in for masterclasses to hear other perspectives.",

                "Outstanding opportunity for chamber music development and one of my favorite ways to play music at Yale.",
                "Strengths: you get very close to a group of strong musicians, you get to perform a major work publicly and get to interact with many wonderful coaches and musicians from all around Yale \r\nCons: Sometimes it can be hard to schedule rehearsals, especially if your group is big and busy, but this is inevitable",
                "Perhaps an easier format on which to communicate with group members and coaches about practice schedule would help ease some anxiety regarding rehearsals and coaching.",
