    "A great survey of the various arts produced during the Middle Byzantine Period.  We learned about Byzantine history, a bit of church history, and a lot of art history.  Just what I was after.  I learned better art historical comparison skills and new ways of appreciating religious art and artifacts."

    "I wish that we had gotten a bit more introduction\/background to Byzantine art and history before we delved into the material for anyone who wasn't so familiar with it.",
    "The course offered a lot of Byzantine political and military history, and it gave a good survey of the various types of arts produced during the period.  The lectures were well adapted to our class of 3 students, and the \"seminecture\" style worked well to keep us informed and engaged."

    "This is a wonderful course--Professor Nelson is so passionate about the material, and is extremely approachable and supportive for students.",
    "Yes!  Professor Nelson is probably the most kind, supportive, and mentoring professor I've had so far.  His passion for Byzantine art is always clear.  This course offers a great survey of the various types of art made during the Middle Byzantine period, and it situates them in the military and political history of the time."
