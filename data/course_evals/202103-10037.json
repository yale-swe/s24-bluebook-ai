                "a more thorough understanding of capitalism, heteropatriarchy, settler colonialism, neoliberalism, gentrification, and so much more key concepts that everyone should be familiar with",
                "The course covered a lot of important scholarship in Urban Studies, major historical processes, and current issues in American cities.",
                "This gave a technical definition and history to things that I already knew about America and New Haven.",
                "My views regarding racial capitalism within the world and racial, social, gendered, etc. inequalities as a whole have been expanded greatly. I'm really happy that I took this course.",
                "I learned how to critically engage with the space around me and be thoughtful of the place and context that I occupy. I also developed a deeper understanding of the way that American history reinforced gender, space, and class discrimination\/disparities and can now engage in thoughtful discussion about it.",
                "Great class, learned a ton about racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy and their applications in the real world",
                "really interesting to see how these constructs intersection and the impact they have on American society",
                "i literally only learned how to critically think about the built environment, everything i came to class knowing",
                "This course helped developed critical analysis skills by connecting contemporary issues to historical processes. I thought the readings were really interesting.",
                "I learned more about racial capitalism and the inequity of American Cities",
                "This class gave me really useful theoretical tools for looking at social science problems. The first half of the class provided a good overview of 20th-century city-based American history. I learned about how several policies influenced how cities functioned in recent history, and I learned more about the ideologies that shape cities today. The field projects also helped me get to know New Haven better, which was one of my goals in taking the course.",
                "Great overview of the main forces driving inequality in American cities. Excellent overview of the history of American cities, and how the historical forces interact with contemporary injustices. Based on topics in the course, I have developed skills to re-evaluate my interactions within urban space, and I am constantly re-thinking the spatiality, forces, and interactions that shape urban space.",

                "Learned about the development of urban spaces in America and their history rooted in the displacement and discrimination against minority communities. Better understanding of structural factors that contribute to inequalities along race, class, and gender lines in American cities. Also helped me decide what I want to study in the future!",
                "A good introduction into critical urban geography and history in U.S. cities  the first half is the theories and history of social production of urban space, and the second half is present-day examples of this social production. Much needed insights into the settler colonial and racial capital processes in cities, including examples of resistance to these oppressive architectures of power.",
                "The first half of the class begins with a discussion of the structural factors that have contributed to racial, class, and gendered inequality in American cities, exploring fundamental themes like settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and heteropatriarchy. Then, the second half discusses modern inequalities that show the persistence of these histories and themes.",
                "I learned a lot about cities and the reasons why they are the way they are today! I feel like I was given the tools I need to talk about the issues in cities currently.",

                "I learned SO much about the ways in which cities are organized and it really changed the way I walk around neighborhoods. I learned so much about the history of how cities are formed and why, and I learned a lot more about capitalism and how it physically shapes spaces. It was also just really helpful for me to see how all these historical layers shape our cities today.",
                "This course pushes students to explore cities through a lens of gentrification, neoliberalism, housing crisis, and environmental crisis. The subject matter was very interesting and the readings were great to read.",

                "For some, this may be your first experience learning about the inequalities that have perpetually haunted cities like New Haven since their creation. For others, this will probably be the first time you can actually name the injustices going on in your home community. I was definitely the latter, but with this in mind, there is nothing wrong with either stance. In fact, I was able to understand the region I came from more by gaining perspective. This course is definitely not for everyone, but if you are interested in studying how topics like settler-colonialism and heteropatriarchy have historically shaped the urban landscape in the US, this is for you.",
                "By taking this course, I learned a lot about the historical origins and modern manifestations of socioeconomic inequalities plaguing American cities. I really feel like I have a much better understanding of processes such as gentrification, capitalism, etc. and how to critically analyze urban space.",
                "Inequalities across America",

                "This course provided a broad overview of key issues related to race, class, and gender in American cities. It situated the class under three broad themes: settler colonialism, heteropatriarchy, and racial capitalism. The first section of the course was dedicated to history, while the latter half focused on current issues. I felt like I was able to achieve a broad, surface-level view of a variety of issues related to race, class, and gender. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely an overview course. I think it would be most effective for underclassmen with little background knowledge in this field.",
                "learned a lot about the social reproduction of space and how it is extremely racist. Learned about redlining and how the effects of the HLOC are still seen today. Learned about new haven public transportation and the inequities that come with it, and how it needs to be upgraded. Learned about gentrification in New Haven as well.",
                "I learned about the ways in which settler colonial, racial capitalist, and heteropatriarchal ideologies have impacted history and continue to shape our current society. Through a variety of field projects, I was able to apply the knowledge learned in readings and lecture to specific and present-day examples of these ideologies at play.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of racial capitalism in the US. This course helped with my critical thinking skills.",
                "I learned about contemporary urban issues as well as their historical basis in the events of the 20th century in particular",
                "By taking this course, I was exposed to the ways in which racism has infiltrated the geographic and physical world.  I not only learned about the histories that have shaped the environments near us, but I also learned how to identify them and what to attribute them to.  Some of the concepts I learned through this course are racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, redlining, neoliberalism, settler colonialism, and vertical disintegration.",
                "We spent the first half of this course reviewing major historical and sociological developments within the American city in the late 19th and early 20th century. These developments include industrialization, scientific management, segregation, labor unions, deindustrialization, automobility, redlining, suburbinization, and white flight. We spent the next half of the course investigating the effects of these developments: uneven development, gentrification, food deserts, etc. Throughout the course, we use three main theoretical frameworks to analyse and understand the issues we dealth with: settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and cisheteropatriarchy. By the end of the course, I felt very well-versed in the history of the contemporary American city as well as capable of understanding all contemporary cities in not only settler societities, but everywhere.",
                "I developed the ability to critically analyze space, and I developed a greater understanding of how historical processes impact current issues. Specifically, I learned how to discuss these issues through the frameworks of settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and heteropatriarchy.",
                "This class provided a historical context as well as contemporary manifestation to the ways Race, Class, and Gender have shaped our lived experiences and, quite literally, built our lived environments.",
                "Good understanding of the reproduction of space",
                "I learned a lot about how patterns of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy have shaped and continue to shape urban spaces in the United States. Through class lectures, field projects, and readings, I feel that I have gotten much better at identifying real-world examples of these concepts and thinking critically about how and why cities function the way they do.",
                "I learned to assess how cities are built on historical premises that build and define how they function today. We applied elements of capitalism, heteropatriarchy, and environmental injustice to address how cities exist today.",
                "I learned how to do sociological style writing, and how to combine broad course concepts with specific histories and contemporary issues.",
                "I learned the foundational principles of racial capitalism and patriarchy and settler colonialism. I also learned the historical influences on modern day expressions of racism",
                "This course was a great survey of the history of U.S. cities through the lenses of settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and heteropatriarchy.  Even though I felt like I was well-versed in the history of general trends in U.S. urbanism already from previous courses I've taken, re-examining that history explicitly through the framework of race, class, and gender was a really important and worthwhile undertaking.",
                "Looked at the social and spatial production of race, class, and gender inequalities, and how they were built through the interaction of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy",
                "I got a basic understanding of the different economic, social, and political processes that occurred in cities throughout varying times in the urbanization process."

            "comments": [
                "It was great in that it discussed a lot of very contemporary phenomenon that I have witnessed in real life, but also how these trends rely on systemtic means of politicization and marginalization that have existed for a long, long time.",
                "Absolutely wonderful lectures and slides. The course was clearly very organized and Professor Barraclough was wonderful at communicating her expectations. The readings were also incredibly interesting and applied directly to what we learned in lecture.",
                "Ok first of all... biggest weakness: there is no need for these assignments to be so harshly graded. Like. How can someone do exactly what you ask them to do (look at a redlining map and describe what it says) and give them a B+? This writing class should've been designated a WR credit. \r\nAlso, the midterm was extremely long and the study guide wasn't helpful because that was harshly graded too. Like, my TA literally went over what to say for some of the terms and people still got B+ for no good reason or a really pathetic reason. \r\n\r\nstrengths: course material is super interesting and fun",
                "The lectures were engaging but the goals of the field projects were often vague and sections could have been structured differently to enhance our learning.",
                "The readings, lectures, and course concepts are interesting. The first and third field projects are also interesting and engaging. That is the end of the strengths. \r\n\r\nThe second field project is actually one of the most inane and ridiculous assignments I have had the misfortune to complete at Yale. It feels like a parody of what conservative pundits think Yale or other elite universities do in their classes. The fact that Professor Barraclough acknowledges that there have been countless complaints in the past regarding the assignment as well as the current semester but refuses to amend or remove it speaks to the nature of the course itself. She is sending out nearly 200 Yale students to take up space on the public transit system within New Haven which as we learn in class is already underfunded, poorly maintained, and a utility used by a demographic that consists of a majority of low-income people, POC, elderly people, and those with disabilites. We are expected to go out and observe the riders of public transit and of the state of the transit system itself but it is impossible to avoid feeling like it is merely an attempt in cosplaying as a poor person especially considering the radically different demographic makeup of the Yale student body compared to the riders of CT Transit. It feels gross, weird, and invasive. \r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Professor Barraclough also made incredibly insensitive comments that bordered on transphobia when she requested that in our observations students assume the gender identity of those that we saw. Along the lines of \"if they look like a woman, analyze them as a woman\" simply so we could make more general claims about those who rode the bus. This is inexcusable and just lazy teaching.'\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the midterm exam was actually ridiculous. The course staff expected FAR too much from us in the short amount of time in one class for the midterm. It was just physically unfeasible for to write fast enough to write as much as they wanted during a class period  unless you were able to read the prompt and immediately know what you would write for the next 9-12 pages, writing non-stop. It was simply unnecessary stress and unreasonable expectations. It would have made far more sense to have us narrow our focus to fewer topics and elaborate further on those.\r\n\r\nLastly, it was not made expressly clear that our final exam would consist of a 7-10 page paper until the Friday night after the deadline to change the course to credit\/D. This meant that students who suddenly learned that they did not have adequate time to prepare and write a 7-10 page paper among their other planned finals and papers were stuck with making time for the paper as well as taking the course for a letter grade. There were multiple people that I knew taking the course who would have seriously considered the credit\/D option had they known the expectations for the final exam before the deadline.",
                "Great lectures and field projects were insightful. I wish the \"final exam\" was just a end of term paper because it was basically a 10 page essay that we didn't learn about before end of the class. That would have given us more time to prepare and think and allocate time well during finals period.",
                "Strengths: The content is incredibly interesting, and the order of the material works well with history during the first half and contemporary issues during the second half.\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments were interesting, but the instructions were incredibly poorly written and often created confusion.",
                "Strength: address really important topics and is very inclusive \r\nWeakness: the grading was harsh and unclear. Even when asking for specific help, the advice was never specific and never led to a better assignment product.",
                "Professor Barraclough does a great job when lecturing material, however her course assignments are too ambiguous in what she expects from us and then when we do fulfill a prompt given we're told that we didn't include something that was asked for. I think",
                "Strengths: Dr. Barraclough is one of the BEST lecturers I have seen at Yale. Before you graduate, try to hear her speak (even just during shopping period). The content is incredibly engaging, interesting, and relevant to everyone. She doesn't present an opinion that she wants you to have; instead, she provides historical context to different situations and allows you to reach your own conclusions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't really like my TA or connect with my section. But that's a toss up, I guess",
                "A lot of work -- projects were interesting but very time consuming",
                "definitely interesting but you have to care about the material! if it is not something that is relevant to you, it is easy to feel a bit lost",
                "First, if the final exam is not an exam but a 10-page essay, that should be specified in the syllabus. I was overwhelmed with writing at the end of the term among all my classes because I was caught off guard. A middle-of-the-semester notice about the format is not sufficient either. We should know what the final will be like when we sign up for the class. Second, I appreciate the feedback on my writing, but this was not a writing course. A five-page reflection on a field project is not the same assignment as a well-crafted thesis paper. Third, I want to speak honestly about a serious qualm I had throughout the course. I have a deep moral problem pretending that I, as a white man, understand the struggles of a person of color or of a minority gender. Whenever I would make a comment expressing this concern, my TF responded that it was fine. Maybe it is. But this should be a significant point discussed in the class. Critical theory is a great tool, but I was in no way educated on how to craft a respectful and accurate narrative. All semester, I felt like I was just making things up; putting words in other people's mouths; pretending I knew what someone else's lived experience was despite the fact I had genuinely no idea beyond a 50-minute lecture.",
                "This course was incredibly misleading, and ultimately disappointing. The content that the course covers is interesting, and the lectures were clear and easy to follow. What I did not like about this course was the assignments. This class is advertised as having three field projects, a midterm exam, and a final exam. All five of these exercises were just papers. Three five page papers instead of field projects, an essay-based midterm, and the final exam was not an exam at all, but rather a 7-10 page paper. This is a ridiculous amount of writing for a 100 level lecture, and a class with a WR credit. Also, the expectations for the assignments were really unclear. There seemed to be a major disconnect in what was expected by Barraclough and what was expected by the TAs. The final paper (exam) was completely open ended, and we were given no guidance on how to approach it. I expected this course to be at a similar difficulty of other 100 level lectures, and was baffled by the poor communication and extreme levels of criticism I and other students received in response to not understanding. This is very much an introductory course, but students are not treated like beginners. Nobody I spoke to in this course had a positive experience with their communication with Barraclough, and shared similar frustrations with the structure of the course.\r\n\r\nThis course has amazing potential to be something really uplifting and informative for students, but there needs to be serious changes made to how assignment instructions are written. This class seemed to suck because of poor communication between the professor, the TAs, and the students. Or maybe it just needs a better professor.",
                "weakness: the assignments. the assignments were awful, they were essays not field projects. they expected you to somehow read their minds and understand that the way the assignment instructions were written was not actually how they wanted the essay to be written. also the \"take-home final exam\" was actually a 7-10 page paper that was announced 45 minutes after the deadline to credit\/d\/fail the class which i found to be incredible unfair. also given that this is an intro level class and i barely learned anything new in the class, the assignments were truly asking you to go above and beyond in a way that was impossible given the course material and really required a lot of outside research to get a good grade on assignments.\r\n\r\nstrengths: professor barraclough was an engaging lecturer and office hours with her were very easy to schedule",
                "The material and content was really interesting and the delivery of it through the lectures was efficient. However assignment instructions were somewhat unnecessarily lengthy and difficult to parse through. Could have benefited from more direct instructions with more clear expectations and better communication between TFs and the professor. Often we would ask TFs questions about the field projects that they could not answer.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures, material\r\nWeaknesses: discrepancies between Teaching Fellows.",
                "Discussion sections delve into the large amount of content provided in class so it can become more digestible",
                "First, I will say that the class was much harder than advertised, which I personally think was a weakness in the course. The TF's stressed high school-like criteria for writing style that detracted from the creative and critical nature of fieldwork. The \"take-home final exam\" was also a 7-10 page argumentative paper, assigned on the last day of classes. The expectations for writing and work were really not clear at many points in the course. I thought the material, both in lectures and in readings, was very interesting and well-presented. The opportunities to respectfully engage with New Haven communities and public transit were also very valuable. I think the syllabus and the content were the course's main strengths, and communication and workload were its main weaknesses.\r\n\r\nOne content-related weakness I will add is a lack of discussion about trans and nonbinary experiences in cities. For a class with \"gender\" in the name, basically all of the gender-related content was about the cisgender women's experience. I think this class could grow by including more readings and discussion on how cities reproduce the gender binary.",
                "Some good readings and lectures tended to be engaging",
                "Course was great. Good lectures, good TFs, interesting material, engaging readings.",
                "The strength of this class lies in the readings. There is a great selection of authors and the readings are very informative. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is impossible to discuss this class without critiquing the incredibly problematic aspects of the course. For one, the professor herself is a white woman whose academic interest in race stems from the fact that she went to school in a predominantly POC high school. Moreover, the assignments are incredibly problematic. One of the assignments was to get on a New Haven bus and take notes on the \"racial and socioeconomic demographic changes\" on the bus. Essentially, it required that Yale students get on a bus and treat poor people and POC living their everyday lives as lab rats. The second assignment required that we essentially take pictures of gentrification in New Haven, again having Yale students going and taking pictures of people's houses. To improve this course, I think the person teaching needs to be more cognizant of Yale's role in New Haven and more respectful of low-income and POC experiences.",
                "I loved the field assignments that got us out in New Haven and had us engage with and learn more about the urban community outside of Yale. The lectures were engaging and jam-packed with riveting information, and the course expectations were very reasonable. Professor Barraclough is extremely accommodating and genuinely interested in learning about her students, their interests, and their backgrounds. My only criticism is that the TA's had very different expectations when it came to assignments and grading, and I wish that it was more streamlined.",
                "Strengths: excellent, excellent readings; lectures were pretty good; field projects served important academic and nonacademic purposes\r\nWeaknesses: smaller discussion sections could have made for enriched student discussion and engagement with course (and other) ideas",
                "Strengths: We discuss fascinating topics about structural race, class, and gender inequalities that changed the way I view cities. Weaknesses: My TF. The workload is relatively manageable, with 3 field projects, a midterm, and a final exam. But the way my TF graded my papers was unreasonable -- instead of critiquing my overall arguments and analysis, they evaluated my English, adding comments only about missing modifiers, punctuation, etc.",
                "While the course content was intriguing, this course was falsely advertised and insufficient information about course requirements and expectations was provided at the start of the semester. The premise of some of the field projects, including the bus ride, encouraged students to invade the privacy of New Haven residents and make assumptions about their lives. It was very uncomfortable. The final exam also was not a timed test but a 7-10 page paper, which we were informed of half an hour after the Credit\/D deadline. Providing students a clear and detailed syllabus would allow students to best judge if and how they would like to take part in the course.",
                "This class had a ton of weaknesses that really made it hard to be engaged and invested in this course. \r\n- \"take-home final exam\" was NOT an exam and was instead a 7-10 page paper which should have been on the syllabus so that we could have planned accordingly.\r\n- Unreasonable expectations set by the TAs for our field projects. They graded them for our writing quality as if they were essays and this was not clear based on the actual assignments provided by the professor. Grading made it seem like it was a writing credit, but it is NOT and the TAs really did not treat it that way.\r\n- Field project 2 was framed in an incredibly problematic way - making assumptions about race, gender, and class-based on people's appearances, having 180 people ride the bus with no other options if people didn't feel comfortable (due to COVID or because of the necessity to make observations about people without their knowledge, or the premise of the assignment in and of itself)\r\n- Professor was very defensive when students had critiques of the assignment, stating that it's been done for 20 years (which does not justify anything continuing ?) and that we should all check our own privilege. \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n- I liked field project 1 because it allowed us to explore the history of our hometowns and contextualize what we see in the present.",
                "I thought this class was so good! Incredibly well structured and very accessible. One thing that I think could be improved is just adding some clarity about the final earlier in the semester. We were told that it would be a take home final, but it was announced on the last day of classes that it was actually going to be a 7-10 page paper, and this announcement was only made after the deadline had passed to credit D the class. I also was hoping to talk more about queer issues in lecture, since it really intersects with a lot of the topics we focused on. \r\n\r\nAnother area for improvement in the class I think would just be making the expectations a lot clearer for the assignments. This improved with later assignments, but receiving feedback our first assignment was really jarring because a lot of the expectations had not been included in the page-long assignment description, which I had assumed was comprehensive. It was not clear that we were going to be evaluated on the strength of our argument, since all the description said was offer a gentle thesis and that if you dont feel comfortable trying to explain the relationships between past and present, you might pose a set of questions that came up for you. For an assignment in which we were told primarily to summarize your findings and reflect on their possible meanings, it really sounded much more like a reflection than an assignment where we were expected to have a really strong argument. The assignment description also read that you are not expected to cite any sources beyond the Mapping Inequality website, so it was also kind of a shocker to find that we had been marked down for not using any outside sources? I really appreciate that it was made clear in following assignments that few ere expected to incorporate the readings, but I really wish this had been clearer for the first assignment as well.",
                "I thought the lectures were extremely engaging and enjoyed the field projects. I think that if the format of the midterm is kept the same, it should be a take-home exam instead of timed and in-person. Since the terms and questions were given out ahead of time, I basically memorized exactly what I was going to write for each term and then wrote it down as quickly as possible during the exam and still only had time to answer the minimum number of terms. Had I not essentially memorized my responses I definitely would not have had time to finish even though I understood the concepts. I think that more thoughtful and fully developed responses could be generated through a take-home exam, and memorizing my responses felt like a waste of time. Otherwise I very much enjoyed this course!",
                "I think this class's lectures were really interesting and the readings were usually very engaging and added to the material. I think most of the weaknesses of the class were logistical, which was frustrating. A lot of the ways that the professor tried to make assignments easier for us ended up  making things harder. Overall, communication of assignment expectations between the professor, TAs, and us was really poor. The professor had detailed instructions and wanted things done as assignments (which many of us also wanted) whereas the TAs expected (and graded) assignments as papers. I think having more open-ended assignments (like the actual assignment descriptions would have been helpful). Additionally, the midterm was designed to make our lives easier but it was similarly frustrating. A lot of people just chose a few terms and practiced writing prompts for those, and I didn't think my overall knowledge was really being tested. We also all ran out of time which was hard. And it was really frustrating to have written so many papers for the class and then our \"take-home final\" at the end was just a 7-10 page paper. It was a really great class and I learned a lot which was why it was so much more frustrating that assignments and logistical elements took so much of my joy away from the work.",
                "The biggest weakness is the lack of clarity between the course and sections. TFs were extremely biased in their grading, and there were no guidelines on how grading was based. Often times, it felt like an English course\/ writing credit without the benefit of earning an actual writing credit. The instructions to field projects would often say one thing and then even if executed exactly as the instructions said, TFs would take points off for the smallest reasons or say that you organized the paper wrong. The TFs genuinely made this an awful class and it would have been better without section in general.",
                "STRENGTHS: Prof. Barraclough clearly loves the material, well-curated selection of readings, nice to have a connection to New Haven \r\nWEAKNESSES: disconnect between classes and readings, \"sage on the stage\" style lectures, assignments did not have clear guidelines (obvious that Prof\/TF wanted something more complicated than what they asked for, which was frustrating)",
                "The content really is quite interesting. I definitely learned a lot and am able to better understand the physical components of cities and the implications they have for social organization. I think one of the major weaknesses is the field project assignments. At the beginning of the semester, with our first project, there was  a lot of confusion about what the assignment actually was and the structure of what we were supposed to submit. The other field projects involved us going out into different areas of New Haven to study transit mobility and gentrification, which sometimes felt a little bit strange. Like, on the bus trip, I didn't feel 100% comfortable observing passengers and intellectualizing my perception of their mobility struggles. Maybe if we were given more actual techniques for how to conduct field work in a respectful way this would have been different?",
                "I thought the strengths of the course was the in-depth dive into certain historical periods, like neoliberalism and redlining. The weaknesses I saw was how the midterm made us relate everything back to settler colonialism and radicalized capitalism. I did not think that every term in the class fit neatly into these two concepts.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very engaging, having lectures recorded allowed for flexibility, TF's and professor were available to chat often\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: expectations for writing assignments were often very unclear (ex: I didn't receive rubric for grading field projects until the 3rd one), midterm exam was really pressed for time, sometimes I felt assignments were being graded more for writing (like an English class) rather than for content",
                "Strengths - interesting course material and readings, engaging lecturer, gives a broad understanding of the different topics through different means\r\nWeaknesses - the grading and overall experience is very dependent on TF, and the Field Projects and Final Paper are somewhat difficult to do because they have little guidance",
                "Interesting assignments, good course format",
                "Strengths: the topic...I had hoped to learn so many incredible things from such a rich subject focus \r\nWeaknesses: The class' structure, format, and execution did not live up to m",

                "Strengths: kind, engaging professor, and fun field-work projects that let you apply the coursework to real-life environments. Weaknesses: the assignments were often vague, misleading, and disorganized (prompts were given out too late; grading was inconsistent between TFs; students were barely given enough time for the midterm; and the final take-home paper was not detailed AT ALL in the syllabus or in lecture-- we were told it would be two mini-essays and it ended up being a 7-8 page paper...)",
                "Professor Barraclough is an engaging professor who clearly cares deeply about the material. The lectures are informative, structured, and interesting.\r\n\r\nGrading for assignments could be clearer. Many people in my section received fairly low grades at first because we almost all misunderstood the initial assignment. Later in the course, we were given the rubric and were therefore able to better understand how to approach the assignments. Clarity from the beginning would be helpful.  There also seemed to be some disagreement between what the TFs wanted to see in papers and what Professor Barraclough wanted. Better alignment would make things less confusing.",
                "Professor (and TA) are generally unclear and uncommunicative regarding expectations for midterm\/writing assignments\/final. When it came to the final they changed the format numerous times and finally decided that the final \"exam\" would actually be a final paper. They made this change after the credit\/d\/fail deadline. Overall, the content of the class is not challenging. What makes it challenging is trying to guess what the professor (and TAs) want.",
                "The material that is covered is very interesting and Professor Barraclough is a good lecturer; however, the assignments were not explained clearly. There was a disconnect between how Professor Barraclough explained the assignment and what the TAs were expecting, and this caused some confusion when I got my grades back on these assignments because I thought that I had followed the instructions that I was given. This was a source of frustration throughout the semester because I was never really sure what my TA was expecting.",
                "The content of this course is very interesting, but seems to be missing an opportunity for deeper discussion of intersectionality. For example, in discussing the heteropatriarchy, there is essentially no discussion of transness or genderqueerness. Everything is in the context of men and women, which neglects to acknowledge the ways in which trans demographics are also not well-served within a heteropatriarchal system. The same type of nuance could be added for racial capitalism around the idea of colorism. Who is most well-served and who is least well-served by these systems? It seems to me that everything is on a spectrum, because race and gender are not binary systems; therefore, these power-based systems should not be discussed in binary language (black \/ white; men \/ women) either. Most importantly, when considering intersectionality and the ways in which the three ideologies of this course interact with each other, is seems remiss to exclude trans women of color, who are most underserved by every one of these systems shaping our society.",
                "Weaknesses: the final was announced super late and there was way more writing in this class than I originally anticipated. I ended up writing over 20 pages for a course that does not have a writing credit.\r\n\r\nStrength: the TAs seemed to care about teaching us the material and the Professor was passionate about the course.",
                "Strengths - great lectures, interesting field project, recorded lectures \r\nWeaknesses - lack of clarity around the nature of the final",
                "I have no suggestions.",
                "The main strength of this course was the clarity in its structure and schedule. The syllabus accurately described how we moved throughout the course, and all our readings were available to us from day 1. The main weakeness of this course was that for major examinations, like the midterm and the final, information was not available until about a week before the assignment was due.",
                "The organization of the course was a strong point. I think the weaknesses were the field projects, specifically the bus trip project. I think that project should be rewritten with the concerns of students from the New Haven area prioritized, as they feel like this project judges them unfairly for the benefit of their wealthier classmates. I know this by talking to students of this perspective, and I think Professor Barraclough should do the same.",
                "Strengths: well organized, Barraclough is an engaging professor, readings and lectures connected and enhanced each other, I appreciated Barracloughs willingness to record her lectures and, when she was sick, to conduct a virtual class. \r\nWeaknesses: Assigning a 7-10 page paper as a final exam 1.5 weeks before the due date kind of sucks for all parties involved.  To be clear, Im fine with 7-10 page papers AS LONG AS the professor is honest that that is what it is BEFORE reading period\/last week of classes.",
                "I loved this course. I loved that the lectures were recorded, the readings were substantial and meaningful to the course content, and the assignments invited us to go beyond a traditional scope. I think a major way this class could have been improved, and this could have been specific to this go around, is that the grading was so much more focused on the structure of our writing (i.e. topic sentences) as opposed to the content of our writing. This class is not a writing credit or an English class and should not be treated as such.",
                "Lectures and slides were quite unorganized",
                "I really enjoyed our in-class lectures - I felt that Professor Barraclough did a good job of explaining complex concepts and providing illustrative examples in relatively short amounts of time and without condescending to the class. The course syllabus was also great, with a variety of sources and source types to read for section and three field projects that connected the course material to the New Haven context.\r\nOne area that I think could be improved is the guidelines\/instructions for preparing for section and completing field projects. It was not totally clear to me what form the field projects were supposed to take, and my classmates and I sometimes got conflicting feedback on assignments (e.g. whether the field projects should be more fluid\/narrative or more segmented\/scientific). In the future, it might be helpful to provide rubrics and example papers before the very first assignment and coordinate between TFs as to what the expectations will be for assignments and discussion section formats.",
                "Lectures were interesting, and I appreciated the flexibility of courses being recorded.  I wish there has been more clarity on assignment expectations, particularly the first redlining paper. The prompt presented the assignment as very matter-of-fact, separating evidence from analysis, but then grades were knocked for following this set up and not integrating analysis with evidence. Similarly, I wish the format of the final had been more clear earlier on. as it was repeatedly referred to as a take home final, I had planned to study for something similar to the midterm when planning for reading week, only to find out after the deadline to drop the class that it would be a 7-10 page paper, which for me takes a lot more time. I think this is perfectly reasonable as a final assignment for the class, just wish it had been presented as a final paper and not a \"take-home final\"",
                "The lectures are very strong and well-prepared. I entered each one excited to learn and exited with new or reassessed knowledge. The readings could be more diverse and could address focuses on more cities, to personalize it for students across the United States and make them more excited to read and learn about their homes. The biggest weakness is the assignments. They are presented far differently on syllabus and in instructions than how they are assessed -- we are told to write reports, but are graded as though we wrote stories\/essays. The final exam was also an essay, not a test.",
                "Was a good class overall. Could have been more intersectional or perhaps had guest speakers. Specifically more on LGBTQ issues would have been appreciated, as well as speakers on issues like environmental racism, especially from New Haven.",
                "The lecture content was amazing! I thought so deeply about everything we learned! But expectations for the assignments were unclear, and I felt like I didn't get as much out of the assignments as I could have. I'm not sure how this could be improved, but it seemed that there was something I was missing from the learning experience. Section felt like we were just going through the motions, wasting as much time as possible talking about *how* the course worked (which is fair, because we had a lot of questions about what was expected from us) but never having discussions that matched how impactful the lectures were. The content of this course was fantastic. The reading load was manageable but also substantive, probably the best reading load of any of my courses this semester. But the assignments and section made me feel like I only understood 70% of what was happening and I actually attended all the lectures in person and did all the readings. I put a lot of effort into this course but it wasn't a fulfilling learning experience.",
                "I enjoyed how this course went chronologically through American history. I also enjoyed how those focus on resistance against hetero patriarchy settler colonialism and racial capitalism.",
                "Professor Barraclough is a great lecturer, mentor, and person, and she organized the course really well (the lectures, readings, and assignments were all clearly connected and well-sequenced).  I enjoyed all of the field projects a lot  I wish there were a bit more leeway on the page count, though, because I found that I couldn't answer some of the prompts robustly or responsibly within the page limit (I opted to just write my papers the way I felt best about them and take the grade penalty for going over the page count, but it was kind of annoying to be penalized for doing my best to answer a question well).  The only real weakness in my opinion was section  the section for this course felt like a complete waste of time and was consistently the hour of my week that I dreaded most.  I don't know if it was just my section in particular that was this way, but maybe giving TFs more direction or structure would be helpful.",
                "This course was well organized and topics of the class were interesting, but workload was much different than advertised. The take home final exam ended up being a 7-10 page paper due at the end of finals period, which was only communicated to us right before reading period.",
                "I think there should have been a class or a discussion section on how to approach field projects as Yale students and as students from varying backgrounds - a class on the paternalism in academia, the roots of anthropology, etc. It shouldn't have been assumed that all students know how to respectfully approach field projects, and our own privilege and possible \"lab-experimentlike\" approaches should be unpacked as a part of the class as well. I appreciated the variety of resources that were given to us, especially the films.",
                "The strengths of this course were that there were moderately engaging lectures towards the beginning of the semester and some interesting readings. \r\nThe expectations for the assignments in this course were incredibly unclear and at times unfair which was a major weakness. Oftentimes, one thing would be written on the assignment and then the grades\/feedback would reflect an altered expectation that was not clearly communicated. It was often unclear the extent to which we were expected to draw from course material and or outside sources, and balance that with personal reflection. The midterm exam was structured in a way that made it extremely difficult to actually show an understanding of a topic because the time we had to complete a large amount of writing was quite short. We were asked to write on a topic and show our understanding and also bring in course readings, and connections to larger issues for at least 6 topics in under 50 minutes, which left little time to organize thoughts and plan a response, even if we did know a considerable amount about the topic. Finally, the syllabus was incredibly unclear about the nature of the final for this class, and made it seem like it was going to be an exam i.e. NOT a paper\/essay. It was labelled as take-home. In the last week of class we were informed that the final was indeed a longer form writing assignment, and we were first told that it would be two essay questions each a few pages long. The final prompt was not released until the evening of the last day of class, after the Credit D deadline, where we were informed that it would be one 7-10 page essay. I felt completely blindsided by this announcement because no where in the syllabus had it ever said we would have a final paper. By releasing it during reading period essentially, it also left little time to plan out a well developed response because by that time I was already busy completing other final assignments. I think that the final either should have been released well in advance, or at least the format of the final should have been a LOT more clear from the beginning. Additionally, the excuse for waiting to post the prompt was to wait and make sure that the final only asked about material we covered in class. However, the prompt was so vague it would not have made a difference if it was released a week earlier, and we had more time to plan.  \r\nAnother of this courses main weakness stems from the fact that a critical intersectional viewpoint or approach was often disregarded for simplicitys sake which really made the class feel pointless a lot of the time. For example, during our bus field project, we were asked to just put aside the fact that peoples experience and identity around gender is not something we can assume from their physical presentations. Instead we were asked to make assumptions about peoples race, class, gender, and identity based on solely observations of them during a short time period, and then draw larger conclusions about the bus system. Overall, this project was a negative experience and did not contribute to my overall understandings of the bus system or peoples experiences. I think this project should be removed from the class. Additionally, in lecture, we had few discussions about gender that acknowledged trans experiences and the non-binary nature of gender. Additionally, our discussions of sexuality in lecture really only went as far as talking about middle and upper class gay men and their role in gentrification. I think there are many interesting histories of queerness that tie into the topics we discussed but we largely did not talk about them. \r\nThe documentary we watched about gentrification also seemed slightly outdated and the fact that it was made by a a white woman in Brooklyn was slightly odd, I feel like there are more important perspectives we could have watched\/read about too."

I really don't know what it was about this course, but it really burnt me out intellectually, and not because the topics were difficult to grasp. If I had to take a guess, I would say it was because of the field projects. I really felt like the second and third field projects did not help me grasp the course material better.",
                "I would but also with caution. Like, this course is so amazing and interesting but the grading and AMOUNT OF WRITING with NO WR credit (like over 30 pages of writing) is just not worth it. It is impossible to get an A. Like, I literally slaved away at writing a paper worth 15% of my grade and my TA was even like \"wow you blew me away and this goes above and beyond\" and she didn't give me the full 15\/15 points like. Isn't an A supposed to be above and beyond? Idk maybe I haven't faced failure before but this hits different like. I've never been given such positive feedback and still gotten a grade I wasn't happy with. This class is absolutely not a gut but it is really interesting if you're interested in cities and urbanism (which I was, thankfully). \r\n\r\nAlso, on the last day, Dr. B was like \"Oh I haven't even written the final exam yet because I want to make sure it encapsulates every element of the course\" and...

This is a class that encompasses a lot of information into one, so you don't need to take several classes to gain the information that she shares. Through this class, you'll learn all about how American space and history has shaped racial, class, and gender disparities that exist today. You'll learn about the underpinnings of systemic racism, grasp how sexism has created gaps in what women are able to accomplish, and understand how class and race are deeply intertwined. You'll develop a new language about how to speak about these things, so that you can go out and talk about them with other people and engage in real conversations with the context necessary to develop your own opinions. The workload is very low yet extremely rewarding. The assignments from this class are by far my favorite that I've done at Yale, and I gained experiences and insight that go well beyond the academic aspect of assignments.

                "I would recommend this course, but with some caveats. I am a senior social science major, who is fairly well-versed in ideas of heteropatriarchy and racial capitalism, so I figured this class would be an easy fifth class. It was not, especially because the expectations for writing what were presented as \"summary and reflection papers\" were similar to an AP language class or an intro history writing credit. The three \"field projects\" were essentially 5 page research papers, and the \"final exam\" was a ten-page research paper (using only course materials). In general, though, if you are writing a thesis on something relating to geography or structural inequality in the US, I would recommend taking this course for exposure to urban studies scholarship.",
                "The syllabus said we would have a final exam. Instead, we wrote a final long essay on top of three other essays we wrote for the class. The midterm was very hard. We barely had enough time to complete the assignment.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you want to reshape the way you interact with American cities, take this course. Provides great detail and a great overview of American cities and injustices within them. Highly recommend the course, Professor Barraclough is great, too.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student. The entire course feels very white savior complex-y.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a broad American Studies class and want to learn about the histories of modern inequalities in American cities. However, your experience with the class will really depend on your TF.",
                "The content of this class was interesting, but honestly if it continues to be structured this way I wouldn't recommend it.",
                "Yes! I thought this was a great class and definitely good for anyone interested in learning more about cities.",
                "Yes, I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about New Haven as well as my home city, and I would recommend this course to anyone.",
                "I would recommend it with the extreme caveats of the miscommunications of assignments and expectations. I loved what I learned but as I explained above, it was really draining to be worrying so much about the writing details of the assignments (especially since different TAs graded very differently). The reading workload was also very high for an intro lecture class.",
                "Honestly no, not unless they get better TAs and create actual guidelines that they must stick to when grading.",
                "Yes! This is a great course to get an introduction to urban studies and learn more about the history behind many of the inequalities that affect our cities today.",
                "No... I would only recommend this course if you are planning to audit or Credit\/D. The lectures are interesting (in a TEDTalk kind of way), but are theory-heavy, so can end up feeling a bit empty. Additionally, the assignments are deceptively time-consuming and graded more stringently than you might expect. I learned some interesting things from this class (a few of the readings will definitely stick with me), but it was ultimately more stressful than gratifying. Unless you need this class, continue shopping.",
                "The content really is very interesting and made me think about cities in a new, deeper way. The assignments are strange, though.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because for the first time in my life I am able to understand systematic racism. I knew it existed but I was unclear exactly where it started or what key example were. This course does a great job taking students step by step through America's history to demonstrate how injustice after injustice creates disparities for generations.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning more about the socioeconomic challenges faced by populations in American cities in current day. However, I would be aware that this course is very much an ER&M class.",
                "I would recommend it as a good background to understanding urban patterns and the intentionality that has gone into creating urban inequality. I think overall, if you have had accurate historical lessons on slavery, colonization etc in high school, especially if you are a person of color, you are likely to know a lot of what is being talked about. However, the readings and lectures give a lot more concrete knowledge and numbers that I found very helpful and the lectures on environmental inequality and gentrification were the strongest in my opinion and cleared up misconceptions. I think finding friends in sections and doing office hours with your TA would be the most helpful, because a lot of the instruction for the papers is somewhat vague, but overall it is a good class.",
                "Yes, the content is cool and assignments are fairly flexible to promote research into student interests",
                "This course isn't a gut. There are quite a few essays (3-5 pgs) throughout the semester, in addition to an in-person midterm I spent days studying for as well as a final paper. However, it isn't a horribly stressful, difficult class. The midterm was the only assignment that was actually timed, you can skim the readings and still make meaningful contributions during the discussion sections, and all lectures were recorded and uploaded to Canvas to improve accessibility. So, if you're looking for a class where you'll get familiar with the terms racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, imperial domesticity, and settler colonialism, then you should take it. As an ER&M major, I learned quite a bit and feel more confident having discussions surrounding these topics in the future.",
                "No, it was *very* disappointing. The grading structure was frustrating (expectations were not well communicated... ie the assignment would say one thing and the comments would criticize completely unrelated things). The class would better be structured as a semi-colloquium with more guest speakers because the slide decks don't do the topics covered justice. The final exam was not an exam but a 7-10 page paper.... yet the class is not a writing credit. Overall, I got very little out of this class and it was not worth 1\/36th of my Yale education.",
                "Honestly, no. The content is really interesting and Prof Barraclough is an engaging lecturer, but the assignments are confusing and come every few weeks in the semester making it a fast-paced lecture course. Assignments don't super closely relate to the readings or lectures so you'll be doing a lot of extra work outside of class to complete them and the grading is pretty hardespecially for an intro lecture. My biggest qualm with this class was that the syllabus didn't give any information on the final exam except that it was take-home. The midterm was a timed short-answer exam, the final was expected to be more of the same. 10 days before the \"take-home final\" was due, Prof Barraclough announced that it was an 8-10 page paper, which is something that should be in the original syllabus so students can decide if they have the capacity to take the class or not... not something you spring on students right before reading period.",
                "Yes BUT only if you know what you're getting yourself into. The course material was fascinating and incredibly important in understanding contemporary urban inequalities-- transit inequality, gentrification, and the legacies of redlining, white flight, and deindustrialization. I especially loved reading the scholarship about these topics, and I learned so much! BUT... there are some cons to this course: the assignments were often vague, misleading, and disorganized (prompts were given out too late; grading was inconsistent between TFs; students were barely given enough time for the midterm; and the final take-home paper was not detailed AT ALL in the syllabus or in lecture-- we were told it would be two mini-essays and it ended up being a 7-8 page paper...) The reading can really pile up s",
                "I would recommend this course to an underclassman interested in getting a broad overview of core concepts related to race, class, and gender. There is not a ton of depth and we move through concepts quite quickly, so upperclassmen with previous background knowledge will not get much out of the course.",
                "I do recommend this course to Yale students, because I learned so much about New Haven and learned to appreciate the city more and the residents living in it. I also learned a lot about the persistent racism still in the world, country, state, and cities that we live in. I liked how much we learned about cities as well, and the terror of them, as well as the beauty that comes with each.",
                "I would recommend this course because the material is so interesting, but I think that the explanation of assignments needs to be better.",
                "While I appreciated the core concepts of this course, I hesitate to recommend it to other students. This is in part because of my statements above on weaknesses (the material lacks nuance and intersectionality). Additionally, this course is far more work than would be indicated by the syllabus. The field projects seemed as if they were intended to be casual assignments when spoken about by the professor, but the teaching fellows seemed to expect polished papers. Furthermore, the syllabus lists a take-home exam as the final assignment. This take-home exam was in no way an exam, but rather a final paper that was assigned on the very last day of classes, after the Credit\/D\/Fail deadline. Perhaps if the workload and expectations were more transparent, and if there was improved and deeper discussion on intersectional identities, I would be more likely to recommend the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the history of cities and how those histories affect those who are marginalized along the lines of race, class and gender. I think the course covers a wide range of topics (transit, gentrification, neoliberalism), and gives you a language to use to understand urban policy and urban issues. However, the instructor was very vague about the final, only to find out that it was a 7-10 page right at the start of reading period. Thats my biggest gripe about the class.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student.  The structure of the course is very manageable and the instructor is great at connecting theories to real-world situations and immersing her students in the lesson.",
                "If you're looking for a broad overview of historical and modern racial dynamics in urban spaces and do not yet have knowledge of these then yes. The lectures are organized, easy to digest, and quite informative. A good introductory course.",
                "If you're interested in studying the American city and its contemporary manifestations in any capacity, this course is a must-take. The course's interdisciplinary nature, two-part structure explaininig history and present-day effects of such history, and all our readings provided a diverse and deep understanding of how the city is now and where it might be going in the future.",
                "I would recommend this class, as long as you know it probably won't feel like a gut class. I don't think it's a gut because the expectations can be unclear which is just frustrating when you're doing assignments that should be straightforward. Also, the material is kinda obvious at some points (i.e. racism exists and is bad), so some classes are way more interesting in others. But past that, it's a pretty interesting overview that definitely changed how I view the built environment around me.",
                "Yes with a caveat. Yes because I genuinely believe the material is important and the lectures are incredibly engaging, BUT it is writing intensive and there is a chance you will have to write a 7-10 page paper with less than two weeks notice :)",
                "Yes - this class has opened my eyes up to a lot of unequal structures that exist in American society. Prof. Barraclough creates an atmosphere of inquisitiveness and open mindedness - if you have a question she is happy to answer it and also share it with the class. The structure of sections has also allowed for such open forums of discussion.",
                "Yes. A really interesting way to see how our lived environment has been shaped by contemporary and historical processes.",
                "No",
                "I am a bit conflicted on whether to recommend this course to others. On the one hand, I learned a lot and feel that Professor Barraclough and my teaching fellow were great resources and very knowledgable about the subject matter. On the other hand, I often felt confused about how to complete the assignments, a sentiment that was shared amongst many of the classmates I spoke with. If you want a thorough and intersectional survey course on urban studies, this course might be for you - you'll just have to be willing to ask for help and guidance.",
                "Yes, Professor Barraclough is an excellent lecturer. This course also allowed students to assess their own home cities for themes of gentrification, look at their histories, and evaluate how historical processes impact the present city they live in.",
                "Yes, if it maybe had the changes I suggested.",
                "Yes, I found this class Both engaging and informative. I thought it gives incredible context into social justice initiatives today and I felt that background was very helpful.",
                "Definitely  I think the course is a necessity for people in majors like Urban Studies and American Studies.  It's so important to understand the history of U.S. cities through the lenses of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy, and it would be almost irresponsible to not take a course that examines the history of urbanism in that way.",
                "I would recommend this course if the transit inequality assignment was changed. It felt invasive for me to be a part of the 150 students from the class taking up space on the city's bus system to study people and make assumptions about their socioeconomic status and how they are using the bus system for a grade. As Yale students riding the bus for an assignment, we are took up space IN A PANDEMIC, made judgements and assumptions about people, and then left to never engage with the space again. The assignment is even more questionable in my opinion when considering that we are calling out the city of New Haven for contributing to transit inequality but not doing anything to change transit inequity in New Haven or at the very least directed to support existing projects in New Haven that are working to solve transit inequity. We criticized the ways that New Haven buses are set up without actively questioning how Yales relationship to the city of New Haven is a direct cause of the lack of funds that limit bus accessibility for those who depend on public transit,. Yales monetary contributions to New Haven compared to how much it should give in taxes is a huge revenue stream that, if given to the city, could provide necessary funds for New Haven transit to become equitable. I wish that these connections were considered more when making the bus transit assignment. I enjoyed the other two field projects and learned a lot from them, but the transit inequality field project needs to be changed in my opinion.",
                "Good introduction to the social and spatial production of race, class, and gender inequalities, and how they were built through the interaction of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy. I think there should have been a class or a discussion section on how to approach field projects as Yale students and as students from varying backgrounds - a class on the paternalism in academia, the roots of anthropology, etc. It shouldn't have been assumed that all students know how to respectfully approach field projects, and our own privilege and possible \"lab-experimentlike\" approaches should be unpacked as a part of the class as well. I appreciated the variety of resources that were given to us, especially the films.",
                "I would not recommend this course to to another student unless there are SIGNIFICANT changes made to the syllabus which seems unlikely. There are so many other classes surrounding similar topics that do a much better job. Overall, this course was not organized well to facilitate student learning and engagement. The topic was interesting but the execution of the class made the work feel unbearable."
