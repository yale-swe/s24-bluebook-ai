                "I became acquainted with the genre of cultural criticism, having received the opportunity through this course to read for the first time authors like Joan Didion, Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and Ariel Levy. I also learned how to write more concisely while incorporating advanced writing techniques that we gave a name to in this course.",
                "This course teaches you how to identify cultural narratives and question them, and ask what their existence says about us, what we value, how our brains work, etc. It also exposes you to a wide range of essays that do this using different strategies.",
                "I learned how to say more with less. I became aware of beautiful essay writers. I also learned how to exaggerate in a tasteful way, and improve my writing overall.",
                "I developed a better understanding of what a cultural critique is, how to write one, how to refine a writing voice, and how to better workshop peers' writing.",
                "In this course, I refined my knowledge of the essay and essay-writing in general. The specific form I became more skilled in was the cultural critique. By the end of the course, I felt more assured in my ability to understand what counted as cultural critique, utilize the specific techniques cultural critics often use, and be more careful with my writing and the arguments I made therein.",
                "You learn to think about stories you tell yourself and highlight assumptions you may not have questioned before, and then write about it in a way that engages to reader to think. This is not a class about the op ed that focuses on providing solutions or strong stances."

                "Professor Shirkhani is the course's biggest strength.",
                "The readings on the syllabus were excellent: they were diverse and interesting in subject matter, and pleasurable to read in terms of writing style. I also appreciated how much opportunity we received for writing feedback. I loved that Professor Shirkhani read first drafts and provided feedback on our essays. This encouraged me to experiment with my essays. Additionally, I liked the peer critique and workshop format for essays, which provided further opportunity for essay feedback. \r\n\r\nNo weaknessesexcellent course!",
                "A strength is how amazing class discussions were, how wide ranging the essays we read are, and how much amazing feedback we get on our writing as we go along. I also love the shorter exercises that serve as practice along the way, and workshops with other students in the class were so helpful for essay editing. I can't think of what could be improved.",
                "I loved the structure of the workshops, the class discussions, and assignments. The papers both had a good amount of structure while also allowing us to explore more creatively.",
                "The strengths of this course include Professor Shirkhani herself, who always allowed our conversations to go deeper and become more nuanced, the readings that we read and learned from, and the format of the workshops. A weakness of this course is that I think we could write more and perhaps write more varied assignments.",
                "I felt like readings were kind of awkward. Sometimes they included forms of writing we should employ and some we shouldnt however delineation were never quite clear",
                "My favorite days were the workshop days where we commented on each other's pieces in small groups because that allowed for a lot more conversation."

                "Excellent courseone of my favorites and I recommend it to any student without hesitation. The course was carefully designed and conducive to students improvement in nonfiction writing. It has been very rewarding to learn how to read and write cultural criticism with Professor Shirkhani.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in non fiction creative writing, or anyone who wants to be introduced to basic strategies for writing about society and personal experience. I would say the skills in this course are very transferrable, whether you want to pursue more writing at Yale or not.",
                "Yes if you want to improve your writing and expose yourself to the best writers then take this course.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who really wants to get better at learning about and making cultural critiques and wants to just have more time and space to refine their essay-writing skills.",
                "No. I felt like feedback was never quite actionable and sometimes very confusing. Often feedback was contradictory to the model essays we were given or professor shirkhani contradicted previous things she said",
                "YES -- I would recommend any course with Kimberly Shirkhani! If you are interested in the topic\/style of cultural critique, then Shirkhani is the BEST at teaching it!  She is someone who knows how to teach this sort of class. Professor Shirkhani offered office hours every morning before class, provided thoughtful feedback and line edits to every draft and essay, and is just an incredibly smart and kind person who made me look forward to class every time. Professor would have long conversations about my essay ideas where she would listen to me ramble on and on because I never knew exactly what I wanted to write about until she, who I think now knows me better as a writer than I do, suggested a direction I go that excited me (that I would never have come up with myself). I am now unsure of what I would do without her."
