                "Critical thinking, reading, super clear and concise writing. Thinking about abstract themes through the lens of history.",
                "All of them.",
                "Yes, you do learn history in this course. I've learned a lot about early 19th-century Russia (mainly through War and Peace) and the Cold War. But that's not the focus of this course. The course is meant to challenge your thinking about history. Through working with archives, great books, and classics, this course made me fall in love with the discipline.",
                "This class taught me about the challenges of writing history and the different methods of telling history. We discussed the flaws in archives, the intersections between history and science, and connections between history and morality. In this course we read literature, watched clips of movies, and looked at scientific phenomena which taught us the value of understanding other subjects when writing history.",
                "Critical thinking, importance of interconnectedness of history, writing skills",
                "This course completely changed the way I think about history - particularly in how it is conducted and how our understanding of it is flawed.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of history through this course, and even decided to become a history major because of it. It is hard to be more specific than that; What History Teaches rarely provides concrete takeaways, usually instead leaving students with a sense of awe and excitement and a feeling of greater understanding of the world. I personally came out of the class fascinated by the convergence of chaos theory and history.",
                "I learned to think critically and creatively about the importance of history, as well as its limitations, and about the role of the historian. The assigned readings and discussions held in this course were very intellectually challenging and pushed me to think more deeply about history than I ever have before. Through this course, I also became a better writer. Professor Gaddis chose really open-ended essay prompts that seemed rather daunting to tackle, but they pushed me to write imaginatively and develop my writing skills. This course additionally emphasized the importance of being a generalist, having knowledge about many different disciplines, and not sticking to a super specialized path in life. I really appreciated this message, as someone who is interested in many different areas of study and isn't sure what they want to major in, much less do beyond college.",
                "I learned how to think in abstract terms about history along the axes of space and time. The professor used metaphors of maps, fractals and animals to help make ideas more concrete.  I would not say I developed too many particular skills, but I did gain some insight on historical philosophy and how different types of work (archival work, fiction, music, math) can contribute to our understanding of history.",
                "It's hard to pin down exactly what I gained from this course, and that's probably by design. Professor Gaddis teaches new ways of thinking about the world and the past through the medium of an exceptional range of readings. You won't learn about one history in particular, and you won't read only one kind of book. You'll instead be treated to the probing questions, remarkable thought process, and wonderfully disjoint interests of a most wonderful historian.",
                "Better writing skills and analytical skills.",
                "As many other reviews allude to, it's hard to pinpoint a specific skill or insight you learn from this course. As soon as you think there's a takeaway from the class, Professor Gaddis will introduce a completely new idea about, well, what history teaches. Most of the specific history you'll learn mirrors the readings: Herodotus and Thucydides, Churchill in WW2, the Cold War, and of course, Napoleon's invasion of Russia. However, it's the big-picture insights that you will take away most from this course: \"power-law relationships\" in history, self similarity across scale, the \"Malkovich maneuver,\" gold-digging ants, and many more classic Gaddis insights."

            "comments": [
                "Reading a lot of interesting texts that I would've never read. Made me a better writer. Discussions with Prof. Gaddis were really engagin.",
                "Absolutely amazing course. Not sure it could be improved much. Maybe some colloquia or field trips.",
                "Strength: Professor Gaddis is legendary. His insights and stories make for wonderful discussions. Also, you'll quickly notice his humor and wit. Much of the reading is rewarding (and some have barely anything to do with history; they will still change your thinking). The assignments were all thought provocative. Being in the same room as him is a privilege.\r\n\r\nWeakness: There really isn't any. You just have to be ready for doing the work.",
                "The professor is very passionate about teaching the class. The course discusses bigger philosophical questions about what is history, which are not typically addressed in history classes. Because of the focus on methodology, you do not learn much about any historical period in great depth. Many of the assignments are very open and include creative writing, which can be difficult for people who prefer standard history writing. A weakness of the course is that it is focuses almost completely on the Western canon. I also think that the inclusion of critical theory would have added a lot to our discussions. For example, although we discuss limitations of archives, we barely touch on the race, class, and gender biases of archives. I think that scholarship on critical fabulation would have deepened our discussions of archives.",
                "Strengths -- really engaging conversations, creative essay topics \r\nWeaknesses -- there was so much reading that you did not have the time to fully engage with each one. Felt like reading load was quantity focused over quality.",
                "I love the seminar format - each class is a dynamic and intellectually stimulating journey, starting from an initial idea and evolving based on the contributions of students. Professor Gaddis masterfully guides these discussions, and we are able to have conversations about particularly complex concepts. The only issue I have with the course is the workload!",
                "This class may prove to have been my best at Yale by the time I graduate. It made me excited to discuss history and to simply hear Professor Gaddis's insights and anecdotes, and it fulfilled its secondary role, being a fall first year seminar, of creating a new community of first year students. My one recommendation would be to provide more clear feedback on work. The gender split was also heavily skewed male, but I don't know how that could be fixed.",
                "Strengths: the reading list!!! There are so many readings assigned for this course, but they are all amazing and worth the time spent. Reading War and Peace was a particular highlight, especially since Professor Gaddis is so passionate about Tolstoy. The small class size is another strength - it allowed us to get really deep into intellectually challenging discussions. Of course, the biggest strength is Professor Gaddis himself. There's so much to learn from him, and our class also enjoyed getting to hear about his personal life, hometown, how he got into history etc.\r\nWeaknesses: Our in-class discussions, while always engaging, were not always related to the readings we prepared. Often times I came into class with many thoughts on the readings, but then the conversation centered around something different and I wasn't completely sure what to contribute to the discussion. I also wish I had received more in-depth feedback on the writing assignments.",
                "Strengths: professor Gaddis is an interesting person with decades of experience and wisdom under his belt.\r\nWeaknesses: discussions felt meandering and largely pointless. They added little to the content introduced in the (hefty) readings.",
                "This course is fantastic! I wish Professor Gaddis would push a little harder for more engagement with his questions, though they are admittedly super hard to answer. I always thought the best classes were the ones where there was lots of back-and-forth.",
                "Strengths - great readings, interesting papers. \r\nWeaknesses - too much reading so that students do not complete all of it and so class discussions are not worth the long readings. Class discussion have lots of long often irrelevant tangents.",
                "The reading list is interesting, but you take this class for one reason: Professor Gaddis. The highlights of every class are his stories and insights, which often caused me to think a lot more deeply about some topic. However, because of this, class discussions are often pretty disconnected from the readings, which can make the very intense reading load even more difficult to slog through."

                "Absolutely. I would argue this is the best seminar you can take as a freshman. People have dropped DS for this, and said it was worth it. If you're looking for an easy gut class, look elsewhere.",
                "I would recommend the course to a student interested in the philosophy of history and the intersections of history with literature and science. The class also pushes your writing skills. However, this class is not necessarily well suited for people who dislike creative writing or want to learn about specific periods or historical figures in-depth. The course is heavily focused on the US and Europe, which is another consideration to take into account when deciding whether to enroll.",
                "Yes, this is an awesome first seminar class to introduce you to Yale classes.",
                "Yes, definitely - the course will alter your perception of history itself!",
                "Yes. Only take the course, however, if you will give it your full effort and attention; there will be a lot of work and a long waitlist. I barely took notes; What History Teaches is far more about intellectual development than learning concrete historical facts or methods.",
                "Yes 100% take this class!! This was probably the most difficult course I took all semester, not only due to the heavy reading workload, but also because of the intellectual challenge of our discussions. I worried a lot about what comments to contribute to discussion and about sounding \"smart\" in seminars, but I'm glad this course pushed me to think so deeply about topics ranging from philosophy, science, social science, politics, and of course history. This class was 100% worth the workload and stress. It's one of those courses that epitomizes why people want to come to a place like Yale - to read an array of such great works of literature, to have incredibly thought-provoking discussions, and to be taught by an amazing, acclaimed professor.",
                "Only if you genuinely care about historical philosophy. Don't just take it causr it's a first year seminar with a famous professor.",
                "Yes! Are you a student? You should take this course! Unless you hate reading. There's a lot of reading in this class, and though you can get away with not doing most of it, the reading is the point, and the class will be way more rewarding the more you do. So yes, take this class, and get ready to read.",
                "Definitely. This class was a true intellectual experience and exactly what I hoped I would find when I came to Yale. Yes, the workload of this class is very high, bordering on ridiculous at times. You will read the entirety of War and Peace over 3 class periods, and some classes require multiple books' worth of reading (not to mention that many readings are incredibly dense and difficult to read). While you only need to write four five-page essays, the prompts require a lot of creativity, and Professor Gaddis's high standard for writing quality means that you will probably spend hours writing and revising each one. However, if you're willing to do the work, you will get an incredible amount out of this classfrom neat historical tidbits to fundamental lessons about how history works. Don't be turned away by Professor Gaddis's legendary status; he is actually very approachable, and the class dinner we had with him was a highlight of the semester. If you get in, take ityou will be glad you did after the semester."
