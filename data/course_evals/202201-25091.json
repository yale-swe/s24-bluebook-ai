I loved how the class had a mixture of first years, upperclassmen, and grad students - this was a different dynamic to my other classes and was useful this year to outside of class develop relationships with people I would otherwise not have.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Inevitably the sheer amount of work is sometimes overwhelming, especially when an oral presentation and a chapter exam on the same week. Additionally, I wish we had access to the slides we saw in class alongside the general presentation slides - this would have helped reviewing for exams a lot."
