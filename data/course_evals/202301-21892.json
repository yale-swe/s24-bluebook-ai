                "Studying historical moments from a strategic perspective. Skills wise, getting to collaborate with an academically-diverse body of students.",
                "I gained a basic understanding of various historical episodes relating to power and the state. Additionally, I learned to analyze the decision making of leaders, integrating the economic, political, and social context in which they made important choices.",
                "GS is an incredible course in that it gives you a framework to think strategically about both the world and yourself. How do you accomplish long-term change while thinking about short-term objectives? How do personal convictions and ideologies influence our thinking, for better or worse? Overall, grand strategy taught me that it's important how we come to certain decisions, not just what we do.",
                "I learned a lot about individual historical cases and analyzing general themes (ie the larger idea of grand strategy). I worked on my analytical skills and covering new topics quickly.",
                "The course in Grand Strategy (Part I) allowed me to deep-dive into the question of what 'grand strategy' is, and do so through the lens of historical cases. Through this class, I thus simultaneously worked towards answering this overarching question (though whether there truly is a definite answer to the definition of Grand Strategy, I'm still not sure) as well as obtain an overview and insight into a number of historical events and figures. The class allowed me to develop my writing skills - but most importantly, allowed me to develop skills of critical analysis and strategic thinking. In the class, we were encouraged to put ourselves in the place of strategic thinkers and consider what we would do, and I learnt a lot from that exercise over the course of the semester.",
                "This course is unlike any I've been in at Yale and yet it is also the most \"Yale\" course I've taken. It challenges you to think and write in new ways, and empowers you to speak on global challenges (both past and present) in a way that is practical, solutions-oriented, and critical which was incredibly rewarding."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I appreciated that it was split up into two class sessions per week, which allowed for more discussion. The format of having case studies followed by a strategist was also productive.\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice for the course to have more content on social movements, especially because GS is often advertised to be very inclusive of students interested in social change. Social movements were really only covered in the last two weeks of class.",
                "The strengths of Grand Strategy are the incredible professors, students, and guest speakers that motivate a high level of engagement. The weakness is the lack of agreement on what Grand Strategy actually is - at times the class felt like a general overview history course.",
                "The biggest strength of the class is the cohort. They do a great job of selecting highly insightful individuals who are always willing to make thoughtful comments in class. It's a class that is highly dependent on student engagement and contributions with the professors only guiding the direction of the conversation, so having a good group of people makes the class super enjoyable. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness has to do with some of the class structures. The week is basically divided between a specific case in grand strategy for the first class, and a discussion of specific strategists for the second class. Sometimes the case and the strategists in a week were only tangentially related, making it difficult or even unproductive to make connections between them. The discussions in those weeks felt disjointed.",
                "Strengths: comprehensive programming outside of class, fantastic opportunities (travel grant for research!), more class bonding than average courses, great professors, interesting cases, manageable workload - overall challenging & interesting \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes expectations were a bit unclear, occasionally topics/cases needed more background, wish sometimes more info from professors in class (less full seminar), I did not always know how I was doing mid-course",
                "There are so many strengths to this class : the faculty, the extra-curricular opportunities associated with the class, its structured nature and the support you receive... the list goes on. It also goes without saying that the content and questions considered in Grand Strategy are some of the most interesting I've encountered during all my time at Yale.",
                "I think the case studies could be further diversified, as could the strategists examined in association with each case."

                "Take it if you're interested in the subject material on the syllabus. You'll probably thrive in this space if your academic focus is on great power competition, war-making, and state-building. If you're interested in grassroots movements and social change, don't expect to have much of this covered in this course.",
                "Yes, it is a privilege to take the course, but it requires a high level of commitment.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! Grand Strategy as a class is exactly the type of collegial, Socratic seminar that I hoped to have at Yale. It's a lot of reading and a large time commitment but is so rewarding if you fully commit to it. It is also institutionally set up to provide you with incredible mentorship and teacher support, unlike any other course at Yale. You really do get as much out of it as you put in. If you get into the program, do it.",
                "Yes! The Grand Strategy program is a fantastic opportunity. The combination of coursework + programming + summer travel and research was fantastic and I really got to know my peers and feel more connected to the class than average courses. Very glad I did it and good for any social science or humanities student.",
                "I could not recommend a class more highly than I do Grand Strategy.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in policymaking, movement-building, or statecraft, especially those who are not Global Affairs majors, as there are few opportunities to take a course such as this within humanities/social science majors at Yale. This is one of those rare courses that teaches you to think in a new way, and thus will enrich your learning in other concurrent and future courses as well."
