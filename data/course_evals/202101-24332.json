                "I gained a working knowledge of many of the different topics within WGSS.

I also learned more about sociological research methods, and how to conduct various types of research.",

It taught me to think about the readings in a different way and I am going to take that skill with me to other classes. I learned a lot about how to incorporate intersectionality into almost every conversation because it is always relevant and not talked about as often as it needs to be.",

                "This was the first sociology course I've ever taken and this course was a nice introduction to sociological methods and writing. I think this course taught me how to get to the point in my writing and how to more clearly demonstrate my point without relying on flowery language. I also learned a lot about what to consider when planning a sociological experiment and all the different types of methods that are available to use.",

                "I think one strength of this course was that we were able to discuss many different topics and think about the connections between them all. Additionally, class discussion time was usually pretty open ended, and the discussions most of the time felt very student lead. I think one weakness was that the readings focused a lot on cis white women, and there could have been more representation of queer people and movements in the course in various units we studied. However, Prof. Almeling usually could give you a number of additional readings to look into if you wanted to learn more about a specific topic which was great!",
                "This was a great course which was centered around a really interesting topic and the seminar discussions were well-organized and fascinating. The only way that I can think of to improve it is to widen the readings on the syllabus to include non-middle-class, white, heterosexual people. That was a point that a lot of our conversations got stuck on and I think adding different readings to the syllabus (or additional readings) would broaden the conversations.",
                "Strengths: The instructor is wonderful, the assignments are really fun and you learn a lot! Some of the readings are very intriguing. The readings could at times be a bit limited but the professor was so open to feedback and every conversation on the readings was really in depth.",
                "Weaknesses: \r\n1) there were some obvious hiccups in the restructuring of the course that made writing weekly memos a bit difficult some weeks\r\n2) a lot of the texts were outdated (written like 30+ years ago)\r\n3) The approach to gender and sex in this class were often too straight, too white, too cis, and too Western",
                "Strength: the material is varied and interesting, it's a comprehensive introduction\r\nWeakness: queer and trans studies were largely absent from the course readings",
                "It is meant to be an introductory class, but I felt it lacked nuance."

She would send out a schedule so we knew what to expect and occasionally show us a document or a video or another type of source, but mostly prompted conversations. People were not afraid to speak up, which made awkward Zoom silences (which are plentiful in other classes) almost non-existent."

If you have taken a lot of courses in the department already, this class might have some review, but there is definitely a lot of information you can still get out of the readings and the discussion.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. We had great conversations and everyone was very engaged with the material. Professor Almeling structured the syllabus well in terms of the life course, gave very clear feedback about our writing and projects, and organized the seminar well for sparking conversation, while still leaving space for more free-flowing conversation about the readings.",
                "I think so. Professor Almeling was a really receptive professor and if she takes in some of the feedback from this semester about diversifying the syllabus and course topics, I think this course will be really good in the future.",
                "Absolutely. The course was much more interesting than it at first appeared to be, the professor is fantastic, and it was my favorite class of the semester. It also was the reason I decided to change my major to sociology.",
