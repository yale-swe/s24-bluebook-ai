I also liked the relaxed format of the class meetings themselves, where students could discuss their progress with their peers and get tips from one another.",
                "I thought the due to advisor vs. due to department deadlines were a bit confusing, to be honest. If the goal was just to light a fire under the a**** of the students, it definitely worked in my case. If theres some other reason for having it be this way, i dont know maybe reevaluate that?",
                "I really liked how we discussed the ways to motivate ourselves to work when we hit a slump. Jim's advice about how we need to put our projects into perspective and work on what we can finish in the \"next two weeks\" helped us realize what was doable and what was unrealistic in the time we had. I liked the practice thesis presentations at the end especially.  A major strength were the class work sessions, where we had quiet, structured time set aside to work on the thesis."
