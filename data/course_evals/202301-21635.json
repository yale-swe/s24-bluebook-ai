                "strengths:\r\n- very organized\r\n- good material\r\n- professor is great\r\n- homeworks were extremely fair; you learned material and they were not that long\r\n- exams were amazing, hard and challenging but also short; that is to say, they really tested concept understanding\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- ta's were not present\r\n- ta's did not host office hours\r\n- ta's were not friendly",
                "The course had labs that often felt like busy worm and did not allow us to truly understand what we were doing",
                "Professor Tang made us submit our homeworks on paper, not through canvas which was very frustrating. The labs were incredibly confusing and poorly designed. Many key instructions necessary for the lab were never mentioned anywhere in the lab notes, which greatly increased time spent in the lab and led to a very confused group of students. The exams were reasonably difficult, and the workload was never excessive. We weren't allowed to use the real oscilloscopes, and instead had to use a module provided to us. I feel like it would have been more beneficial to let us use the real oscilloscopes. 8 labs that all take 3 hours is a lot, especially because it doesn't count as an extra half credit. TAs were not very helpful. Sunny was not a good TA, very condescending and rude. Office hours were held at inconvenient times for most students.",
                "Material is great. Lectures sometimes unclear",
                "Strengths: the order is logical, problems are very relevant to exams and highlight key concepts, lectures and lecture notes very thorough\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we did not really discuss any elements like op amps or transistors in detail. Also we had no circuit design component even though this course had a lab (every lab was very similar).",

Hong is fine as a lecturer, he explains things clearly enough, but almost everything else about this course is just inconvenient. Having to submit homework on paper instead of digitally because \"If you submit through canvas, I won't be able to give you any feedback\" was really annoying and just untrue, To Hong's credit, our homeworks were always graded in a week, and the midterm grades came back pretty fast too. Labs desperately need reorganized. Many of them are monotonous and I didn't get much out of them. This class would be much better if they just reworked it.",

It's basically Circuits IIyou've learned ohms law and some basic techniques in EENG 202now you get expanded to all linear circuits (resistors, capacitors, inductors). Not incredibly enlightening, but important for any electrical engineer. Not the best course in the major, but does a good job providing an applied overview of linear systems analysis (diff eq, fourier, laplace, state space, etc.)which are all helpful in almost any engineering field.",
