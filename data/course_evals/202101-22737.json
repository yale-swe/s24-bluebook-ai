                "Mainly, I became a much better writer, through the essays we wrote and the ability to revise them.",
                "A new skill I gained was comparing ancient texts to each other to find common themes and points of contrast. I learned so much more about early Christianity and the Roman empire.",
                "You read a lot of apocrypha - as well as canonical books in the New Testament - from antiquity. Learnt a lot about the cultural context of the development of the early Church and the canon. Develop skills to analyze and critically read early Christian texts, and pretty good for improving writing skills.",

                "I gained a much deeper understanding of the process of canonization for biblical texts and read several books/writings that were at one time or another included, but ultimately didn't make the cut. I learned about the authors of these texts, the role of the church authorities, and so much more.",
                "I learned all about early Christianity, namely its diversity. I learned about different approaches to Jewish law and to theodicy. My favorite unit was on Gnosticism, since I found their cosmology/theology fascinating. We ended the semester with apocalypse literature, which is awesome stuff. I also learned how to read a lot in a short amount of time and how to prioritize which readings to do.",
                "I learned how to better analyze information and put it on paper. Through the reading texts, I also managed to get better at extrapolating more important information. This class also provided me such great insight into the making of the Bible. In a subject, I felt I knew nothing about this class left me knowledgeable.",
                "I learned about how to be critical with the religious texts I was presented with. I also learned about the importance of perspective and learned about a wide variety of non-canonical texts.",
                "It was cool to understand the Bible through the lens of reading things that were not included. I learned about the different strains of early Christian thought that did not prevail to the 21st century."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: well-organized, diverse content, excellent and flexible and kind teaching team. \r\nWeaknesses: Because it was a survey course, sometimes the transition into different topics felt a little disjointed/sudden, although I don't think this was the fault of the teaching team.",
                "The biggest strength is the reading list and how interesting the material is. The infrequent but interesting lecture are also a strength. One major weakness is that the syllabus is absolutely stuffed, and some classes could have really used more time to allow for fuller discussions.",
                "Professor Doerfler deeply cares for her students, engages them in conversation while making timely interventions and mini-lectures to further the class' knowledge. One of the best professors I've had at Yale.",
                "Keeping students involved was definitely a strength, as conversation was a constant in the class.",
                "A strength of this course is that there are lecture components, but the core of the course is a seminar. The teaching staff were incredibly helpful and gave great feedback. A weakness of the course might be how quickly we move from readings, which get difficult to keep straight after halfway through the course.",
                "Professor Doerfler was an amazing teacher. It is clear that she cares a lot about her students, their education, and the material of the course. She puts a lot of work into the class and is very available to talk to about papers (and to talk in general). I think she does a great job of pulling out the interesting questions and ideas from the class (I'm saying this as a STEM major with no background or specific interest in religious studies). I think there is also a good balance between lecture and discussion (the class is definitely mostly discussion), which makes the class welcoming to people without a lot of background in the subject.\r\n\r\nProbably the one thing I didn't like about the class was Perusall, which was a website through which we can post comments and annotations about the readings. I don't feel like I gained a lot from the comments, and it seemed like the main goal was to make sure that we did the reading. For me, a way to make sure we did the reading that would be more useful/that I would gain more from would be to have a question to respond in 4 or 5 sentences to before each class.",
                "Strengths: A lot! Professor Doerfler was extremely helpful and just a really amazing professor overall. Despite the constraints of online learning, I always looked forward to going to class. I also found the readings to be really interesting and fun, so I thoroughly enjoyed doing the readings for this class.\r\nWeaknesses: I was intimidated by the papers since I am not a humanities major, so the stress of writing those made the course slightly less enjoyable. Maybe more instruction on how to write a paper would have been helpful. Also, I would have loved to talk about the Old Testament more, though I know that would not be possible given how much is covered in this class.",
                "The primary strength of this course is Professor Doerfler. She is INCREDIBLE and truly one of the best professors I've had at Yale. She did a fantastic job of making each class engaging and worthwhile, and even in this weird virtual semester, I looked forward to every class.",
                "The readings are all very interesting, as is the subject matter of the course. Professor Doerfler, Christopher, and Julia all gave extremely detailed feedback on the papers, which was very helpful in writing future papers. Professor Doerfler is also a very warm and welcoming human being, and taking this class with her was a delight. She was always available to meet and give advice.",
                "Strength! Definitely Engagement level! Online is a very difficult place to pay attention but this class constantly had me engaged. While a strength for me it could be a weakness for others but this class is very discussion-heavy. I do feel like this helped me learn from my other classmates and just really love the class.",
                "Strengths: The Professor and TF's really made this course shine. Their dedication to the course, expertise, and ability to make all the course content so interesting and relevant created an amazing learning environment. The other students in the seminar also contributed to the strengths of this course-- because there were people from such a wide variety of backgrounds, conversations were always extremely interesting, and I really felt that I learned a lot. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none. Really.",
                "The diverse range of readings was really helpful. I did not like that we had to make comments on the readings before every class. I enjoyed the breakout rooms, especially because they were kept the same throughout the entire semester."

                "The breakout rooms were a really good idea",
                "She launched a poll at the beginning of each class that would ask about which reading we liked, how it related to pop culture, or just checking in on us to see how we were doing. We would then move into a 20 mins or less lecture with slides that would provide a historical/contextual foundation for what we would be discussing that day. Then we would go into breakout rooms (which were consistent throughout the semester, facilitated by an instructor on a rotating basis) and discuss the readings. We would then come back as a large group and discuss what each breakout room concluded, and that was the end of class. Overall, we knew what to expect and it required participation and engagement.",
                "Success was definitely the breakout rooms. This gave me time to breathe especially with the 3-minute breaks. I found this class to be my most successful zoom class.",
                "The breakout groups and small-person format worked very well. In addition, the usage of Perusall elevated conversations so much and kept me accountable for keeping on top of all of my readings, which further contributed to interesting conversations outside of regular class times.",
                "The breakout rooms were helpful. She gave us a break in the middle of each lecture which was helpful to get up and focus on something else besides class. I appreciated that she shortened our paper lengths because the semester was so stressful. The TFs were also really good."

This class provides an overview of different viewpoints in early Christianity, with an emphasis on those viewpoints that fell outside of the umbrella of what would later be considered orthodoxy. The material is fascinating, so I can easily recommend this course to anyone interested in antiquity or early Christianity. Professors Doerfler is a careful and circumspect speaker and never comes off as biased. Thus, I can also recommend this class regardless of one's religious affiliation (or lack thereof).",

                "Yes. It's a really interesting subject even if you don't have any experience studying these topics.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great writing credit on an interesting topic. I am not a religion major or anything (STEM person, in fact), and I got a lot out of the class.\r\n\r\nNot a gut, but not a terrible workload class either. Engaging, educational, and interesting.",
                "YES ABSOLUTELY! I have studied the Bible a lot from a religious standpoint, so it was extremely interesting to study it and its context through this class. I highly recommend this class because of so many reasons, from how amazing Professor Doerfler is to how interesting these readings are.",
                "Yes. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale--if you ever get the chance to have Dr. Doerfler, TAKE IT!",
                "Absolutely! I learned a lot about a subject I had little familiarity with, and Professor Doerfler and the TAs are very kind. This class was an absolute delight. Do note that there are a lot of readings (at least for me as a physics major who has taken few humanities classes), so make sure to pace yourself.",
                "Absolutely. This class completely changed how I thought about many parts of the Bible and its making. We have one lesson on Pontious Pilate that made me never be able to view passion plays again! This is a class that will intellectually engage you every single time. You do have to do the reading for each class but it's relatively easy and the discussion-like homework makes it so that you find yourself passionate even about the homework.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course changed the way I see religion, and as a result the world, as a whole. The Professor is also so accommodating and encouraging, which welcomes people of all levels of confidence/expertise to engage in conversation. Furthermore, our Professor was super dedicated to ensuring we learned as much as we could by doing things like giving us second chances at our essays and giving us very long feedback comments on our essays. Overall an amazing, irreplaceable learning experience.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Christian thought and religious studies. As a lifelong Christian, the class was really helpful to dive into the faith and build on the information that I already knew. I think the class was approachable to everyone since most of the readings were not in the Biblical canon."
