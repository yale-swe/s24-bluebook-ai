                "There was much less of an emphasis on grammar and learning vocabulary in 130 than in 120 or 110. This was much more application of spanish to various medias with a new syllabus focussing on cultural learning. Definitely a different approach to learning spanish.",
                "This class encouraged me to improve my public speaking of Spanish through presentations and class discussions. In this process I also has to improve my pronunciation and grammar. My teacher helped me through this process and took the time to really focus on how I could improve.",
                "Was exposed to different aspects of Spanish culture and was able to develop my language skills in the process. Was able to improve my fluidity of speaking.",

                "This was way less organized than previous spanish classes due to the new syllabus. Something that is hopefully addressed for the next semester.",
                "The course is very organized on canvas which is really helpful. I also think the projects correlate well to the material which is great. I think that we may have had too many projects and presentations that we did not focus enough on the textbook and learning the grammar.",
                "The assignments via Canvas often felt poorly introduced. The class was never on the same page of what we had to complete before the next class until the latter half of the semester. The syllabus, while intending to be a daily planner of sorts, was never really consulted or used by my Professor and soon became obsolete. My Professor ended up send us a revised syllabus toward the end of the semester, which helped to clear up confusion.",
                "The course this semester was very disorganized - it was constantly unclear what assignments we had due when and what was required for the assignments. The only reason that this was bearable was because my instructor didnt care what we submitted as long as it was done well and thought was put into it. Which is usually not the case in these courses.",
                "Strengths: learning through projects. Strong community building for the class because of group work. Weakness: expectations to know grammar but no formal teaching of grammar in class. You read it in the textbook as homework and are expected to know it without any verbal practice.",
                "One strength of the course was the emphasis on memorization when it came to presentations, and I think the act of memorizing improved my Spanish skills. I think the biggest flaw with the course was that it needed to be more structured. The course was largely more focused on assignment completion, and we were spending most of class doing that, which was a shame. I often felt that class time was being wasted, and I think the big thing that was missing from my class was discussion, in Spanish, between students, led by the instructor. Being able to speak conversationally in Spanish is a big goal of the course and if we had just been able to have more conversations in Spanish I could have probably improved a lot more on that end.",
                "The strengths are that the class forces you to improve your speaking skills and the weakness is this disorganization of the syllabus which caused me to never know what was due and when it was due. This course could really benefit from a clear syllabus. I would also have liked to learn more grammar in class because a lot of that was just something you had to do on your own."

However, this was probably more a fault of the course organizer.",
