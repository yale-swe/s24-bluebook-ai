   "comments": [
    "Although I have taken a few political philosphoy courses, I have learned how to read essays, papers and books in political philosophy here like in no other class, mainly because of the instruction of the professor. You really learn how to focus on what's important for the sake of the class in the readings. I also learned the skill of looking at the course as a whole thematically, rather than focusing on it week by week. Professor Linden-Retek is very helpful in teaching us how to do that.",
    "Learned about sovereignty, international law, and the political theory behind borders and migration, especially as they related to the EU. Also wrote a 25-page political theory paper, so this class taught me how to do that, too.",
    "I learned how to think through and address the challenges of an ideal post-national government and current state of international governance.",
    "We covered political theorists who discussed national sovereignty, democracy, constitutions, international law, human rights, migrations and asylum, trade and neoliberalism, postcolonialism, and what those concepts tell us about the ability to construct democratic governments and places beyond the nation-state. Every week there was a critical response that was due (supposed to be 250-500 words, I believe, but everyone usually went longer and had so much insight), and there was one final paper of 20-25 pages. I improved in reading large amounts of materials quickly and thinking about them in-depth in both writing and discussion in class.",
    "This was maybe one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale  the structure of the course, the reading, and most importantly the insightful, thoughtful teaching by Paul made it both rigorous and accessible. Broadly, the class addresses both traditional questions and theory with questions such as: what is the law? what is legitimacy? what is a nation?, but also addressed some of the more immediate and current-events questions like: how can the EU sustain itself and derive legitimacy? Above all, this class is an exercise in reading deeply, being very, very confused, and then ultimately  through the process of grappling  working deeply and critically with text and theory.",
    "This course is critical for any student who wants to gain new insights about some of the most important political theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries.",
    "I developed the ability to creatively consider possibilities to reconstruct and redraw existing national boundaries to be more inclusive of stateless peoples.",
    "I learned many different ways of thinking about international relational structures. I considered the causes and the results of those structures, and developed a more nuanced personal ideology when it comes to the formation of governmental units."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: \r\n- Great readings \r\n- Great professor\r\n- Themes organized in a manner that build on each other. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I think there could be more time spent trying to reach the overarching themes of the course. Maybe two sessions in the middle and the end of the semester",
    "So many strengths, including well-chosen readings and incredible discussion (should've been called 'Imagining a Yale seminar with fascinating and productive discussion for two straight hours') but mostly it came down to Paul, who is brilliant, a fabulous seminar leader, and super generous with his time and his teaching. I think one improvement might be more continuity week in, week out  - occasionally we made connections between thinkers across weeks, but we could have done more of that.",
    "The course had amazing reading and the people that it brought together made for weekly dynamic and building conversations. The instructor guided the conversation so that it never dulled or repeated itself.",
    "Strengths: Paul is an amazing guide through the text and discourse. He is the epitome of what an ideal teacher\/professor should bealways kind and patient, funny, never judgmental about a student, always encouraging, on top of being an intellectual leader in the classroom who asks high level questions and deepens everyones thinking with each class. Take this class to learn how to think creatively, in challenging ways, while doing it in a wonderful group of people. Everyone came to class prepared (a real first in my time at Yale) and offered great contributions in discussion, both a tribute to their own wonderful selves and how Paul encouraged all to bring their best. The discussions were the best part. Some of the readings were also truly fantastic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought some of the readings could have been better or pages more carefully selected. I could also see two smaller papers being easier than one long one, or having a draft of the longer one due earlier for more feedback and revision before finals.",
    "This course's foremost strength is its instructor; Paul is somehow both easily an extremely lofty, smart, and rigorous thinker, and a wonderful teacher and mentor. His guidance of the class made each two hour seminar feel like it was not enough. His hand in leading the class was just right  applied with enough heft such that we never felt truly lost or strayed too far from valuable thinking and exercise, but light enough that it was an engaging and stimulating class at any and all possible moments. As a secondary, the syllabus and readings were excellent  again a demonstration of Paul's deep commitment to the material and to us. The readings were both carefully curated and sometimes unorthodox assignments that somehow, in the end, make deep sense.",
    "No weaknesses at all. \r\nPaul is the best seminar leader I have ever had--he asks insightful questions and encourages students to really engage with each other's comments. He provides thoughtful, timely feedback on our outlines, and he not only reads, but internalizes and incorporates our discussion posts into our seminars.\r\nFew professors care about their students' intellectual and personal growth as much as Paul.",
    "The strengths were that the course gives us many opportunities to critically consider how we may use political theorists to pose potential reconstructions of the international order.",
    "There seemed to  be two halves to the course -- the first dealing with sovereignty\/self-determinacy, and the second half dealing with human rights in a globalized world. The first half was more structural and the second half was more oriented toward the content of those structures, probably using Arendt's work as a pivot point. I really enjoyed both parts, but there was one point at which I looked at my notes and realized, \"wow, this is different from what we started talking about at the beginning of the semester.\" I like that the class had a flow, but I think making that more explicit, with more comparisons of the latter half to the former half would have been useful. \r\nClass time always seemed to go by very quickly and facilitation of discussion was conducted well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a fantastic class. Learned a lot, and enjoyed nearly every session.",
    "Absolutely. If Paul's teaching it again, TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I looked forward to it every week. If you have any interest in challenges that transcend borders, such as climate change, forced migration, international commercial law, decolonization, then this class will give you a much better theoretical framework for approaching all of them.",
    "Yes. This was the best class Ive ever taken in my life. Paul is the most compassionate, brilliant human who always makes time and organizes his seminar to optimize both dialogue and what he conveys.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is unique in its approach and brings together hundreds of years of political theory to address modern crises in a very deliberate and measured way.",
    "Would highly recommend any class with Paul and this class especially as a way to think constructively and imaginatively about future possibilities in a confusing world and time. It was inspiring and hopeful, and every discussion left me with a better understanding of some aspect of political theory or the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested and willing to do some heavy lifting in intellectual\/legal\/political theory. A brilliant course for those interested in the subject matter, I definitely can't say that I would imagine that it would be a widely popular political science class.",
    "Absolutely. This is the best course I have taken at Yale, hands down. Paul helps you see how studying political theory can actually make you a better thinker and person, and every student leaves his course with a profound appreciation for political theory.",
    "Yes. Paul is a great, lucid professor and the readings are genuinely interesting and push you to think in creative, unintuitive ways. Discussion was well-guided.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE. It changed the way I think about the refugee crisis and revitalised political theory for me. Also, Paul is incredible.",
    "Absolutely, and I definitely have already. The syllabus is well constructed, and the quality of conversation is high. I think most if not all students in this class had to confront something about their views that they had difficulty wrestling with, making it definitely worth the while.",
    "no"
