    "I thought this course was well taught, and although they were early, the lectures were engaging. With this topic, there's a vast depth of information, but the course did well in focusing on key facts and takeaways.",
    "Very straightforward and clear what we needed to know. Nothing really significant needs to be improved.",
    "I think the greatest strength of the course was the topics covered. The modern technology used by warfighting communities is very interesting and the class covers it at a reasonable level for the students to understand. The tests were all very reasonable and there weren't a bunch of curveball questions or surprises. Overall the class was pretty easygoing and stress-free while still hitting all of the key concepts.\r\n\r\nMy one suggestion would be for there to be more in class engagement. Instead of just sitting through lectures it would be nice if the students were given real life scenarios and asked which weapon systems they would employ for different situations. If we discussed more of the big picture as to how the US's procurement of particular types of weapons systems fit into the larger context of national strategy then I think that would have given the course another level of relevance and made it more interesting."
