    "This class was great for providing a macrocosmic understanding of the rich, interconnected histories of East Asia.",
    "I gained great insight into the past 1500 years of East Asian history.  Understandably, the course cannot cover everything in five weeks, but I feel as if I have a pretty decent grasp on the course of history over that time period.  I had zero knowledge in East Asian study before taking this class and now have a good idea of the general history of the region.",
    "It helps me to fully understand the summative history of the entire region of East Asia. Learn analytical methods for historical materials.",
    "Learned about the history in East Asia, and improved my writing skills. Also learned about how to think in terms of a historian",
    "I learned a lot about the region of East Asia and also feel like my ability to write history papers improved.",
    "Empires of East Asia greatly expanded my knowledge about East Asian history and culture. Additionally, the course covered in depth the historical causes for the political divisions in China and Korea today, while Japan remains unified. Empires of East Asia placed significant emphasis on contemporary sources, which allowed me to develop my interpretive abilities.",
    "This is basically a survey course on East Asia. So you'll be learning a lot about the East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) history, culture, and politics. Don't expect to dive deep into those topics, but you'll learn a lot about this region, especially if you haven't taken a course on East Asia, aren't from East Asia.",
    "This course gave a broad overview of East Asian history. It teaches you how to make connects and highlight trends across cultures and centuries. It also teaches writing skills and map skills.",
    "I have gained a more detailed overview of two thousand years of east asian history, and the experience has been incredibly enlightening.",
    "I got a great introduction to the history of East Asian empires and some of the important elements linking the region.",
    "Learned some basic Chinese because of the nature of the class.",
    "I learned all about East Asia and the various empires that ruled it. Specifically the Tang Dynasty, Japan, the Song Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, and Korea. We also learned about the importance of primary sources, but also that the reliability of these sources must be evaluated before they can be used. Taking this class also taught me how college classes work, so I can be better prepared for when I attend college in the future.",
    "The assigned essays forced me to write from a distinctly history scholar perspective and qualify all of my evidence based on the believability of its source in primary documents."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The brevity of this course was the biggest shortcoming since there is so much to learn! The great part of the class was that our professor was really great at bringing together all the different aspects of the class into a cohesive unit of understanding for big takeaways around ideologies, Buddhism, and cultural spheres of influence.",
    "Strengths:  Very interesting primary sources and readings for the most part.  The main textbook for class is written well and concisely, which is much appreciated in a history course.  Prof. Linzer's class schedule is quite helpful, with the 10-minute breaks being very welcome in a three hour fifteen minute zoom class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Communication for upcoming assignments could be somewhat vague at times and a little stronger Canvas organization would have been helpful--especially if the \"Assignments\" tab had been used to its full capacity and \"Files\" tab was used at all.  In a class with such a short timespan it is nice to be able to start thinking about upcoming assignments\/papers as early as possible.",
    "The strengths of the course is that it provides a great understanding of the broad history of East Asia. The weakness is that we did not cover a lot of material because we did not have much time.",
    "Empires of East Asia effectively used the \"breakout rooms\" function on Zoom to stimulate conversation in an online format. Each class was generally divided into a \"section,\" a lecture and a supplementary activity such as a guest speaker or watching a video, with a short break in between each. This setup worked very effectively to make the 195 minute class period manageable. The primary source readings were both informative and engaging, and our history textbook was informative. The course outlines and lecture slides were extremely helpful resources for studying for the midterm and final exams.",
    "It was extremely well organized. The readings were carefully chosen and were very fun to read. The sections were really engaging and well facilitated by both Joanna and Zekun! \r\nThe only improvement I would suggest is that I sometimes felt that the lecture part was a bit too pre-planned and felt almost like reading a history book. It was still really good but if Joanna could be a little more candid and engaging in the lectures, that would be fanatstic.",
    "The weakness is hard to avoid: it is over Zoom. This makes it inherently harder to pay attention and focus. Despite this, Joanna and Zekun (TA) were really great teachers, were constantly available for office hours, and were genuinely great resources. They are the biggest strength of the course.",
    "The structure of this course is very solid and engaging. I particularly loved the discussion sessions. I wish there were more collaborative projects or presentations in the course.",
    "The main strengths were the structure and the breakout room use - the material was always clear and connected. I also really enjoyed guest talks and various sessions involving East Asian art.",
    "Enjoyed the material. Loved the last section about Japan and WW2. Went into it thinking I'd learn about the Mongols but they are not part of the course. Not a negative, there are so many other important topics that need to be covered.",
    "The strengths are that we learned a lot of interesting information and we had very informative guest speakers. The weaknesses were that there was a very large workload to be done in a very short amount of time. The timing issue would probably not exist if we were in in-person classrooms, and not taken over a summer term.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Primary documents\r\n- Clear expectations for tests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- A zoom equivalent of a chalkboard would have helped for spelling out names and proper nouns"

   "comments": [
    "If you want a solid introductory course to East Asian history this class is definitely worth the time. You will get a wide view!",
    "Yes--I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking for a broad overview of East Asian history.  If you already have a lot of knowledge in the subject area, you might find it a bit boring as most topics covered are pretty surface level, but that is expected in a five week course.  The readings, both primary sources and the textbook, are strong and many quite enjoyable.  Overall a solid course.  Two papers, in-class midterm and in-class final actually organize the course quite nicely.",
    "Yes, because it's a great intro to the history in East Asia and I have learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students in order to learn a lot about the region of East Asia in a short amount of time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in history or the modern state of affairs in East Asia. This course provided me a strong overview of the past 2,500 years of East Asian history in a relative short time frame. Additionally, the history of East Asia in the 20th century was covered in detail, providing a contextual understanding for why East Asia today is the way it is.",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you haven't taken a course on East Asia\/ aren't from East Asia. Both Joanna and Zekun are amazing and I will recommend any class with them. This class was the highlight of my Covid-ridden summer.",
    "Definitely. Although the course description (a 5-week history course that covers 1500 years and three or more different cultures) may seem impossibly broad, the course is actually really helpful. As someone who has never taken a course on East Asian history, I found the insights the course provided re: China, Korea, and Japan, to be particularly interesting in their own right and in that they have huge implications in the modern world. Is anything, this class is excellent practice in the study of how states' and cultures' histories shape their present manifestations.",
    "Yes. To any student of history I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! This was a very clear and fascinating introduction to East Asian empires that did a great job of covering a lot of material in a clear way. The readings were interesting, the assignments + feedback were very straightforward. I was not at all familiar with any history of the region and found this to be a very friendly course. Would definitely recommend!",
    "I would recommend it. The course was very interesting and fun, anyone who enjoys history will love it. Ms. Linzer was an amazing teacher as well that made class very engaging. All the course materials were also good reads as well, so that even when there was a large workload, it was still enjoyable to do. I would recommend this to anyone who had the time.",
    "Yes. The course gave a broad overview of all East Asian history and then dived deep into the specifics of certain interesting moments."
