                "Strength is the lectures because JDRS is great, the psets are really good and the exams are fair. Generally just a very cohesive course with lots of office hours so it doesn't feel too big and you can access help. I did hear of lots of students using psets from pervious years to get a guaranteed 100, so mixing them up from year to year would be good I think. Each assignment seemed like a good level of difficulty and length. \r\nOnly complaint is sometimes the grading seemed a bit arbitrary and frustrating.",
                "This course is designed so that you can take it asynchronously, which I really appreciated as I could learn on my own time. The lectures were really thorough, and the homeworks were definitely doable as long as you kept up with the class. The material was also very interesting in general as you got to learn about different statistical methods that we read about in papers but are difficult to understand without learning.",

                "Strengths: taught me R, got me to re-engage on intro stats material\r\nWeaknesses: class too large so everything is too standardized as opposed to individualized. Got penalized for trying to find different approaches to problems myself as opposed to using class code and doing it the same way the Professor did",
                "The lectures are great, but the asynchronous nature of the course made it quite challenging to avoid getting behind.",

JDRS was a wonderful instructor that was always very engaging, even early in the morning. I liked the online discussion board - it was an easy way to see if someone else had asked a similar question.",

It would be a much better course if more effort was put into making genuinely engaging assignments.",
                "Strengths: lectures are clear, love that it's asynchronous/you can always go back to the recording, JDRS is funny + approachable, teaches practical skills, not too much work/challenge but still informative\r\nWeaknesses: none, really? Other than variation in quality of ULAs + a little lack of clarity on final project requirements",

                "The class comes with such an abundance of resources to ensure student success. The class is offered entirely asynchronously so it requires students to have the discipline to do the work and stay on schedule but the TA's are always really available for any needed help",
                "Lectures sometimes unnecessarily long. There is said to be grade deflation in this class.",
                "The strengths is that it is asynchronous so I felt like I could work on things in my own times, and there were a lot of helpful office hours I could rely on so I never felt like I was being forgotten. One weakness is that the grading system is unlike any I've seen at Yale before. I would say 80% of the points taken off on homework and exams were not because I failed to understand the material but because I maybe wrote 2 sentences when it vaguely asked for one, and tiny formatting issues like that. They had nothing to do with statistics or coding.",
                "The fact that there was an online option for this class was helpful but I think that the class would benefit from some in-person components such as discussion sections.",
                "Strengths  very accessible for all majors, not super time consuming, honestly just a super effective way to learn r!\r\nWeaknesses -- sometimes a bit hard to stay engaged, but that is probably more of a student issue than a professor one",
                "the way this course is designed is very accommodating, and it can be taken entirely asynchronously. there is a lot of support. however, i dont think i fundamentally understood a lot of the stats material, just how to code them in R. also, the curve is insane because scores are so high, so feels kind of cutthroat :(",
                "Strengths: great teaching, well-organized even with hundreds of students (!!), lots of resources like different types of recorded lectures, office hours, and Ed discussion. \r\nWeaknesses: it's a little weird that no one comes to class and the people who do have to participate a lot to keep the flow going, which they don't (I think this also contributed to the live class getting behind). Also, grading is nitpicky-- make sure you check over homework thoroughly! I have heard of a lot of people cheating by using psets from previous years, so it would be great if the problems could change from year to year so people can't do that anymore.",
                "Some quicker answers on Ed Stem, especially about peer grading and the final project would be great!\r\nThe default datasets are not very helpful for the final project.",
                "The rumors are that this course is going to be curved down because everyone has been doing well on the problem sets. Everyone has been doing well on the problem sets because everyone plagiarizes them from their friends who took the class 1, 2, 3, 4, years ago, because JDRS hasn't changed the assignments in that time  like literally, they are exactly identical assignments from years ago. A better solution to me seems like changing the assignments so that this no longer happens, and then letting students keep the grade they get, instead of punishing the students who do well on their own just to get at the cheaters.",
                "This course does a fantastic job at effectively teaching a new coding language and how to use it to run statistical analyses. It also provides a tremendous amount of useful resources: supplemental videos and presentations on statistical techniques, an abundance of office hours, helpful TAs, and a myriad of different ways to learn the same material. I also liked that the class had multiple options for engagement and the option to take the course asynchronously. My only suggestion regards the final project. I'm still a bit unclear about how it's graded, but I am not a huge fan of peer grades, particularly the part of the peer grading that ranks your project (since some students might receive three high quality projects, and one will automatically be deducted 8-points because it was randomly grouped with two slightly better A-tier projects).",
                "Strengths: completely asynchronous - gave students flexibility. JDRS is an awesome prof. Weakness: grace cutoff for an A is very high",
                "My one complaint about this course was the final project. Having to grade other peoples projects was kind of insane, even if TAs will do different grading. There was very little clarity with what was going to happen to our peer grades, and no TAs were commenting on the questions people were asking for clarification. The rubric was very rudimentary, and there wasn't any listing of how many points should be taken off for what errors. Pedagogical I kind of get the reasoning behind it, but I think it would have made more sense as a sort of pre-submission peer editing instead of a post-submission evaluation. Also, it's super unfair to not tell a class how their final grade will be determined.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great teacher, the material is useful, the workload is manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading was a bit arbitrary, the course material did not end up being very advanced/going into that much depth, peer grading assignment at the end was not well explained or executed.",
                "all online which is nice",
                "If you want to learn R, take this class; however the way the final project is graded is so bizarre, unclear, and completely can shift how you are doing in the last in the last week just based on how a peer decides to arbitrarily evaluate you -- hopefully this is a system that will be changed but be aware of that before you take this class.",
                "This class has no weaknesses. It is a very good class to introduce you to statistical analysis using R. The TA's are also super helpful. Go JDRS!",
                "The strength of this course is that it really teaches you a programming language from scratch. The downside is that grading is extremely annoying.",
                "All work is asynchronous so it's incredibly easy to do on your own time. JDRS and the TAs are very accessible via office hours for pset and final project help.",
                "Strengths: Asynchronous format, classroom resources\r\nWeaknesses: Final Exam format",
                "The course is extremely well designed to facilitate student learning. There are many formats you can watch the lectures, and there are so many TAs available to help. The Ed page is super helpful for asking questions. The problem sets help you learn the material.",
                "Great online setup",
                "No weaknesses (aside from grading rubric for final project) \r\nStrengths: Professors lectures were extremely clear, easily accessible, and modules were well organized. Expectations were communicated and clear. There are so many opportunities for help (over 40 hours of office hours a week)!",
                "It is extremely well organized and you get a lot of help from the TAs since there are a lot of office hours available. One thing that could be improved is the grading of the final project which is a huge chunk of your grade. In order to curve the class since the average is too high at the end, JDRS makes us subtract  -4 and -8 off of 2 of 3 final projects we have to grade (final project is peer graded). I found this system to be extremely arbitrary and unfair, I wish that they had just made the homeworks or exams harder instead of creating this problem in the first place.",
                "This course is good for someone who is willing to self study and take the initiative to go to office hours.",
                "Love the asynchronous format  please keep it forever! This course is really conducive to it, and it's super helpful for scheduling. TF's could be a bit nitpicky at times with the PSET grading.",
                "It was very easy to follow along and keep up with the work. Sometimes it felt like the psets were a little too straightforward, but overall a great class. Also, the style of the final project and peer grading wasn't great, particularly ranking the different projects we had to review. In the future would do away with that, or at least the ranking.",
                "The Psets were quite fun and not too difficult. The TAs and office hours were very accessible and helpful. Lecture videos were also really nice and well put together. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the grading can be knitpicky - many of the points I lost were for small formatting issues,",
                "Strengths: Online videos were extremely helpful for when I didn't want to walk up to Marsh for 9 am class. The sheer number of office hours was really amazing, and I felt very supported by all of the TAs. The problem sets were a great opportunity to practice the concepts we learned about in class and were a lot of work, but attainable and not confusing.",
                "The final project should NOT have a student grading system; there's too much incentive to be harsh.",
                "There was very little learning necessary, and I could get by just copying code from lecture.",
                "-nitpicky on a few details\r\n-having it be remote made it very accessible, but also easy to be detached from content",
                "The amount of support you are given is incredible. I wish the psets were a little more different than the code taught during lecture. Grading can be harsh for seemingly simple errors.",
                "I liked the format of the class and how it could be in person or virtual.",
                "Strength: JDRS is an amazing lecturer. He is someone who can make statistics sound fun - just imagine that. The class is also amazingly well-structured, which is so helpful for a stats beginner like me since the concepts themselves are already a mouthful to digest. It really helps me to grasp the big picture and piece everything together. \r\nWeakness: class size, perhaps. I would appreciate sections where I can really consolidate my learning, but right now we only have lecturers and office hours which are not always helpful. Sometimes the TAs are more confused than I am ...",
                "The process of grading of the final project could be improved",
                "Strengths: Very fun course content and JDRS does a great job given the enormous number of students.\r\nWeaknesses: Extremely high variability among graders. Inconsistent deduction of points on assessments.\r\n\r\nFor coding, I would like to see a greater emphasis on performance and a lower emphasis on stylistic conventions. As an example, points are lost for not having braces around each for loop (even one-liners), but suboptimal code, such as c(1:4) instead of seq_len(4) or repeating expensive operations throughout a for loop, are both accepted and prevalent even in lecture examples.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses of this course are strongly dependent on the student. I was hardly engaged with the course because it was asynchronous (the alternative was walking to science hill at 8:30am) and I did not feel an incentive to watch/keep up with the lectures. However, JDRS is an awesome teacher and gives a WEALTH of resources for students, you just have to use them.",
                "Super well organized, super helpful group of teaching assistants. JDRS is the class's largest strength as well; I think he is a phenomenal professor.",
                "Strengths: Very flexible, many resources, tons of peer tutor support\r\nWeaknesses: Some problem sets were absurdly long, but some others were fairly short, so perhaps more balance in that workload would be nice, no huge complaints, a good course overall.",
                "The course is very well organized and JDRS's curriculum is well designed to suit any student. I took the course entirely remotely and still was able to learn just as much if not more than if I would have attended the live lectures. Grading is generous as long as you watch the lectures properly and put in 4-5 hours every week for homework. I don't see any weaknesses of the course.",
                "I think a strength of this course is the abundant amount of help provided and how available both JDRS and the TAs are for both help and accomodations. You can tell there is a lot of work put into making sure there's as much help as possible and that it is available to everyone regardless of availability. One weakness is that the course can be a little fast, and sometimes I wished there were review sessions or sheets to sum up the concepts for that day.",
                "Strengths: this is such a well-organized course. Kudos to JDRS and all course staff for making it that way. I love how much office hour support there is. It's always organized in the sense of online modules and Ed discussion as well. The homeworks are very doable.\r\nWeaknesses: I always felt really disengaged with the other students who took this course. I wish there was a way of fostering more class community. I also sometimes wish there was more push to make homeworks more than a copy-paste modification of class lectures, but their current nature makes them very student-friendly. I also felt like points were always taken off for small errors, never major ones.",
                "Strength: It is a wonderful course to learn R, especially for those who know basic statistical concepts already. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, the professor, and the materials. One of the wonderful things about the course was that it can be done entirely asynchronously if you decided to since his video lectures are wonderful! \r\n\r\nWeakness: While it is a great course for those who already know statistical backgrounds, I would not recommend it for those who did not have an introductory course on statistics because the course only briefly touches upon fundamental concepts.",
                "JDRS is the right kind of quirky- passionate, energetic, silly, and patient with students. He works really hard to make this course accessible to every student offering in person, live streamed, and pre-recorded lectures to fit your learning style and has ample office hours to help students with any questions they have. \r\n\r\nMy least favorite things about the course were office hours being on zoom- it meant that it took forever to get help. I also did not like doing the final project as a group project (unless you love group projects just do it by yourself).",
                "It's convenient that all of the lectures are pre-recorded if you have class conflicts or simply can't get yourself to wake up at 9am. I will say, that does make it very easy to slack off, get behind, or not pay much attention. Also, a lot of the problem sets are just copying code from class which made them much easier but I think it would be helpful to make it a bit different because I'm not sure how much I learned vs. just copied from class code.",
                "strengths -- asynchronous pace (you can attend live lecture or watch recordings which allows you to learn at your own pace/time), psets & midterms actually help you practice what you've learned in class, office hours + online discussion forum are very helpful, JDRS is energetic in his lectures which helps you pay attention + he's very kind and understanding when it comes to being flexible with assignments\r\n\r\nweaknesses -- I can't really think of any",
                "good",
                "A strength was its asynchronous format, it allowed students to work at their own pace.",
                "More office hours on the last day before assignments are due. All the psets are due Friday and ofc most students don't work on it till then. As a result, it was challenging to do the psets sometimes.",
                "Class average is extremely high, unclear what the grade cutoffs would be",
                "The strengths of this course are that the modules are pre-recorded, so if a student wants to be ahead of pace, he/she can be. Additionally, the course has a lot of office hours spread out throughout the week, so getting help is relatively easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that it is curved far upwards because students tend to do well. It would be one thing if some students work were so excellent that they redefined the standards, but in the case of a course like this, my impression is that the difference between a 94 and a 97 is usually minor mistakes. Therefore, it seems wrong to penalize students for as a whole doing good work, especially when at the beginning of the semester, JDRS told us not to worry about our grades.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, group grading was not ideal. I understand that a lot of students took this class, but perhaps capping that number so that the JDRS and the TAs are able to grade the final projects may be best.",
                "I think you get in what you put out. If you want to become skilled in r and do some catching up/review on statistics concepts as you go you can really make the most of this course. At the same time, it's within the rules to pretty much copy the p-sets and lots of students did that and left the course having learned little. I ultimately think this is a strength though: if you want this class to be a comprehensive learning experience it can be, or if you want it to be almost a gut it can be. My only real criticism would be some of the grading on the homeworks was shoddy. Sometimes the instructions would be unclear or would be clear but the TA's would be \"looking for\" something not asked for in the instructions. It got better as the semester went along though, so just be thorough early on. And it's pretty impressive that they do as well as they do given there are are 400-500 students in this course. JDRS has things very well-organized.",
                "Peer tutoring was very available which was great!",
                "Good flexibility with asynchronous learning.\r\n\r\nGrading seems very fickle and inconsistent, especially for final project.",
                "Video format very useful for going back and replaying parts I missed, felt like the TAs/TFs were constantly cancelling office hours on us",
                "A strength of this course is how flexible it is with the option for it to be asynchronous. However, this is also one of its largest weaknesses as it is very easy to fall behind. But, the massive number of weekly office hours certainly makes up for this possible pitfall.",
                "Strengths: The ULA team! I worked closely with a ULA this semester who really helped me out. Given that this class is very big, I'd recommend others to try to find someone whose teaching style they like and attend their office hours consistently.",
                "Strengths: the ability to take the class asynchronously and have lectures recorded so that you can review the material over again as needed. Tons of office hours every week that allow you to get help when you need it and the TAs are all great. And the professor! JDRS is awesome and always super helpful\r\n\r\nWeakness: I thought the final project grading (peer grading) was a little subjective. While my group didn't face any issues with how our project was graded, I could see some of my friends' groups received varying scores even though they had submitted the same projects because their projects had been graded by different people. The rubric wasn't super specific which made it difficult to determine how many points to take off, etc.",
                "Strengths: Well organized, covers many important topics that are commonly used in data analysis, psets are conductive to learning, great teaching team that offers many opportunities to get help. Weaknesses: None",
                "This course was predominantly an asynchronous corse which was a strength because there were still many opportunities to work with the TAs and professor. One weakness is that often times homeworks and other assignments were graded very tediously.",
                "Strengths: lot of help. \r\nWeakeness: grading on final project.",
                "There are too many students in the class and the peer review sometimes isn't very fair.",
                "Good flexibility of learning schedule",
                "Plenty of study hall hours to get help and clarifications",
                "Strengths: Lectures were well-designed to aid comprehension, homeworks were helpful for learning the material, office hours were plentiful and helpful.\r\nI felt that the only weakness of the course was the final project. The rubric lacked specificity and the low quality  peer-reviews could not be contested, yet were the primary basis for calculating the overall grade. This did not feel at all like a fair evaluation of the effort put into the final project. Yet the grade for this project was heavily weighed into the semester grade.",
                "The course was very intriguing and had a broad range of applications",
                "The content was very accessible, though the grading was a bit off sometimes.",
                "Flexible lectures and helpful psets.",

                "Great and well laid out class. The worst thing is how easy it is to slack off, which isnt on JDRS",
                "There should be more transparency about the point of peer grading.",
                "This course handles its breadth of content very well.  We went through everything from basic t-tests to multiple regression through the semester, and I feel like I grew in ways I would have never imagined!  Grading for the problem sets did get a little frustrating at times--I often got points docked for failing to include certain details in my responses that the assignment had not explicitly asked us for.",
                "This course is the best course Ive taken at Yale its very well taught and its hybrid form is really convenient",
                "I did not like that our final projects were graded by our peers and that we didn't have a chance to request a regrade by faculty, especially when points were accidentally taken off. My group members and I received greatly different scores for the same project.",
                "Strengths: Accessible lectures, knowlesdgeable TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs would sometimes cancel their hours with late notice",
                "Strength: lectures are easy to follow;\r\nWeakness: the progress of the class is uncertain",
                "Weekly homework's served as good check-ins to make sure we were understanding that week's topics - kind of forced you to keep up, which I appreciated as someone with ADHD.  Group option for project made it less stressful, and appreciated that we got to pick the data set - made it more interesting. Open note exams also made me focus more on learning the material than cramming. Student grading of the final project could be tweaked a bit - ranking of projects felt like it diminished the work we put into it, and political beliefs and biases could impact how a student grades something.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very clear and engaging, problem sets and exams were very fair, grading and feedback was fast, wide variety of office hours times, exams were all take home\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you could lose many points on a problem set for minor things such as just assigning a page or two incorrectly when submitting to Gradescope, having to rank my peers' projects when peer grading",
                "The final project was an absolute mess. The grading was not established beforehand, and there were two different rubrics for the final project, meaning people who followed one rubric got points off when the other was used.",
                "strengths: The flexibility, you could take the class however you liked whether synchronously or asynchronously without penalty either way. The final project was a fun and creative way to work on stats as well.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: The class went out on a sour note when we had to grade other students' final projects. It was unclear how the student grades would affect your final grade and the rubric was very harsh. The process was logistically messy as well.",
                "The format of this course is EXTREMELY frustrating. Final project grades were peer-determined, teaching fellows take off significant grades for formatting on homework, and the professor reuses every single homework, exam, and project with artificially increases the course average and makes the curve very difficult, particularly for those who do not cheat on exams.",
                "I appreciated how the course was entirely asynchronous and I could take it at my own pace.",
                "I think that the course was well structured with lots of office hours and homework help. I do like how it was asynchronous and live because it allowed the course to be more manageable. I do think that a weakness is that they took off whole points for misaligned pages on gradescope because this can have a big affect on your overall homework grade. Sometimes the weekly psets became overwhelming during the last half of the year when a lot of other coursework was picking up, and I do wish instead of our last pset, we had no pset so we could work solely on the final project. I do not think that peer grading is a good method to grade the final project. Personally, one of my peer's gave me a 10/10 and one of them gave me a 2/10 for the final ranking part and so, you can see how subjective it is which makes the overall grade quite unfair.",
                "Strengths: good prof, interesting and useful material\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "One weakness was that as the semester went on, some TAs were increasingly late for office hours or never showed up at all. Since I was often only able to go for a short time, it made the class more stressful.",
                "Very easy to follow becajse mostly online, a lot of help available all the time during the week. A little too fast paced",
                "Strengths: very flexible format, teaches data analysis concepts and skills in R in an easy-to-understand, not overly demanding way. The only major weakness in my view was the disorganization of the final project and its grading.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, love the recorded lectures, lots of office hours, great professor. No weaknesses!",
                "Strength: learned a variety of relevant skills, I liked the data sets we looked at\r\n\r\nWeakness: office hours were really busy",
                "The many options for taking the course are beneficial and allow for greater freedom. However, in some ways this is also a drawback. I am a very motivated student, yet I had a difficult time fully committing to learning this material. The same is true of the assessments- take homes (though wonderful for the reduction in stress and likely more realistic representations of how we would use code) are not incredibly motivating. It seemed that the professor tried to account for this fact (that the class's assessments were relatively relaxed) by making the final grade calculation very harsh. This strategy seems unreasonable. Furthermore, I felt that the peer grading system for the final project was ridiculous. It is unfair to expect other students to be able to accurately assess our work.",
                "The teaching and explanations are very well explained, detailed and thorough.",
                "Online office hours make it very difficult to engage efficiently with the TFs. Quick fixes are fine but actually digging into a big code problem is not a good use of time over zoom. Peer grading of final also complicated things.",
                "What could be a strength for some could be a weakness for others. All the lectures were pre-recorded, which may make it easy for people to study at their own pace. However, there was little engagement - it is essentially like taking a virtual course because all lectures are prerecorded.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great lecturer; he explains things well and is very humorous at the same time. The Canvas site shows deadlines clearly. The course schedule is very flexible; students can choose to take all lectures (and exams) asynchronously. TFs, ULAs, and graders are very friendly.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: Very clear layout, tons of office hours, JDRS is nice and smart. Its also nice to have a group final project. And I think I learned a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are often word for word from the class code. So its very easy to just take straight from there without understanding it. I think it would be a lot better if the psets were more different from the class code. ON THAT NOTE, because the psets are right from the class code, its very easy to get 100%. So TFs/ULAs are just taking off points for nitpicky stuff that isnt clearly asked for. Please make the psets more of an extension from the class code, not just a repeat and then be less nitpicky. It also meant I spent an insane amount of time inspecting my responses to make sure they were perfect for the TFs, rather than investing that time into general concepts and understanding. Office hours were kinda crazy. Need more at the end of the week and fewer on Saturday since psets are due Friday.",
                "Great ULAs and teaching staff. Lectures were all prerecorded and in-person which made the class very flexible. Honestly, not many weaknesses.",
                "Really good way of learning R for non stem majors. I wish TA's would schedule their office hours later on in the week when students needed help rather than early in the week when most people hadn't even started on the psets.",
                "The course was flexible and a wide variety of students took the class for different reasons. Very independent and we had an asynchronous option.",
                "I like that it is asynchronous and provides students with a lot of flexibility. It explains the concepts behind the statistical models without getting too involved, and teaches students how to work with data and gain insights on it by application rather than through theory. The problem set grading could be improved, however; grading was meticulous and sometimes capricious, and I felt like I had to spend an hour scanning my problem set before submitting it just to check for slightly cut-off graph labels or to ensure my explanations discussed every possible detail mentioned in the prompt, etc. Grading methodology for the course could in general be a little more transparent.",

                "Yes. Good intro stats course for coding.",
                "Yes, I learned important skills for R programming that is super useful.",
                "Yes!! Especially if you're interested in stats and coding. Even if you're not (like me) it's a good chance to learn new skills and get some experience with fun coding stuff! It's so well organized and JDRS is awesome.",
                "Yes! I think there's a reason this class is one of the more popular ones at Yale. The topics aren't completely riveting all the time, but the information is super necessary to whatever you want to do and regardless of your major.",
                "Yes! You learn a lot and I now feel comfortable using R",
                "The content of this class is interesting and I learned a lot, but you should only take it if you'll be able to keep up with the work, since it's really easy to fall behind if you don't go to class. If you care about your grade, it might also be pretty hard to get an A in this class.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. S&DS 230 is a great QR for those who might not be pursuing a degree in another stats related, as it is applicable analysis to any data (i.e. could be applied to any discipline).",
                "I would recommend this course if you have coded before and are comfortable learning on your own or prefer to teach yourself.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course.",
                "It's required for most stats inclined students, so you may have no choice but it's a good introduction to R programming and you will learn some stats tools. I just wish it was smaller or more resources for applied towards individual feedback and encouraging different approaches",
                "I would recommend this course only to students who specifically want to learn R and think they're capable of staying engaged with a course that can be so easily completed asynchronously.",
                "Yes! This is such an essential class to take at Yale. Learning how to use R checks off so many requirements on possible internships and jobs in the future.",
                "Helpful class for learning R. I'm not sure how much of the statistics I actually retained.",
                "The Lecturer is super nice!",
                "No. While the classes are relatively well structured and taught, the problem sets are completely pointless and unengaging. You could teach yourself many of these techniques in R much more quickly. The course should just be flipped classroom where you learn code on your own and come into class to debug it with TAs.",
                "Yes, definitely! The only asynchronous course I've ever enjoyed. Instruction is clear, course content is useful but not ridiculously challenging -- a great course to add into a busy semester/easy-ish QR credit for non-STEM people.",
                "Yes if it's for a requirement! It's one of the most flexible options and is listed as a prereq for several majors. Recommend this over other prereq alternatives.",
                "Yes to someone who has limited stats experience and wants to learn more.",
                "Absolutely! It's so well organized, flexible, and actually really useful for a variety of future jobs.",
                "Sure, but make sure to get as close to perfect on everything.",
                "I would say yes if you want to learn how to code in r",
                "Yes! It's a very efficient way to learn how to program in R and the data analysis methods learned in this class are applicable to every field.",
                "Yes!! If you want to learn r, this class is definitely the way to do it.",
                "Yes! S&DS 230 is an awesome course that teaches you so much about data analysis in the context of learning the R programming language. The course is very well designed. An amazing aspect that I took advantage of was the possibility of taking the course asynchronously (you can also take it live, in-person). This allowed me to take the course as a sixth class without too much stress. Even if you're not planning on being a statistics major, this course is a good way to brush up on your programming skills and learn some new data analysis skills. If you're worried about a lack of direct support from TFs/JDRS because of the asynchronous aspect, don't worry, there are plenty of office hours that you can visit for help. Don't hesitate, add it to your course registration now!",
                "i would if you want to learn R! otherwise, not sure what you would be taking this course for (i did not actually seek to learn R so im in this boat)",
                "Yes, definitely! I don't have to tell you to take this class. It's exactly as advertised and exactly what its reputation is. Not hard and you will learn useful skills.",
                "YES",
                "If you want to learn R, take this course. But engagement will be low. You will just watch recordings and complete R Homework, that's all.",
                "It's a great intro to R without being too much work.",
                "Yes! A really great introduction for complete beginners if you're willing to put in the work, but taught really helpful skills.",
                "Absolutely! I took this class because I wanted to learn how to analyze datasets with R, and I feel confident walking away from this class that I've learned how to do just that. JDRS is a fantastic instructor and built this course in a way that really facilitates learning without unnecessary stress.",
                "Yes. Great intro to R",
                "This is probably one of the best ways to learn R and to get a QR credit if you need it. The end of term project (and peer grading) definitely made me want to burn some peoples houses down though, metaphorically.",
                "Yes, but with some important caveats. The course itself is pretty fun and not that hard. However, the class is graded on a curve (determined by the distribution of student grades). So, people tend to do pretty well on most assignments, and hence the cutoff the get an A is much higher than usual. The class is good if you're looking for a low-workload way to reinforce your stats knowledge and learn to code in R, but I'd recommend taking another class if you're looking for a more advanced and rigorous way to continue studying statistics.",
                "yes. must go to office hours though",
                "This class requires you to be very self-directed -- if you like that and would like to learn R, go for it. I would also definitely recommend finding a study group to work with on psets.",
                "Yes! This class has clearly-outlined expectations and transparent grading. Would strongly recommend this class to anyone who wants to acquire a basic literacy in data analysis.",
                "I recommend this course for the stats major or certificate. I also recommend it if you know absolutely no programming and want to learn an easy beginner language (R) from scratch.",
                "Yes, it's a great way to learn how to code in R especially for the social sciences!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to literally anyone looking to work in a field that deals with graphs. The knowledge in this class helps you become better in understanding statistics, collecting data, and turning data into something that can provide useful insights.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes",
                "Definitely! Im not a STEM major but coding and data analysis is becoming increasingly prominent so basic skills is necessary to have!",
                "Yes, for educational purposes. However, in terms of GPA, keep in mind that your grade might fluctuate significantly because the final project could tank it.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning R and are willing to put in the work to understand the content on their own.",
                "Yes! Especially if JDRS is teaching, the class is a breeze and you learn a lot. Very low pressure and very informative.",
                "Yeah, it's a great fundamentals class.",
                "Yes! Really great introduction to R and because its asynchronous, you can fit it into your schedule quite easily. Whether youre a stats major or not, its a cool class to take.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you want an introduction to both R and statistics! It is very good at giving you skills and a bit of background in data science. I would say that since it can be possible to do the problem sets without going to lecture or watching the videos, it is very hard not to fall behind, and since most everything is online, it doesn't have the same feeling as a primarily in-person class.",
                "No just do something better with your time, unless you want an easy 5th credit",
                "depending on their interests",
                "Yes! Especially for people who want to be comfortable with data analysis but would benefit from some hand-holding and extra guidance.",
                "Yes, to learn how to use R and analyze data.",
                "Yes, it's a very accessible and fun course to get familiar with r language and basic statistics concepts. one word of caution: you should really have some statistics background knowledge coming into the class, if not you will have to spend extra time catching up on the basic concepts. JDRS will offer a lot of help but it's ultimately up to you to spend the time. you could get through without revising them - but you'll struggle.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that wants to learn R or basic statistics and is very detail-oriented for the problem sets.",
                "Yes, if you're willing to keep up with the content.",
                "Totally if you want to improve either your understanding of stats or your skills in R (and I wanted to do both for my job).",
                "Yes, to learn the R language, but if you want to learn stats concepts primarily, this many not be the best choice.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student at Yale who either took AP statistics or took s&ds 100-106. By reinforcing concepts from the introductory courses with a proper programming language, you feel that you really know the fundamentals of statistics after taking the course. As R and Python are the most used languages for data analysis, the material learned in the course will be useful in a variety of fields.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to learn to code in R. However, I would recommend taking an introductory statistics class first just to have a strong foundation.",
                "Yeah! It's a well-organized, applicable course that won't take up more than a few hours every week. Exams don't really require studying since they're take-home. Start the final project early and make sure you hit everything on the rubric. You got this.",
                "if you have to",
                "Absolutely! I think it is the best course that I have taken at Yale in terms of programming and statistics. The lecture and materials are highly organized. The instructor provides plenty of feedback and helps with an army of TAs (probably one of the things that I enjoyed the most).",
                "Yes- It gave me the basic skills I needed to apply to my research in the sciences. R is a super helpful program to know how to use.",
                "If you want to learn R- yes.",
                "Yes! I would recommended this course to anyone that wants to carry out any sort of statistics research for any given major/topic. Great professor, good lectures & assignments, and interesting + collaborative final project.",
                "Yes! Great introduction into using R in a stress-free, supportive environment.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It gives a good introduction to R and you can use the opportunity to learn statistics as well. Keep in mind that the statistics background is fairly glossed over, so you would have to spend your own timing learning it if you had not previously. That said, not much understanding of statistics is required for this class as the focus is on coding in R. From what I've heard, the grade required to get an A in this class is higher than normal, but it is totally possible if you keep accountable of the material and consistently watch the videos.",
                "Yes",
                "I think so. Im told that what were doing with R is not real programming but learning basic functions. \r\n\r\nI would say that if you have never programmed before, take R during the summer to avoid the curve.",
                "Yes, this is a cool class no matter what your major is. You don't need any coding experience and R is a very rewarding program to code in. Run the plot() function with a couple arguments and you've made the Mona Lisa of scatterplots. It's fun.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to learn R and statistics.",
                "Yes, good intro to stats and r.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in statistical analysis or anyone who is interested in being introduced to coding.",
                "It depends. It's definitely a course that requires you to work independently and find your workflow. There was also a lot of general confusion about grading, which was never clarified, not even at the very end of the semester. There was a lot of dissatisfaction with final peer review grading that was never addressed, despite many comments on the Ed discussion board about it. I didn't really appreciate the lack of transparency there.",
                "yes  well taught and you learn R! Not too bad on statistics",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student - easy course load, great TAs, great professor",
                "Yes! It teaches you a lot about R and gives you many opportunities to practice via homework assignments, take-home exams, and the final project without a heavy course load. There is also a great teaching team and lots of support.",
                "I would recommend this course because it taught important skills in data analysis and coding with R, while have a relatively low workload.",
                "Yes - if you want to learn R well and refresh stat concepts.",
                "Yes",
                "Most people have taken a stats course before, but this was my first time learning statistical concepts. I would not recommend this as your first class unless youre willing to put in double the class time to watch supplementary videos. Other than that JDRS is a wonderful person!",
                "Yes, this is a great stepping stone in a track to learn statistics, or even a great singular overview class which is an excellent survey for someone who won't go any further in stats.",
                "Yes, it is very helpful for future career work",
                "If you are interested in data analysis at all, this is a very useful class.",
                "Stats in R",
                "Absolutely! JDRS is an amazing professor that teaches you by example. The PSets are designed to optimize your learning, and office hours are plentiful! Highly recommend this course as a first step into programming, etc.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!  Data science is a must for just about any field, and JDRS does a great job of dipping your toes into the world of statistics!  I came in with only knowledge from my AP Statistics course and no R experience at all, but have learned to perform best subsets regression, permutation tests, etc.  The class gives you all the skills you need for the real world.",
                "Absolutely! You do not need to know any R to become a pro through this course and its just really fun in general",
                "Yes, especially if you are considering the S&DS major or the certificate.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to learn R",
                "Yes, it's a good intro class for R and the application of statistics.",
                "Yes, regardless of what major you're doing. Serves as a good QR credit, can apply to a lot of fields and just generally interesting/useful and not stressful in how its organized. Professor is funny and available to address questions and help out. Weekly homework's served as good check-ins to make sure we were understanding that week's topics - kind of forced you to keep up, which I appreciated as someone with ADHD.  Group option for project made it less stressful, and appreciated that we got to pick the data set - made it more interesting. Open note exams also made me focus more on learning the material than cramming.",
                "I would recommend this course for any student interested in exposure to R studio. I came in with no experience in R and no coding experience in general, but JDRS made everything feel super approachable and easy to understand. The problem sets and exams were very manageable, as was the final project at the end.",
                "Yes, take it if you're willing to do the work for an easy QR, but be prepared for the final project to be an absolute mess.",
                "This class is one of the best skill-building classes at Yale so if you want to learn R it is a great and usually low stress way to do so. I enjoyed every aspect of this course, until the very end of it when there was a peer-grading system that didn't seem fair.",
                "Take this class if it is required. Otherwise there are better statistics options.",
                "Yes, I would if you require an additional class that needs flexibility.",
                "I would. Not too difficult, but very interesting and useful",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this is a good course for gaining some expertise in R and evaluating if you're interested in continuing with S&DS courses after an introduction to statistics.",
                "Yes! Great introduction to statistical analysis, and the workload is very manageable!",
                "Yes! Can use these skills in any field",
                "Yes- if you have a reason/desire to learn R and already know intro statistics. I took the course without having a background in stats. This proved to be a mistake, as I now cannot take an intro stats class but have only a vague understanding of many of the concepts. This class is a good introduction to coding in R, and by the end of the course I feel fairly able to utilize R to analyze data.",
                "Yes if you are interested inn being able to work with data in r its a very good foundation",
                "Yes, valuable stats and coding skills",
                "If you are planning to do research involving statistical analysis, the topics covered in this course are essential.",
                "Yes! JDRS is a great lecturer. It's also a great fifth credit; very flexible schedules, all exams are take-home and untimed.",
                "Yes if you have taken intro stats. No if you have not. The reason I say no to people who havent taken intro stats is not because you wont succeed in the class, but because youll leave the class confused about the stats concepts and they wont be baked in because you wont understand their reasoning. The class will teach you how to do a t-test, for example, but if you dont have a strong grasp of what a t-test is, whats the point?",
                "Definitely. The professor is honestly amazing. The course manages to teach students about R without overbearing or stressing people out",
                "Yes. Cause you can learn a lot",
                "Learning to use R is helpful and this course is definitely manageable without prior experience in statistics. It's probably not a good course for someone who want to gain theoretical understanding of statistics. This course is very much application based.",
                "Yes, material was presented very clearly. Very hands on.",
                "Definitely",
                "Not really; it is generally low-workload and convenient since the lectures are asynchronous, but it was very tedious and I felt like my grade was walking on eggshells the whole semester. The final project is graded by other students, which is a bit concerning since it is a curved class and one might expect malicious grading; I don't think this ended up happening at significant levels, but I was very stressed during the grading period.",
                "If you want to learn R, this is the class.",
                "Yes! R is super useful -- I went into this course with only intro stats (and no prior coding experience of any sort) and I was able to become really confident in R by the end of the semester! It's also really nice to have the asynch option",
                "Yes! With JDRS!!",
                "Yes! JDRS is fun! The psets can be annoying but ultimately really help with your learning and understanding what goes on during the lectures. This was my first time learning a programming language, and I thought learning R with JDRS was really fun.",
                "Yes! Just make sure you are self-disciplined enough to not fall behind."
