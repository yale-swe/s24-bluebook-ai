    "Yes, especially if you are looking to fulfill the lessons for credit requirement. Although finding the motivation to get out bed and sing whole tone scales at 9:30 in the morning can be difficult, the classroom environment is laid-back and friendly and you'll learn and develop some useful skills along the way. The required weekly keyboard labs can be fun if you go in with a good partner, especially since you'll be able to decide what kind of material\/skills you want to work on for the semester.",
    "Yes!! Its a great course.",
    "Yes, it provides a fairly useful base on which to build."
