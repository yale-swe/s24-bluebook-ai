    "Communication with Spanish Language at a higher level, knowledge of cultures of Spanish speaking countries, training oral and written sides of the language",

    "Spanish speaking",

   "comments": [
    "The teaching style was very good in this course; however, I believe the evaluation methods are not representative of the work given in class. The listening evaluation is read at twice the speed that our professor spoke to us the entire semester and the written exams are way too long for the duration of time given.",
    "There was not a lot of transparency with the grading.",
    "Strengths: There were ample times to practice speaking and listening to Spanish.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course moves a little too fast.",
    "The course is very boring, both by nature of the material of the class and by the way it is taught. The tests are absurdly hard for no reason, and in class time is spent basically reading the grammar in the book. Its drilled in using memorization and all kinds of engagement and excitement about learning a language are sucked completely from the curriculum.",
    "Strengths: Good amount of speaking activities, course well organized for students to learn L2 Spanish, good combination of speaking, writing, listening and reading, includes stories regarding culture of Spanish speaking countries\r\nWeakness: Too many points taken off for one mistake, some activities have more points than others that should be equailized",
    "I did not look forward to class everyday, since the workload was mostly uninteresting. I loved the literature assignments and interactive activities. The day-to-day work of checking homework and learning grammar was usually redundant with the homework. We could have used more alternative forms of practice.",
    "Maybe exams could be a bit less broad in the material they contain. It was a tough course, but well taught.",
    "Constant, daily work is tiring but ultimately was probably very useful in learning a new language. More conversation & engagement with literature\/film (like in the last few weeks of class) would be great throughout.",
    "Strengths: meeting every day, grammar explanations, lots of feedback on written projects\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough opportunities to practice speaking\/listening because of the class size (18 people is a lot for a language class); not enough feedback on speaking and listening portion of the class"

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course because although the teaching is done well, the evaluations are not representative of that instruction.",
    "Great class if you need it.",
    "Yes! Take L2 Spanish with Maria Vasquez! You leave the class feeling more confident in communicating in Spanish.",
    "No. It is very boring and hard, the work is excessive and unhelpful, and most students in the class have no motivation or drive to care. I am taking it for a language credit, as is virtually everyone in the course. Everything learned in class could be leaned faster and more effectively from the textbook.",
    "Yes. Good conitnuation from L1 and transition to L3 to perfect Spanish and course well organized",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "Yes, if you want to further your learning of Spanish.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in the work to learn basic Spanish.",
    "Yes, definitely if you are interested in learning Spanish"
