                "Problem solving, critical thinking, assessing air quality studies and issues, atmospheric chemistry.",
                "I learned about air pollution dynamics, causes, and management, past and present, and developed strategies to understand and address air quality issues. I also learned more about computational methods for data analysis through the final project.",
                "Great introductory overview of air pollution issues, air chemistry with various pollutants, policy regimes adopted to mitigate air pollution, and a general introduction to the thought approach to managing issues of pollution. Very well-taught course that emphasized student learning and put us through practical exercises in class and for homework assignments, rather than pointless pset problems that seem tangentially related to the course material. Well organized and taught. Highly recommend.",

                "Strengths: This class was probably my favorite class this semester! Professor Gentner is incredibly caring and commutative; the class content is taught in a way that incorporates group activities and active learning methods, and Professor Gentner is constantly looking for ways to improve / adapt his teaching style so that it's accessible to everyone; the content of the course itself was extremely interesting and relevant while not being overly difficult workload wise.\r\nWeaknesses: Absolutely NONE! Amazing class, amazing professor, I have no complaints!",
                "I liked how the course was structured around building up a framework for how to analyze air quality problems, and I thought that I had a pretty good understanding of the material by the end. I also liked the way the class was split between lecture and group activities to help us stay engaged. I did feel like some of the group activities were not giving us enough direction (the discussion questions were sometimes pretty vague) so it was a bit confusing at times to know what we were supposed to discuss and our group discussions sometimes reached dead ends.",
                "Strengths: strong focus on student learning, interactive environment, Professor Gentner's lively energy, support from TA and TFs, practical exercises, in-depth exposure for undergrads",
                "In class activities were engaging and helped solidify concepts."

                "YES! Take this class! Professor Gentner is great and this class has made me want to take his grad level class. Also, this class has made me potentially want to study the atmospheric side of climate science in my future education.",
                "Yes, it was very helpful for the environmental engineering map.",
                "Yes, it's a really interesting course and (as far as engineering courses go) not too hard.",
                "Yes, 100%. Professor Gentner is fantastic and the material is taught in an interesting way that actually stimulates you to think about air pollution issues critically, rather than merely memorizing facts and regurgitating them on assignments or exams. I really liked the course and I have found myself thinking about the material of the course quite often."
