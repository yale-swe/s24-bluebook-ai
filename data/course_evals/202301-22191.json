I gained insight on how to hone my creative abilities both in theater and any other aspect of life. I learned how to better work with others and learn that there was a way for group projects to be enjoyable. The way the course and assignments were set up, each group member had to do their part in a project in order for it to be successful and everyone in the class strived for success."

                "Actually make it a class about acting instead of getting-to-know-you group activities or teaching college kids how to work together.",
                "strengths --> great way to meet friends, if you are shy this is a great class for you to come out of your comfort zone, pretty simple class and not much work\r\nweaknesses --> im not sure if i learned anything new tbh. it was just a fun and chill class which I needed compared to my other very heavy work loaded classes",
                "Strengths: the Professor, the assignments, the morning pages, the class dynamics (and how well you get to know the people in your class)",
                "Strengths: really fun and easy going class. \r\nWeakness: some of the conversations regarding how we can better collaborate fid drag on a bit longer than it shouldve, but it was overall a fun class.",
                "This course's biggest strength was it's environment, as each session felt less like a class and more like a fun gathering of like-minded people improving one another. If I were forced to find a weakness, the only one I could come up with was that I did not have a chance to work with everyone in class over the semester.",
                "The class itself was something I looked forward to every week, and the readings were always interesting. Our guest speaker was also fantastic. The class dynamic was great, and I really enjoyed getting to know my professor and classmates in a way that is not a feature of most courses.",
                "Strengths - very safe space for breeding creativity by establishing collaboration contracts; Weaknesses - could be slightly more organized in terms of releasing the weeks work",
                "I feel like the journal pages could have been shorter, they were a large time commitment for a course that doesn't give you a writing credit.",
                "The course was ran very well and the structure of the assignments helped us build up to the final project. The first few assignments were about getting to know our classmates while learning the material through different exercises we would do in groups of 2 or 3. This was a really strong way to start off since the midterm and finals required working with others and being comfortable with each other was a huge part of it. Overall a great course and the only improvement I would say could be made was more explanation of the homework assignments the class before to avoid confusion when we arrive at class the next week."

                "Not at all if you want a real theatre class. Take it if you want a credit and a class that only meets once a week.",
                "yes if you want a fun and chill and easy class. be cautious that you do need to participate a lot in class and really not be super shy and come out of your comfort zone. great class if you want something creative, work well with others in group projects, and are vocal and active participant.",
                "Absolutely! You get to know a lot of students through the class, the assignments all have a clear intention, and Hal is incredible and gives great advice on what it takes to improve and succeed as an artist.",
                "Yes, if you want a fun, easygoing class.",
                "Absolutely. As a theater studies class, it seems to have some restrictive quality for people not pursuing the major or a similar one, but it truly was a blast and would benefit almost any Yale student.",
                "Definitely! Especially for students interested in theater, but the skills learned are applicable to every field in my opinion, and it perfectly encapsulates the first-year community that first-year seminars are meant to create.",
                "Yes - really pushes you out of your comfort zone and you learn creativity and collaboration skills applicable to success in any field.",
                "Yes I enjoyed the class, but I would want them to be aware that the workload is heavy for a first year seminar. Great environment though!",
                "I would highly recommend this class, especially for students who enjoy theater and wanted to continue in college but are not necessarily theater majors. I think most people with even a slight interest in theater can benefit from this class. It helped me learn to work with other people and taught me social skills as well as creative skills. As well, it gave insight to many aspects of theater that students are often not as much a part of in high school theater such as scriptwriting and designing the characters. This was the most fun class I took all year and I would high recommend it. It didn't even feel like a class at times and I was always excited to do the assignments and show up to class each week. It gave me something to look forward to and that meant a lot."
