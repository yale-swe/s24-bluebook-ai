I'd taken a statistics course in high school, so I had a surface-level understanding of the math itself, but I never learned how to do analyses in a computer program; this course made statistics accessible to me in the long run.",
                "I learned how to use a very cool software for statistics. I also learned to understand how studies are made. If I see a study for example in a journal, I can understand it and without reading the written report about it.",
                "I learned the inner working of data science and statistics.",
                "I gained a general overview of statistical analysis that expanded on basic statistics courses I took in high school. More than anything, this class gave me a degree of statistical literacy that was very useful in my other classes that required me to read a lot of sociological literaturethis class really allowed me to get more out of those readings and critically analyzing statistical studies in other fields.",
                "I learned basic concepts of statistics like probability and test methods",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: lots of resources and instruction\r\nWeaknesses: felt like heavy reliance on minitab, almost as a crutch",
                "Strengths: JDRS clearly puts in so much effort to make statistics engaging, and that's greatly appreciated. I also like how lectures are structured such that we can learn the mathematical premise for statistical analyses and then learn the simple way to use them on a computerized calculator. This course also made stats far more accessible than some others that would require students learn R or other coded analysis programs. I also LOVED that JDRS gave us the option of attending class in-person or completing lectures asynchronously using his recordings from the early pandemic years; that flexibility in my schedule was so useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I came into this course with a perhaps nave expectation that because it was designed for Political Science majors that we would draw political events and data into our learning, so I was somewhat disappointed when that wasn't a large aspect of our lectures. Other than that, I think this course made statistics as interesting as they could possibly be!",
                "Strengths of this course are that the professor is very nice and tried his best to teach a giant lecture in a fun and engaging way, homework is 40% of the grade so if you dont do well on the exams you can counter it by doing well on homework, and there are a ton of opportunities to get help. Despite all of this, this class was still quite hard for me as I am not mathematically inclined. I would not consider it a gut based on the material. There is also a TON of material taught in a short amount of time, so the class feels like it moves extremely fast.",
                "Strengths are the endless hours of office hours, there is a lot of help. The course is very well organized.",
                "It could be improved by having a section because it was difficult to learn the content in such a large lecture and although there was a lot of office hours, it was still hard to get individualized attention.",
                "This course can be a bit dry content-wise, but that's generally the nature of introductory statistics. JDRS made the course funny, low-stress, and engaging, even through the recorded modules. I would've liked to see S&DS 102/103 be more directly related to the political and social sciences, as I was excited to dive into examples of data analysis and stats in political science and felt that the course lacked that.",
                "JDRS makes stats actually interesting as he is a very engaging lecturer. The p-sets arent too difficult and you can usually go to office hours to figure them out, but they are a bit confusing if you try to do them on your own. The exams werent too bad either",
                "JDRS is a huge strength, as is the flexible format. Lectures were great, workload was very manageable but the homework helped me learn. The exams are very easy, which is nice, but still a helpful review to make sure you're learning. Really a great course all in all. Sometimes the grading seemed arbitrary, points would be taken off for random things that we did not know we had to do, but other than that it was awesome.",
                "Strengths: Asynchronous\r\nWeaknesses: I took the Political Science section but there was little to no engagement with political related topics",
                "Strengths: very accessible for students (pre-recorded lectures, in-person lecture, Zoom-in option, course content like lecture notes all available on Canvas);  weekly homework assignments generally matched the difficulty of questions asked on exams; JRDS as a prof; emphasis on learning rather than just grades \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading on homework could be a little bit tough; course content could be dry sometimes, but this is just the nature of introduction courses so that you can eventually learn about more interesting things",
                "Designed really well. Flexible lecture options and office hours (in person or remote or recorded if you want!) make this one of the best designed classes I've taken at Yale. I think it was truly really well done. JDRS is also an engaging lecturer and quite funny. And there were a lot of office hours to help whenever I was confused. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the TAs didn't really have the same information--so I'd go to office hours one day and be told one thing and then be told that it was wrong the next day. Or some TAs had never used minitab to do their work (the main program most people seemed to used, they had used R instead) and were less helpful with questions that involved minitab. I wish that in that information was available on the page with all the TA information so I could know whose office hours to go to.",
                "strengths: flexible, all the material is readily available for you weaknesses: if you're not self-motivated, it's really easy to get behind in class",
                "I loved that it was online because I could choose when to watch the lectures. However, sometimes it was difficult to keep up with what was going on in each lecture ( the explaining wasnt always great). The amount of office hours was great too.",
                "This course is extremely organized which is definitely a strength. We move at a good pace for understanding and comprehension. The weakness of this course is its lack of focus on political science when it is labeled as a polisci concentrated course. We didn't complete any polisci content.",
                "I LOVE the format the flexibility allowed me to have a balance schedule and engage with support from TAs when I can.",
                "Sometimes for one reason or another I had to skip a lecture, and in turn try to learn from the class notes. But it always felt that either on quizzes Homeworks or tests, these notes were severely lacking in the explanations of important topics. \r\nOffice hours also seem to be designed in a counterintuitive way: it seem the TA is only wanted you to go to office hours if you basically already knew the answerthey werent terribly open to getting you there. I understand TAs shouldnt just give me the answers, but if Im making an attempt to go to office hours I believe I have a right to be helped no matter what that help entails. \r\nI also think that the nature of tests was quite peculiar:\r\nFor starters it always seemed like they were testing our understanding of fundamentally different material than either the quizzes or the Homeworksmaking it quite hard to actually study for them. \r\nFurther, and I raise the issue early into the term with multiple TAs, The lack of partial credit on the first two tests was really detrimental to the learning process. If partial credit was removed because the scores were too high you are affectively punishing those students who actually prove their work and show demonstrated effort put into the classinstead of rewarding those who left how they got there ambiguous possibly helped out by cheating.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The course is phenomenally organized; in addition to live lectures and lecture notes posted on Canvas, the lectures are recorded and you can either view these lectures or the pre-recorded lectures online.\r\n- Professor JDRS and a couple of the TA's are amazing (a huge callout to Talat and Sarah!!!)! Visit office hours if you take this course!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The course is graded on a rather tough curve and learning the information can be very difficult... I don't know if it's a weakness of the lectures or simply the difficulty of statistics, but the information can be extremely hard to apply to tests and homeworks sometimes\r\n- Homeworks are very time consuming, and there are very few ways to prepare for tests (no practice tests or review sheets/material are provided)\r\n- I've heard from some TA's that cheating on exams is very common in the class and has been going on for years... I don't know if there's any way to address this but it makes the course more frustrating"

Students in other majors would be better served in other sections, but I think that a strong background in statistics is a really useful tool for PLSC majors. The ability to interpret statistics you see in media is so valuable, and it's a QR credit for Social Science majors! I would say, though, if you took statistics in high school, don't take this course expecting it to be easy. I tried to do that and ended up not doing as well on the first midterm as I would have liked because I was too complacent, so be prepared and put in the effort to make sure you actually know the material.",
                "If you took AP Stats in high school this course will probably be a lot easier for you than it was for me. I did not take AP Stats and felt behind. The teacher is good but moved very quickly. However, he is always very fair in the amount of time slotted to turn in assignment and exams. I would recommend if you are interested in stats but not if you are looking for an easy QR. Also, I never exactly understood how this stats course was specific to political science, all the material felt pretty general to me.",

                "I do recommend this course to other students who want a simple intro to stats but if they want a more practical QR credit I would much more recommend a calculus class. However, if the individual was interested in research, I would definitely recommend this class.",
                "If you have a low-key interest in S&DS and are looking to just get a feel for it or want a great and useful QR, absolutely. If you're hardcore into S&DS you may find it lacks rigor. It was a great, low-stress but intellectually stimulating way to learn the basics of S&DS and made me interested in continuing to take some more courses in the department. The class was extremely flexible and can effectively serve a wide array of students.",
                "Yes! Great QR for someone who isnt great at math and overall a good intro class",

                "Yes, if you would like to learn how to do statistical analysis",
                "If you are looking for an accessible QR credit (i.e., if you are not keen on Calculus or Economics), an intro stats course as a pre-req for the major/certificate, or you just want to learn important statistical analysis skills used in many careers, then absolutely! If you have a strong background in statistics, you might prefer the intensive version of the course typically offered in the spring semester or jumping straight into S&DS 230.",
                "Yes! I think this is the best math class I've ever taken.",
                "It is a good statistics overview for someone like me who hasn't taken a formal stats class before. It is a low workload, but nicely facilitates learning R if you want to.",
                "Yes. I loved the professors level of excitement and engagement that he approached each class with, and I feel like the teaching fellows were super helpful in aiding with understanding problem sets.",
                "I recommend this course to get your QR credit out of the way as a humanities major.",
                "Yeah go for it!",
                "It depends. If someone is hoping for a class that actually complements there learnings in the political science then dont take this class. If you are instead someone who loves Stats and maybe once a little bit of a foray into political science, dont take this class. This is just an intro to Statistics class in a poly-sci trenchcoat.",
                "There's both in-person and virtual options to take the course: I recommend attending in-person when you can, but it's great to have the virtual option to fall back on.",
                "If you want to learn stats to pursue research, to fulfill a requirement, or to pursue more advanced stats, I think you're in the right place. But be warned - this class takes a lot of work!"
