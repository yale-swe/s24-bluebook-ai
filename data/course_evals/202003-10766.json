                "The course is well-designed, and each of the guest lecturers contributes something unique and interesting with their lectures, though it might be helpful to suggest that students read the assigned review papers anytime between when they're posted and the discussion day (instead of reading all the papers between the lecture and discussion) so that they don't have to read 6-7 papers within the span of 2 days.",
                "strength - learned a lot from a variety of professors, group STEM work was a new experience that I enjoyed\r\nweaknesses - would like to do more proposing our own experiments, as that is where I feel I fell the most short on graded assignments",
                "This course was extremely well organized and I so enjoyed the weekly discussion sections, and the preparedness of everyone in the class.",
                "A wide range of diseases are discussed with several viruses and various genetic disorders. I think it would be nice if there were a lecture (preferably earlier in the semester) specifically dealing with cancer. A number of diseases pertinent to telomere biology or genomic (in)stability alluded to consequences in cancer, but without background knowledge on cancer and its mechanisms, this could have been missed by some students.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professors who presented at each weekly lecture and the topics\/papers selected for analysis and discussion.",
                "Strengths: getting to learn about a variety of diseases and to understand translational medicine, hearing from a variety of faculty who are each experts in their field, learning from my classmates and getting to hear their insights in the discussion sections; the TAs were very helpful in guiding our discussions and in providing feedback on our writing assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more guidance would have been helpful for both the mini-review and the final paper; sometimes the turnover time between the Monday lecture and the Wednesday discussion section was not enough to get through all the assigned readings, spacing out the work\/reading would have been nice (because we had basically no work to do from Wednesday-Monday); the diseases we studied were heavily focused on the DNA and RNA levels, and I personally would have appreciated learning about some diseases more from a protein\/signal transduction perspective.",
                "It would be nice to have more guidance writing the mini review and final proposal, as not all students have experience with this kind of writing, especially with the final proposal.",
                "I think that this course was difficult, by nature, to have on Zoom but that the professors and TAs did a great job adapting the course in an online setting. Strengths: inspiring professors and lectures, interesting source material, interactive weekly discussions\r\nI wish we had had more time to develop our proposal, and a scheduled one-on-one discussion time over Zoom (given the virtual constraints) discussing our proposal topic would have been very helpful!"

                "The Wednesday discussion sections worked surprisingly well over Zoom. We were able to all work on a Google Doc on our computers and talk to each other in our Zoom breakout rooms. Obviously being in person would have facilitated discussions better and would have afforded us the opportunity to get to know each other better, but overall, we were still able to collaborate well over Zoom.\r\nMost Monday lectures went very smoothly over Zoom.",
                "The break out rooms for discussion sections were a good attempt at fostering discussion, but often led to the same people being grouped together every week. \r\nOverall, having the entire class live (including the lectures) was very very important for this course and being able to meet so many different professors and learn about their research was really exciting!"
