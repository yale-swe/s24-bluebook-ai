                "So much to explain. One of the best skills I obtained from this course was the practical directing practice we received. Being able to direct my peers was the best use of my time. Also, learning how to dissect a play was great as well.",
                "This course truly helped me to shift my focus from thinking as a performer (focusing on one objective at a time) to thinking of the production as a whole. It helped me expand out of what's comfortable and safe and reminded me that taking risks and making mistakes are still an important part of the process."

                "Strengths: content, facilitators, venues\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: scheduling but this I think is subjective because you can't please everyone. It's possible that the schedule was best. Instinctively I want to suggest having the program be 12 days as opposed to 10 and making classes 2 hrs long as opposed to 3 and making the breaks (1 hrs long - which was actually done during the program I guess because it was asked). However, maybe in reality, it's fine as is.",
                "Strengths: It has quite abundant content that almost involves all areas of theatre work, and it tells me how to be a good person which, in my opinion, is much more important than technical skills. The teachers did not push me so hard, instead, they gave me time and space to adjust everything here which made me feel pleasant and comfortable.\r\nWeakness: At the first couple of days, the break time between two classes was kind of embarrassed, but after it changed to 1.5 hours, it became more reasonable",
                "The strengths are definitely the transparency, the care regarding our overall mental capabilities and the schedule. Although the schedule was tough, I felt that it was a great balance. The only weakness was the housing unit we were originally placed within. We should've been placed within a dorm that had air circulating.",
                "It was wonderful to know that the leadership team was reading the daily evaluations and addressing them\/making adjustments each and everyday to enhance the overall experience of the course."

And it also provides diverse activities of creating, cooperating, thinking and sharing.",
