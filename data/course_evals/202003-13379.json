                "The seminar felt mostly like a lecture. Definitely should include more student conversations. One-on-one meetings with professor halfway through course to check in would be great.",
                "In my opinion, the course was relatively surface-level. The topics covered were ones that do appear current events quite often, so if one isn't especially focused on the news it might appear novel. However, for those with substantial experience with the intersection of business, politics, interest groups, and the environment, this may not be a deep enough exploration of this topic.",
                "Strengths: professor Swenson's analysis of the US political scene over time, truly a pleasure to learn about. He could have done a better job facilitating discussion mid-lecture, but it was tough with zoom",
                "Very little can be improved upon for this course.",
                "The reading list for this course is really, really great. I learned so much about environmental politics--the good and the bad--and argument papers based on weekly readings were fun to write. I also enjoyed presenting about topics of interest to the class.\r\n\r\nThe class, despite being a small seminar, is mostly just Professor Swenson lecturing about the week's topic. Professor Swenson is a really knowledgeable professor, but lectures seemed slow, and at times, it seemed like Professor Swenson hadn't looked at the slides he was talking about since the previous semester. This felt a little bit like a missed opportunity, considering that I know that many students in the class were just waiting for an opportunity to chime in with thoughts.",
                "Strengths: I liked how each week focused on a clear, distinct topic but also allowed us to see some of the overlap between competing interests. I also appreciated the opportunity for student presentations. The readings were very eye-opening too. Weaknesses: I wish we had more time to specifically discuss the readings, since the seminar was structured more like a lecture.",
                "Amazing professor! The quality he expected for argument papers was very high though which required a lot of work and I am very unsure of my final grade",
                "I learned so much from all the readings, and Professor Swenson clearly knows this topic well. \r\n\r\nI wish there had been clearer guidelines for the student presentations--I didn't really know what I was supposed to do since I did mine at the beginning of the semester. I don't think I understood how open-ended the arguments could be, so I think it would have been helpful to see an list of a sample of arguments that students had made in past years. \r\n\r\nI felt like I would have wanted more guidance about the topic and structure of the final paper. Basically we were given a very brief prompt and told to write a 15 page paper during the last week of class for our final. I didn't expect the final to be such a large undertaking so it would have been good to have more advance notice about what the final would be like.",
                "I think the course could include more discussions rather than only lectures. I think this aspect of the course was hampered by the Zoom format, but it made it difficult to contribute to the course."

The instructor did his best at welcoming students to speak up, and it worked as well as can be expected. The instructors slides could use a little bit of polishing, but the content was clear.",

                "Honestly, it was really hard for me to stay engaged in this class with the online format. I felt like Professor Swenson tried to conduct the class as if it was in-person, with no modifications to make it work better over zoom. Unlike in some other seminars I took where professors were focused on creating community and changing things up to fit the zoom format, we never had any discussions in breakout rooms or got to know each other that well. It was really hard to stay attentive for a whole 2 hours on zoom--I think it would have helped if we were given a short break even for just a few minutes in the middle of class or something.",

There are so many misconceptions I hear all the time about the environment and now I have the know-how to rectify them (Thanksgiving arguments with climate denialists). The discussion is very chill and the class isn't demanding. Probably the most relevant to life but least relevant to a job classes I'll ever take.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes, and my hope as that even non-EVST\/PLSC majors would take this course. With anthropogenic climate change beginning to drastically effect many of our societal spheres, it is critical that more people understand what the environmental issues are, and who the promoters\/inhibitors of climate action are.",
                "Sure, if you're interested in environmental politics! Professor Swenson isn't teaching the class for much longer, but he's a great man who cares a lot about his students. The reading list and the opportunity to write papers and present is the best part of this class. Discussions, however, are mostly Professor Swenson lecturing about the weekly topic. This can be quite frustrating for students who are looking for a discussion-based class. It is nevertheless a good opportunity to get close to Professor Swenson and meet more people in the sustainability\/env. policy field at Yale.",
                "Yes, I thought the material was comprehensive and intriguing. The seminar itself can sometimes feel long, but there is a bit of freedom in the class to explore and write about a specific topic in environmental politics that you're interested in.",
                "Yes! AMAZING course",
                "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in environmental policy or environmental law.",
