It would have been helpful if there was a list of labs that past students had worked in for this project as well as those that ENVE professors run in order to get a sense of our options to choose from. In addition to this, it would have been helpful if the details about what the project entailed and the requirement of selecting a lab were provided before the semester started so that we could have smoothed out details before the semester even started. It may be good to have ENVE seniors start looking for labs in the fall even if they're taking the course in the spring. It took a little time to get into it and I would have been able to get more done if I had the details a little earlier!",
