                "Restrict the course to upperclassmen in order to facilitate learning and skip over basic concepts that took up a lot of the course time explaining to underclassmen and non-biological majors. Include more Professor-led lectures rather than purely relying on students to teach. Course would be much more beneficial in a seminar format. Grading should also be standardized by the teacher, rather than switching between TAs per week/assignment. Optimal class would be a professor-led lecture on course content followed by a student led presentation of relative research reports and papers related to that lecture. Again, smaller class size and heavier professor involvement with greatly improve the course.",
                "Good",
                "As a writing credit, this is on the lower workload side (in terms of amount of writing), which is appreciated because the content can be pretty difficult for nonBME majors (and thus may take more time to look over lectures and recordings to understand the content). It would be nice if the profs all did 30 minute mini lectures before the student lecture presentations instead of the students mostly teaching the whole course because it comes off as the professors interjecting only when questions are asked, rather than sharing the most important points of the weekly topic.",
                "The weekly synopses are a strength of the course as they ensure the students are focused and fully understand the lectures. However, the deadline was usually three days following the lecture, on a Saturday evening. I would consider this a weakness as the assignment felt rushed sometimes so that I could be available for other responsibilities over the weekend.",
                "Strengths: great professors and interesting lectures, especially since students put together presentations for some of the lectures. Weaknesses: the midterm / final essay are much more stringently evaluated than the synposes.",
                "The material was interesting and useful, but for smaller details, I liked the group project aspect of the course. Having snacks each class was a really generous thing to do from the professors! Being able to revise our midterm papers for the final was also really nice.",
                "Student-led presentations makes the class more engaging during your presentation, but content can be hard to follow depending on the topic",
                "Strengths: The material covered in the course is very relevant to many disciplines. It is clear that all of the professors are experts in their fields and it was very cool to learn from them. \r\nWeaknesses: The organization of this course really made it hard to fully appreciate the material.",
                "Weakness: student taught, so quality of lectures are not the best; workload of weekly synopsis was mostly set to 1.5-2 pages a week as opposed to the one page shown on the syllabus.\r\nStrengths: pretty chill otherwise, no exams",
                "I enjoyed the upper level feel of this class.",
                "The topics of this course are quite intriguing. Despite only meeting once a week, I felt as if that was an appropriate amount of time to review the material. One strength of the course is it being hybrid and the lectures being recorded. As for weaknesses, I can't think of any.",
                "Asking us to write consistently was a really good way to exercise writing, which is useful within this course, other courses, and in general. Many other classes don't require as much and it's easy to let that skill slip.",
