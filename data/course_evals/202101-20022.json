I learned a lot about trans people, who they are and aren't, who they might or might not be, and how they figure in and influence the world. I have an enhanced understanding of what transgender could (and should) mean, and a heightened appreciation for the complexity of this discipline. Loved everything I read and appreciated the intense challenge the material and subject-matter presented. Also appreciated the opportunity to learn in this important setting.",
                "Lots about the the trans studies canon, with special attention paid to race and intersectionality as well (more than I expected). As someone who has taken a lot of ER&M classes but never a WGSS or comparative class on gender or sexuality studies, it was a little intimidating keeping up, but I'm glad I did it because I've walked away with so much. Prof. LaFleur and Olivia were generous, too, about explaining things and meeting you where you are.",

                "This course was very eye-opening, especially for someone who had never taken a higher-level course like this before. The syllabus was great, and Professor LaFleur was a fantastic lecturer. However, it's definitely not an introductory class, and I would caution against taking it unless you have taken a 200-level WGSS class before.",

                "Yes, of course. It's a challenge and one you should take if you're interesting in understanding how the world became and becomes what it is (generally) as well as how trans people figure in and influence the world (specifically) and how trans studies mediates an important conversation about the (bad) state of the world and its (bad) history.",
                "This class is wonderful! Discussions were insightful, thoughtful, and interesting. The essays and novels we read will stick with me for a long time. This class and Professor LaFleur inspired a whole lot of thinking in and out of the classroom.",
