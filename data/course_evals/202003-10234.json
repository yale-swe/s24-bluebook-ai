                "This was a fantastic course, as both a Bible class and an English course. It was very different from any other English class I've taken, but it helps that Mr. Brisman emphasized intellectualizing the Bible, meaning considering it not necessarily only as a religious text but also as a body of work written by different authors. I think out of all the English class I've taken, it was the one in which historical context mattered most, which was valuable to consider.",

                "The course helped fine-tune a lot of grammatical challenges in my writing and challenged me not to write along with a strict argument.",

                "Mr. Brisman was great at encouraging participation and demonstrating his value of student voices in class. I think I might have been helpful to spend some more time in class focused solely on the secondary texts concerning the synoptic problem and the documentary hypothesis, although I appreciated the required response papers on those topics.",
                "I wouldn't change anything about this course! Some of my favorite parts of the class were the introductory writing assignments in which we were asked to put the introduction of the New Jerusalem Bible translation in conversation with the writings of other biblical scholars and the requirement\/encouragement to consult a piece of literary criticism in writing our three essays. This introduction to and participation in the greater field of biblical literary criticism was a strength of the course. Another strength was Prof. Brisman's teaching style of making many analogies to current events. The constant reminder of the relevancy of the course material to our daily lives made each discussion and this feel all the more important.",
                "I loved how discussion-based classes were: we had remarkably intriguing and lively discussions every class. Mr. Brisman would also give an interesting introduction at the beginning of every section, but I wish those introductions would be a little bit longer and more like mini-lectures!"

                "Definitely. The Bible is a book that everyone should read and understand because of its importance in Western literature and this course is a great opportunity to read it in an academic environment.",
