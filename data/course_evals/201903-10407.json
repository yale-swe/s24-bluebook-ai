    "A lot of knowledge about different artists and art styles. Very interesting readings about art and its relationship with language.",
    "As someone who has enjoyed making visual art since before I could speak, this course taught me to fall in love with it all over again. The combination of exciting prompts assigned each week and the creative freedom we had to complete them made me so much more invested in my artwork than I expected. I learned to explore and combine mediums that were familiar and unfamiliar to me, and also to trust my instincts much more than I am used to in fact-based classes, a strategy I also carried over into my writing class this semester. Additionally, I learned how to consider and comment on my other classmates art in the critique period that was held once a week. Lastly, I gained experience discussing and analyzing literature about art since we were assigned books and excerpts to read each week."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Critiques were very engaging and interesting, projects had a lot of room for creativity, and readings were eye opening.",
    "Strengths: I really appreciated the small class size, how passionate Professor Rodman (he preferred that we call him Halsey) is about what hes teaching, the freedom of choice we had when creating our projects each week as well as the final project, the very useful comments Professor Rodman offered as we worked on our final projects, our fantastic TA from the Art School, the $80 budget for our final projects, the multiple field trips we took to the Yale Art Gallery, and finally how unerringly kind and joyful Professor Rodman is! \r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I would mention is that since this is a first year seminar and not a high-level course, during the period set aside for critiques each week, all the comments about each piece of art were positive. Although its great to have positive reinforcement, I think that it would be normal to intersperse constructive criticism as well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, very interesting art class even if you are not an artist. Great way to learn about art while also practicing it.",
    "YESS!! Dont you dare think twice about it! Professor Rodman is an amazing person who will light up your day twice a week for the whole semester. And, of course, you get to make art! I cant count how many times I have thought about how much less wonderful my first semester at Yale would have been if I had not taken Words and Pictures. My love for this class never fluctuated, whereas I disliked my other classes at least once during the semester."
