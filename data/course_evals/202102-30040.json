Galaxy type, characteristics\r\n4.

And in this course, I started again to calculate figures and think in a more logical way, which was a very delighting experience.\r\nSecond, I found something special in this course. I took this course in Shanghai, China at midnight those weeks, and the nights and darkness really encouraged me to do some philosophical thinking, i.e. about the universe, the meaning of our life, and our destinies. \r\nIn addition, I think it is really good to know the abcs about astronomy, since it is somehow quite embarrassing that as an earth resident, I have never been able to figure out why the sky looks blue. This course via providing me with some basic understanding of the universe and us, helps enrich my learning experience and also life experience: it made feel more COMPLETE.",

                "This course is interesting, but having class everyday was a bit overwhelming. Maybe its because I was taking 2 summer classes, but I feel as though the abundance of time made it harder for me to gauge what exactly to study/what we would be tested on.",
                "I somehow think the the last chapters are a little over-difficult while the first several ones are much too easy, which failed to make this course in terms of the difficulty level very \"gradual\" in a sense. However, I still want to announce that it is my favourite course of the year! The instructor and the TAs are really nice, knowlegeable, and extremely responsible at their work. And also, the textbook and the lectures worked well with each other: when sometimes I had trouble understanding the lectures, I coud always turn to the texbook, and vice versa.\r\nAnd I think the best thing was that I could always find my helpers, the Prof and the TAs when I was in need. As a language major, I found it hard to fully understand the contents of the course; throughout the course, to help me with that, the TAs and our Prof displayed great patience and their extraordinaly knowledge, via writing and replying to the emails, and offering the students adequate office hours, discussion sessions, and many other channels through which the students could explore the unclear concepts and ideas. I was moved and grateful, since due to my location, it was not very convenient for the TAs to receive my messages every time, but they truly wanted to help and we finally solve the location problem. Everyone was just so nice in this course!",

And owing to him, I agree that astronomy is something very fascinating and should be learned at least at the abc level, since it is so interesting and very relative to our real life.\r\nVia learning astronomy, I found out that compared with the universe, I am negligibly small. Due to that, I abandoned some unnecessary worries in my recent life and managed to have a fresh start. I think this \"philosophical thinking\" will help every student participating in this course.",
