   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Mostly good; should be 1 credit (it took more time than Organic Lecture). Good thing it is curved by TA since there is a lot of variation in grading.",
    "Strengths: Workload is very manageable. There isn't a lot of wasted time, and labs finish up early. Most labs are genuinely interesting and fun to complete. Professor DiMeglio is very accessible and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading seems trivial at times, and more time is spent making sure that your assignments are formatted right than learning content.",
    "Strengths - environment focused on learning\/not results, expectations and goals for assignments and lab were clear\r\nAreas to improve - techniques such as TLC get repetitive after a few labs, discrepancy between Gas",
    "Clearer rubrics of expectations for lab reports.",
    "The lab is good a teaching techniques, but I feel like much of the course is based on the procedural details of writing responses.",
    "This course is very helpful because it relates to lecture, so the classes reinforce each other's concepts, making all of the content easier to remember. The lab is also well-run and clean. A potential improvement could be streamlining of information in the course. There is a large course packet, but sometimes the content is repeated in other places, or another resource is required, and that can get a little confusing. Fortunately, the instructor and TAs are always there to answer questions.",
    "Dr. DiMeglio is amazing! She is so kind and you can tell she loves organic chemistry and loves interacting with students.",
    "Ideally we would be able to work on lab techniques more, but there are only so many weeks in a semester. Realistically, I dont think this course could have been improved.",
    "Strengths: Nice being able to use top-notch chem facilities and perform experiments\r\nWeakness: I never understood what I was doing-I just followed the procedure",
    "I think the actual labs were really interesting and fun, but the focus on outside assignments were really frustrating. It often felt like we were being graded on our structure and formatting, not our content or knowledge of chemistry. Also, it was difficult to feel like the different sections were equal when some TAs gave 3\/10s and others always gave 10\/10.",
    "The strength of this course was its course packet that not only guided us through the introduction of new chemical concepts\/equipment, but also walked us through experiments and had us think about why we were performing certain techniques.",
    "Strengths\r\n-taught well (the course packet is clear)\r\n-not overwhelming  (Dr. DiMeglio is super nice and doesn't make you feel bad when you make a mistake)\r\n-interesting and useful\r\n-low workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-The post lab assignments sometimes had questions that seemed a bit unnecessary",
    "I felt that the grading of the PL assignments was not always fair. At times, especially on the first PLA, I lost a substantial number of points on formatting errors that were not specified as even requirements anywhere. In hindsight I understood how to improve for PLB, but the lost points in PLA for formatting not content could have been avoided had I been given clearer expectations.",
    "Strengths: The labs were organized and moved along at a good pace - we spent a few weeks learning the basic techniques and then progressively the labs got more and more complex. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading in this class is heavily dependent on just a few assignments (PLA \/ PLB \/ final). The individual EP's aren't worth anything ,really. A bit different compared to gen chem lab, where grading was spaced out evenly between every single lab report.",
    "It is very individual and helps you feel like a competent chemist but there is not a lot of outside class help or interaction on assignments.",
    "I felt like the grading in this course was way too harsh.  It had me focusing on my grades rather than learning a lot of the time.",
    "The course is a good intro to organic chemistry lab techniques. Some of the experiments are a bit confusing. There also is not enough transparency in the grading process of PL's and EP's; it seems very dependent on the TA. Standardization in grading and pre-lab lectures would benefit the course.",
    "This courses's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: it places a great deal of emphasis on minutiae while also moving at a very quick pace. A student who manages to keep at the class's pace and keep a handle on the minutiae will thus do fairly well in the course and learn a great deal. I frequently found myself struggling to maintain the pace and handle the minutiae simultaneously, but with a few notable exceptions, I managed to fall back on the resources available to me to ensure I remained on pace.  However, in the case of those notable exceptions, I felt almost as if I had nowhere to go, as my failure was neither of understanding nor affecting my grade significantly, but simply required time and practice I felt I did not have and did not feel it deserved in order to address it.  I believe that the solution to this problem would be regularly scheduled time set aside for appointments with an educator involved with the class, which would have made me feel I had space to take up educators' time to address my concern.",
    "Amazing instructor and class was very organized. Could be improved by having TA's be more uniform. Some grade easier than others.",
    "Strengths: good course pace, manageable workload, empathetic professor, informative labs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading is highly variable based on TA which causes some unneeded stress, final is really short but is worth a significant portion of the grade, some poorly worded questions result in confusion",
    "Strengths: The experiments can be very interesting, and the autonomy was a refreshing change from Gen Chem lab. By writing our own EPs and performing the experiments ourselves, engagement during experiments was much higher than it would have been in a different class setting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a very big discrepancy in grading between those who have lab earlier in the week (Monday) and those who have lab later (Friday). As someone who had Monday lab, many people would ask me how a particular experiment is, what answers I responded for certain assignments, what questions were on the lab final, et cetera. This is an inherent problem with the course that I'm not sure how one would fix, aside from the fact that I requested Friday lab to fit with my schedule better and was not given Friday lab as an option. This should be adjusted in the future in order to accommodate those who need special attention.",
    "The biggest weakness is that it is difficult to know how to do well, especially on the first post-lab assignment.  The TAs have a very specific rubric where they look for things that weren't explicitly asked for.  The biggest strength of the course is that it is a reasonable workload and you develop a good understanding of how and why different lab techniques and tests work.",
    "Strengths: Very friendly\/helpful for people who have never been in a chem lab before\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grades are very heavily weighted on a few large assignments! It would be nice if there were more even distribution of points",
    "Strengths  lab environment is very welcoming and non-stressful, TAs and Dr. Dimeglio are very approachable, learned a lot of valuable lab skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  lap EPs can get overwhelming and overly pedantic, as more stress is put on the tiniest formatting errors than actual comprehension of the science",
    "I think that this course could be improved if it was graded a little more leniently. I also think that it didn't supplement what we were learning in organic chemistry enough.",
    "Strength:\r\n- very hands on (as expected from a lab course) but importantly trains a variety of skills with enough repetition to build strong habits and skills (e.g. TLC)\r\n- routine, expectation made clear\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- experience of lab course depends on the level of preparation that the student came in with (some are able to finish labs in 2 hours that would take others 4 hours)\r\n- not super closely guided, depends on initiative to ask question to TA and\/or classmates\r\n- possible or even easy for someone to follow along the course packet without understanding what the steps are meant to achieve",
    "Doing all the prelabs and EPs can be annoying and tedious, but I see their point. The equipment is nice in the lab, and everybody is quite friendly.",
    "Make this course worth more than 0.5 credits. Otherwise a wonderful course.",
    "It was well-designed in the lab, but it would be better suited if it matched up more with the organic chemistry lecture.",
    "Strengths- well-organized",
    "The main strength of the course is that it introduces students to a wide variety of lab techniques. There are no major weaknesses of the course.",
    "I wish Dr. DiMeglio taught more. She is really nice and smart but I never got to see much of her. \r\nMost people will say that this class is so much better than gen chem lab, but honestly I disagree. I liked gen chem lab because you knew that if you put the work in you would get a good grade, and you knew that Dr. G would help in office hours.\r\nAlso the grading is frustrating and you have no idea what your grade is until the end. The final exam holds so much weight, and it's all multiple choice, which is annoying.",
    "there was a little too much emphasis on memorizing\/testing really specific safety info in the first couple of weeks, and it felt like there was no need to that and that its main purpose was to start to create a grade curve. obviously safety is important but i'm not sure that this lab approached it in the most reasonable way. otherwise the labs we did were interesting and i really liked that we got to use some techniques over and over in new labs because this way i not only got better at doing them but also inevitably got a better conceptual understanding of what i was doing.",
    "Some of its strengths were that it built skills up progressively the culminated in some synthesis labs. It built skill sweek by week and never asked that we try too many new things all at once.",
    "I thought it was cool to be making new products and crystals every week. Sometimes if the reaction wouldn't go properly, the experiment would take way longer than expected which was quite annoying.",
    "This lab course was great in the sense that it connected lecture material to the labs in a meaningful way. In comparison to Gen Chem Lab, these experiments felt like they had a greater purpose. That being said, it was relatively easy to become discourage in the longer labs. Perhaps if even more attention was paid to supporting students, this could be avoided.",
    "Not enough feedback, I don't understand why we could not collaborate with each other",
    "Strength of this course is the structure of assignments. Only having two post lab assignments allows students to focus more on the lab techniques and on understanding them. Having review questions and then a final exam is also very helpful. This structure (in contrast to gen chem lab, which assigned hours and hours of busy work that taught me nothing) was actually conducive to mastery of the lab techniques, and was far less painful. The course could be improved by having standard grading on the Eps. My TF was an incredibly strict grader, taking off lots of points for simple mistakes, or things that didnt even seem like mistakes. People in other sections did not have this problem, and were able to enjoy lab more with less stress. Perhaps having a standard grading rubric for TFs to follow could solve this problem.",
    "Strengths - not as stressful as Gen Chem, well organized course, EPs were helpful\r\nWeakness - N\/A",
    "This course felt useful in some ways, but a waste of time in others. I felt that the quizzes were an inaccurate measurement of the student's knowledge. The grading was also very nit picky.",
    "The course is well taught and teaches a great mix of both technical skills and organic chemistry knowledge.",
    "The course was good other than the fact that the course packet was a little disorganized at some points which made it hard to understand what we were supposed to do, but that was only for a couple experiments.",
    "There are no weaknesses to this class. It was amazing experience and the labs were great! Synthesis is fun...",
    "I though there should have been more explanation\/help with the pre-lab lectures, more explanation and help in the packet for the final, and way less IR spectra stuff since it was very painful to look at.",
    "Strength was that the material in the lab aligned with the material we were learning in CHEM 220 so it was nice to follow along. Weakness was the discrepancies in grading between TA's that made it hard to really estimate grades.",
    "Much more engaging than gen chem lab. You're not just doing the same thing every week in orgo lab which was good.",
    "Had a reasonable expectation of the students that pushed me without making me afraid of messing up. I was very comfortable asking if I was unsure of something.",
    "Strengths: The experiments were generally a lot of fun and I really liked how low stress it was in that the yield did not matter. What mattered was if we understood the reasoning behind the low yield and if we knew where we messed up in the experiment and how we can improve it. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that grading was very inconsistent between the different TAs which wasn't really fair. I also felt that some the reports we had to do were unclear with the directions (in PLA, there was a question where we had to list at least 2 reasons for each part but this was not stated in the question and a lot of people lost a lot of points).",
    "Class was fine, but your entire experience is shaped by your TA. If you have a bad TA, you will have a bad experience in this course.",
    "The strength is that this course is pretty fun and chill. The labs don't take that long, the EPs don't take that long, and the other two large assignments are not too difficult and do a good job of summing up the work you've done so far in the course. That said, I feel like the chemical table section of the EP was pretty useless. The information wasn't hard to find online, just pretty tedious, and drawing the structures of all the molecule was also pretty tedious. Having the information available during the lab is important, but spending 30 minutes looking up the boiling point of six different benzene derivatives is kind of superfluous.",
    "Weaknesses: Chem draw was useless and seemed like a waste of time. The grading was also sometimes harsh and seemed irrational. For example, getting 5 points off for starting a sentence with numbers? Seemed excessive. \r\n\r\nStrengths: It was interesting to see how the reactions played out.",
    "The biggest strengths of this course are the large time slot to conduct full experiments, the resources available (we each get our own lab hood with our own equipment!), the excellent instructor, and the way the lab itself is managed to facilitate learning. The lab is very wonderfully tailored to each individual student. My only issue was, coming in with very little knowledge of how to work in a lab, I felt like I was thrown into a laboratory setting and told to just \"go.\" I can't imagine how this can be improved in any way-- maybe more explanation about the experiment during lab lecture at the beginning?",
    "This class is amazing for learning a lot about lab techniques in organic chemistry.",
    "The strengths of this course definitely lie in how helpful all the TAs and the instructors were. They were always willing to answer questions and were constantly checking in to see that everything was on course and safe. A weakness was that some of the assignments, such as EPs or Post-Labs, were unclear and a little ambiguous.",
    "Strengths:  Very laid back environment that really allows for unadulterated learning.  I was never nervous or anxious about coming to lab.  The instructors were helpful, and I found the relaxed and \"at your own pace\" culture to really help facilitate a better understanding of the material, instead of the grades and accuracy of the data.  \r\n\r\nAreas of improvement:  If we would complete post lab assignments with our peers, that would help us learn some of the materials better.  When I wasn't able to work with others, I lost a lot of points on formatting and material mistakes that I could have learned through a peer.",
    "It was a lot of fun and it was well structured. It can improve by having more help on learning how to improve yield and improve our techniques further.",
    "Strength : EPs and preparations before lab made it go a lot smoother than gen chem \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: having the final be worth so much yet not really focusing much\/teaching the concepts on the exam explicitly was a bit annoying",
    "Overall, the course was very good. One thing that I think could have been improved is the course packet, which was a little bit hard to understand and use initially.",
    "dimeglio is amazing and so welcoming. the TAs are great and nothing could be improved.",
    "Interesting experiments, and I liked how they built on one another.",
    "This course has a lot of issues. For instance, there is a ton of inconsistency in the grading and the expectations for assignments. From week to week we had EPs due as assignments, but we often had to guess what was supposed to be included in them. One week you would omit one thing and no points would be taken off, the next week you would omit the exact same thing and you would lose a point. It's totally fine to have certain things be worth points, but I believe that rubrics should be released and given to students so that we can give instructors what they want. Otherwise, no one is really learning anything - it's all just luck and guesswork. I feel like there especially needed to be rubrics for the big post lab assignments. These were worth a significant portion of our grades, but we had no idea how they were going to be graded. Additionally, more points could be lost than given out! This makes absolutely no sense. If you want something to be done by students and consider it to be important, then have it count as a point value for the grade. You cannot have it both ways by being able to deduct from nothing. No one should be able to get a negative score on an assignment, despite its unlikelihood. The quizzes also had pretty unclear expectations. They did correlate to what students assumed to be the major topics, nor did they pull from information that we directly discussed. Lastly, directions in lab varied from lab instructor to instructor. Some would say that something was fine to do, so you would do just that, then another person would come around and give you a 5 minute lecture that you shouldn't do that. There should be consistency between these instructors about what they are all going to enforce, teach, etc. Otherwise, it's just a confusing mess for students. I also wonder if splitting lab into more experience students or less experienced students might help. The more experienced students just stressed out less experienced students, and they were also certainly more bored and less interested. Perhaps, offering an advance organic lab 1 might help all students have a better lab experience.",
    "I think the EP structure really just encourages low engagement. PLAs are helpful for synthesis and learning, but the EPs felt like busy work. It also is a lot of work to be just 0.5 credits.",
    "Strengths: the labs themselves are not stressful and very conducive to actually learning.\r\nWeaknesses: there are barely any major assignments so the final counts for a ton.",
    "Strengths - good intro to lab techniques\r\nWeaknesses - grading and what was wanted from certain assignments was difficult to understand",
    "The course could be improved by having the TA's be more explicit about what they want. There seemed to be inconsistencies in the way each TA graded.",
    "This course was very good at helping us understand how to do various lab techniques. It could be improved by describing the practical application of some of the methods we use and in what situations they are necessary. For example, I do not know what type of synthesis requires reflux but I do know how to do it.",
    "Strengths - reactions are very cool and time in the lab is well spent. Weaknesses - the PLAs are awful. It'd be better if there were a few more questions in the EPs. The grading of the PLAs really hurts because many students put in many hours and then it feels like you get 20% taken just for formatting that you tried to pay attention to but couldn't because there were roughly 1000 rules about it. Overall, cool and engaging class but some of the grading (also the IR worksheet) feels like it's out to get you even if you're giving it everything you have. The grading feels like it's intentionally trying to trip you up and doesn't really care if you're learning anything or not. Also, if some of the grading was more based on content and less on formatting or weird other stuff, people would have more energy to put into actually learning\/absorbing the material because they wouldn't be spending hours reviewing dozens of random rules that don't have much to do with the material.",
    "This course did what it needed to do in terms of teaching the basics of organic chemistry laboratory research.",
    "it was structured really well",
    "The course went step by step and assumed no prior knowledge of organic chemistry. The slow introduction really helped to ease into the course while learning a lot about the reactions. The reactions were all very interesting to watch unfold, and each one was explained thoroughly so that we knew what was happening. I learned a lot of chemistry by doing so much and reading about the background of each reaction and technique. My only suggestion for the course is for the course packet to be updated. There were some errors my friends and I found. An answer key (maybe even compiled by the TFs) would also be useful for the questions at the end of each lab, which would help to study.",
    "strengths: run much better than Gen Chem lab - cured my lab PTSD because doing EPs can be annoying, but definitely helps you prepare for what you need to do in lab\r\nweaknesses: it just...wasn't interesting...we did things like checking off a to-do list but there wasn't anything fascinating about it",
    "It requires a lot of self instruction from the course packet, but if you read the course packet then it thoroughly explains everything.",
    "I think the course is a good introduction to lab techniques, but it would be helpful if there was more connections between what we learned in class and the experiments we did in lab.",
    "lots of emphasis was placed on PLA and PLB without that much guidance. But, you just need to ask for help!",
    "Overall the course isn't bad and it's very reasonable. It would help if some of the experiments were done by the staff\/TFs a bit more before we had to do them because they don't always work even if you follow the instructions exactly (this was a repeat problem for people not just me)",
    "No final exam.",
    "The course is very conducive to learning as there is usually ample time during each session to ask questions and complete the experiments.",
    "I have absolutely no complaints. Its a great course, the teacher is super nice and flexible with deadlines (if you are respectful), and its fun.",
    "The course can be quite different depending on your TA. I felt like my TA did not explain\/ teach the material enough and graded unfairly. The grades are curved according to your specific lab section, but I felt like I was not learning as much as students in other TA groups. Also, the grading is different depending on what the TA wants to take off for.",
    "Strengths: Very structured and organized. TAs very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Didn't know how much to study for when quizzes and exams came around because there was so much information in the Course Packet. Would like if there was a more narrow approach to the especially important topics.",
    "A strength is that you really learn how to do many experiments on your own. It could be improved by providing students with more help on how to do the experiments. Also, the quizzes are very hard and they should not test material that we have not learned in lab.",
    "good practice of the techniques",
    "Strength: It got me to gain all of the skills it taught in a very efficient manner and allowed mistakes in the course of lab to not affect too much\r\nWeakness: Even though everything ends up curved by TA, I got the feeling that different TAs' students definitely had to put in vastly different amounts of effort",
    "There were many strengths to this course- it's very well organized and relaxed, but conducive to learning. Sometimes it felt like our assignments were returned quite late, but overall it was good!",
    "strengths: course packet contains key information needed to prepare for lab, all experiments are doable within the given time frame",
    "The course was well structured in that we learned about the background behind the experiments through the experimental procedures. One improvement could be that there could be more tests or ways to review before the final exam.",
    "Strengths: Course was well organized, expectations were always clear. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing related to the teaching of the course. I personally disliked lab because of the long hours, but it's not as long as gen chem lab. Also, being in an earlier section was frustrating because later sections would always do better as they could ask more questions (and ask about the questions). I believe this was taken into account during grading though.",
    "The TAs and instructors were very present and willing to help during lab -- the environment was well-supported. However, grading is harsh, so it is beneficial to get reports done early and go to office hours\/schedule a meeting with your TA before turning them in",
    "Coming into this lab course, I had never had any experience in a chemistry lab while everyone else in my lab group did. I was the only first year in my section, which was difficult and anxiety-producing throughout the semester, but I think I was able to get the hang of it by the end with the help of my amazing teaching fellow who was always willing to help and answer questions. It could be improved by potentially having the option to have a lab partner for the first few labs to help the first year students in organic chemistry who have no lab experience. This would help people like me feel more comfortable learning the procedures and not feel thrown into the deep end. In addition, the final exam did not seem to be a completely accurate reflection of the course, and I think it would be more fair if it did not have such a large weight in our final grade.",
    "Again I feel like students especially premed need to be taught why they have to learn this.",
    "More weight could be put on more than just 3 assignments.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Dr. DiMeglio is lovely\r\n- Great TA's (in my experience)\r\n- Effective practice for bench techniques\r\n- Level of difficulty of EPs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Amount of work for only half a credit",
    "Strengths: no weekly lectures or quizzes. everything about this course is a huge step up from general chemistry lab. do not let a horrible gen chem lab experience scare you away from Dr. Dimeglio's course. Even though the total number of students enrolled is high, Dr. DiMeglio makes a huge effort to talk meaningfully with each student. She hold everyday office hours and is kind and patient. \r\nWeaknesses: The lab final was tough to prepare for, even though we were given lots of study questions. A practice final would have been helpful.",
    "Some TA's have harsh grading, and sometimes the grading rubric has been very vague. Otherwise, it was a very engaging class and I learned a lot of lab skills.",
    "There needs to be more teaching. We were expected to know lab report formatting and laboratory procedures that the TAs simply did not explain to us. \r\nAs a result, I just got bad grades on written assignments and barely learned anything. The students (especially pre-meds and chem majors) were extremely stressed which created a toxic competitive atmosphere.",
    "A strength of this course is its organization and the instructor. Every lab built off the last. There was a good mixture of new techniques and repeated techniques.",
    "Strengths of this course include the friendly staff of the organic chem lab, and DiMeglio being so nice and willing to talk about chemistry. There is also a little bit more independence in organic chem lab, which is freeing because, as a junior taking this lab, I am mature enough to do these laboratory procedures on my own. Weaknesses of this course include the variability of leaving from this course (you always have to leave by 5pm, but other groups got out super early while others got right at 5) and the strict rubric of grading the Experimental Plans (EP's) and Post-Labs (PLA\/B). The strict rubric usually took off points for things like \"data table was not all on one page\" or \"questions asked for reasons, instead of reason (must give two or more reasons for a certain process)\". The strictness of the rubric therefore took off points for things that do not matter in the grand scheme of things, like understanding the experiments or experimental procedures. Often I was more focused on formatting than the concepts, and in turn lost most of my points on conceptual questions. Perhaps it was teaching use to write experimental plans as a good scientist, but it seemed too strict. Also, the difference between CHEM 134\/6L and CHEM 222\/3L in terms of formatting was very hard to get used to, so perhaps standardizing doing lab write-ups\/EP's would be good.",
    "Strengths: This course seems great to me. This science itself was really cool, and doing your own synthesis is extremely satisfying. The course packet is FANTASTIC. I really appreciated that the model of a good experimental summary included a description of losing half the product by spilling it and that we were encouraged not to come to lab if we were too sick to act safely. These touches made it clear that we were not expected to be superhumanly perfect even before we set foot in the lab.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You're on your feet for four straight hours dealing with dangerous chemicals. But that's just how it has to be :\/\r\n\r\nImprovements: Towards the end of the semester I found out about the option to come in and finish experimental on a different day. This was super helpful for relieving time pressure, and I wish I'd known about it earlier. Maybe mention it in the course packet?",
    "strengths: course packet very detailed and the TA was very helpful in lecturing before, answering questions , and throughout the experiments\r\nweaknesses: no rubric given for literally anything, which would be really helpful especially for the post-lab assignments worth a lot of the grade. also, no partners ever, which contributed to a very stressful environment for everyone.",
    "Clear instructions and setup for course, lots of resources to come in ready for lab",
    "This course is well organized and the instructors are all amazing. Labs helped with understanding concepts covered in class.",
    "Strengths: Freedom to students and the fact that we were not graded by percent yield and experimental results\r\nWeaknesses: Directions were very long-winded, too much room for interpretation, very strict guidelines and expectation with little room for error, unfair grading by TA",
    "I thought there was a big difference among the different TAs when it came to grading. Although Dr. D told us that the grades would be adjusted, it still made many students feel panicked.",
    "Strength of the course was the experimental plans to help you understand the experiment beforehand and cut down on in lab reading without the pressure of a quiz like in CHEM 134L and the two post-lab writeups to help with concept understanding\/preparation for the final.",
    "The course is well organized for teaching students these important skills. There are a lot of resources available, from the very thorough course packet to Dr. DiMeglio's weekly reminders, and the labs themselves were never too difficult or too long. Although I was sometimes stressed or strapped for time, that's definitely my fault instead of the course's.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that the final grade almost entirely depends on the two post-lab assignments and the final exam, which made some of the other work feel somewhat meaningless. This could be improved with a greater variety of assignments or possibly splitting up the post-labs so the grade doesn't feel so concentrated. Another weakness was that, in my personal opinion, the labs weren't particularly interesting, but I can understand that an introductory organic chemistry lab is limited. I'm not sure if that can really be improved.",
    "I did not like how insignificant the EPs were in terms of grade percentage. Furthermore, the TA grading system seemed unfair. But overall much better than general chemistry lab.",
    "I think that grading for this course could have been clearer, there should be a rubric so that we know what we are graded on and what is expected.",
    "A very laid back and supportive atmosphere in lab that really helps with learning and getting through the lab",
    "This course has a strong support system. The professors and TA's are usually available to help students. However, no review sessions were held for the final exam. In the future, a review session would boost students' understanding of the concepts.",
    "This course is very good at helping you further understand organic chemistry concepts.\r\nThere is nothing that needs to be improved.",
    "Strengths-my specific TA was very kind and helpful and available to answer questions\/concerns during lab\r\nWeaknesses-could be more opportunities to discuss the purpose of labs beforehand and more communication between professors\/TAs and students",
    "It was very well organized and instructions were super clear.",
    "Didnt really feel like I learned much. Too much of the class was weighed on just 2 assignments that I feel were not fairly graded.",
    "I liked that we did not always need to stay until 5. I also liked that the post labs were not every single week. The work felt right for a half credit. Lots of waiting for experiments to run their course though.",
    "The course is organized well, and Dr. DiMeglio is wonderful. However, there was inconsistent grading between the TAs, and some TAs did not help\/guide their lab students as much as others.",
    "It is a great course",
    "Strengths included the interesting and varies experiments, dedicated TAs, and workload",
    "This class isn't that stressful or competitive and the environment encourages questions but it is a lot of work for half a credit",
    "A strength of the course is how laid out everything is. Unlike General Chemistry lab, with weekly lab reports that would take upwards of 3 hours at least, we only had experimental plans and two Post Lab Assignments. While experimental plans were weekly, there were low stakes, and it left so much time for you to truly ease into the class before the really hard experiments started happening, and Post Lab Assignments were also structured so you would think and understand what was happening in the lab.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is, as always with lab courses, inconsistency with TAs. In addition, while this is not my personal experience, sometimes the TA and Dr. DiMeglio have different standards for work, which causes a lot of stress when grades come into play, and since there aren't many assignments, this is very stressful.",
    "I thought the labs were very informative and had real world applications. The TAs were very helpful and the labs were an appropriate length.",
    "Strengths: This course follows a fast-paced but thorough progression through the basics of an Organic Chemistry lab. It feels independent, and also has a greater emphasis on the chemical process behind procedures than I've had in other courses. This comprehensive style of learning felt like an invaluable supplement to my Organic Chemistry lecture course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the experimental procedures in the course felt half-baked and left many students with unusually low yields which felt preventable given more time developing the course packet. Furthermore, the specific grading rubric\/expectations for lab reports and pre-class assignments were never clearly detailed before turning them in. There were times when I'd get penalized for an 'error' that had been fine the week before, leading me to believe it was the proper header style.",
    "I think that having to write out an Experimental Plan before each lab greatly helped my mental preparation - I came into lab already having a basic understanding of tasks I was to perform for that week's experiment. The lab setting was also very relaxed, but not to the point of it being unsafe. We always had lab coordinators float around to different students and give pointers and advice on what we were doing. The grading was fair, if not harsh for two of the major assignments during the semester-the Post Lab comprehension assignments.",
    "I liked how we learned each technique first and then started applying them together in experiments",
    "One strength of this class was its organization. It was planned out and had some breathing room to change as well.",
    "Strengths: the instructor, manageable workload, interesting experiments\r\nWeaknesses: very few expectations for the final exam",
    "The different labs we come across are very good at giving you practice and slowly building up before getting to the more complicated labs. They teach you how to be responsible for your lab space and materials because not everyone shares the same equipment, and it is nice that the grading is based on the process and the thoroughness of your work rather than the actual results. I do think that the grading can seem subjective according to each TA, so I wish that could be changed. The work is also not that much and the actual lab time is fairly short.",
    "This is a well-managed course, but the grading is too specific and does not accurately reflect the work done.",
    "Good as is.",
    "The lab is structured very well and my TA made sure to go over important points beforehand. However, I know that other TAs were not as awesome as mine, and their students suffered because of it.",
    "i felt that this class was very tedious but that's the nature of lab",
    "Solid course overall; emphasis on safety might be a bit extreme",
    "I think that the course is quite well organized, and I appreciated the unit of one's lab section, one's individual hood, etc. Overall, it felt less intimidating than general chemistry lab, but we still covered a lot and there was a collaborative atmosphere. Another strength was that labs were well-timed  I rarely felt that I was rushing, and the content of labs progressed nicely over the semester. The one weakness I found were the assessments; the two quizzes were quite straightforward, but it might be nice to have a quiz or two more, to feel like I've consolidated information better. And though there were (helpful!) practice questions throughout the lab notebook, a practice lab final or some more multiple choice-oriented practice would have been great.",
    "The course does a great job of covering how to complete essential techniques required for organic synthesis protocols and reinforces the use of these techniques throughout the course. Some of the theory behind the protocols are well explained. The course could be improved by providing more explanation for the theory behind some of the techniques, as well as by having a practical final instead of a written final. I feel that the written final did not properly reflect what was taught in the course and that a practical final would do a better job of that.",
    "the teaching staff is very caring and are always helping their students learn",
    "Strengths: rarely goes the full 4 hours, TA is very helpful, you can go at your own pace, makes sense\/pretty related to the orgo class.\r\nWeaknesses: if you haven't had lab before, be prepared - read the course packet and make sure you're taking lab notes properly since instructors will assume you know from gen chem lab and won't go over it.",
    "The course taught me many valuable techniques in a comprehensive way, but it was quite rigorous. I put much more effort into this class than some of my others, and this course is only half a credit. I personally think the course should be weighted more heavily to reflect the rigor of the course.",
    "Strengths: kind instructor, relatively enjoyable labs, fair workload \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some experiments seemed needlessly tedious (ex. doing 12 IR spectra)",
    "I love how this course distributes workload very nicely across the semester. The EPs are a great way to get acquainted with the lab concepts and be prepared for lab before actually going to lab, and they also serve as a great way to keep up with the concepts of the course throughout the semester. The TAs and Professor DiMeglio foster an amazing environment within the lab, and make you feel comfortable, welcome, and confident in your abilities. This lab feels relaxed, yet fast-paced at the same time, in a way that pushes you to be the best you can be while not stressing excessively about the outcome of your experiments, and that is definitely something I appreciated about it.",
    "I thought this course was great because it allowed students to independently work and learn necessary skills for the lab! I really enjoyed the course.",
    "The strengths of this course include the pacing, the teaching fellows and the instructor. The instructor is very open and willing to help out if you are struggling during the lab or have doubts about the results achieved. The presence of teaching fellows help to take care of problems that occur within the lab and my teaching fellow was helpful and encouraging. The structure of the course also follows a good formula in teaching us the skills we need and letting us apply those skills and progressing through to more difficult labs at a nice pace. The course packet was also very helpful in cataloging and organizing all of the necessary material into a central structure. The only improvement I could suggest for this course is ensuring students have the background necessary either by including a link in the course packet to a video or possibly a simple document of skills necessary beforehand."

    "Yes, it was great.",
    "Absolutely! This is the first lab I've taken here and I can only hope future labs will be as fun and engaging as this one.",
    "Definitely! Its a good intro lab course that doesnt put too much pressure on you.",
    "I mean it's much better than gen chem lab. Dr. DiMeglio is very caring the few times that I saw her. If you have a good TA (like Theo Koelsch), it will make lab much more manageable.",
    "Yes and no. I really liked the actual experiments, but jumping through all of the hoops and having to prepare for a test on the content I don't feel like I learned was really frustrating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to experience a chemistry lab that creates a very positive learning environment. I enjoyed learning about chemical concepts through hands-on experiments.",
    "I would recommend this. It's a relatively low-stress class where the staff is really nice and helpful and you walk away with essential laboratory skills.",
    "It is most likely a requirements so yeah. Also know that this is by far much better than introductory to general chem lab! By far felt more relaxed as time went on.",
    "It's not bad, really.",
    "Yes, if you are a chem major or pre-med.",
    "Yes if you must take it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is taking organic chemistry and needs this course to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Taking this course is an absolutely essential component of learning organic chemistry at Yale, as it makes concrete the theoretical content of orgo lecture and brings the magic of chemistry into what can otherwise be very dry content. However, any student taking it must be prepared to think constantly and consistently about their actions and what could go wrong, as even small mistakes can result in very large problems, especially as data collection techniques in the class can require a lot of time and analysis.",
    "Yes. It is a god lab course to take if you want a pleasant lab experience. Its especially good coming from the gen chem lab class which isn't nearly as enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches critical organic chemistry techniques in a comfortable lab environment.",
    "Only if it is required, because the class itself is not bad but since many people taking the class are competitive premed students, you will definitely feel some pressure if you don't fully engage with the material.",
    "Only take it if you have to, I feel it didn't help me understand organic chemistry better and I didn't get that much out of it.",
    "Half the credit, double the work is very applicable to the class so be warned. However, I loved the class and would definitely recommend it!",
    "Definitely! I think it was a super nice way to learn how to actually do reactions instead of just reading them, especially since the TAs are always there to avert disasters",
    "If youre taking this course, its probably because you need to. Nevertheless, Id recommend this course to anyone whos thinking of taking this, especially to those considering freshman orgo!",
    "Yes, if you are pre-med or doing a science major, you probably have to take this course for your requisites.",
    "- basically mandatory for everyone so I don't know if this response is particularly useful, but...\r\n- great foundation for practicing technique\r\n- generally supportive community and staff (they walk around and check on you throughout the lab)",
    "This course is more than a half-credit of work, but its quite enjoyable if you have a good TA.",
    "Yes, this course is definitely better than Gen Chem Lab, but it is still tedious. Lab courses take up a lot of time and work and should be a full credit.",
    "Yes, important skills learned",
    "Yes. If a student is interested in learning the lab techniques related to organic chemistry, I would highly recommend this class. I felt that this class really helps students see the concepts they learn in organic chemistry I applied to the real lab setting.",
    "You probably have to take it.",
    "yes, as far as labs go this class is a good one!",
    "I would reccomend this course to accompany the normal organic sequence because it's nice to be able to see techinques actually being used instead of just learning about them in class.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It's a huge block of time each week and there are pre-lab assignments for each week. If you are interested in learning lab techniques and synthesizing products, then I think this might be a good fit.",
    "No, not unless you have to take it. The grading for the post lab assignments is very subjective, and it's really difficult to do well on those assignments. You can be as thorough as possible and unfortunately, it still is probably not enough. The lab experience was definitely better than General Chemistry lab, however, I think the stress of grades weighed pretty heavily on most students, to the point where many had to drop lab. This made the averages for the students who remained rise, and it just seemed to propagate the cycle of stress.",
    "Only take this course if it is a requirement. Its less painful than gen chem lab, but unless you want to go into organic chemistry research, its not particularly interesting or useful.",
    "Not unless it was required.",
    "I mean you probably have to take this course if you're looking at it. It's annoying, but not the worst lab.",
    "Absolutely! Great course with an amazing professor and does not consume a large amount of time every week.",
    "Yes because it made organic chemistry seem like less of an obstacle because it made some concepts clearer.",
    "Definitely take this OCHEM lab with your OCHEM class to supplement your learning. It helps a lot and you have fun with other students in lab. Working together is the best.",
    "No, the grading was so subjective for the EP's, I always wanted to get out of lab as soon as I got there, and I did not enjoy\/see the relevance of many of the labs we did.",
    "If they have to take it for major requirements",
    "Yes, it is important to learn the basic lab techniques we learned through this class.",
    "yes! whether you need to for your major or simply want to take a science lab, I would definitely recommend this course. You'll also get a better understanding of some of the topics taught in orgo lecture",
    "Most likely taking it because you have to, but I was pleasantly surprised with the course. You get out early almost every week as well.",
    "Yes. It is a very fun lab with reasonable expectations.",
    "If they needed to take Lab, I would recommend it.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "Orgo lab is pretty chill and fun. The reactions are very well explained, unlike gen chem lab, so you usually feel pretty satisfied with your work\/what you've done by the end of lab period (which almost always gets done pretty early). Also, even if you do badly on the PLA\/PLB, the final is worth a ton of the grade and it's multiple choice and very fair, so it's nice to be able to pull your average up if you study really hard for that.",
    "It was okay. They won't be super sad if they have to take it.",
    "Absolutely. I took it as a first year, and I found it was a very good introduction to what working in an organic lab is like. Among other things, you learn how to use a separatory funnel, TLC analysis, IR spectra analysis, and reflux. You get a ton of resources, a lab instructor who clearly cares very much about if you understand what you're doing, and the grading is more along the lines of \"did you try your best\" rather than \"did you do everything perfectly,\" which I very much appreciate. Overall, excellent introductory lab course!",
    "Yes if you are interested in chemistry",
    "Yes, it is very cool and very very well run",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students since it sets a good foundation for working in a chemistry lab. Though intimidating at first, the TAs and instructors were all so encouraging and willing to help that working in lab became less daunting, and my fear of making mistakes really decreased.",
    "Yes, I think this is a fun course with a lot of \"hands-on\" experiences.",
    "Yes! It is an amazing intro to learning how to apply organic chemistry techniques to synthesize chemicals.",
    "Only if you have to take it like literally why else would you be taking this",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who need to take a lab.",
    "yes take if you're taking orgo lecture",
    "Yes! Good overview to organic chemistry lab techniques",
    "No. Avoid this course if you can. It is not fun, you don't really learn very much from it anyways, and the grading is so messed up - it just creates a super stressful semester where every week you just hope that you checked most of the boxes you were supposed to for the assignments. It's just a frustrating experience that no one needs to endure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in lab techniques.",
    "Only if they need to take it.",
    "If you have to take it then take it.",
    "Yes, if they are considering a chemistry major. Otherwise no as it is a lot of work.",
    "Not unless you have to take it, but it's better than Gen Chem Lab",
    "I would recommend this course to any inquisitive student who wanted to push themselves in the lab. It was an enjoyable time but it does require a lot of out-of-lab work.",
    "I would if the student is interested in chemistry.",
    "Yes - cool course, fun to be in the lab and be relatively independent with multistep, interesting experiments. Hope they change the (somewhat unfair) grading schemes.",
    "Only if you need to take it or want to work in an organic chem lab. No need otherwise.",
    "It was a good time, especially compared to gen chem lab",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned so much about how organic chemistry is studied in a lab. From this practical perspective, I was able to understand chemical reactions better and how they connected with other reactions. The content was interesting to learn because there was problem solving involved to figure out how to analyze data. I also found it in fascinating to see chemical reactions unfold in front of me or crystals form, so this lab was very fun.",
    "Yes because the reactions and experiments are very cool and it is a requirement for a lot of majors, but the grading seemed to be arbitrary and the set up is stressful.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed lab and learned techniques that I will be able to use in the future.",
    "I enjoyed lab, but probably only if required",
    "I would recommend this course. Of all of the courses I have taken, this is the closest to real lab experience. There is a certain level of guided independence that also allows for a tremendous growth.",
    "Yeah, its super fun. She makes you not hate chemistry.",
    "Only if needed for major\/ pre-professional track",
    "As with organic chemistry, this course is probably being taken to fulfill some sort of requirement. It definitely is a breath of fresh air coming out of gen chem lab because the work feels a lot more manageable and help seems more attainable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to take lab. It is a very interesting lab course, and I was thoroughly engaged with the content.",
    "I would because it does help you with your lab techniques.",
    "yes, it was good but only if its a requirement",
    "Yes! It is a good lab course that teaches some important techniques.",
    "Yes, if you want to gain experience in dealing with laboratory equipment and perform chemistry experiments",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to learn about the fundamentals of organic chemistry in a collaborative environment that fosters learning.",
    "It's not too bad. Just make sure to complete the assignments (especially PLAs) thoroughly. It's also probably required. I personally didn't enjoy the class, but it was probably because I was always scrambling to prepare beforehand. If I had taken the time to thoroughly learn everything I probably would have enjoyed it more. The experiments are pretty cool!",
    "If it is not required, I do not think this course is worth the time\/effort it takes to do really well. However, it did increase confidence\/competency in a well-supported lab environment.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have to take organic chemistry lab for major\/pre-med requirements.",
    "No.",
    "If they are taking orgo I it is a great companion.",
    "I would definitely let other students know that this course is great compared to gen chem lab, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend that students take lab courses in general unless they need them to fulfill pre-med\/major requirements anyway.",
    "Yes! Lab is fun! The experiments can actually be followed and are concurrent with the ORGO lecture and you walk away feeling like you truly accomplished something,",
    "I would only recommend this to another student if they absolutely have to take it for their major. Otherwise it is a waste of time to surround yourself with a toxic student atmosphere and lack of instruction.",
    "Yes! This lab is much better than and more enjoyable than gen chem lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, since the material is interesting (at least to a chemist like me) and the stuff we do in lab is more enjoyable than the stuff we do in lecture. I would recommend taking them separately as I did (take lecture one year, and the labs the next) because if I would have taken lab and lecture together, lab would be terrible for me. I enjoy lab so much more now that I can focus on the experimental concepts and have fun doing experimental chemistry instead of being reminded of my lecture material and being stressed out.",
    "As much as I loved the science in this course (I made one substance into a whole new substance! wow!), the safety hazards were a massive source of anxiety. If you get stressed out by waste disposal, you will not enjoy this class.",
    "premeds\/other majors require it. I think it's much better than gen chem lab though",
    "Yes, good to get an introduction to lab when taking a science course and it does supplement the learning in lecture",
    "Yes, even if youre not a huge fan of chemistry this lab teaches a lot and seems to be interesting to all.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who needs to learn how to work in a lab.",
    "I'd recommend it to students taking organic chemistry lecture, if only to learn a little bit about what performing organic chemistry is actually like. Don't expect to be blown away or particularly excited by what you do.\r\n\r\nYour experience will definitely depend on your TA, but Dr. DiMeglio at the very least is a wonderful person who sincerely does want to make the lab enjoyable and instructive for everyone. Compared to what I've heard about gen chem lab, it's much more relaxed, so that's another perk.",
    "No, not unless you have to. Seems to be a lot of work and stress for something not very fun.",
    "Yes. Great intro to common organic chemistry techniques.",
    "I would recommend if you want to learn more techniques about chemistry, however beware that your grade is mostly dependent on the final exam, so if you are looking for an easy lab or science credit, this might be more work than the 0.5 credits that it is given.",
    "Yes if you would like to learn new organic lab techniques in addition to gen chem lab",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she is considering doing pre-med or wants to learn more about organic chemistry techniques.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it helps with organic chemistry concepts and helps you thrive in a future chemistry lab.",
    "You have to take this if you are a pre-med. Though it is not as bad as intro chem lab, I would recommend not taking if you can avoid it.",
    "This course is often taken as a co-requisite with the corresponding lecture in organic chemistry, usually as a prerequisite for majors\/medical school, so I would recommend especially for that purpose. \r\nBut it was also cool to see how to separate products from a reaction and there is more overlap between lab and lecture toward the end of the course to help with solidifying concepts.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are required to take it.",
    "No it is only a half credit but a lot of work.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes because I feel like it's a necessary prerequisite",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it. While this lab is better than General Chemistry in terms of stress in my opinion, a lab is still lab, and if you aren't good at it, you're not going to have a good time.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in beginning chemistry research. The techniques taught are very applicable and it helped me in the other chemistry lab that I work in.",
    "I would definitely. This was the highlight of Organic Chemistry for me.",
    "Yes because, again, you learn a lot of different lab skills that are very useful, especially when working in a lab in the future",
    "Yes, it was very good time and my lab group was very nice.",
    "Yes if they are interested in chemistry",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in becoming a better chemist.",
    "Take if you need to, I think whether this course is enjoyable varies from student to student and TA. I personally had a great time and had a great TA but I know others did not enjoy this course.",
    "Yes. This course was extremely fun and informative. It was not without its challenges, but I never felt overwhelmed or lost during the course.",
    "not really but you dont take these classes bc you have to",
    "Yes, it's a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course! I think that students generally take it because it's required, but I truly enjoyed myself and learned a lot, increasing both in my knowledge of organic chemistry and the lab environment, and in my confidence in carrying out labs.",
    "Yes, the course was fair in its workload and expectations and did a good job of covering essential techniques for lab.",
    "yes! It was a great way to learn lab techniques",
    "Yes its needed and it was fun.",
    "If you have to take it for a pre-req its really a pretty good experience. However, I don't think I would recommend anyone taking this class purely for enjoyment.",
    "If you are taking this course chances are that you need to. Nonetheless, even if that is not the case, this course provides a very comprehensive and well-taught introduction to organic chemistry lab techniques within a very good environment, and so I would recommend it to any interested student.",
    "Yes! If you love lab, this class will definitely be that students thing because you are allowed to work independently.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only is it structured well to facilitate learning of skills and their application, but the instructor and teaching fellows are there to support students through their development. The pacing and workload are not overwhelming and the course stays interesting as each lab generally focuses on a different skill."
