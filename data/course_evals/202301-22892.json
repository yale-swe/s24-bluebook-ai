                "This class didn't really have any weaknesses. Professor checked for feedback regularly during the semester to make sure that no one any problems/concerns.  Prof made it essay to participate in lecture as long as you did some of the reading. If you didn't do all of the reading, we would read some sections in class and you could still participate. In terms of writing assignments, we were expected to submit a first draft before submitting a final. This was super useful for making sure that you're on track while also getting feedback on your writing. Grading also seemed fair.",
                "Strengths  get to write + read a lot of different kinds of essays, the format of forcing people to workshop is really great in my opinion bc I loved getting to read everyone else's essays + get feedback from everyone on mine. Another strength is the conferences after writing an essay + before workshopping. \r\nWeaknesses - some essays assigned were a little long / didn't have enough time to get thru them.",
                "Strengths: able to write a lot of essays in different genres. Good if you want to recycle these essays for other applications.\r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of writing. Better be prepared",
                "Strengths: assignments are fun, you can choose four out of five genres to write which is nice as it gives some flexibility, readings really help you gather inspiration for your own piece\r\nWeakness: a lot of readings so its hard to really delve deep into one (which causes the conversations to be a bit dry sometimes)",
                "There are honestly no weaknesses. The readings are all engaging and give you a variety of examples on possible formats for your essays. The workshops are incredibly instructive, since you get to hear from your peers. The biggest strength of this course was Professor McGowan. He is the most understanding and considerate professor I have had to date. He understands that you are a student with other responsibilities and makes sure that the work you submit is your best, not something you rushed to finish. As an instructor, the 1 on 1 meetings with him are so useful, and he always gives you personal suggestions from across all of your essays to make you a better writer as a whole. I cannot stress how much I have gotten better through this class.",
                "Being forced to experiment with different genres of non-fiction writing definitely helped me get a sense of what I was best at. We also had a lot of creative liberty which allowed for the most unique writing that I've ever undertaken (and probably ever will). Having the system of submitting a draft before the final version helped make the writing feel low-stakes, and the feedback that I got on first drafts really helped polish the essays.",
                "Strengths: Kind professor who provided very helpful and thoughtful feedback. Made sure to listen to our own feedback for the class. Loved the readings and enjoyed the workshops (which were helpful). Assignments were fun!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I appreciated the workshops, I wish we had less of them and focused more on the readings instead. Analysis of essays on the syllabus could be slow at times."

                "Yes, this class improved my writing and the in class readings were manageable. Would recommend for anyone looking for a writing credit.",
                "Definitely!! I dread taking English courses normally but this class was a class I looked forward to going to every day + highly looked forward to writing each essay  I was thinking about what I would write far in advance because that was how excited I was to continue engaging with this course. I loved the environment that this class created and I think this is a must-take class at Yale for a writing credit, especially for non-English/humanities majors  this was much different from most other english classes I've taken in a great way. It made me really enjoy writing.",
                "yes. good because all the writing prompts are actually good. I had trouble writing before because what I would be writing about would be boring. 120 picks topics that relate to us (and who doesn't like talking about themselves?)",
                "Absolutely! This was the best course I've taken at Yale. I enjoyed writing every single piece (which is something I couldn't have imagined before taking the course). The class readings were fantastic and the seminar-style discussions felt very laid-back.",
                "Yes! Such a fun writing credit, especially for stem students. Youll definitely have some pieces at the end of the semester that you want to keep and reread, which is more than you can say about academic papers",
                "No doubt, probably one of the best courses at Yale to not only get better at writing, but also learn about yourself in the process.",
                "Yes! As a STEM major, I'm glad I got the chance to read and experiment with writing that I otherwise would not be exposed to. Writing non-fiction is a valuable skill that can translate to other domains like personal statements in applications, and is something everyone should commit to at least once.",
                "Yes because the writing is fun/interesting! Great professor and relatively easy class. However, every weekend you generally have an essay first or final draft due (except for the fifth essay that you can drop). Would recommend you plan ahead for what you want to write about for each essay."
