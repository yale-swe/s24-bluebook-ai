I feel like this course was a real turning point in my time as an economics student. Major topics included utility and profit maximization, risk and insurance, firm behavior, and competition. There was not nearly enough attention devoted to firm behavior and cost optimization (AC, SRMC, LRMC, TC, etc)",

I enjoyed how the topics we studied were real world concepts that could be given quantitative measures. The math in this course allowed me to think more critically about economics, and we also discussed modern day technology plus policy that affects economics: I enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of this course.",
                "From this course, I gained a deeper understanding of microeconomics building on the foundation of introductory microeconomics. The class was able to introduce the concept of Lagrange functions and use partial derivatives for certain maximization/ minimization problems. This technical ability was supported by the conceptual understanding behind each mathematical process. Intensive, but interesting and valuable.",

                "I learned a lot of mathematical reasoning for microeconomic concepts. The course was very math-intensive, but a lot of the same types of math over and over again. It reinforced a lot of introductory micro concepts by showing mathematical derivations.",

                "In this course, I further developed the fundamentals in microeconomics that I learned when I took ECON 115 last year. We didn't use any calculus in ECON 115, so it was very interesting to finally use calculus in this course to solve for some values that we would only discuss conceptually in ECON 115. We also went beyond some of the topics taught in ECON 115 and introduced new applications, like insurance and exchange economies. I also appreciated that Professor Chalioti connected artificial intelligence to some of the topics we learned, as AI is growing increasingly more and more prevalent in our society today.",

                "I learned about different aspects of the economy, including perfect competition, collusion, optimization, trade, and monopolies, but ultimately, the core undertanding of this course revolved around the most efficinet allocation of resources, whether that involved perfect/imperfect competition, trade, collusion, monopolies, etc."

                "I think this class should have the updated (nearly exact) slides posted on Canvas before class. Sometimes the slides posted beforehand are missing so many slides--practically useless to use. There were a lot of problems with the class that related to the classroom we were in (SSS 114). The lecture hall was just terrible at the beginning of the course because there weren't enough seats, and math was written on the chalkboard. Therefore, people who sat in the back had a hard time looking at what Eva was writing. However, it did get better towards the latter half of the semester when she started to utilize her iPad for math. The class should be recorded considering how minimal the information is on the slides. It's hard to listen and note everything that Eva says in class because it is a lot.",
                "Strengths: Organization, access to materials, access to OH \r\nWeaknesses: Assessments often did not match the problem sets or discussion section work. Additionally, we were not given practice exams as previous classes were; this significantly impacted preparation for the exam",
                "Strengths: Eva Chalioti is an amazing professor and clearly cares about her students doing well. Extremely clear when explaining concepts, repeats herself when necessary (such as when she's drilling an important point / conclusion about the math we did). Discussion section was good, I found the class very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Too much weight on exams. It would be nice for PSETS to not only be graded on completion because otherwise, your entire grade falls on two exams.",
                "I think the method of teaching is effective, and peer tutoring is very helpful.",
                "I hope the instructor has more office hours",
                "lectures sometimes are a bit tedious but Eva is a great prof!",
                "Honestly this course is really well-taught, I just think the room made things logistically difficult. the microphone always cut out, the board is hard to see, the projector screen is really high up, etc...",
                "Strengths repetition of method and lots of practice materials offered. Weaknesses not a strong foundation on intuitive economic understanding behind the numbers, or how to intuitively \"make sense\" of the results.",
                "The slides were very good, and the sections clarified things. The material sometimes got too into the math and got boring since it got repetitive.",
                "I think the lecture structure could be better. We were in a large lecture hall, and writing on the chalk board poses as a challenge for people sitting further away. Explanations could also be better and I feel as though I was left confused most of the time.",
                "Very structured and organized",
                "Weaknesses: all the class time spent doing algebra on the board. It really made it hard to stay engaged.",

                "Professor was helpful, TFs as well",
                "Strengths: Good support for students all around, psets were relevant and not too bad.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the content can be taught in a more easy-to-understand way, and more organization of content/signposting would be helpful. Sometimes we would be half way into something and not understanding anything until the end, but that's not very useful for our learning because we don't know how to follow along. Lecture notes should provide a clear explanation of process steps for each type of problem, i.e. first, we maximize profit, second, we maximize utility, last, we clear market conditions. Ed discussion questions should be answered more promptly.",
                "The sections and psets were generally well done and very important aspects of the course; they gave the opportunity for hands on application of the material studied in lecture. The lectures were occasionally unoptimized, meaning that lots of time would be devoted to unimportant or easy topics, and challenging things would be rushed through in the last 15 minutes. This should be improved. Also, the textbook was generally over-complicated for the level of the course (although often very interesting but not directly relevant); it would be great to have a textbook that more closely aligns with the course, and particularly would be nice to know the corresponding readings BEFORE the lecture as opposed to after.",
                "Tough material",
                "- Strength: The course provides comprehensive coverage of advanced microeconomic concepts, including market structures, consumer and producer behavior, game theory, and policy analysis\r\n- Strength: Emphasis on the practical application of microeconomic principles to real-world scenarios enhances the relevance of the course content.",
                "The strength of this course is that the presentation slides are very clear and concise, and there is plenty of material for review or practice for us to use. Also, I like that the professor included real-life examples of economic concepts in the lectures, which allowed me to visualize the applications better.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Exams very reflective of p-sets\r\n-Incredible TAs and office hours almost every day of the week\r\n-Discussion sections\r\n-EdStem forum for asking quick questions\r\n-Engaging professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Math at the beginning of the course was not explained; not presented in a manner accessible to students without MATH 120 or higher\r\n-Lectures not recorded and Zoom lectures were difficult to attend for students with medical appointments (not accessible to folks with disabilities and chronic conditions)\r\n-Syllabus did not outline the course well; difficult to prepare for lectures beforehand\r\n-Lack of additional review sessions and practice materials for exam. The p-sets are graded on completion, and there's SO much weight on the exams",
                "Strengths: Exams align closely with work from PSet and Discussion Sections. Weaknesses: no recorded lectures, the textbook wasn't too helpful, and overall a bit repetitive.",
                "I feel like the material taught in class and the material on the psets cover the basics, but then the practice material and the midterm were much harder. Eva is amazing at teaching, though, and she makes a huge effort to ensure you have a smooth learning experience.",
                "Eva Chalioti is the biggest strength of the course. Her lectures are very clear and the book complements them well in the few cases where I found myself lost. The tests are fair in difficulty, and the problem sets are not time-consuming but teach you a lot.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by making the problem sets graded for correctness. As it is, 100% of our grade comes from the exams, and it would be nice to have an incentive to stay engaged throughout the semester as opposed to just cram for exams.",
                "The main weakness is that feedback is hard to get; many TFs did not have the midterm solutions and we could not review our answers; the midterm was also substantially more difficult than psets. The lecture slides were also difficult to review with. For the benefit of future classes, SSS was also a difficult room to work with  the microphone was pretty much always broken and the boards much too small.",
                "I struggled a lot in this course. I thought the structure of the lectures was very hard to follow, the problem sets were very difficult and often felt like we hadnt learnt the material on them in lecture. I think this course, and many econ classes, can be really hit or miss depending on the professor and for me this was a miss.",
                "This course is well designed, with ample office hours and well-designed problem sets. The lectures are engaging and thorough. One way the course could be improved would be through the release of practice exams; I feel practice exams, especially before the midterm, would help students better prepare for exams.",
                "Lectures are horrible.",
                "The course really tests your knowledge of microeconomics and is excellent at going in-depth with methods to choose output and profits.",
                "Strengths: Eva was great. Psets being collaborative is nice. I guess it covered what it had to. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: content. Was at times a little too difficult and some concepts were pure review",
                "It probably is a necessary aspect of intermediate micro economics, but there are few applications because it is intro concepts just with a lot more math, but not quite enough to make the concepts realistic or work with them. A strength is the professor, Eva, who clearly wants everyone to learn and adjusts how she explains so its as helpful as it can be. A weakness is just that it's a lot of math/calc if you haven't done that in a while. Warning, we were told midterm was not a time crunch but it is, few people had enough time.",
                "You don't really learn anything fascinating. No new topics are covered over 115.",
                "I think a lot of time I did not know why we were doing what we did in the class and think it could have been more clear.",
                "The instructor is such a kind person and clearly is very interested in the success of her students. She does her best to explain things well in class, and asks the class directly if we understand what she is saying. The slides were ideal for my learning type: I felt it was easy to find information on them not only during class but also when I was studying for exams. The readings assigned are often very helpful in increasing your understanding of what is already well-explained in the lecture.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is the lack of recorded lectures. I understand not making recorded lectures widely available out of a fear students will not attend class, but it really would have made such a difference to hear the lectures again while I was studying. Other professors make course recordings available a week before midterms and a week before finals, and I feel that is a fair way to handle this. This lack of recordings also made it really difficult for me to catch up when I had to miss class for health reasons. Another weakness is the lack of feedback on PSets. Although this is understandable considering the number of students, I feel this would have been helpful in spotting what was wrong with my understanding of the concepts being applied in the PSet.",
                "Strengths: You have to take this for your major and I think Eva does a really good job at making really hard concepts simplified and  easier to understand.  Weaknesses: Lectures could not be more boring and I often felt it was hard to study for exams for this class.  Not having practice problems was really hard for me especially as someone who is nota strong test taker.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are clear and easy to follow, especially the fully worked-through examples. Eva truly wants students to do well, and will spend time to break down concepts or reassure the class as needed. Weaknesses: Some topics are so similar that they blend together, and it's easy to mix them up when setting up equations (e.g exchange economy with/without production), while some topics seem unrelated and/or are rushed through, especially in the second half of the semester (e.g externalities).",
                "Super clear teaching and explanations, clear course expectations, and fair exams. The course content is tough, so you'll need to work hard (and not skip sections), but it's taught amazingly. Professor Chalioti is a fantastic and engaging lecturer, and I appreciated her receptiveness/ the transition from the chalkboard to the iPad for practice problems midway through the semester. I also appreciated how female pronouns were used to refer to economic agents in the slides :)  \r\n\r\nOne weakness: I do wish there were more practice problems provided to review for the midterm and final. I understand why they weren't provided (simplification + all of the test questions were similar to the psets so we didn't really need lots of excess material) but I wished I would've had more ways to practice and study before exams besides redoing psets.",
                "Strengths- interesting material\r\nWeaknesses- not very engaging",
                "A weakness of the course was the dense lecture material and the addition of stuff that doesnt necessarily matter. At times, the concepts were just taught using math from other concepts, but it was not explained conceptually.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, well organized lecture slides and content, psets posted on time, section problems relevant to the course material, plenty of practice material before exams, not overly stressful, expectations were very clear, the difficulty of exams was reasonable\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally it was difficult to hear in lecture (but this was resolved as the semester went on), other students in my section were quite unengaged.",
                "Prof. Chalioti took her time to explain everything in class. That we had many TAs was also very helpful. There were many OH hours, which allowed us to get help whenever necessary.",
                "strength: lectures are so helpful\r\nweakness: discussion sections were not helpful",
                "Strengths: Plenty of practice problems and learning material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "A strength is that the Psets really help with mastering the topics. When studying for exams, the Psets were solid in covering what we learned in class. This constant learning and application really helped me grow in this course. The exams usually give questions that combine multiple topics together, and I do wish we were exposed to more of those problems beforehand.",
                "It feels like the course effectively teaches new material and leaves a person with the feeling that they have gained a new skill. The course is intensive, however, and the class feels like it rushes through new material with less explanation of the reasoning behind each step; that reasoning comes from working on problem sets and figuring it out individually. Discussion sections are not mandatory, and that drives down participation that could have been useful.",
                "Strengths: The slides are well-structured, with plenty of conceptual background and mathematical examples to help us understand each concept thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets can be a bit repetitive and long, and the large, lecture style of the class felt a bit impersonal and unengaging at times.",
                "Course was too math based- not that the math was difficult, but that it seemed unnecessary and a waste of time. Instead of solving partial derivative questions in class, more conceptual instruction would have been preferred.",
                "I didn't find the lectures too helpful unfortunately.",
                "Strengths: Provides a fantastic theoretical foundation for those interested in studying neoclassical economics, used math that was advanced but simple. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Failed to engage with any other theoretical framework for economics, often lacking in practical skills although rich in theory.",
                "I feel that the problems sets and discussion section materials were very clear and prepared me well for the exams. However, I believe that the lectures could be more engaging.",
                "There should have been more intuition about the different concepts presented. The focus on calculation was extremely unhelpeful (we all know how to plug in numbers/do algebra). Furthermore, there could have been better general organization regarding the topics being taught. For instance, grouping units by topic (i.e., \"Consumer theory\", \"Market equilibrium\", \"Production and Supply\", etc.) would have been far more helpful than simply listing all of the lecture slides on the Canvas page. It was difficult to tell what exactly we were learning in the context of the discipline.",
                "I think this course was very well structured!",
                "I really enjoyed the real world examples given in lectures. \r\n\r\nAll the math steps should be given in the solutions, instead of double arrows given to the answer. It would make it much easier for students who have limited math background. \r\n\r\nPractice final exams should be given.",
                "The content is pretty boring but Eva is really a great professor. Its interesting to understand the math behind microeconomic concepts and not just memorize rules like you do in 115.\r\nFeedback on psets was a bit of a mess though. I would get points taken off without any comment, even though I was under the impression that psets were graded on completion.",
                "The course was well structured.\r\nHowever since no past exam is shared, I felt there wasnt enough material to revise.",
                "Strengths: the lecture slides were incredible and very thorough; practice problems, psets, and discussion section questions were very helpful, especially in preparation for exams",
                "It is just a hard class!",
                "it is fairly straightforward, but not very engaging in terms of the material",
                "The material is difficult, so being able to see it clearly throughout the semester instead of just the second half would be nice. The professor is excellent and cares about the students.",
                "Strengths: The TA's, and Professor Chalioti. The TA's (a shoutout to Jingyi) were phenomenal, and Professor Chalioti really pulled through for us at the very end.\r\nWeaknesses: The material is quite abstract, and not particularly compelling. However, I do see the value in its application.",
                "Eva is a fantastic lecturer, and she really wants everyone to succeed. The discussion sections were not really helpful, and I only went to a handful. The psets being graded for completion is a plus, and it should be kept that way! The ULAs were really amazing.",
                "Biggest improvement of this course would be to change the location to somewhere with more lighting and bigger whiteboard/screens. The first half of the semester was challenging when the professor wrote on the chalkboard and it was hard to see from anywhere past the front 10 rows but the second half with the iPad was very helpful! I also would be interested to see more practice materials (like practice exams) available for exam prep.",
                "I really appreciated how the psets were graded on completion so I didn't have to worry week to week too much about them, but at the same time I was encouraged to do well and learn the material from them for the exams. It made the class more enjoyable and less stressful, and I felt like I was still able to learn what I needed to.",
                "The Psets were helpful, but I wish we had practice tests.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti taught the class very well. Lecture notes were posted on Canvas beforehand, and were fully uploaded after, which was super helpful. The exams followed the content of the problem sets pretty well.\r\nWeaknesses: No practice exams to study for midterm and final, which are weighted pretty heavily.",
                "This isn't a real course. Crazy gutty. If you have any math skills this course comes naturally. There is actually interesting economics. This isn't it.",
                "The course was pretty well done, covered a lot of difficult material, but went over the different types of problems enough that you were never blindsided. I felt that the exams were very fair, and as long as you did the homework and the review problems, there was really nothing to worry about. The material, however, could be presented in a more engaging way.",
                "Some aspects of the class was disorganized, particularly when it came to grades and testing.",
                "h",
                "The first half of the course (everything on the midterm) is very, very dry and boring. Lots of math and its almost all the same just used on different concepts. The second half is much more interesting when we talk about game theory, salaries, monopolies, etc.",
                "Strengths: The psets were well organized and the expectations were clear. Weaknesses: For a large portion of the class we could never see the blackboard and so I would never understand the math, which made going to class pointless, but then the classes weren't recorded either so you kind of had to go...",
                "The TAs are top notch and office hours were always great and helpful. I think Professor Chalioti's lecture style is also very clear and helpful, and the discussion sections helped clarifying some questions i had during the lecture.",
                "Strengths: Very well structured. It was very clear what was expected of students, and deadlines were always told weeks in advance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "No need to attend lectures. Slides are all you need.",
                "Strengths: structured lectures \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there could be more study materials and practice exams when preparing.",
                "Eva is an awesome teacher and did a fantastic job of explaining advanced economic concepts to a bunch of teenagers. \r\n\r\nEspecially in the second half of the semester, it was great to see a healthy mix of economic theory and math, as well as historical anecdotes and current socio-economic issues. \r\n\r\nFor the first half of the semester, professor always used the chalkboard in the giant SSS 114 lecture hall when going through math examples. I oftentimes found following along to her teaching difficult during these moments and really appreciated it when she switched to projecting her iPad in the auditorium. \r\n\r\nI think that practice midterms should have been provided prior to the exam. Because they were not, I spend more time studying ideas that were not even relevant to the midterm, when in the past, practice midterms streamlined the studying process. I believe practice tests would have enabled everybody to do better on the exams and not allowed those who are simply \"econ geniuses\" to do so well on the test while everybody else did quite poorly. \r\n\r\nBoth tests contained too many questions, given the exam time constraints. I do not know any students who had time to actually finish the exam and review their work.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: Professor, Grading, P-Sets, Engagement",
                "Strengths: The course material was very interesting, the review sessions were helpful, and the sections served their purpose in enhancing lecture concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures themselves weren't as useful as I hoped for understanding the course content. Oftentimes, reviewing the lecture slides felt more substantive then listening attentively throughout lecture.",
                "Very organized and clear information",
                "Lectures could have been made more engaging, potentially by having less time spent on working through problems and by including real-world examples of the analysis we did. While we could see that there were real-world examples of the concepts (like pollution as a negative externality), we didn't really see examples of how real firms carry out the math we were working on. I understand real examples might be much more complicated than the simpler models we used, but it would be cool to see examples of how companies actually use such models in their decision-making.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it is well structured around lectures, discussion sections, problem sets, and exams. You know what to expect in this course, and the professor is not trying to trick you. As long as you actually do the problem sets on your own and you stay organized and on top of your work, you will learn a lot in this class and perform well. I personally liked that the problem sets were graded for completion, which meant that I could spend more time focusing on the solution strategy (bigger picture) and not spend too much time worrying about getting every single calculation correct. I can see how for some people this might mean that they didn't have an incentive to do the problem sets thoroughly (which of course would be a bad thing), but I know that for me, doing the problem sets thoroughly is the best way to study for the exams, so I personally liked the completion-based grading system for the problem sets.",
                "This course was a large lecture class, but we moved through the material very well. Perhaps one weakness was that we moved through some of the problems a bit slowly, but that may just be personal preference.",
                "Strengths: this class teaches intermediate microeconomics. I found that the lectures, problem sets, and sections were generally well-organized and all built on each other well. The content was mostly clear. Weaknesses: maybe it was just personal preference, but I found the lectures to be pretty non-useful. A large portion of the class time was spent doing algebra on the board - which hopefully students would already know how to do - and the theory or objective of problems was often lost in the details. I was especially disappointed since I had heard that professor Chalioti was quite a good lecturer. She seems quite nice and invested in her student's success, but I did not find the lectures to be particularly engaging.",
                "The course is well taught. Sometimes slides in lecture are not posted/do not correlate with slides online.",

                "Definitely if you're an econ / econ adjacent major the course is basically an extension of Econ 115. I left the course with a much deeper understanding of the content though understanding the math behind the theories really made it so much easier to conceptualize. I remember some concepts I struggled with in intro micro were MUCH easier to grasp after discovering the math in 121. You don't have to worry about not understanding the intuition when you can literally do the math, which is what I loved about the course. It was like uncovering a hidden layer that explained all of 115.",

I was hoping to develop a better understanding of microeconomics than that attained in ECON 115, as well as to develop my economic intuition.

I feel like I learned so much about economics, and the structure of the class (1 pset a week, one midterm, weekly sections, lots of ULA and TF office hours) was set up well to facilitate learning.

I ended up enjoying the mathematical aspect of this course. And the learning about policy and technology makes it very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. For economics majors, it is essential/ interesting information that builds on other concepts for the rest of the major. For non-economics majors, the information itself is interesting and useful for everyday life. The course is more work, but that work sees proportional returns on the effort.",

                "This is one of the least stressful courses at Yale. Psets are completion, and the small army of TAs and peer tutors makes them impossible to struggle with. Eva is such a caring instructor, and the exams are based exactly on the wealth of practice material she provides. If you make sure you understand everything in the lectures, psets, and do as much of the practice material as possible, you'll do fine. Also, I placed into Math 115 (but probably should have been in 112), did not take any math at Yale, and put in maybe a dozen extra hours pre-midterm to make sure I was solid on partial derivatives. You do not need 118 for this course (but if you want to do more econs at Yale, maybe--this advice is more for global, epe, and socy majors who don't need econ beyond 115).",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to explore microeconomics in more depth. The course goes through a lot of material but it isn't too fast-paced, and I personally learned so much.

                "it is a major requirement, but other than that wouldn't be much useful",

                "I would only recommend the course to individuals who need to take this course for their major.",
                "Yes! I believe it's a reasonable course load, and you end up retaining a good bit of the information, simply by how Eva lecturers and reviews concepts.",
                "Yes, 100%. This may be a tad bit of an unpopular opinion but this has been one of my favorite econ courses at Yale so far. I liked this class more than the intro sequence and found it easier to understand. Just ensure that you have the time to attend office hours/peer tutoring every week for problem set help (they are designed in a way that sometimes you have to go to the peer tutor to get the right answerit's not always intuitive from class content. Other than that, learning the main concepts and methods will get you by in this class; definitely understand the content conceptually before every exam because there are some curveballs in there!",
                "Yes! Though I did need this class for my major, I think it has been one of the most enjoyable economics classes I've taken thus far at Yale. I generally enjoy microeconomics, so I think that helped, but I also think the course structure and layout under Professor Chalioti made it especially enjoyable!",
                "Yes, I found it interesting",
                "Yes, especially if they are considering majoring in anything Econ related. Otherwise, if you don't need it I wouldn't take it.",
                "Absolutely not. I learned nothing. However, if you want an easy A, sure. I put about 7 hours cumulative into this class the entire semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student even if they have reservations about how multi is needed for this class; multi is definitely not needed, and all of the multi required is covered in the first lecture, and it's pretty cool to see the math basis behind a lot of microeconomics concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that has it as a requirement.",
                "Yes, I think it was helpful to see how math is used in Economics beyond just graphs.",
                "hh",
                "I mean if you're taking this you probably have to. Not a bad course by any means, just not sure where I can apply the knowledge I learned. Some of the second half stuff is very very interesting and you see the theory behind some of the ECON 115 concepts which is honestly really cool. But other than that only if you have to.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to go into higher level microeconomics and are comfortable with derivatives and have a basic understanding of microeconomics.",
                "Yes. Though it might not be useful for anyone not pursuing economics, I believe that the economic equations and graphs that I learned were very useful and interesting.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I took it for my major, but teaches valuable information, although very simplified by assumptions.",
                "Absolutely! Although getting a solid grasp on the content of this course is difficult and everybody has to work for their grade, it is very rewarding and interesting. Very glad I took it.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student unless it is part of a requirement. This class is not very challenging and the lectures are very uninteresting if you have already taken ECON 115.",
                "If you're an Econ major, you have no choice and may find the content engaging. However, if you're not an Econ major, you're likely to find little benefit from this course, as it's far to abstract to be applicable yet not theoretical enough to be sufficiently engaging intellectually.",
                "YES",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student who does not like doing math computations with derivatives. This course is a little computation heavy, so that is definitely something to note before taking the class. However, the computations are for the most part pretty straight forward. All the derivatives I took in this class were essentially just power rule, so as long as you know how to take a partial derivative, it's really not that bad. But I know that for some of my friends who are global affairs majors and don't enjoy doing math as much, they opted to take intermediate macroeconomics instead because they only have to take one of the intermediate economics courses. That being said, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who is interested in or enjoys economics. I learned a lot in this class, building off of what I learned in ECON 115. This is obviously a big lecture course, but if you have already taken ECON 115, you will know what to expect. This is also a super accessible course to anyone who is good at math and has taken ECON 115, and just wants to learn more about economics even though it is not their major.",
                "If you are an economics major, you are required to take this class. I am not, however, and I still think this class was intellectually stimulating because of the mathematics and problem-solving required, as well as how all his math is under a \"real-world\" framework.",
                "If you have to take this class or want an easier econ credit, it's fine. As a STEM major I found it pretty straightforward. Note that if you've already taken intro micro, game theory, and math through multivariable calculus you essentially already know everything covered in this course. That's either a good or bad thing depending on your objectives.",
                "Yes, very nice and intuitive in understanding certain topics in economics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it helped me connect my understandings of multivariable calculus to economics. It also allowed me to grasp the significance of optimal allocation and efficient choices when subjected to constraints and different economic environments. It allows you to use math to understand concepts that were introduced in introductory microeconomics."
