                "I furthered my latin skills in this course, namely with Vergil. The quizzes definitely strengthened my grammar and scansion skills tremendously. However, I feel that I grew the most in the final project, as I had never written a substantial Latin paper at Yale. I found the paper writing experience to be incredibly enriching, and it reminded me why I want to be a classics major.",
                "I learned how to engage with Latin in a much more language- and grammar-oriented manner. I learned more about the \"Aeneid\" from both a historical and literary perspective. I learned skills that exponentially improved my skills with translating Latin.",
                "A wider knowledge of the Aeneid than I had from high school AP Latin, as well as deeper understanding of and appreciation for Vergil's intricately-crafted language, references, themes, etc.",
                "I improved my translating skills. I also gained more facility with scansion, broadened my Latin vocabulary, and deepened my understanding of the Aeneid particularly and classical analysis more broadly.",
                "I am coming out of this class with a much deeper appreciation for the art of Vergil's Latin and for close reading of Latin in general. I also learned much more about Roman mythology, culture, and history through the discussions as part of this course.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of significant passages of Vergil's Aeneid, as well as honing my ability to closely read and analyze. It was a great crash course in scansion, as that's required for the quizzes and not something I'd paid much mind to prior.",
                "I got a good overview of the Aeneid and the themes woven throughout it. My Latin improved as well.",
                "I improved my facility at Latin and gained a greater understanding of the main themes in the Aeneid.",
                "I learned so much about how to read and analyze Latin poetry (and Vergil in particularly) by taking Professor Freudenburg's class on the Aeneid. I learned much more about how to leverage scansion to translate the text and to explore what Vergil does and does not emphasize, and I also learned to pick apart the diction Vergil uses to explore the underlying themes and messages Vergil sends beyond the outward appearance of the text. Lastly, I learned how to examine formal aspects of the text such as figurative language and the actions of major characters to analyze Vergil's opinion of his contemporary world and his complex relationship with the rising principate and its hold on Roman society and art."

                "I personally loved every aspect of this course; I think the assessments were fair and I appreciated that there were multiple opportunities to improve your grade. As I mentioned before, I was especially fond of the final term paper.",
                "Strengths of the course: teacher, content, grade structure/graded workload.\r\nWeaknesses of the course: pacing of the course, non-graded workload.\r\nImprovements: Spending less class time on the actual translation (students should be required to prepare three questions about the translation before each class and we can go over that instead). The rest of the time could be spent on actual analysis of the text, which sometimes was lost given the amount we had to get done each night. Also, maybe spreading out the material a bit more. Some passages did not feel as necessary for us to read, while some extremely necessary passages were lost or under-examined.",
                "This was a fantastic course. Prof. Freudenburg is both an extremely insightful authority on Vergil and a very chill, laid-back professor. It's a lot of daily translation (as expected for an upper-level Latin seminar), but the discussions are great. I came away from almost every class feeling like I'd learned a lot and grappled with some really interesting stuff.",
                "It was consistent, well-taught, and enjoyable. The course material was reliably interesting. Really, no weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Love the format of this course with reading every time we meet usually preceded by a brief lecture from Prof. Freudenburg about relevant historical/mythological/artistic content.",
                "The course is very well taught, the seminar style is conducive to the learning objectives, the material is interesting. I loved the multimedia elements and wish there could've been more, maybe as enrichment options.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freudenburg is a wonderful teacher. He is friendly to his students, and everything he has to say in class is fascinating--it is a pleasure to hear him talk about the Aeneid. He is also very responsive to the class's needs and ideas. I liked the quizzes and thought these were a great way to check my learning every few weeks that wasn't incredibly stressful. I thought the Aeneid excerpts were well-picked. I loved the YUAG visit. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated more direction on how to do a close reading, and how to formulate this into a final paper. Simply a one-page instruction sheet with some do's and don't's would have been helpful for people who haven't done a paper in this style before. I also thought the readings got too long towards the end of the semester. We started out with 60-80 lines per reading, but by the end of the semester, more of the readings were over 100 lines which became overwhelming as workload increases around this time anyways.",
                "The strength of this course is that it goes so much beyond being a simple Latin course to become a course devoted to understanding the mind of Vergil (as much as possible in a semester's work) when writing the Aeneid by analyzing the text in its original Latin. By translating and examining key passages from all twelve books of the Aeneid, we both looked over the breadth of Vergil's range without sacrificing much of our ability to examine the depth of his writings in our haste to get through the entire text. By having many students in the class translate and comment on the text, we were able to bounce ideas off of each other and consider how the Aeneid fit into the broader framework of classical literature. However, at times we spent too much time discussing one element of the text such that later we had to speed through the latter half of our translation."

                "Definitely!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone well versed in Latin. Professor Freudenberg is very well known for his work on the Aeneid, and I was very excited to attend every class and hear his thoughts on every passage. However, Professor Freudenberg not only told us his thoughts on every passage, but he also urged us to cultivate our own opinion's on every passage of the work. Moreover, I felt like I grew so much as a classics student",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who successfully took Latin at a high level in high school. Whether you think you're interested in Latin or not, just take this course: you will undoubtedly develop an interest you didn't know you had. It is definitely difficult for a student whose level of Latin in high school was not as successful as it could have been (e.g., a 3 or lower on the AP Exam, a year or two off of Latin before re-entering the course). Be prepared for 150+ lines of translation each week; depending on your skill level, this can take between 1.5 and 5 hours of homework before each class. The enjoyment you get from the material and the improvement you get from the teacher, however, far outweighs the negatives of homework load.",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to classics majors or anyone interested in reading Vergil. The discussions are engaging and rewarding, and Prof. Freudenburg is great.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in taking it. This class taught me so much more about a text I had long felt familiar with that I had to reconsider my definition of familiarity with a text.",
                "Yes, regardless of if you plan to become a Classics major!",
                "Absolutely! A fun and informative L5 Latin. Great for major requirements or for those who have taken it in HS and want one last hurrah.",
                "For Classics students, it is really a must-take class. Freudenburg is great there is no better setting to read the Aeneid. For non-Classics majors, I think it may still be a very interesting class to take if you have a good background in Latin and an interest in the Aeneid.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in Latin literature. Vergil is essential, and Freudenburg's knowledge of him is vast.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any Latin student because the Aeneid is one of the most significant works of Latin Literature and Professor Freudenburg is the perfect instructor to explore the complex world of Vergil's writing. While the student would certainly be hard pressed at times to complete translations quickly or consider all of the implications of Vergil's writing, the course completely changed my perspective on the Aeneid and in particular the importance and beauty of the Latin it was written in, and after this course I can never look at a Latin text in the same way. For those interested in majoring in Classics, this is a perfect stepping stone into future courses on Latin Literature."
