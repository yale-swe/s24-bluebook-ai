Some readings seemed unnecessary and got to be very long",

Honestly, the only weakness of the course is that we didnt have time to do more of each topic or do more comparative work (even though that happened naturally).",

Other TAs hand easy As but discussion might not be the best."

It was a bit more work than I expected, but I truly enjoyed most of the work. It was a great class to take second semester senior year. It didn't change my life but forced me to think about a lot of important questions.",

The point isn't to learn about different world religions, but rather to use them as jumping-off points to consider your own values and assumptions and (hopefully) come to some real conclusions you can take with you after you leave Yale.",

He is the type of professor who thinks about teaching in earnest, as can be seen through his relentless dedication to cultivating fruitful class discussion. Reading a variety of materials across traditions is something I wouldn't have done myself, and it was even better that I had a wonderful class and professor with which to discuss those materials with.",
                "Absolutely! If you can take this course, especially with Ryan, you should! Itll make you think about your life, and especially your time at Yale and after, in a different way.",

The class provides a space for deep discussion about the things each student values about life, or thinks is true about life, which is a rare opportunity at Yale. It was great to be able to raise doubts and ask hard questions and to really think critically about life and what makes it worth living as a class.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, but I would say to take it Credit/D if you want to take it with Ryan, who is the best TA. This is not a gut if you take it with him."
