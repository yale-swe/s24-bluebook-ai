                "Basic economic concepts, supply and demand, optimization, production, consumer theory",
                "I learned how factors of economics can be applied to the real world like how when the FED increased interest rates and it affected society and the stock market",
                "I did not have any prior knowledge to Microeconomics before this course, so everything I learned was new. I learned how to read the economics graphs and understand them right away. I also learned how to use economic principles in real-life and analyze why the economy might work in this way.",
                "I received an introduction into economic thinking through ECON 110. This class discusses microeconomics from the perspectives of the consumer and of the firm. In this smaller class format, Tolga makes this class welcoming and interacts with the students, discussing economics and applications of these topics in the real world.",
                "I gained key insight about how the economy works the way it does, how perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, etc. affects the product market, and how the types of interactions between firms affects the factor market. Furthermore, I gained deeper insight on how these concepts apply to both historical and current events, such as the start of firms like FedEx.",
                "Knowledge of introductory micro, and a brief introduction to game theory and some behavioral economics.",
                "Gained a deeper understanding of basic microeconomic principles. Scratched the surface of several different concepts but did not have time to dive extremely deep into any in particular.",
                "I learned how to think about economics and look at the way our individual preferences and incentives come together to create a market. We saw that often the most important developments in economics come from simple common sense observations about the world around us.",
                "Introduction to microeconomics, learned about different graphical models of market structures and consumer rationality.",
                "This class gave me a good understanding of all the concepts I need for future studies in microeconomics. In addition, I benefitted from a small classroom environment with a teacher that I could talk one on one with.",
                "I developed an understanding of introductory Microeconomic concepts, both in theory, and through mathematical examples.",
                "Decent overview of basic concepts in microeconomics, especially consumer choice and firm profit maximization. More emphasis on practice problems with random numbers and less on larger-scale concepts (though Tolga does give lots of general life advice through the context of economic principles)."

            "comments": [
                "I think that the strength of this course is how engaging Tolga is. I think that however he sometimes glosses over the intricacies of the material.",
                "The course is very heavily weighted on the midterm and the final. There is not a lot of work outside of those two tests (only 4 psets the entire semester), so it's really up to the student to keep up-to-date with the content. Also, instead of a seminar, I think the class is more accurately described as a lecture with the opportunity to ask a few questions at the end of each class.",
                "Strengths: lots of access to the professor\r\nWeaknesses: limited opportunities for feedback, harsh curve, limited resources, professors' explanations were difficult to follow sometimes",
                "The strength of the course was the size of the course and the real-life applications. Compared to courses like Econ 115 hearing from friends, I felt Tolga was much more thorough and in-depth in his teaching and gave more examples of how the different principles could be reflected in the broader economy. We learned much more about the stock market and inflation which is highly applicable today. I also appreciated the video lectures as I could use them to review on the midterm and the final. A weakness was there was not enough graded material. I wish my grade didn't solely depend on my performance on the one mid-term and one final.",
                "Strengths: Tolga provides plenty of examples for each difficult concept and he encourages us to think of our own examples. The problem sets are not too difficult and he gives us plenty of time to complete them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No glaring weaknesses.",
                "The course is very well organized and taught in a way that makes it a bit easier to understand. However, I do wish there were more course notes ahead of time in case I missed something during class.",
                "The course is a classic intro to micro. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Not too much work: 4 p-sets that are around 90 minutes each and a midterm and a final. Good TAs \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not very many grades, and the class is curved. 115 is curved too, but it's a lot larger so you don't see who you're competing against, and the curve is better from what I've heard. Also the class can be kinda mathy and there are some problems on the exams that are annoying and that we haven't gone over specifically how to do in class.",
                "I really enjoyed the seminar style of this course in contrast to the large microeconomics lecture-based course (ECON 115). I felt that it allowed for better discussion and a better environment to ask questions.",
                "I liked the way it was structured with looking at things from the consumer side in the first part then switching gears to the production side. I think the sequence of topics was very nice in how it flowed from concept to concept. Another strength is of course the small class size which allows for greater communication with the professor. I think it can be hard at times to keep up with all the concepts which are introduced in quick succession.",
                "Tolga is a wonderful teacher, and knows how to keep the class engaged. I think the lack of assignments in this class make your final grade more difficult to evalulate long term. However, I did enjoy the way the class allowed for class discussions.",
                "The strength of this class was the experience that Tolga has. If you ask the right questions, he will always have an answer. A weakness is how fast paced class is, but that is due to the large amount of content that needs to be taught. This class is great as long as you stay on top of what you are learning and check in with the teacher.",
                "This course is well structured to enable student engagement with the professor due to the seminar nature of the course. Professor Koker is always willing to help students who need it, and frequently gives examples during class, and is willing to re-explain things if asked.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is that you will leave the class having learned a decent amount about a very wide range of economic topics. But many concepts aren't treated with a sufficiently in-depth explanation (in my opinion), and I wish I had a stronger intuitive understanding of the concepts."

                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in taking microeconomics. I think that possibly compared to the lecture it is much more interesting and engaging and the instructor is very funny. If you are not interested in microeconomics though I would not take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class, but I would advise the student to thing about what type of learner they are and if they would be better suited to 115. 115 has more resources, more feedback, and a better curve. This course was interesting, but I felt the seminar style wasn't as much of an asset as I thought it was going to be. However, Tolga is a very dedicated professor an will nourish your interest in econ if you already have one.",
                "Yes Tolga is a fun professor who has a lot of experience teaching intro micro but gives a lot more insight outside of just the economic studies",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. The seminar style gets you more engaged and I think learning about microeconomics is just beneficial as it teaches you how the world functions.",
                "I would if the student had no prior knowledge of microeconomics and was interested in the topic. However, if the student is pre-med, I would not recommend it.",
                "A microeconomics class should be a must-take for any Yale student, and ECON 110 is a great choice for first years. The class is welcoming and gives you plenty of resources to help you if you get behind or miss a class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Maybe its just Tolga's sections, but we learn a lot more than just economic theory; we learn how to apply it to real life scenarios, why Walmart became so big, why the stock market is the way it is, etc. Personally it changed the way I make some of my decisions to be more logical, more \"economically sound,\" less based on emotional bias. Also, for what its worth, Tolga will some bring some random treat to give everyone at the midterm or final exam, this semester it was french truffles.",
                "Honestly I would say take 115. This class is fine if you have a scheduling conflict with 115, like I did. You'll learn the econ, it's just there are more people to study with in 115. There are also 3 exams not too, and the curve is better in 115.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is curious to learn a little bit more about economics, potentially as an exploratory course. This is also a good course to take as a first year student interested in majoring in economics.",
                "Yes, very interesting and well taught.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about microeconomics in a smaller class environment. The concepts were all very interesting and give a peak into the mechanisms behind our economic system.",
                "Yes, I think that this course allowed for a level of teaching that was very high. I also felt as though this class teaches you to be strategic with your studying, because there is only one midterm and one final, and the psets do not count for very much of your grade.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course especially if it is with Tolga. He has been teaching this course for a long time and makes his lectures fun while teaching you a lot of content.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to major in economics at Yale. It is detail, thorough, and well taught. I believe that it has prepared me well for any further courses I will take.",
                "Probably not. If you need into micro as a prereq for higher level econ classes, then you don't have a choice. Personally, I was hoping for moreTolga's interludes and life advice are iconic, but the classes are otherwise not so engaging, and I didn't really come out of the class with a great understanding of the material. Spend at least a week shopping both this class and 115; many people find the larger lecture more engaging, even people who normally prefer smaller classes (110 is basically a smaller lecture class anyway)."
