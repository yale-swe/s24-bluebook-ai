                "I learned a vast amount about Ancient Egyptian Archaeology from prehistoric times through the New Kingdom. I came to better understand how to analyze archaeological finds and interpret artifacts found at sites. In previous archaeology classes I have taken, there was more of a focus on settlements, so it was fascinating to learn about all of the mortuary sites in Ancient Egypt. I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
                "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the history of Ancient Egypt and the history of the archeological sites that can be found there. I learned a great deal about a subject I knew virtually nothing about beforehand. In addition, I found the research paper and the in-class presentation to be great ways to further learn about a topic that was particularly interesting to me. This course has sparked a lot of interest in this subject, and I think I will be looking forward to taking more archeology classes in the future.",

            "comments": [
                "This is a phenomenal course. It is challenging to smush thousands of years of civilization into a single semester, but Professor Marouard did a fantastic job of covering this wide span of time in a clear and engaging fashion. I enjoyed how many photos were included in slides and the use of Google Earth to help orient us; it helped to transport us to the sites in question much more effectively than just reading the textbook. I loved the approach of going in chronological order, as it highlighted key shifts and constants throughout time. I also liked that, even though the course was largely lecture-based, it was capped at a seminar size, promoting a sense of community in the class.",
                "I think this course is very well taught. Mr. Marouard is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and his enthusiasm is very clear in every class. Another strength is that the structure of the course allows for improvement throughout the semester. That being said, I think a weakness with the course is the difficulty at some points. Particularly on the midterm exam, I noticed that the grading was extraordinarily tough and was looking for answers that required so much detail, it would have been nearly impossible to fully prepare for. This really took me by surprise as I felt that the strict expectations on the exam were not necessarily explained beforehand and could not have been foreseen.",
                "Strengths: lectures were always very interesting, never dry. A lot of cool images and artifacts examined in class, but also time spent understanding why we were learning those things. Workload was very manageable but also useful. Weaknesses: none with the class, but there were definitely some students in the class who took it but were not at all engaged or interested in the material.",
                "The classes are very engaging and the material is super interesting. The slideshows are really helpful when preparing notes.",
                "Interesting lectures with very few assignments. Most students are not archaeology majors, so very accessible",
                "Strengths: good synthesis of many years of history, good focus on archaeological evidence. Weakness: lots of details without clarification on the most important ideas."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It was well-structured, interesting, and had a very reasonable workload. If you have a general interest in archaeology or want to start getting into the study of Ancient Egypt, this is the perfect class. It does not assume any previous knowledge of Ancient Egypt or archaeological practice, yet it is still engaging if you do have background in these areas. Professor Marouard is incredibly knowledgable, explains topics well, and is very responsive and patient to student questions. Take this class!",
                "It depends. Something I need to emphasize at the beginning is that THIS COURSE IS NOT A GUT. DO NOT TAKE IT AS SUCH. You have been warned, if you take this course thinking it's a gut - you WILL realize that it is not one and you will regret not listening to this review. I know people that have taken it thinking it would be easy and ended up having to Credit/D it. That being said, if you're someone who has a genuine curiosity and interest in the subject then I highly recommend giving this course a try. Its well taught and its genuinely super interesting material. Be prepared to engage in the class, but if you stay on top of studying then you should be fine. Although I struggled more than I expected in this class, I do not regret taking it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to those who are interested in egyptian archaeology. Professor Marouard is clearly passionate and an expert in what he does, and he brings a lot of really interesting information to class. After taking it, you realize just how much ancient egypt is present in culture today, and you also can explain the why behind many artifacts.",
                "It was a great intro archaeology course and I had a lot of fun with it.",
                "A great course to try something new or expand current passions! Has a bit of something for everyone, and he will tailor to your interests if you reach out/engage with material. You will get as much or as little out of the course as you choose"
