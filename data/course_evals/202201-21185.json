In this class, I learned what makes for an interesting photo in the art world, as well as the basics of operating my camera. The teacher and TA also had advice about how to cultivate your craft, how to get less nervous about taking photos in public, and how to work with human subjects. I also learned how to edit photos in Photoshop, though mostly through unstructured doing-it-myself and some help from the Prof. and TA. We also discussed famous photographers and their work. Overall the class provides a solid introduction to photography, and I came away more confident in my photographic abilities and excited to take more pictures.."

                "A major strength of the course is Ted, who is a very thoughtful and kind teacher. He's very good at giving feedback -- he has this way of conveying what you should fix\/improve without seeming like he's criticizing or saying your current work is bad. I liked that the class was relatively low-stress without feeling like a \"gut.\" I appreciated how willing Ted and Amartya were to help out, especially with Photoshop. It was really fun to do something artistic and the course really brought out my creative side, which I really appreciated. A weakness I can think of is that it was, during some weeks, the class was so low-intensity that I felt like I wanted more assignments. It might be cool to do a photo-of-the-week assignment where we all had to make a photo with a certain theme (light, self-portrait, etc.) for Monday's class.."

                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It's difficult to get into (something like 100 people apply each semester for 12 spots in the class), but I definitely recommend you give it a try. Digital Photography is very laid-back, and has only two major assignments  a first Crit and a final project. As such, it's a great low-stress addition to your course schedule. I also feel like I genuinely learned a lot about photography and know how to take more artistic photos. It was really fun going to class, editing photos, talking with Ted and Amartya, and going out and taking my own photos. I did get the sense that some students were more engaged than others  since the class is so competitive and spots are in demand, I recommend that you really only apply if you think you're going to put effort in. The class definitely requires some effort and a commitment to taking photos on a weekly basis, and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to do that!.",
