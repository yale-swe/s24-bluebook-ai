His office hours are also helpful. Weaknesses: because this class is intended as a first philosophy class, some issues arent addressed as deeply and that could be frustrating in some cases. I also wish there could be more instructions on writing. It seems that learning about philosophy and writing about it are two quite different things. Knowing all the concepts doesnt necessarily mean that your writing will be as good and clear as your undertaking, so some additional trainings on writing would be helpful.",
                "The level of discussion in the seminars was great, and I think that the presentation element that the classes had was really engaging and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the texts through this type of detailed explanation. The syllabus was varied and fascinating as well. One thing is that I wish we had gotten a bit more guidance in terms of what was being looked for in the essays.",

Hes genuinely excited to hear students ideas and interact with them, which I really appreciate. If there are any weakness in the course, I would say they could be fixed by Professor Maxwell being slightly more rigorous in his critiques if students arguments and structuring the topics covered in seminar more explicitly."
