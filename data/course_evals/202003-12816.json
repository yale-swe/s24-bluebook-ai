                "The strength of this course is Col. Granholm. I really appreciated his insight into the material. I felt like we got a good picture of the Air Force and his role and experiences within it. With real world examples and case studies, the material just seemed more relevant and important than in previous AS classes. He treated us like capable adults, and it made a difference. In addition, the Col. Rodgers guest lecture was one of the most motivating and enjoyable lectures I've ever attended. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of AS202 has to be the material. There's not much a course director can do about this, Holm Center dictates the requisite packets and material. With topics like \"Kelly's two dimensional model of followership\" and comparing the 3 methods of problem-solving, this simply isn't going to be the most intellectually engaging course you'll have at Yale. Nevertheless, Col. Granholm made it a good experience and I did truly enjoy the course.",
                "This course was interesting and was taught really well. The work level was appropriate for the course and I enjoyed every discussion session.",
                "The strength was definitely Col Graholm's decision to format the course in order to emphasize the ideas he found to be most important. He also brought in engaging and insightful guest speakers who complemented the content of the course well."
