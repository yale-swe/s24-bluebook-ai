                "I think the course could be timed better (we spent two months on one scene and three weeks on Chekhov), and also some transparency in terms of scene partners and attendance given that it was an ensemble dependent class. I don't know how that could be fixed but it was an issue.",
                "I think that the obvious weakness of this course was that it was once a week for four hours instead of twice a week for two hours -- while this was obviously a unique circumstance,  I think that it was harder for students to get into a routine and maintain a high level of engagement. I think that our units in scenework suffered because of this -- it felt simultaneously like we had too much time to fill and not enough time to work on the scenes. I think that this class format worked best when we were able to have guest instructors come in to teach a  \"masterclass\" about a specific technique or aspect of performance. If the class were to take this form again, I would recommend that the whole course be organized more or less in this way.",
                "I loved that this course was taught by a young actor who is currently active in the industry--it made me feel like all parts of what she was teaching was relevant, and it felt honest and earnest. Another big strength was that she let us take what was useful to us and leave what wasn't.\r\n\r\nNot a weakness of the course itself, because it's meant to be introductory and broad, but I feel like we touched on so many different aspects of acting without being able to explore them deeply, and I now don't know what courses to take to focus more on these things in particular, since it seems like all undergraduate acting courses are broad like this in some sense."

                "Yes, but I feel like it would greatly depend on who's teaching it. I loved it with Sohina, and I'm not sure if I would have had the same level of engagement with another professor. This course is a great and necessary introduction to further studying acting at Yale."
