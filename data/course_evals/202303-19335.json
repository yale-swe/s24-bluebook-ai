                "I learned how to think about the meaning of ornamentation and its practical use in architecture over time, from a variety of fascinating and interdisciplinary perspectives. Through the homework exercises, I learned how to diagram and track the effects of ornament, as well as develop my own ornament, following the philosphies of several different architects and designers. As a non-architecture major, I learned how to conceptualize a final design project and prepare for a final review."

                "Loved this class! Great mix of history, theory, some cognitive science and then applying these all to your own design practice. The design assignments were wonderful in how they allow you to develop skills and ornament intricacy each week. A fun field trip and cool guest speakers! Misha and Kass are so kind and enthusiastic. They are very available and really care about helping students improve their skills and designs.",
                "I think this course has so much potential, but this was its first year and I think there were still some kinks to be worked out. A strength was the design project at the end of the semester which allowed us to use a lot of the ideas we had been taking about all semester. I also thought each individual component of the class (readings\/lecture and discussion, design exercises, and eye tracking) were valuable but all together it was too much and the components sort of detracted from one another. I think it would be better to focus more on one or two things rather than try to do it all because then it became overwhelming and it was hard to absorb everything.",
                "The lectures, readings, guest speakers, and discussions were interesting and definitely expanded the way I see ornament. The mini hands-on ornamenting projects were a useful and fun way to put into practice what we learn in that part of the course. I appreciated having two professors with different perspectives and teaching styles. The course would benefit from leaning more into history\/theory or materials\/design, as I felt the focus was at times too broad.",
                "Strengths: fantastic professors, good theory\/practice split and great readings; Weaknesses: sometimes too few guidelines\/examples on the assignments",
                "This was a fantastic course! The biggest strength was its organization---yes, some week's assignments were more work than others, but for the most part the pacing was just right to keep me engaged without feeling overwhelmed. Especially for the final review, the clear organization and staggered deadlines reduced my stress and helped me perform my best. I also really loved the range of weekly topics chosen by Kas and Misha. They were all distinct but meaningful, and together they helped me develop a deep sense of how ornament influences the world. One weakness is the relative lack of discussion time spent on readings, although this wasn't a major issue---I just personally feel like it would have been very interesting to hear more of what other students (or Kas and Misha) had to say about the weekly readings, which were often quite dense and complex!"

                "Yes, if you are really interested in the topic and especially if the structure of the course changes a little bit. I still learned a lot and enjoyed the class, but the work load was heavy and also required a lot of different types of work all at once.",
                "If you need a credit for a design major, yes, as it's specific material.",
                "Yes, a fascinating intersection between art and science that truly offers something few other courses do.",

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you aren't an architecture major! It was a highlight of my week to attend class, and get to hear from so many fascinating guest speakers, as well as Misha and Kas's amazing insight into the study of ornament. This class offered a broad but meaningful survey of ways to think about ornament, and can really appeal to students from all backgroundssome weeks focused on architecture\/design principles and ornament-making demonstrations, while other weeks were about connecting ornament to neuroscience, nature, and math. Beyond the exciting theoretical content, the design exercises were a lot of fun, and always a manageable workload. By the end of the semester, all of the incremental work helped me feel prepared for the final design project. If you are at all interested in ornament, take this class! You will love it."
