                "I was able to explore different forms of life styles and and cultures by taking this class. Being able to contribute and add input during class aided me to grow as an individual.",
                "I learned how to effectively write a book review and read ethnographies for anthropological analyses.",
                "This course was the most fulfilling course I have ever taken. I learned about the field of anthropology, something I had never been exposed to before, among may reproductive issues around the world. I learned to write a book review and make meaningful contributions to group discussions.",
                "How to write a book review, how to lead a seminar discussion, how to read and dissect an ethnography, what sort of reproductive technologies there are in different parts of the world and how the medical system is intertwined with local cultures.",
                "I learned a lot about anthropology as a field of study, specifically with regards to ethnographies, field studies, and anthropological terminology. I also learned how to write a book review, a skill I assume I will utilize many times throughout university. I also gained a much larger sense of reproduction worldwide, how it differs, and how reproduction itself can apply to many different aspects of biology, society, and culture.",
                "Through this course, I believe that I gained a well-rounded understanding of women's global health and reproductive technologies. I learned about the role that different reproductive technologies play in different parts of the world and how they act on a cultural, medical, and sociopolitical level. Before this course, I had not realized how intrinsically tied women's health issues are to nation-states and are directly affected by history and traditions. In terms of skills, I learned how to lead an efficient class discussion and ask insightful questions to best channel the essence of the books we read in class. Furthermore, I learned the art of writing book reviews and picking the most crucial information to present to the reader.",
                "Learned a huge amount about current issues in medical anthropology, as well as the anthropology field in general; learned how to write a comprehensive book review and lead a discussion section.",
                "In this class I learned a lot about the unique history and cultural views on reproductive technologies. The technologies analyzed in this course varied greatly as some were focused on cosmetic surgeries, contraceptive and hormone use, and invitro technologies. Because these topics impact society as a whole, not just women, these themes and concepts should be discussed more regularly. I learned how to read and analyze anthropology works.",
                "In this class, I developed the ability to write anthropological book reviews and how to read ethnographies. I developed the ability to read many books in a super short time frame and to know what to look for in those readings in order to be prepared for class discussions and to formulate book reports. This was also a great class to develop your ability to participate in a seminar discussion very in college, as Marcia gave us the space to share our ideas in a super open format.",
                "In addition to leaving with a vast set of knowledge -- about women's health, reproductive issues and technologies, different cultural values, and the discipline of anthropology -- I feel like I am leaving this course with a whole new way of looking at the world. So much of this course was at the intersection of history, interpersonal relationships, healthcare, feminism, and biomedicine, which just added so many layers of understanding. This course has made me interested in studying or working in public health.",
                "I learned how to read critically and discuss topics productively. I gained knowledge regarding a variety of reproductive technologies around the world. It was an immersive and engaging discussion-based class.",
                "I loved this class! One of the most useful skills I learned was how to skim a book. I learned how to look for the important information and not read every detail, while still understanding the main points. I learned how to write a book review and the challenges of summarizing. And I learned to speak up and participate in class. I learned how to think critically and draw comparisons. I learned so much in this class and feel that it equipped me for the rest of my time at Yale."

            "comments": [
                "I think that the only weakness of the course is the redundancy in some of the readings. The strengths would definitely be how involved students are in directing seminar discussions.",
                "Strengths: The subject material is very interesting and relevant. I liked that everyone had a chance to lead the seminar. Marcia's expertise. Weaknesses: Reading one book every week was a little difficult to keep up with at times, and sometimes that affected the conversation--you could tell sometimes that not everyone was able to throughly read the book.",
                "I found the selection of course material and formatting of the seminar to be a real strength. I really loved that the students led the discussions for each book. I also really appreciated the diversity of regions, people, and anthropologists that were highlighted through our different materials. I do think, however, that the final movie we watched in the course probably required a trigger warning.",
                "The strength of this course is that it captures a wide range of regions and topics in reproductive health. The class discussions are engaging and keep you wanting to continue with them after class. Furthermore, the readings were very fascinating; however, they were a bit long to read in one week with work from other classes. Although a lot was learned through the readings and peer-led class discussions, I wish I could have received some more \"lecture-like\" teaching from the professor simply because I think that everything she had to say was super interesting.",
                "Loved the class, really had no critiques",
                "I think that a strength of this class was the class discussions that promoted student engagement however I think that the environment created during these discussions was not favorable of allowing different opinions to that of the dominant opinion. Often religion was seen as irrational for being against certain reproductive technologies or governments were ignorant for illegalizing certain reproductive technologies and I think there was a big gap of knowledge for not addressing these topics and giving them validity.",
                "One strength of this course was the workload, variety of work, and distribution of assignments throughout the semester (specifically referring to non-reading homework). The course requires you to write two book reports, lead a seminar discussion, and write a final comparative book report. Within the time frame that these are assigned, these are super doable and allow you to complete all of them with thought and attention. It is also a super comfortable, open space to share your thoughts and personal experiences, which balanced the larger lectures that most first-semester first-years take. However, the major weakness of this course is the reading timeline. Marcia expects you to read a book (usually around 300 pages) every week and come to class ready to discuss or to have written a book report on it. For me, this was simply not doable in conjunction with my other classwork. I think if the class had half as much reading I would have been able to complete so much more of it and be a lot more engaged in discussion.",
                "Strengths:  The student-led discussions were very engaging, the ethnographies made me think about the world differently, every element of the class was highly intentional and relevant, the course description of \"feminist book club\" rings true, and Marcia!!\r\n\r\nHard to think of any weaknesses! The writing assignments were very formulaic, which may not be everyone's favorite, but also relieved some stress.",
                "There were numerous course strengths. Each book selected by Professor Inhorn was compelling and engrossing. The class discussions were interesting and lively.",
                "My favorite part of this class was the warm, open environment! The class was like a feminist book club and I felt that my classmates were always cheering me on. We not only learned so much from Marcia, but we also learned so much from each other. We would even get meals outside of class and Im still friends with some classmates.\r\n\r\nI also loved his this class was conducted! I liked that students would lead class, and Marcia would add insights here and there. I felt that this really pushed us to think and grow because nothing was just laid out for us. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was that the amount of reading felt overwhelming sometimes. This is really what pushed me to learn to skim, although there were some weeks with a lot of work that the reading felt stressful."

                "Yes! I really enjoyed Marcia and the energy of the class in general. I learned so much about reproductive technologies and reproductive health in other parts of the world. This class changed my view on the objectivity of science.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The ability to take a course solely devoted to reproduction is incredible. I feel I learned a great deal about women's (and sometimes men's) reproductive lives, the societal influences on women and reproduction, and the impact of technology on reproduction. Marcia is an incredible professor who cares greatly about her students. Learning from such an accomplished anthropologist is such a privilege.",
                "Yes, this course is great for anyone interested in women's issues/ health, anyone interested in medicine, or for those even interested in cultural anthropology. I also think that if you are a female in general you should take this course as it directly speaks to our lives.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Inhorn is the best.",
                "I would recommend this course however I would warn about the large workload and really recommend it if the student had had previous experience with reading anthropology.",
                "I would, but only if they were super willing and excited to do so much reading so quickly. The content of the books is really fascinating, eye-opening, and specific to material that you won't learn at most (if any) other courses at Yale. I would recommend that students who are more interested in the social side of reproductive technology than the medical side take this course, as the books do really focus on socio-political factors. I really want to emphasizethere is so much reading!! all the time!! You're able to get by without doing it, but the discussions become so boring if you have nothing to contribute. Take the course if you're really interested in the material (because it is fascinating) and willing to put in the work.",
                "Absolutely yes. Take this course if you're even remotely interested in reproductive justice and women's health -- you'll come away with a much more nuanced picture of the global reproductive landscape. The workload is high (a book a week), but the readings and discussions are fascinating. This is the kind of course I came to Yale for.",
                "Yes",
                "Please take this class!!! I learned so much this semester and have learned so much knowledge and skills! You learn skills that are so useful for other classes. And I always looked forward to class because of the warm class environment."
