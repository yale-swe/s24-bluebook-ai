                "I learned time management and cooperation",
                "I learned a lot about basic biochemistry and cell biology. I also learned a lot of applications of cell biology by learning how to understand the contents of scientific papers.",
                "I primarily developed my scientific critical thinking. Throughout the course, many questions were posed that were very open-ended and I felt that those questions really expanded my perspective. I also felt that my scientific writing improved. The course really focused on answering questions as briefly as possible and making your answer clear. I got the impression that I was doing real science.",
                "I learned a lot of foundational information about biology and biological processes. I also learned successful strategies for completing problem set type assignments.",
                "I learned more about cell biology and various macromolecules, especially proteins. Additionally, my paper reading skills improved due to reading several works of scientific literature, class breakout sessions analyzing figures, and comprehension questions on p-sets.",
                "I gained an enormous amount of knowledge about biochemistry and cell biology. Further, I also got a glimpse of what university lectures are like since it is very different from what I get in high school. Additionally, I met supportive professors and amazing Yales students that made this course educational and fun at the same time."

                "This course's strengths are that the material is often explained clearly and concisely. The instructions and expectations for assignment are also communicated very well. The problem set help sessions and quiz study sessions were also very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses might be that the material is gone through very quickly at some points in the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the small classroom setting, giving us plenty of chances to interact closely with different classmates and the professors. Given the time frame, it is nearly impossible to cover the same quantity of content that is covered during the school year, but I think the structure of the class and the emphasis on scientific methods is suitable for a summer session class. The synchronous class schedule is pretty rigorous, although understandable, but the low workload helps balance that.",
                "The professors of this course have been awesome, they are extremely insightful and run the course very efficiently. At times, lectures can be dry, but also it is a very crammed course in the sense it is a rapid pace and almost 10 hours of class time a week which can be grueling.",
                "Since summer courses are so compressed, I was still able to remember information I learned early in the course towards the end. I was also thankful for how available the professors made themselves, especially in the absence of TAs/peer tutors. I think the case studies approach to cell biology in 105B is not a good way to introduce students to the field, but alas.",
                "I think that a weakness of this course overall is that it moves extremely fast. There is obviously lots of material to cover but I wish we had more time and opportunities to absorb what we were learning. Also, I felt that for the second half of the course, there were a lot of material the teacher was teaching that he expected us to understand without the proper background knowledge.",
                "I think it could be improved by not having homework assigned for holidays. I ended up doing work on Father's day and the 4th of July, which is not ideal and fun and hampered my social life. Also, plan ahead. This was easily avoidable.",
                "I think the strengths were the professors who were very nice and communicative. They were willing to help at any juncture and gave great feedback. I think the lectures were very strong, especially considering they were enthralling for the whole hour and 45 minutes daily. I felt the course was very condensed, but that is what a Summer class will be. So, I do not think there were any real weaknesses.",
                "Major weakness is the fact that there was no teaching assistant or peer tutor. If the regular school year has this, but the summer version when it is 2.5x as fast does not, it is a major problem!",
                "The major strength of this course was that it facilitated advanced discussion which reinforced my understanding of the basic concepts. I do not think that there were any major weaknesses but I do have suggestions for improvement. In the Cell biology section, we learned about the techniques before we read the papers. I think it is better to discuss the techniques as we go along when we are looking at experimental data. \r\nAlthough I understand it is a summer course, I felt as though the course tried to cover too much material that may have similar underlying principles.  In other words, perhaps more time on concepts rather than content. Perhaps more use could be made of videos presented by the investigators that discovered the basic concept. For example, I found a great lecture by Gunter Blobel on the signal hypothesis and I think more use of material like this could facilitate even more class discussion.",
                "Strengths: Informative, collaborative, offers many real-world applications that make the information relatable in multiple contexts, the opportunity to work through problems with other students makes the class a lot more manageable \r\nWeaknesses: Despite what the description says, this course definitely has prerequisites. Anybody who has not taken a basic chemistry, biology, or physics course prior to this class will struggle, because the foundational concepts in these areas that you would expect to touch on in an Intro. course so you can then understand the actual material are not explained. I would not characterize this as a course for somebody who has had 0 exposure to any of those three categories. This class is also really fast-paced, which makes sense for a summer course, but I think the volume of work could be managed a bit better. I think it would have been almost impossible to take a second course alongside this one because of the volume of work for this course alone, so I think it might be valuable to restructure some of the lessons so we could apply some of our other outside class time to alternative things, such as a second class or outside work.",
                "The 102 portion of the class is very very dense and fast paced, it's definitely a big transition from 101 to 102. The 101 portion is very well organized and explained, the 102 portion a little less so.",
                "It was so great that all of the homework was collaborative and the exams were open book! I think a weakness of the course was the material distribution in a short period of time. However, the class was very engaging and the professors really encouraged discussions and collaboration.",
                "The strengths is definitely the small class sized, there were only about 25 students in this course and that made all of us really engaged and close in class. We were able to ask questions freely and all inquiries were answered by the professor due to the small class size. Unfortunately, this course had to run online due to the pandemic so we cannot do any experiments and hands on learning. However, there were still many fun activities such as group discussions that made student engage in the class."

                "Yes, this is a good introductory course to biology.",
                "Yes. It's a great class, we did lots of fun activities and breakout room discussions together. \r\nProfessor Collins is a great professor. As a rising senior in high school, he taught me some important lessons and prepared me for college.",
                "Depends on the student. Given how fast paced it is, I would not recommend the summer version of this course to anyone who hasn't studied biology before. I think it's a great class for those who are scientifically inclined and are looking for a crash course and/or refresher on some key topics in biology. Those looking for a comprehensive, thorough introduction to biology might want to consider the fall/spring version of the sequence, but the small class size makes the summer class engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course. For requirements of course, but also if there is an interest in basic biology this course is insightful and intriguing.",
                "If you have to take the bio sequence, I think this is a good way to do it. I think the information you learn would also probably be useful for people planning on working in labs.",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course over the summer unless you really have to. You would definitely be able to understand/learn the material much better over the course of the semester compared to 5 weeks.",
                "I would recommend it to students who are pre-med or considering that path because there were many aspects that I liked and did not like about the class. It gave me some clarity regarding if I really want to study biology or not, or even regarding what type of biology I'd like to engage with.",
                "Yes, I would. The course can be difficult, but if you keep working hard you will see success. The professors dedicate a lot to helping their students succeed. The two halves of the course are very different, but both are super interesting and enthralling. I loved the scientific papers as well. Overall, this was a great prerequisite course.",
                "I would not recommend this course in the summer because there was no peer tutor or teaching assistant to help you with the course and especially for 102, I felt like I really needed one.",
                "Yes, I would. The course was excellent for summarizing and understanding how Biochem, Biophysics, and Cell biology came to this point and where they are going. Importantly it introduces students who are thinking of a science career to real science. It is difficult for high schools to present a real science course.\r\nPlease note that I am a high schooler and so, this advice is for a fellow high schooler.",
                "For anybody who needs foundational Biology for their major, yes. For anybody who needs a science credit, has had exposure to chem, bio, or physics before and is okay with the credit offering a bit of challenge, yes. For anybody looking for a science credit who has had little or no exposure to any of those three categories and would struggle with a challenging course (such as non-STEM majors looking for a science credit), probably not. It isn't as basic as the description leads you to believe.",
                "Yes, basic biology is good to know and the class is well taught.",
                "I would recommend taking 105 over 101 or 102 simply because it's so nice to finish each \"course\" in about 2 weeks. However, it was very manageable for me since I had taken biology before. If you have limited biology experience, the course's pacing may be very difficult.",
                "Yes, of course I would recommend this to my fellow high school students who are interested in biology since they not only could gain knowledge in their field of interest but also challenge themselves since the curriculum is way beyond high school level. Plus, they could get used to the learning style at university since it is very different from what it is in high school."
