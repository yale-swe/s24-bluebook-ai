                "Psets are fair and professor is good.",
                "Strengths: Many examples, Professor Baker is a kind person.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PRIORITIES. This was my biggest complaint of the course. Many times, we would be re-learning topics from intro physics. When something newer or harder would arise, we would go through it very quickly, and not very much in depth, leaving this to the homework. For example, we learned all about how to calculate the inertia tensor, but not how to do rigid-body dynamics with it. Much time would be spent evaluating integrals that most people in the class knew how to do. The midterm and final were conceptual multiple-choice, and didn't really feel like an in-depth assessment of knowledge. I can't say I engaged very highly with the material, and my understanding of the upper-level topics is shaky at best. Professor Baker doesn't always answer questions very clearly. I would really liked to have seen more time spent on the Calculus of Variations\/Lagrangian Dynamics, Central Force Motion, Rigid Body Dynamics, and Special Relativity sections.",
                "They say you get out of it what you put into it, so if the problems and exams are quite easy, then you don't have to put a lot into it and so not much is gained. I think that was the main issue with this course. Even simply keeping the same number of problems on problem sets but picking more difficult ones from the textbook could improve this course. Even though it's a second course in classical mechanics, it felt more like a somewhat advanced first course.",
                "Strengths: Material is comprehensively treated. Baker is a kind and well-motivated professor with a distinct old-school vibe. TAs and guest lecturers were good as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exam formats were somewhat unconventional - while I understand the intent of emulating the GRE, I would suggest that Prof. Baker look to non-multiple choice formats in the future.",
                "Professor Baker is extremely nice and understanding. The assessments were meant to check your conceptual understanding of the physics and not too difficult and the problem sets were more calculation based. The material covered is extremely interesting if you like physics and you can immediately see how useful the Lagrangian is for physics Professor Baker also went through problems from the textbook during lecture which I found great for developing an understanding.",
                "The whole entire course should be on the Lagrangian. The first week should be a rigorous mathematical look at the calculus of variations. The second week should be an introduction to the Lagrangian. The third week should be Noether's theorem. The rest of the course should be a deep dive into chapters 10-14. Non-inertial frames, Angular momentum, coupled oscillators and relativity are all great subjects that are almost completely new at the 400 level. Chapters 1-6 and chapter 8 are merely recaps of physics 260 (Girvin was a great professor). I understand that not everyone at the 400 level took 260 so maybe this means the class needs to be split into two. Even if this ideal cannot be achieved, covering less chapters in more depth is the way to go. The way the course is currently set up, each new topic felt like a review of high school and first year college physics.",
                "The course tried to cover a lot of material in a relatively short amount of time. It might honestly be good to break it up a little (like maybe put special relativity in a separate class). But the things we did learn made physics life so much easier. I would like to see more support for the class (in terms of study halls and ULAs), however, because it felt like there was a huge dropoff between this and the introductory physics courses in those areas. I didn't really know whom to ask when I had trouble, and it was hard not to already know everyone from a previous physics course. (i.e. PHYS 200 students can DEFINITELY succeed in this class, but they need to work harder to find friends\/work buddies because it felt like everyone was a PHYS 260-er who knew everything already.)",
                "Professor Baker would occasionally delete all his whiteboard work which was funny, perhaps a 10 minute technology lesson from his daughter would suffice",
                "This course was very well taught and the only weakness would probably be not being the most organized at times. Not many things I think that could be improved.",

The trade-off with asynchronous lectures is that it is good in this subject to be able to ask questions, but hopefully adding office hours more regularly would help with that. The whiteboard\/annotation features on Zoom caused much tsuris, making the lectures too fast or too slow depending on whether the professor showed us lecture notes or wrote them all out by hand. Also, the wifi was a bit patchy, and pre-recorded lectures would probably help with that.",
