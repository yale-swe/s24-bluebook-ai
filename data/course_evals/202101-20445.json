The few times that we did have pre recorded lectures and then discussions during our class time, I felt much more engaged with the content and left with a better understanding of the author's perspective, interpretations of the work, and real world implications.",

By the end of the semester, it's just impossible to maintain that level of time for readings that will be summarized in the lecture anyway. It would be a lot easier to do less reading more deeply in order to figure out what we should actually focus on in the class.\r\n\r\nThe final exam was incredibly hard to study for and is curved on an unpredictable scale.",
