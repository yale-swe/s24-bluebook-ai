They have two very different teaching methods, Prof. Zuckerman told long-winded but engaging stories about the development of the field of Set Theory while Prof. Liu followed the book fairly consistently. I would highly recommend getting \/ printing the textbook to read along and take notes in during class. Although we did not cover all of the syllabus, we managed to cover everything from the 6 basic axioms to properties of ordinal numbers (Chapter 6). You can learn all of the necessary vocabulary to understand the Axiom of Choice, which I found rewarding. Take it if you have to, but even as an elective math course there is something interesting and non-trivial to be found within the world of sets. Exams were not easy but we were given ample time and open-notes. Finally, I would urge you to read up on the research of both Prof. Zuckerman and Prof. Liu, as they have done some pretty amazing work in their respective fields with symbolic languages.",
