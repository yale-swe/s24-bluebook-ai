I spent one semester building analysis of our simulations, and another semester synthesizing this info, polishing my charts, and tying together everything. I loved every moment. It really depends on who your advisor is but finding one that you jive with well is insanely enriching. I learned how much care, detail and iteration goes into the climate simulations we make, and how much DEBATE sits at every point. It gives me a lot of hope and confidence in the effort of science! At the end of the yearlong thesis our team also made a paper that we hope can be eventually put into a manuscript for review/publication and that's a really satisfying feeling."

                "Yes! I highly recommend the yearlong thesis! you learn so much more and create so much more product than you could in one semester. One semester is only enough time for spin-up and a really minor summary, like a final essay for any other of your STEM courses. But with a year or more of concentrated study, you grow more as a scientist. You'll really create a deep investigation, and learn how much debate and care goes into constructing solid hypotheses and evidences. You also get to invest far more deeply in a lab, which is really really fun!"
