    "Lots of new grammar patterns, how to sound more natural in various situations using different politeness registers and things like sentence particles and extended predicates. Of course new kanji, new vocabulary, as well as the pitch-accent patterns for a small set of words."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that the course was very well paced, had a great instructor, had a well-balanced workload that was fairly constant throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that there could be more opportunities to practice speaking. While the almost-daily dialogues that students practiced at the beginning of class was helpful, there could possibly be more pressure on those to force students to really practice and almost memorize the dialogues.",
    "It is well organized and engaged.",
    "The strength was that through the workload of this course, I could tangibly see my Japanese skills improving. However, the workload bordered on being unmanageable during many points in the semester.",
    "More student engagement with speaking during classes would be better",
    "This course was excellent and my only regret is not being able to devote more time to it. I feel that it offered all that I could reasonably expect from a language course. I would love to have some kind of weekly 1-on-1 session to just practice speaking in order to master any old grammar that is lacking, but I suspect that is too much to ask from an already busy department, and something I should arrange myself outside of class."

    "If you love Japanese and want to learn more, take this class! Yales Japanese department is excellent in general.",
    "Yes, it is a fantastic course for the level of Japanese that it advertises.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if the goal is to improve Japanese skills, this course is a must! However, there is a lot of homework, quizzes, and assignments to get to that point.",
    "Yes, I have become a big fan of the Japanese department here and if you are deciding between Japanese and another language, I recommend Japanese. It is a fair amount of work, so you should have a sincere interest in learning the language, at least for the second-year courses."
