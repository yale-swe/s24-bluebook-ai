                "Through the final project, I got to experience a sped up version of the process of choosing a research question, finding data, doing analysis, making a presentation, and submitting a paper. Besides that, the main thing I took away was how to adjust theoretical economic models to different scenarios. I would say though that I didn't learn much about environmental economics.",
                "It was really cool seeing concepts in our foundations courses be applied to topics about environmental concerns and international relations. The group paper was a huge learning experience, and I really grew a lot from being able to do a mini-thesis kind of assignment with a group and be well supported by Professor Kortum and Jillian (TA). I've done econ research over the summer, but I learned more from this paper assignment than from my research experience. Doing it in a group was also great and not lonely at all.",

                "I feel like the most skills I gained from this course were how to write an econometric based research paper. The final paper was a good exercise in research and would honestly be a good thing to have under someones belt before a thesis. Other than that the course felt pretty model heavy which to me felt less easy to follow in application for the real world."

An aspect of the course that I liked and could use more of is whiteboard work. However, sometimes the work on the whiteboard could get a bit into the weeds with math and hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The TA was extremely helpful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The work assignments assigned very challenging problems without any real direct connection with discussions had in lecture. Not a lot of connection between lecture and the expected homework",
                "Strengths: Amazing teaching fellow (Jillian); interesting subject\r\nWeakness: class time could be a little dull",
                "The course was well-organized and enabled us to have ample time to complete our final paper by dividing it into multiple assignments/steps throughout the semester.",
                "Jillian was amazing! Literally the best TF of all my economics classes. She puts in the work and wants you to succeed.",
                "Independent project and generally good lecturer were a big plus. Really interesting readings. A weakness would be that Kortum could sometimes lose track of his own work on the board.",
                "Strength: the final project. Our TA was amazing and so we got some really good guidance on how to adjust our project as we went along. I would have loved to have taken a course with a final project like this before starting my thesis, as preparation. The p sets are graded super easily and are good practice in drawing up and interpreting models a little. The class is very workload besides the final project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not engaging at all in my opinion. It was very dry material and the focus was on the details of the models we were looking at, and the notation and technicalities, rather than the big ideas. I didn't feel like we focused on the important concepts at all, or on almost any contemporary or real-world debates or problems. The closest thing was when we were learned about how a carbon tax works. Readings were also technical economic papers that did not focus on what the big environmental real world problems that I went into this class wanting to learn. The class was also basically designed in a way that made most lectures and readings completely detached from anything you would actually be graded on, so there was no incentive to push through because they were largely not interesting and not very important. So engagement was low for me.\r\n\r\nAnother weird thing about the class was the grading scheme. Most people got 100's on every assignment leading up to the final project, and then the final projects were graded on a curve that could leave people who got 100's on everything else with an A-, for example. Which I just think is an unfair and non-sensical way to grade a course. There could have been more differentiation earlier on if you are going to grade on a curve, so that you don't end up virtually curving people down.",
                "Strengths: paper assignment built into the schedule for the semester with checkpoints and milestones throughout. Extremely well supported by an amazing TA. Professor Kortum teaches at a good pace and really explains everything out clearly and is patient with questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course deadlines were still being experimented with as this was the first semester with built in paper milestones, but overall the teachers were flexible and understanding. I'm sure that the schedule for deadlines would be better next time as there is more feedback to work with now.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, Prof Kortum is very supportive and accessible, and you get to research topics that you care about. Weaknesses: It was sometimes hard to figure out what the problem sets were looking for, and for this reason, they could feel inaccessible without attending office hours.",
                "I have a big problem the way this class was graded. Throughout the entire semester everyone I talked to in the course had all 100s on every assignment. This included the final paper check points and the problem sets. Then we learned the class was going to be curved (so only a certain percentage of students could get an A) which meant basically the final grades relied on the final paper grade and the last problem sets thats grades were never released. Having this type of grading and then adding a curve is ridiculous and unfair. Either grade without giving 100s across the board at the beginning or dont give a curve like that. This also made it quite impossible to have any sense of how you were doing throughout the semester, or to have much power over your grade in the end. This was one of the more ridiculously graded classes Ive seen.  I also  think the class should focus more on the bigger picture. I felt like most of the time was covering models from papers and graphical representations of different carbon taxes but that felt not as engaging when there was not as much to feel like we were going beyond theory. I felt like I mostly came out from the classes with micro economic theory. \r\n\r\nThe strength of this course was the final project. I thought the checkpoints were helpful to keep my team on track and we really learned all the steps involved in approaching a question and answering it through data and econometrics. Like I said above it would be a good exercise for someone before they write a thesis."

                "Let me preface my review by saying this: your experience in this course will be entirely dictated by your final research project. In fact, there actually arent that many other assignments, like we had 4 PSETS in total which I found very challenging, but certainly not impossible. What Ill say is this: I was in a very highly motivated group, and we chose a very difficult and ambitious research project for our final paperI have never worked harder for a Yale class than I did in ECON 412, we poured everything into our paperwe actually created something that were super proud of, but it took a ton of work and head bashing to get there. Most likely wont be your experience, but I would recommend really thinking through your final project before you commit to the course, and do something that you are proud of.",
                "I would recommend it for someone interested in environmental economics and would be interested in writing their own paper using econometric tools to answer a part of environmental economics that they are interested in or find very important. The class shouldnt be taken as a gut senior econ seminar because it requires some effort with the psets, which can sometimes be a bit tricky, and the final paper but can be interesting for people who have interests in the topics covered in class. The class also has no exams so everything relies on psets and paper assignments (as well as attendance/participation).",
                "Yes. Probably the best environmental economics course at the undergrad level.",
                "I would only recommend this to someone who is taking it as a junior who wants to do a thesis, because of the final project. Also if you want a senior seminar in economics that is not very hard to get an A in.",
                "I would recommend this class! The material is very interesting, and it was a good way to practice the research process. I would warn that the class has a high but not particularly challenging workload. Each week, there was either a problem set due, or research progress, on top of the readings for class.",
                "Not with the current grading scheme. If that gets overhauled, I would recommend it to someone who really really likes models and someone who wants to learn more about a research paper."
