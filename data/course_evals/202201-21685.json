                "Strengths: Professor Reiche is great. The lectures are well done, and I rarely felt lost.\r\nWeaknesses: None come to mind. I'm not certain that we covered everything on the syllabus (because Prof. Reiche always spent time answering questions, so we slowed her down), but I think that's fine as long as we're prepared for future econ classes (and we have the textbook for our own reference).",
                "The professor was good and the powerpoint slides were very useful for learning. I wish that the textbook had been incorporated more into this course, as I gained a lot whenever I read it, but not other students read the textbook and there was too much other work to consistently read the textbook pages. I also wish that there was more conceptual background, as opposed to pure math.",
                "It was a pretty good introduction to Econ but it may have been way too fast paced for people starting from scratch. I also expected way more theory than there was - it was much mathier than I thought it would be.",
                "It was nice how the lectures of this course were posted and how students were able to speak to the professor directly during class. However, despite being a seminar class, the level of personal learning experience was a lot lower than I had hoped, and often felt like there was not enough help to meet student need. I know this is often an issue with lectures, but surprisingly, I also found it to be an issue with this class.",
                "Strengths: The seminar was well-taught. I was able to freely ask questions during lectures and engage deeply with the material in office hours. The size of the class was just right, with not too many students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!"
