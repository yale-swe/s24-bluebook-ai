                "A strength was building community within the class room. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- differences in expectations between classes within the same level. Should be more unified and cohesive among professors \r\n- confusion about expectations \r\n- disorganized at times regarding assignments and quizzes \r\n- because each section was different, I didn't always know all of the information for quizzes and exams",
                "Strengths: class is fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Everything else. Too many strenuous assignments because the professor will give absolutely no direction or if he does, its very unclear. We get very little time to practice new skills in class. Everything from a logistical and organizational standpoint is an absolute nightmare. I probably will not continue taking ASL because of this class.",
                "Strengths: This class made me so happy every day. Truly so much fun and such a great class to start your day in a happy mood or break up the monotony of regular class. Using your body to express yourself is so useful and engages a different part of your brain than most courses. Also, there is literally no stress, only learning and games.\r\nWeaknesses: A little bit disorganized, but this was Prof Zen's first time teaching at Yale so will probably improve over time!",
                "Strengths: Very immersive; a small setting where you had time every day to interact and communicate with peers and professor which facilitated quick learning of sign language.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes, especially since learning sign language is based on visual memorization, it's hard to be able to recall those signs since we can't take notes and there aren't any pictures of signs from lecture slides."

                "Yes!! This class was the highlight of my day most days. Just chilling with friends, playing games, and talking about our days. Not only is it incredibly easy and fun, it exposes you to the world of Deaf culture and Deaf people, teaching you invaluable perspective on this amazing community and how Deafness is not just a disability.",
                "Yes! I think my instructor made this course so fun and I was able to learn more about deaf culture as well."
