                "I learned a more worldly perspective and about the work UNESCO\/other nations or people are doing to preserve cultural heritage or bring it back to its rightful owners. This class taught me to look at multiple perspectives rather than just my own.",

                "This course was amazing in terms of meeting and showing important content themes in proximity of campus.",
                "I think a clearer structure could help the course, and especially since some of the readings are so long, a clearer connection between the readings and the discussion.",
                "The program of the class, especially the second half, was extremely interesting, because it featured speakers and field trips that enriched our learning. I would like to have had more interaction with and discussion about the law, as it is rare to have an undergraduate course where youre able to become involved with it.",
                "The two main strengths of the course are Saras expertise and her willingness to incorporate Yale spaces into the practical half of the course. As a senior, it was wonderful to explore the Center for British Art, the YUAG, the Peabody and even the storages on West Campus as part of class - it felt like going on a tour of all of Yales incredible art collection, which is hard to accomplish on your own time.",
                "This course was excellent, I cant say it had any weaknesses. The syllabus was well-crafted, the readings and discussions were thought-provoking, and the trips to the art galleries were really fun.",
                "A strength of the class is it did not rely on textbooks but rather discussions and locations we were able to visit. A weakness is the readings we did have could be very technical and sometimes hard to digest.",
                "This was a super interesting fifth course on a previously unfamiliar subject. The biggest strength of the course was visiting the Yale galleries and the student presentations, which really summarized the readings. Initially, the readings were quite long but Sara listened to our feedback. The op-ed final assignment was fun to write and allowed us to research an aspect of the course that we found most interesting."

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in these topics this course is fantastic!",
                "Yes! Its not only a great insight into an area that is difficult to study so specifically in undergrad, but its a great way to explore all Yale has to offer in terms of art and anthropology.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another person because it helped you see the cultural heritage of other places and their fights in preserving it and allowed you to see many perspectives including Yales which was very interesting.",
                "Yes! A great interdisciplinary course that was extremely timely given world events. Very accessible even for those without an art history or law background."
