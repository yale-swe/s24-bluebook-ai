                "I learned more about the works of John Milton. Initially, I was incredibly nervous for the class because of Milton's literary status and reputation as a difficult author. While the reading was by no means easy, this class taught me how to better read and comprehend Milton. Additionally, my writing also greatly improved through the wonderful feedback of Professor Rogers and our TF Andrea. Take this class if you are interested in challenging yourself with one of the English language's most influential writers. It is certainly worth it!",

I was not expecting to like this class nearly as much as I did, and that is purely because of the teaching staff.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses = Having scheduled office hours the same day as class is always something I'm not crazy about. Additionally, the course was a night class (which allows working students to take it) but the scheduled office hours were during the workday. These are minor concerns, however, and I wouldn't let either dissuade you from taking the class obviously.",
                "Dr. Rogers and Dr. Walkden were both great and instrumental in helping us understand the course material. Feedback always came back fast and in-depth. No weaknesses, only wished our biweekly 1 hr discussion sections were longer!",
                "This course is engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA were both amazing. Course load is manageable and readings are all relevant and interesting to class. \r\nWeaknesses: Pre-recorded lectures sometimes felt a bit long and didn't match the wonderful discussions we had in class, but they were informative and went deeply into interesting topics in Paradise Lost.",
                "Professor Rogers and Andrea do a really great job of making this class accessible to everyone, especially if you are not an English major. The strengths were definitely the Professor and Andrea. Each discussion was very engaging and they used break-out rooms well to give everyone a chance to speak. This is a good class to take for STEM people who are looking for a good writing credit. As for improvements, I can't think of any.",
                "This course has excellent instruction and a very manageable workload.  The essay prompts are very clearly laid out.  The course could be improved by having more frequent office hours.",
                "The format of the class was very effective. The pre-recorded lectures provided a really nice introduction and overview of the reading, which was augmented by our class discussion and discussion posts on Canvas. The biggest strengths of the course were definitely Professor Rogers and our TF Andrea. They are both so incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the subject material and made themselves available to help us in any way possible. The reading for this class was tough, but they really helped us move towards understanding and appreciating Milton's works. The class only met for two hours each week, which personally was not a problem for me, but I could see how some might want more time--although Professor Rogers and Andrea are always available to talk more during office hours!",
                "Strengths- Dedicated passionate team of professor and TA.\r\nWeakness- Id have liked more essay help.",

                "Yes! The teaching is fantastic and the material is genuinely interesting. I would specifically recommend this course to those with Christian backgrounds and backgrounds in the classics as I think it is easier to pick up on a lot of the references this way.",
                "Ye I would absolutely recommend this course! Milton's material is really interesting with Dr. Roger's insight, never for a moment was I bored during lecture. The class also isn't too big of a time commitment and a great way to earn a WR credit.",
                "Yes, it is a great and informative writing credit.",
                "Yes! This is a wonderful summer course with a great professor who makes studying Milton more fun than you'd think!",
                "Yes! Even though writing courses can be stressful, this course is truly designed for you to learn. The Professor and Andrea design it so that you can get abundant feedback before you turn in your drafts and you have the option to revise your first essay (which is awesome!)! I definitly recommend this course especially if you need writing credit. I also would say this course is good for people who maybe struggle with a seminar format. I know I am more introverted but this course really helped me grow so that I could speak more in discussions, and the Professor and Andrea were also integral in this course. I recommend it whether you need a writing credit or not.",
                "Yes.  You will read some great poetry and learn a lot.",
                "Yes, without a doubt, I would recommend this course to another student! The course material is challenging, but it is so rewarding. Especially for English majors who are looking to fulfill their Renaissance requirement, this is a great class to take. While Milton is often included on the syllabus of other classes, it was great to really be able to delve deeper into his work and life as a whole. Milton is quite a fascinating character, and his writing is incredible. Professor Rogers and TF Andrea really worked to make Milton as accessible as possible, and I have become a lot more comfortable reading and discussing his work as the term progressed. They really care about your success in the class and you will also receive a lot of great feedback on your writing. Despite it being a summer class, the workload for this class was very reasonable. There was ample time to do the readings, which was really nice since Milton requires a lot of time to process and digest. Andrea and Professor Rogers were also both so incredibly helpful during office hours--along with being the most passionate and understanding instructors. The only weakness of this course is that I wish it could have lasted longer! Please take this class; you won't regret it!!",
                "Yes, very interesting course",
                "if you want to learn about Milton...yes, of course. If not, no. I do think this class could make someone appreciate Milton and other poets more, but if they weren't interested in poetry or Paradise Lost, I would think this is the class for them.",
                "Yes it's a great course and reading Milton is more fun than you'd think. I would give them a heads up that \"option to revise\" means \"requirement to completely rewrite,\" but if you're down to do that it's a really good class.",
                "Absolutely! It is an incredibly interesting and fun course! I was worried that I would be out of my depth as a STEM major, but the class was very manageable and reasonable while still being challenging and fun!"
