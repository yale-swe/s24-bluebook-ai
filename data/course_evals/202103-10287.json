The course introduces you to a variety of concepts, including nutrient cycles, global and regional climate, ecosystem and biome types, and population dynamics, but these subjects are neither reflected clearly in the homeworks nor adequately reviewed for the exam.

I regret to say that I have any recollection of what went on in class, and learned more by doing the problem sets (which were incredibly difficult) and lab reports (also incredibly difficult) and poring over the midterms (on which the averages usually shook about to be around 58%). This class felt like the college equivalent of when you would sit at a dining room table with one of your parents and they'd repeat some math question you couldn't figure out again and again, only to make you cry harder and harder.",

This involved the extensive use of math models for many different ecological processes and using their graphs to tell us a bit more about each of the systems we studied. Stavers topics were more in the realm of large-scale topics (global change, nutrient cycling, etc) where the results of experimentation played a larger role than any models we derived.",

            "comments": [
                "This course suffers from a large number of critical issues that could be easily improved upon if even slightly more time were given to doing so by the instructors. Even at the start of the semester, it was clear how poorly run the class was. We were not given any regular office hour spots until several weeks in the semester, and the office hours that were given were in the middle of Monday-Thursday, meaning that many science majors could not access them as they conflicted with other prerequisite and requisite classes. Further, these office hours were held by the TAs, who are first year graduate students. The professors in fact did not hold office hours the entire semester. Lectures were poorly organized and did not reflect homework assignment material at all. Homework questions were terribly worded, and homework problems were entirely unreflective of class material or exam work. No formal review sessions were held for the first two examinations, and for both the professors only posted 1-3 practice problems the day or two before the exams that were not reflective of test material. This resulted in incredibly low averages for the class in both midterms. Homework and lab grading criteria were also very unclear and rubric consisted of postings that were clearly gathered from a general course rubric (i.e., from the Poorvu center). The final exam time was not communicated until the last week of classes. To be frank, it felt like the professors could care less about this course. I certainly know that the manner in which this course was run negatively portrayed the major (E&EB/EVST).",
                "Weakness: The exams cover a lot of material and the questions are a lot harder and complex compared to brief examples we cover in class. The homeworks require a lot of work for a small percentage of the grade. Feedback on homeworks and exams was very brief and not useful. The keys for the midterms were not released until right before the final exam making it difficult to know what is right and wrong in your answers.",
                "First of all, please, for the love of god, structure this class better. The random (or seemingly random) structure of the lectures (there was a lecture on fishery management that had ZERO bearing and little relation to anything else we were learning at the time) was very confusing and made learning hard. Secondly, there is an IMMENSE dependence on knowing excel for the problem sets and labs, which is stated nowhere on the syllabus or mentioned in the first few weeks of class. I had to teach myself excel, which was a Sisyphean task considering that each lab required some knowledge of some function in excel that the professors didn't mention nor teach us. Lastly, the midterms and the finals seemed to be structured around the lectures, usually one or two slides, of which the professors didn't teach well: our first midterm had a question about Hadley cells, of which Professor Staver said - and I quote - \"I don't really get this myself. Let's move past it\" in class.",
                "The lectures were sometimes interesting... but the weaknesses outweigh the strengths. The problem sets hardly every felt like they were actually related to the lecture material, and the tests felt even further removed. The professors seemed out of reach all semester, and we only had about 4 actual discussion sections. I WISH we actually had section, because maybe we would have had an opportunity to learn the course material in an active, hands-on way, and the TAs actually cared. I know several EEB majors or potential EEB majors who either dropped the major or considered drooping the major because this course was so lacking. It was way too math-heavy, and it often felt like we were just learning math without being given the conceptual knowledge behind it.  When everybody did poorly on the second midterm (the average was less than 60%), the teachers seemed to shrug it off, saying they would curve the course WITHOUT actually changing the way they structured the course. When your performance on problem sets and tests doesn't reflect your proficiency in the course material, there is no incentive to actually pay attention in lecture, and it was poorly attended pretty much the whole semester.",
                "This course was not very well taught - the class is split between two professors that alternate weeks of teaching, and teach material in a seemingly random order (it never really built in a natural way). The PSETs rarely connected to any material we did in class, and did not reflect the information we were tested on in exams. The TAs also did not really seem to know how to help, and weren't really able to answer questions about the information we learned in lecture or the homeworks (but I think this is poor communication on the professors' end, not the fault of the TAs!). Professors Vasseur and Staver were also pretty unapproachable, and it felt difficult to go to them with questions (they rarely held office hours, and kind of brushed off questions asked in class). Because midterms went so poorly, the professors decided to give us practice problems for the final, but we didn't have any other preparatory materials for the midterms. The class is strong because the professors clearly care about what they teach - many of the assignments and lectures were based on the research of the professors, which was interesting and cool! However, General Ecology also has plenty of weaknesses in its structure, assignments, exams, and teaching staff. It felt like a very hard class to succeed in, even with hours of studying.",
                "More concepts, less models",
                "Strengths: Professors both were very knowledgeable and the content felt like a solid, broad introduction to ecology.\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures were unclear, exams include lecture content emphasized entirely differently than when it was taught, so a topic that was barely discussed could make up half of the exam, and a very emphasized topic may not appear at all. Exam and PSet question were almost always written in a confusing way where students got points off simply because they didn't know what was being asked of them. Also grading was unreasonably strict and points were taken off for small mistakes or partially correct responses much much more so than I've seen in other courses. The labs were also unnecessarily long and with the second lab specifically, I was very frustrated that we were given and insanely large data set without having every focused on how to work with large datasets or broad statistical analysis in class.",
                "Problem sets were not at all representative of exam questions and didn't seem to have a real purpose. I wish more comments were made during midterm grading.",
                "The subject matter was definitely the strongest aspect of this course. For all of those interested in pursuing anything to do with ecology or environmental studies, the ideas we covered in this class were central to many of these disciplines more specific subfields. Yet, since ecology is such a broad field, it does feel like we jumped around and circled back to many different topics while leaving many others out. This left the responsibility of putting all of the pieces together on the students, which could be strength or a weakness depending on your perspective. The instructions on psets tended to be very vague and there were multiple times where I, along with many classmates, could not seem to clarify exactly what was being asked of us.",
                "This course is extremely flawed, causing myself and other students an excessive amount of stress and anxiety. The weaknesses of the course lie in a lack of support for the students, a lack of resources offered to students, and a lack of clear expectations given. Especially difficult was the fact that only half of the classes were recorded as students were required to stay home during any illness due to the covid-19 pandemic. This class covered a lot of material quickly and did not offer students review sessions for any of the exams. Practice problems were not given and the homeworks were often unrelated to the topics covered in class. Additionally, no exam exam keys were given to aide students' understandings and section was cancelled about half the time. The average for both midterms were in the 50s and 60s and not for a lack of student effort. A single or two topics were covered on the exams in a depth not explored the slightest bit in class. For each exam, we studied at least 20 topics and the exams did not reflect this at all. \r\nI suggest this course be reworked with regards to the amount of support offered to students, the homeworks given, the exam structure, and the compassion shown to students during an especially stressful time of a global pandemic.",
                "I thought the lectures were really engaging and informative. Our textbook was also super accessible and interesting. I enjoyed the supplemental readings and the interactive discussions/debates on Friday classes. In terms of weaknesses, I would have appreciated clearer feedback on the tests, and more review sessions and practice problems available before the tests. Generally, the structure of the class was a little confusing and I felt like the professors and TAs were somewhat inaccessible. I think regularly meeting for section and having set office hours would have made this class better.",
                "The course was too confusing and difficult. Lectures would briefly skim over big topics that exams would assess on a much deeper level.",
                "While this course was interesting it could have been taught better. The grading was unnecessarily harsh and the midterm exams had extremely low averages.",
                "The professors were very good at lecturing. However, I felt like the labs were not super relevant to the course material.",
                "I found that many of the problem sets had little connection to the class material and were graded in a seemingly arbitrary fashion-- grading expectations were not made clear in the setup of problems.  I also think that the late submission policy is overly harsh-- I think that either the penalty should be reduced from 20% or the option should be given to get extensions through means other than a Deans' excuse. I think this course could also be improved by providing a greater number of relevant practice problems ahead of tests.",
                "Strengths: Outside of the TAs carrying the empathy and support for this class on their shoulders...none. Worst class I've ever taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Exams that are designed for you to fail with because of an overload of information. TAs couldn't always help because they weren't made aware of what would be on the exams\r\n- Sections that have nothing to do with the class material. We couldn't even use them for concept reviews or practice like other science classes do. They were always canceled, which in the moment is nice, but when you fail an exam, gets you wondering why they weren't used to make sure the class wasn't collectively failing.\r\n- Near-impossible grading with little opportunity to get meaningful feedback for improvement (the class was so fast paced focusing on the exams would mean neglecting current material)\r\n- Tested on MINUTIA from lecture slides (usually a question about an obscure theory mentioned in the slides or you can only get the answer right if you remember a specific exception to a theory that the professor offhandedly mentions in class)\r\n- the content itself is all theoretical with equation after equation thrown at you and we spent very little time talking about the practical applications of ecology for conservation or why it's even important to learn\r\n- 1st midterm: NO practice problems posted. 2nd midterm: questions posted but professors telling us a KEY would not be made available to us- even though they were study materials. Why do you not want your students to know the right answers on their study materials?\r\n- Professors completely disconnected from current events: Although we're college students living in a high-risk environment for COVID, often our professors refused to post their class recordings because they didn't like the idea that students didn't always show up to their sessions of the class",
                "Tests are hard and difficult to study for.",
                "The co-taught nature of the course allows for each professor to provide in-depth information about topics relevant to their research and interests, which I appreciated, but the course seemed to be not very well organized. We seemed to jump around a lot, which may have been due to how the professors scheduled their chunks of teaching, which ended up working out for their schedules, but may have led to more confusion among us. Questions on assignments and exams were often seemed either poorly written or purposefully convoluted, which was frustrating."

                "Unless you are an E&EB major that is required to take it, I would not recommend this class. It should be titled \"Mathematical Ecology\" in my opinion, and is HEAVILY centered on mathematical models of behavior/population/etc. The material is not exceptionally hard, but it is so poorly taught and organized that every exam and assignment was a struggle. I am walking away from this class feeling like I learned something, but in an unnecessarily difficult way. General Ecology feels like driving through a small town with construction, traffic jams, and stoplights every 50 feet, instead of taking the interstate. I got to the same place at the end of the class, but I feel like I struggled for nothing. The professors could make this class so much better, but it just feels like they dropped the ball.",
                "Maybe - I'm an e&eb major, so given that I had to take this course feel free to take my review with a grain of salt. Most of the concepts that we covered are genuinely really interesting if you're interested in how the living world operates, and the course covered a fair number of topics that have been relevant to past ecological research I've done. A downside (for someone like me more interested in concepts) is that this course is very model heavy and involves a lot of math, although you only really need to understand some basic calculus to grasp the ideas. I think the biggest issue is the tests - the professors admitted on the first day that they always make them too hard, but didn't take real steps this year to change that; an average for a midterm should not be ~50%, and how/when the class is going to be curved is still a mystery for the students. A final word of advice - the lab reports are deceptively more work than their 10% grade weight makes them look, and grading was often harsher than expected. That being said, the questions I developed were actually interesting to me, and I'm proud of the results I produced. \r\nFrom an upperclassman in the major, this is not the class to take if you want a science gut!",
                "No. The only reason I would take it was if I had to and there were no alternative courses to fulfill a major requirement (so only EEB majors).",

                "I would say strongly consider it if you are interested in ecology or environmental studies in general. If youve had some experience in statistics and/or scientific writing I would say that this is a must-take. The open-ended lab assignments we are given were very valuable for using the tests and techniques Ive been introduced to in a general context in the subject area I aim to pursue. Just be warned that the class demands a lot of time to thoroughly understand all of the content we cover and exams dont shy away from demanding nothing short of this level of understanding.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student as it was a constant source of stress and frustration. I took this class purely for interest and would suggest students only take it if absolutely necessary for their degree requirements. The grading for this class was extremely harsh with students regularly getting less than a 60 on homeworks despite high effort. The exam averages were between 50 and 60 for both midterms and, in response, the professors did not change any aspect of the course despite student requests for review sessions and practice resources. Additionally, students were told they were \"going to be very depressed\" along with a chuckle when receiving their exams back. The course content is interesting, but the teaching and course structure completely overshadowed this and left students feeling defeated. This course is very much not worth it.",
                "No. If it is required, of course you should take it. However, if this course is not altered, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it. It failed to teach students well or explore the beauty of ecology, and was a complete disappointment.",
                "If you are interested in ecology I would definitely recommend this class. The subject area is so interesting and we covered a wide range of topics. Generally, I thought it was a well structured introduction to the field and I learned a ton. But, it is not a gut! Even though the content is not super challenging, the structure is a little confusing and the professors aren't super accessible. It's not super easy to navigate and if you don't already have an interest in the subject, you might just end up frustrated and unfulfilled.",

                "Where do I begin with the worst class I have ever taken at Yale? \r\n\r\nThe poorly organized lecturing? The professors giving you different or wrong answers when you ask them questions on the same exact questions and topics? The fact that they refused to hold review sessions or post answer keys to our study materials until they realized we were failing the exams? My other difficult science classes had final review outlines that were 15-17 pages long. The condensed version our study group created (excluding ALL equations) was 45 PAGES LONG. You could study for a week straight (most of us) and still come out of the exams distraught. Our first exam averaged a 60 with the curve. Our second averaged just above a 50. When your students are showing that they arent understanding the material and zero action is taken, it's not us who were the problem. The only good thing about this class was the support from the TAs (and they werent even made aware of what would be on the exams!). \r\n\r\nFaculty of multiple science departments have warned students against taking this class and openly criticized it to students faces. I should have listened. As a science major and senior, this class made me want to abandon science entirely because I felt that the professors were not encouraging our success.\r\n\r\nThe lack of support in this class was something I've never before experienced in a course at Yale. Our study group and most members of the class often discussed that it felt like the professors did not spend even a moment remembering what it was like to be a student while designing and implementing the course throughout the semester. I would rather take the bio sequence, Physics, and the ENTIRE Chem sequence all over again. Save yourself the extra therapy sessions and feeling like you will never be successful. I wish I never took this class. Go take a class where the professors truly want you to learn and succeed, not where they want to boost their egos by making you fail.",
