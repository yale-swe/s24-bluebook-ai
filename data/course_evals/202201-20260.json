                "Strengths: You get to pick a topic you're passionate about, then read and write about it for an entire semester. It's kind of magical. The support from the English department is fantastic. As a person that likes to work at their own pace, I also liked that the classes\/discussion sections are optional. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The strengths were all of the deadlines to keep us on track and the supportive faculty! I felt supported by the graduate student and faculty member over the program as well as my own advisor.",
                "Great support and feedback from our instructors! I loved checking in (and commiserating) with other students during group meetings. I do wish we had received more guidance on how to begin the project during winter break.",
                "The strengths are that you get to write an English paper and conduct independent research on a topic of your choosing. I also loved getting to meet one-on-one with my adviser and discuss an area of their expertise with them. Although it was nice that the weekly meetings and workshops were optional for the most part, it would have been great if they were compulsory so we could have built more of a community among other thesis writers. Professor Glaser and Chris were also huge strengths as they were so generous with their time and gave excellent feedback on our drafts.",
                "I thought this was a wonderfully structured approach to writing a Senior Essay--I greatly appreciated the scattered deadlines that incentivized me to write consistently and not save everything to the last minute (as I have often done). I enjoyed the weekly meetings with fellow essayists as a way to discuss ideas and keep up to pace with the group. Overall the structure of the writing process made for a much more pleasant experience!"

                "If you have a work in mind that you are passionate about, I would absolutely recommend this course as a capstone to your time in the English major. It's demanding especially as the later deadlines approach, but it is also extremely fulfilling.",
                "If youd like to pursue a topic outside of the senior seminars being taught one semester, Id highly recommend this course. My writing improved tremendously, and I enjoyed getting to know many other people in the major.",
                "Yes; writing a senior essay is hard, but its worth it!",
                "Absolutely, if you are prepared to undertake a large-scale independent essay project.",
                "Yes, definitely take this course! It's such a great way to end one's Yale English career and to study something you are truly passionate about. I also grew so much as a writer and thinker so I'd highly recommend writing the Senior Essay outside of a seminar even if you're not sure what exactly you want to write about. The process itself and the weekly group meetings make it worth it!",
                "Yes! The senior thesis is an extremely rewarding experience, especially if you choose a topic you are passionate about, find an advisor who is willing to spend time to work with you, and start early.",
                "The workload of a Senior essay is of course demanding, but if you're up for the challenge it was a great experience in pursuing my own passions and getting to hone my academic writing skills!"
