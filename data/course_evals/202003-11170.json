I am now able to hold conversations with native speakers about what my study habits are, what I want to do over break, what I'm doing that day, or even what my parents do for work. The course covered 10 lessons, and I felt each one had plenty of valuable vocabulary or grammar to add. On many occasions the native speakers with whom I practiced outside of class commented on how quickly I was learning, which I feel was a testament to the quality of the instruction.",

                "The strengths of the course include the wonderful professors for every section (seriously - every other student in CHNS 110 that I talked to loved their professor just as much as I loved Shen Laoshi), rapid pace of improvement in the language, a wonderful camaraderie among classmates, and the interesting topics covered in class. \r\nThe greatest weakness was the massive workload - it was by far the most work of any of my classes. Each day's work included workbook pages, listening exercises, preparations for the next day's lessons, and a short (3 question) pre-class quiz. However, it was also by far my favorite class. To see how quickly I was learning the language was fulfilling, and having class with Shen Laoshi was a privilege. \r\nI think a stronger emphasis early on in the semester on practicing handwriting characters would have been nice. They weren't mentioned as very important for outside work until halfway through the semester, at which time it was difficult to catch up from previous lessons and learn the new daily characters as well.",
                "Strengths: Very organized, good at making students learn the material, handled the online format pretty well, great instructors (Shen Laoshi!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many at all!",
                "The course does a wonderful job developing students' ability to speak and interpret Chinese. The homework is very comprehensive, and the exercises we did in class helped to strengthen our understanding of the assigned grammar structures and vocabulary. The only weakness of this class was the sheer amount of work one has to do in order to keep up with the material. By the end of every chapter, which is only four days, there's a lot of vocabulary, grammar, and characters that students are expected to memorize and know how to use perfectly. I understand why the amount of work needs to be done, but I wish it could have been spread out more to give students more breathing room.",
                "This is an incredible course! Shen Laoshi works very hard to make sure that students understand the material and is always available as a resource for additional questions. The combination of writing, reading, and speaking practice made learning a very smooth process.",
                "The strength of this course is the professor, who always keeps an open learning environment very welcoming to the students. Moreover, it is very well structured. I can personally find no weaknesses in this course.",
                "I thought that as a language learning experience it was great - it was a lot of work and required a lot of time, but that's what's required to learn the language."

                "Overall, virtual learning in this class was quite engaging. It was by far the most engaging virtual class I took, and I felt that the ability of the professor to teach effectively was not impaired much beyond a normal year. We covered the same topics as the usual in-person course, and everyone in the class seemed to pick them up quickly. The live lectures included screenshared powerpoints that covered the lesson's dialogue, new vocabulary, and sentence examples of new grammar. \r\nShen Laoshi's teaching style was very engaging. She would alternate calling each student to read a sentence from the screen, make up a sentence using a new grammatical instruction, or answer a question about a dialogue or listening exercise. Overall, she very effectively made up for the difficulties of virtual learning.",
                "I thought the smaller class size was helpful since people would speak over zoom often at the same time. I also appreciated having weekly tutorial to get one-on-one help",
                "It was a little hard to fully engage with the coursework through Zoom, especially since a lot of the class time involved group\/partner exercises. Professor Shen also had several technical difficulties throughout the semester, from suddenly losing wifi connection to struggling to place students into breakout rooms. However, for the most part, Professor Shen made Chinese adaptable to Zoom, and I was still able to learn a lot from class.",
                "Breakout rooms were not a perfect substitute for small-group speaking activities, but they were helpful. The way the lectures were conducted was very well adapted.",
                "I believe that when it comes to the oral exercises, it worked better when we did them in the main room, because when we did them in the breakout rooms, we didn't know if we were making any mistakes.",

                "I absolutely recommend this course, ESPECIALLY with Shen Laoshi. Even though my section met at 9:25 am every day of the week, I looked forward to it more than any other class. The workload would have completely turned me off of the course if it weren't for the wonderful energy of my classmates and professor every lecture. Shen Laoshi's stories & jokes about China, her family, past students, and my classmates kept all of us engaged, and you could tell every day that she loves her job. I have rarely had a teacher as engaged, supportive, and constructively critical as her. Even when we were visibly struggling, she would kindly correct us, have us do more practice as a class, and then move on. \r\nOften she would spend 2\/5 of an entire class on the pronunciation practice slide for a lesson, teaching us useful phrases and tips outside the textbook. She didn't care if we only made it through half the day's lesson plan, instead focusing on helping us go through examples and practice as a class. \r\n\r\nYale's reputation for language education was dead-on, and Chinese, in my opinion, is one of its strongest departments. You can't go wrong with any professor, but I will always be thankful I ended up with Shen Laoshi.",
                "If you are trying to fulfill a language requirement, then yes definitely! I'm going to come in here with a hot take and say it's less work than people make it our to be in these reviews. For me, it was about 1-1.5 hours each day, and the work is straightforward. I was nervous about the workload and learning a new language (not a language person here) but the environment was very welcoming, and I was speaking Chinese before I knew it. It's fun, and you'll like it! That said, it is probably more work than you would be looking for if you just need to add an extra class to your schedule.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. For a L1 language class, this course gives you a great foundation in understanding and speaking Mandarin Chinese. With this semester alone, I feel I can engage in a basic conversation with a native speaker.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This class is a perfect introduction to Mandarin and is incredibly well organized.",
