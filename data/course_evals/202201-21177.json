                "I learned and practiced a breadth of artistic methods, and also learned how to talk about and critique art.",

                "strength is the amount of work assigned and done in class to practice different skills and complete different observational studies. i would improve this course by making the class period a little bit longer and by doing more frequent progress checks for feedback between critiques.",
                "More communication from instructor!",
                "One weakness might be that the due dates for homework were slightly disorganized but overall the class had a lot of good topics and utilized the time well",
                "I really enjoyed the course and the opportunity to practice my drawing skills in the classroom! I particularly appreciated classes devoted to practicing drawing, whether drawing portraits of our classmates or going to Sterling library to render perspective. I learned not only about the craft but also the history of the art-form.\r\n\r\nMy only feedback would be to try and reduce the in-class time spent going over presentations and slides (while I did enjoy the history on linear perspective) to allow more time for drawing and teacher feedback during the drawing process. While I understand the need for structured assignments in the first half of the course, I would have appreciated more liberty\/independence in the assignments towards the end of the semester--I loved the memory drawing, for instance, but did not as much enjoy doing two separate collages. Minor notes though, overall a great class!",
                "It felt a little go with the flow at times, though Im not sure if I would call that a strength or a weakness, given this is an art class and not a standard seminar or lecture course.",
                "I really enjoyed the in-class work, especially around portraiture and figure drawing. However, I feel like we departed too much from the original syllabus  we ended up doing a lot of collage\/found material stuff which wasn't really the reason I signed up for the course\/what I was expecting."

                "I definitely would! anyone can draw or create art without thinking of themselves as a good or bad artist or a creative or non-creative person. there's much to learn about yourself through trying out drawing, which engages the brain in a refreshing way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially with Sophy Naess. It's a lot of fun and I definitely felt like it made art a much more attainable and enjoyable activity for me.",
                "I loved it!",
                "Yes, it is a chill but engaging class and super fun for putting you outside of your art comfort zone and letting you learn new ways of drawing",
                "Sophy Naess is an amazing teacher who is really empathetic and understanding! I would not recommend if you are looking to develop really strong artistic techniques and learn how to draw super super well. I would recommend if you want to explore drawing because it just forces you to increase the amount you draw and be creative",
                "Absolutely. You spend most of your in-class time drawing, either listening to music or talking to your fellow classmates. I met some good friends in the class, and also really enjoyed the meditative time. You definitely have to keep up with the homework, but its not too bad and I found the work to be a great break from my other classes. I really had the opportunity to leave the class with some art I am proud of.",
                "I would! If you, like me, have a passion for drawing--but have had minimal experience studying it within a classroom context--this was a great way to hone my drawing skill. It also allowed me to learn about the history and nature of craft alongside a group of fellow artists!",
                "Yeah, I would recommend this course, though it can be difficult to get a spot in the course unfortunately.",
                "don't take if you don't want to do all the homework",
                "Yes! It's a wonderful chance to improve at drawing, regardless of the level you're starting at. The assignments were always a good part of my week, though you should be prepared to spend a lot of time working on assignments outside of class."
