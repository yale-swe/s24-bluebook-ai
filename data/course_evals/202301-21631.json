                "test materials could be more defined - currently less guidance for the lesson tests",
                "The strengths of this course included the fact that since it is basically seminar style, the professor was able to give personalized attention to each student and helped each student grow in an individualized way. In addition, I felt very supported and engaged throughout the class. The projects we had and the dictation quizzes we had were actually all truly beneficial to learning the Korean language on a deeper level.",
                "Strengths: Get to talk with your peers while practicing Korean and is an overall fun, relatively relaxed class\r\nWeaknesses: Meeting every day can be a bit tough, but every intro language course tends to meet at least 4 days a week so it's not especially unique to Korean",
                "Very high engagement between students and Professor that helps foster a warm learning environment",
                "Strengths: Prof Back was highly organized and knowledgeable in the subject \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the dictation quizzes piled up and towards the end of the semester some of the significant assignments had back-to-back due dates, which sometimes made it stressful.",
                "The structure of the course, with consistent dictation quizzes and check-ins with our TAs every week, was so vital to develop my proficiency in Korea. I really enjoyed how all of the assignments were entertaining from exploring destinations we'd like to visit in South Korea to creating funny Korean drama-like skits that we all watched at the end of the semester.",
                "A really fun class with a lot of support. Really fast paced but there was a abundance of resources.",
                "Strengths - The way the class is set up is really conducive to learning, and just by attending class each day, I learned a lot. The homework really prepares you for the exams as well, so I didn't have to study extremely hard, even though it was definitely not gutty/the learning was still very comprehensive.\r\nWeakness - None! I really enjoyed starting everyday with this course and would recommend to anyone interested in learning Korean!",
                "The class was very engaging and the teacher kept learning fun.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is fun and engaging.",
                "I don't really know if there were any weaknesses, but there were many strengths. The small class size allows for good conversational practice, the daily meetings ensure that you maintain your knowledge and help build a good classroom environment, the projects give good writing and speaking practice, the tests are fair and reasonable, etc. I really enjoyed this class and felt that I got a lot out of it, though you definitely get out as much as you're willing to put in.",
                "Strength: Probably the best class I took at Yale. Very nice, engaging professor and classmates. The group projects were also very fun to do and we were able to watch them in class. Weakness: Not necessarily a gut class, but very close to one."

It is a course that is meant for you to improve your understanding of the language in addition to learning the culture and heritage to immerse you in that aspect of Korea as well.",
                "Yes!! It was a lot of fun and not unreasonably difficult.",
                "Yes I would as a result of the great learning experience and amount of material learned in such a brief period of time.",
                "Yes!!! Take a language! Theres so much that you can gain!",

                "Yes, because it is a great course to take.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The Korean program has been amazing so far and I've really enjoyed the classes I've taken. The class is certainly a lot of work, but learning a new language always is, and at least it's enjoyable work. The class sizes are small, too, so you really build connections with your peers and teacher, which makes the class an even more enjoyable experience. I looked forward to this class every morning, which is saying something because it was a 9:25am.",
                "Highly recommend, especially if you already took Korean 110. If not, then you should probably do Korean 110 before Korean 120 unless you are smurfing."
