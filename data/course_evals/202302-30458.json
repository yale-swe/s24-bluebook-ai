                "The course was taught very well and the slides were very informative. Professor Collins is amazing and I genuinely enjoyed learning some of the information like how hemoglobins change states in order to pick up and drop oxygen, how CO poisoning works because these were genuine health related questions that makes you better understand how our body works. Such information really stick to your head.  Sometimes, however, the details of every section would get a little too gruesome and a little too specific for us to be able to grasp our head around. In the end, having learned ~60-70 slides per class and almost 200 slides by the end of the week, the class slowly started tiring us out mentally and stressing us. I thought the idea of Chimera, PLIP, and all the other softwares were very interesting and eye opening, but also a little stressful. Having a step by step guidance at the beginning of the projects to at least introduce us into how Chimera works and an example of what is being asked/what is a great answer would be great.",
                "The information was very clear and well taught! I think the pacing toward the end of the course became quite hectic for students, and that the workload of projects could be better paced in the middle area of the course to accommodate this.",
                "I really liked this class. Taking it over the summer was a great choice. I feel like I learned a lot of material in a short time without it being stressful."
