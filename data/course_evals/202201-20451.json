Many impactful concepts were discussed relating to viewing the world from different perspectives.

I learned to more clearly explain and communicate challenging concepts in an accessible way using multimodal methods, including videos, websites, and voice recordings.",
                "There was a focus on developing the methodological framework for understanding and evaluating multimedia (and I do mean multimedia -- \"multimodalidad\" is a key pedagogical theme of the course) and the message it's trying to communicate. I was actually really grateful for that: I think I learned a lot of the structural tools necessary to understand multimedia relating to any field of knowledge, as opposed to just globalization. This was definitely one of the more intellectually stimulating classes I've taken so far, and to have that happen in Spanish is quite impressive!"

                "Such a disorganized course with huge miscommunications and SO MUCH work.",
                "The course only has several components - class discussion, two \"debriefings\" (basically short powerpoints but could be videos, podcasts, any kind of presentation format), weekly reflections, a practice final project and a real final project (the real one is worth 3x the practice). This means it's ok to mess up in one category and still get an A. The projects are also split up into small steps with staggered deadlines, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that busy students may be tempted not to do the reading before every class, since the reading often has nothing to do with the debriefings or projects (unless you want to make your project an extension of the class discussion). Take that as you will.",
                "Strengths is that overall the workload is manageable however there Are definitely waves where there is a lot of work. Professor Njera was accommodating which was helpful.",
                "The homework texts were also interesting, and the discussions felt well-structured and engaging. Prof. Njera takes a very multimodal approach to the learning. This means watching videos, documentaries, looking at paintings, etc., instead of just analyzing traditional written texts. This made the class more  engaging. Prof. Njera also expected us to take a multimodal approach to our projects and assignments (i.e. using graphics, videos, musics, etc., to produce meaning). This was difficult, but fun, because it required thinking in a different way. The workload is reasonable for most of the semester, but very high at the end, because the final project is a fair bit of work and worth 50% of the final grade.",
                "Strengths: incredibly well organized, the professor cares a ton, interesting content, more than just papers, engaging assignments\r\nWeaknesses: instructions were vague in the beginning, but after midterm feedback the professor switched and it became a lot better!",
                "I cried so much during this course.",
                "Strengths: bring you closer to topics of globalization of the Americas in nuanced ways; Weakness; too big of an emphasis on theory, assignments and deadlines can be a little too convoluted",
                "This course is amazing, and I feel grateful to have taken it. The strengths of this course include the interesting concepts taught with concrete historical information. I find the projects helpful as a meaningful way to practice and show our understanding of course material and provide us an opportunity to create something interesting that could be continued and shared beyond this class. The weekly journal entries are a helpful part of the class because we write questions and ideas, providing the professor with an indication of the depth of understanding; Professor Njera spends time thoughtfully responding to and engaging with these entries. My one suggestion is to reduce workload, as more work does not mean greater understanding, and having additional time for fewer projects would have made them more meaningful.",
                "I think the strengths of the course have to do with the rigour of discussion -- there's a substantial focus on developing the theoretical frameworks for understanding globalization and its impact, and that has translated into some really wonderful seminar discussions. I also appreciate the course's focus on the experiences of indigenous communities in understanding globalization -- the experiences of indigenous communities were at the center of almost all of our class discussions, which is of course by design. Overall, I really loved the class.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I would have to say that sometimes the guidelines for our submitted work weren't quite clear, and this sometimes translated into students doing far more work than they had to or should have. I know professors sometimes have aversion to giving word limits or word count guidelines, but they really are helpful -- both because they force students to be concise and because they prevent students from working themselves to death. I also think the course grade weighting could have been done better; our final project was 50% of our grade, and our midterm project (which was the same type of project and was described as a \"practice run\" for the final) was less than half of that. The effect was that after a very labour-intensive midterm project, our performance on it didn't matter as much as it should have in grading. I think that may have demoralized some people going into the final.\r\n\r\nThose are quibbles that can be addressed by changing some numbers on a piece of paper, though!"

My seminar had only 13 students, so I had to participate frequently, and I found the freedom to pursue my own final project liberating and fun.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to others. One point of advice is to ask for clarity in work\/project description and its expectations. Sometimes it was confusing what was expected for an assignment.",
                "I would! The class discussions and reading assignments are great for improving your Spanish. The class covers a lot of different topics related to globalization, culture, indigenous peoples, borders, the environment, etc., without diving too deep into any one. I'd only recommend the course if you're okay with that. Additionally, while the workload is average for most of the semester, it becomes significantly more intense when doing the final project in the last couple weeks.",
                "Yes definitely! The course is so amazing because you don't do typical assignments like papers or problem sets. You have really cool projects where you create a website in the end, and it's so much better than a regular paper. The workload can get a bit tedious, but I don't think it was that much worse than any other class. I really liked it!",
                "No. Do not take. I have dreamt of writing this review for a very long time...but I am choosing peace and kindness.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! It has changed my thinking in many ways and has inspired me to take more classes focused on migration. Also, this class has reaffirmed my hope to pursue the Advanced Spanish Certificate. I will recommend this course to students because I believe many students at Yale (and beyond) should learn about indigenous groups and borders and spheres in a setting where we otherwise would not have a chance. However, I would let prospective students know that there is quite a lot of work (though very rewarding and interactive).",
                "I would recommend this course to a student, absolutely! It was a good experience, and I think students who commit to the course and put in the work for it stand to gain a lot out of it. I feel like my understanding of \"globalization\" before and after the course are actually light-years apart. This is particularly true for students who want to break out of a Euro-American narrative about what globalization is and who it impacts -- the focus on indigenous voices is an incredibly valuable perspective to have.\r\n\r\nThat said, I want students to know going into the course that it's a *lot* of work. This happens not really because of anything the teacher did, but rather because a lack of guidelines has a tendency to result in students over-exerting themselves out of fear of not doing enough. Just note that going into the course, and be sure to balance your work on an expansive and broad project for this class with your work in other classes."
