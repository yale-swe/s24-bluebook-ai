Most of the things we learned, I had never learned in English so it was interesting to learn completely new material in a different language for the first time. Through the course, I think my writing abilities in Spanish improved a great deal.",
                "In this class, I improved my Spanish language skills, particularly my writing skills. This was the first time that I've written a 10 page paper in Spanish, so it was a new experience, but I was successfully able to navigate the writing process, which marks significant growth in my Spanish skills.",
                "I learned a lot more about legal systems in both the US and outside. It was interesting to be exposed to different texts and media, and to be able to discuss them in a different language.",
                "I didn't learn all that much to be honest, which was a bit disappointing. I mostly wanted to practice speaking, but there was not much participation in our classes and because of that every time I spoke I felt like there was more pressure to speak correctly, which made me nervous about participating. I did learn a lot of random stuff about legal theory and the Spanish legal system, which I guess could be useful for law school.",

                "weakness- way too much busywork",
                "I think this course took advantage of the virtual model very well. We had asynchronous class on certain days, which was really well-received. At times, it felt a bit more like a lecture than a seminar, which made it a bit difficult to participate. The class met a 9am on Tues\/Thurs, but we regularly had assignments due at 9am on Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays. It was a bit difficult to manage these assignments with such strange times.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the student presentations, which were an excellent way to learn from and with my classmates. With that said, many of the assignments in this course seemed unrelated to the course material, so sometimes it was difficult to engage with or prepare for classes. This course could be improved by more visual aids and greater synergy between the homework and in class work.",
                "The class would have benefitted from having more activities in class asides from just free discussion. Otherwise, homework assignments were helpful with writing better, especially because Professor Verastegui gave detailed and clear feedback to help without writing.",
                "Too much work, but the in-class collaboration was great. Professor Verstegui was incredible",
                "There should have been much more rapid fire ask and respond participation in the class to help everyone participate more and practice our Spanish. I wanted to talk but didn't really feel comfortable because the class was about 90% lecture from the professor.",
                "The only suggestions I have for improving the course would be to allow students to engage more in discussions and make the lectures more interactive. All of the classes were probably 90% lecture and 10% of actual discussion. While I certainly feel like I improved my reading and writing skills, this class did not help very much in improving my conversational skills.",
                "strengths: interesting content; professor invested in your learning \r\n\r\nweaknesses: class discussion is sometimes overwhelming so I would have liked to have participated in more breakout rooms for discussions; class content seemed a bit unfocused and broad",
