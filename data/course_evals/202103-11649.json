Especially for art history majors, this will really build your foundations and teach you ways to think about art and art history that you can apply to all your other courses. The readings were heavy and required a lot of concentration, but the in-class discussions\/presentations were very clarifying. The process of building your understanding as a group, through the student-led presentations, was useful.",
