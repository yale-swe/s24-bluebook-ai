                "small group discussions during class kept the class very engaging, and the readings were really interesting. the asynchronous videos to be watched before class were also helpful in providing additional context to what we would be discussing in class. no weaknesses that I can think of, to be honest",
                "Good class, good overview. Just hard to do a ton when covering several millennia. But considering that, really enjoyed it. It could be improved possibly by (and I hesitate to say this) adding assessments. They could be very low stakes, but just something that requires a little more review and engagement from week to week. The essays force us to consider works in context on a very specific level. Assessments would do this across the broader intellectual trends. Again, they could be low stakes and a small part of the overall grade. But something forcing me to review and study probably would've helped my recall.",
                "This course was very well designed to facilitate learning. The ability to choose what type of form the projects take helped me engage in the way that was most helpful to me. The small group discussions were also engaging. I also loved the visit to the gallery! It all helped these historical things seem more tangible.",
                "Strengths are Prof T's passion for the course and the knowledgable TF's. Weaknesses are that some readings were very difficult to understand and would have been good to receive some clarity about them beforehand.",
                "strengths: low reading requirement meant more students actually completed readings and engaged in the course; asynchronous lecture provided extra background information without adding in-class hours or a longer lecture time",
                "In general, I appreciated Professor Lu's teaching style, as she always made lectures interesting and found ways to make the content more accessible and relatable to us. I also enjoyed how she gave us time during lectures to discuss that week's readings with our peers so that we could get additional insight into the material. My only weakness about the course is the structure of the slideshows, as some of the slides would only have pictures with little to no supplemental text about the image. This meant that if I happened to miss something in the lecture, even if I were to go back to the slideshow later, I wouldn't be able to find the information I had missed. However, this definitely doesn't reflect the quality of the course as a whole, and is definitely something that can be worked around.",
                "Strengths: Prof T is an incredible person, very kind, approachable, also can be humorous, sarcastic, and funny! Lectures are a combination of lecturing and also a sort of discussion, though it may not feel like it just because we are in a bigger lecture hall. Relatively low workload depending on your engagement with the class, and the guess lectures and class \"field trips\" to the Beineke and YUAG were already great.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much in my opinion, but I can imagine some students not liking the discussion participation part of the class.",
                "One strength of this course was how focused our readings were. While many survey courses pile on the reading and consequently see students skip much of it, that was not a problem in this course. Our readings were consistently short, curated, and on-topic. It was clear that Prof T had thought each and every one out with care. This made it easier to engage deeply with the material for any given class meeting despite whatever other pressing obligations one had that week. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of the course was how easy the assessments were. Our only graded assignments were three short papers of 3-4 pages, each of which focused on close textual analysis, and so there was little incentive to maintain broad knowledge of the course materials. The path of least resistance was to develop enough deep knowledge on one or two authors to produce a very short paper on an as-needed basis rather than maintain and build the deeper, comparative understanding of how the Chinese tradition evolved over time. It would have made more sense either to incorporate comprehensive exams or longer papers that engaged a broader scope of knowledge covered. While it may seem cynical to assume that students are unlikely to bother cultivating this sort of deep knowledge without extrinsic motivation, Yale students are very busy people, and we simply tend to jettison tasks we dont absolutely need to complete. So, I really do think we could have benefitted from tougher assessments. We would have risen to the challenge, and been better off for it!"

                "If you are interested in understanding the way that Chinese people think, in general, and what types of things, ideas, concepts have so strongly influenced the Chinese people, absolutely take this class. I also think that if you are doing anything related to China Policy, IR, or US-China, China-EU things, you should definitely take this class to understand why China is such a unique civilization and why there may be lots of conflict between the way China sees the world and basically how everywhere else sees the world.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who feels interested in taking the class. They will not regret their decision.",
                "Absolutely! Nobody should graduate without understanding the basic heritage of so many of our fellow humans.",
                "I recommend this course if you are interested in ancient China. It's a great fifth class where you can choose how much you want to engage with this course since it's pretty easy to get by with minimal work on busier weeks, but the readings are very interesting if you have the time for them on lighter weeks.",
