                "Professor Fotos' course allowed students to grapple with issues regarding sustainability around the world through an in-depth application of the IAD framework.  Students were able to greatly improve their writing through weekly assignments - to which Professor Fotos provided detailed individual feedback.",

I also learn about democratic practices and how to speak about community resilience and robustness, which is great considering that we are in the middle of one of the most sociopolitically transitional periods of US modern history.",
                "This course focused on the institutions that arise from individual self-governance, and showed that such institutions are generally more sustainable than rules generated by vertical or top-down representation. I developed a greater understanding of the importance of democracy in ensuring a sustainable and equitable future. I also learned a lot about theory in political science, and how democracy in theory and democracy in practice often differ.",

                "Strengths - class participation, instructor support, regular feedback, and assignment relevance. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -",
                "There are many strengths, most important to me that Professor Fotos fostered a lovely culture in the class, even though it was virtual. I became friends with all of my classmates. Additionally, Professor Fotos brought in a bunch of really interesting guest lecturers. Another strength is that students are encouraged to take leadership roles within class. I can't think of any structural weaknesses.",
                "On strengths, this class granted a tremendous amount of freedom in pursuing our interests. The semester-long research allowed us to really delve into a topic we are passionate about. On weaknesses, there was a lot of reading each week, so much that we usually didn't even reference 90% of it.",
                "This course is amazing as is.",
                "The course was excellent. I would say that its foremost strength was Professor Fotos' incredible perspectives on the course material and his dedication to his students. The course's syllabus was extremely well organized and had fascinating readings. These were also supplemented by Professor Fotos' weekly written memos to students that enabled us to engage even more closely with the texts we read. The course was also highly engaging. Professor Fotos' teaching style fostered in-depth discussions of the course's major topics that enabled students to learn from each other as well as from the professor. This was complemented by many group writing activities in class and fascinating guest lecturers.",
                "I looked forward to this class every week.  The discussions were always productive and very interesting.  The culture was probative and intellectual without ever being combative.  \r\nAt times, there was more reading than I could keep up with but that may have just been my fault.",
                "Weekly readings were very heavy, and at times very dense (especially in the beginning, when learning the theory behind the framework). Class discussions were very compelling, and almost everyone had a chance to speak every week. The prompts for the assignments were vague, leading to a lot of potential interpretation for submissions, but Professor Fotos did not seem to mind the variation.",
                "Strength: The class is very well-structured, perhaps one of the best at Yale. Professor Fotos is really thorough about what he expects in every class, owing in no small way to the fact that he actively takes care of and revises the class syllabus every year. Weaknesses: the SES and IAD frameworks are interesting to know, but hard to effectively apply right away. It is so generalizable that there is so much opacity in some of the terminologies, yet it is expected that we are really meticulous about technical jargon. The papers become a bit hard to write for that reason.",
                "The in-class discussions were quite engaging despite the Zoom format. Professor Fotos did an excellent job of moderating the conservation and ensuring that all class members participated in the course. The readings were also interesting, though required a great deal of time to understand to a sufficient degree. I particularly enjoyed the more tangential readings - ones that were only indirectly related to class discussions of self-governance - such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" It was interesting to connect the self-governance lessons from class to historical essays on democracy."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. As my first political science course, it was incredibly informative, and gave me a new framework to analyze problems of self-governance and sustainability. The course material was wide-ranging and ambitious, so there is something in this course for everyone.",
