                "Yes! If you are remotely interested in the EU, take it. The readings are well-chosen, the course is well-structured and Professor Cameron is very kind and helpful. Some background knowledge is useful but definitely not required, so don't be afraid to take it if you know nothing about the EU. The workload is manageable, but if you're taking this then I'd recommend balancing it out with classes that don't require as much reading.",
                "yes def, u will gain basic knowledge of EU structure and politics from an absolute gem of a professor. relatively light long term work but weekly reading responses force u to engage deeply and come prepared to discuss the readings. also made for a more enjoyable seminar bc everyone had something to say"
