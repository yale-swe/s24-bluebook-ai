   "comments": [
    "Waaaaay too much emphasis on lecturing on how to design. Even though we are novices many have designed before and all the different methods arent that helpful\r\n\r\nLet the students do things theyre interested in.\r\n\r\nPick better projects and maybe like to industry to fund\/make us feel like were doing something",
    "The design review structure is helpfully laid out at the beginning of the semester. The lectures were somewhat long though, it would be helpful if they were more directly related to our team projects or shorter.",
    "The projects are nominally interesting, but the execution of the class is poor. The teaching staff do not provide much leadership, and thus the criteria for the design reviews seem arbitrary. It is not clear how points are awarded for any of the grades, and whether points are fairly awarded for different teams.",
    "The course gives a ton of great hands on experience which you simply can't get without large projects such as the ones in this class. However, a lot of the lectures are superfluous, simply eating away at already precious time by reiterating previous lectures and taking longer than necessary to cover material. This wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that this is a HALF CREDIT COURSE with a higher workload than any other full credit course I have ever taken at Yale. This course is designed to be, and could be, super rewarding if we weren't all overworked and sleep deprived. Please, Yale, this is perhaps one of the most time-intensive classes offered; I easily spend 2x per week as much time on this course as I have on language classes (which are 1.5 credits) so why is this only half a credit??? I understand if you can't make it more than 1 credit but at least make it that to lighten our courseload so we can put more time into our projects.",
    "It sounds like many of the problems from last year have been addressed. The projects are genuinely interesting this year; however, the lectures were rarely helpful. Most of them were basic reviews of material covered in another class but too shallow to actually be useful. This time would've been better spent working on the projects (with the exception of the visit by the Cuisinart engineer). Also, the timelines were unrealistically ambitious. I don't understand how the registrar can justify this class being half a credit when it requires significantly more time than any of my other full credit classes."
