                "Strengths:   is the kindest most understanding professor. She brings so much warmth to every class and has been really understanding of all the weaknesses that have come with this semester. I really appreciated how she adapted the course so there were no tests and more recorded assessments like videos\/audio, other projects, etc. Weaknesses: it's just generally hard to have a language class over zoom. It's harder to comprehend things and ask for clarification, etc. especially in a higher level language class.",
                "I think students learn much better through art (music, poetry) and the professor did a great job of incorporating art into the class.",
                "A strength of this course is definitely Professor Lee-Smith. She's AMAZING! She's incredibly considerate of her students and wonderful at explaining new grammatical concepts and any points of confusion. Sometimes, I had difficulty holding myself accountable to study without quizzes, so a few assessments like that might be helpful. But otherwise, the course is so fun!",
                "A strength of the course would be the interactive learning format. Professor Lee-Smith used a variety of means to get her students to practice their Korean whether that be hosting \"DJ podcast\" discussions, writing our own Korean sentences, or making our own Korean song lyrics.",
                "It would have been nice to spend more time learning new grammar patterns as opposed to reviewing past ones."

Allowed for easier discussion. Areas for improvement: maybe we could clarify at the beginning of the class how we should volunteer. For example, sometimes it was unclear whether we should just go ahead and talk or raise the blue hands through zoom or physically raise our hands.",

Although I do have to add that because the class only meets 50 minutes three times a week, it is up to the student to dedicate time everyday to study Korean. Moreover, given the relatively low amount of actual speaking practice that we got (being that the class only meets three times a week), this should not discourage prospective students but rather encourage them to seek creative ways to practice speaking.",
