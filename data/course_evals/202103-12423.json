                "I think any introductory language course is challenging, but I think the main weakness of the course was that the textbook tended to be confusing in its layout and difficult to use. The information in the textbook did not seem to be divided into lessons/chapters in a way that was geared towards considering how students would take in all the information or how students would be able to memorize and retain the information. It was also unclear in each chapter which information would be most important and relevant for actually gaining a working knowledge of Coptic. I understand that there aren't many options for textbooks when it comes to Coptic, so given all the limitations I think I was still able to learn pretty effectively because of how Camille divided up the chapters and told us which points to pay more attention to.",
                "The course was very well crafted; it struck the right balance between difficult and accessible. Camille knew when to offer complex sentences to challenge us and simpler sentences to hammer down the basics. Assessment was challenging but flexible enough that we didn't have to worry about taking risks in translation--we were able to work through hard material without the stress of tanking our grade.",
                "The textbook seems confusing at first, but once you get over the initial new language shock, it's very well organized and pretty much the best way to learn the basics of Coptic over the course of a semester. Camille's notes on each chapter that she posted to blackboard made the lessons easy to understand, and the weekly vocabulary quiz helped to keep us on top of content we otherwise might have forgotten. I also appreciated the ample time left for review, not just before the final but built in to every week, and the emphasis placed on translating actual Coptic passages. The course was organized to promote not just learning, but understanding of the content.",
                "Layton's textbook provided useful over-arching structure to the course, especially with the guidance provided by Professor Angelo's lectures and handouts. I appreciated the emphasis on vocabulary building and real-world practice sentences. I also appreciated the space allotted in the syllabus for regular review sessions (which were some of our most useful and compelling meetings) and for lingering in difficult material where necessary. The homework was always beneficial. I loved the sessions devoted to introducing online tools for Coptic study and to manuscript research. \r\nI would have also liked to get into more of the grammatical background of what we were learning, though I realize that this is a matter of interest on my part, and not necessary in line with the stated goals of the course. Prof Angelo's approach to grammar was pragmatic, clear, and effective."

                "Absolutely, Coptic would have been almost impossible to learn without Camille's guidance in a classroom setting. It's certainly challenging (what ancient language wouldn't be?!),  but by the end of the course we were able to read fragments of ostraca and papyrii, which was very rewarding. The work load is high only because it's a language course, and learning any language takes a lot of time and effort. Again, the reward of knowing Coptic far outweighs the work you put into studying it.",
