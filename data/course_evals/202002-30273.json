   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: prof is a great person, super kind, nice, and considerate. Professors always say that you can ask questions at any time, and to be honest most of them don't mean it, but Prof Mehdi actually does mean it. I felt comfortable interrupting him in class when there was a short pause. I thought the grading and structure of this course was fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework sets seemed too long, especially towards the middle of the class (like week 3\/4) when things started to drag a little for me. I also found my TA \/ discussion section to be completely useless (probably the worst TF I've ever had at Yale) and would just mute him and work on my hw during the discussion section. I couldn't understand my TF, and he didn't have an iPad \/ tablet so was just clicking to draw things with his computer mouse.... no fault of his own, but it wasn't helpful. Online, I think Prof Mehdi was going a little too fast through the problems, like I wish he would have given us some time in class to think about the problem or try it ourselves before he started solving it. It's okay if you've picked out problems beforehand that you'd like to do in class, but for the students who are trying to solve the problem, it's our first time looking at it and we need some time to  think about it ourselves. For reference, I took PHYS S180 last summer when it was taught in person, and the pace of the course was about 20% slower when Prof Mehdi was teaching it in person. Online, it's easy just to go fast, when you can't see the students faces or whatever, I wish he would have gone a little slower during this course. \r\n\r\nImproved: I think this course can be taught asynchronously, like I think Prof Mehdi can hold lectures live and people can come if they want to, but they shouldn't be required to attend lectures. I personally found it most helpful to (1) get an overview of the concept and then (2) work through problems by myself, instead of watching a Prof or a TA do problems. another improvement -- plz offer to loan TF's tablets to write on if they don't have their own...",
    "Strengths: this course was well-organized and well-structured. Lecture content moved in order of the book, increasing with complexity as the course went on. Office hours were plentiful and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\/improvements: No major structural weaknesses. Content was good and moved at a reasonable pace. See instructor comments for more details",
    "The class was ok, but it was difficult sitting for an hour and fifteen minute long class almost every day.",
    "Professor Mehdi and the TAs are 100% a strength for this course. Even though it's very fast paced, Professor Mehdi is always willing to meet up for extra questions outside of office hours and TA sections were always helpful in digesting the material.",
    "Strengths: amazing professor.\r\nWeakness: TA's, section, time zone difference. Wasn't sure section was very helpful this semester, and course wasn't very friendly to people not in EST time zone (i.e. people needed to take exams at 6:30AM or 10:30PM, office hours were hard to make, etc.).",
    "The book and flexibility of the professor are strengths of the course. The class also provides plenty of practice problems, which are essential for learning this kind of physics. The end of the class, however, felt really rushed and was not well explained. This was disappointing, as I found the final material (mirrors, reflection, refractions, Huygen's principle) the most interesting. Perhaps some of 181 could be integrated into 180 (which felt pretty slow). Otherwise, it would be better to spend slightly less time on the earlier concepts that are easier to understand so that we could have spent more class time (and higher quality class time) on the final interesting topics.",
    "the beginning of the course was much harder than the end so maybe the order could be rearranged for a more equal level of difficulty throughout",
    "Really well taught, teacher very engaging.",
    "This class could be better organized. Towards the end of the course I realized that I looked at the notes I made from the chapter readings and rarely glanced at any notes I wrote during lecture. Yes, this class is fast-paced, but often times during lecture I was not aware of what we were learning because things weren't organized. I also felt that during lecture sometimes we spent too much time on the derivation rather than explaining the concepts, which would be frustrating when quiz or test questions would be more conceptual. Overall, there needs to be a better balance between conceptual and practical problems, and ensuring that lecture is organized enough to facilitate this. \r\n\r\nAlso, the syllabus said the section quizzes would only for two attempts, and then we were only given one attempt...I'd prefer if we were given more time to do the quizzes and have one attempt instead of being given barely any time to finish the quizzes. 6-minutes was not enough to answer some of the questions that were asked.",
    "I thought the content of the course was more interesting than 180 (not to say 180 was boring, but for me, E&M was a lot newer and exciting) - so material was cooler. Strength is the consistency of the class: easy to get into a \"rhythm\" of work, everyday is class, some homework at night. \r\n\r\nDidn't like that it was easy to feel alone in this class: no human interaction if you didn't seek it out, but I spent a lot of time with friends I had in the class. I can see it being very boring if that wasn't the case. \r\nCould be improved if there was a week break between 180 and 181. Doing both classes...definitely not hard to do persay, just not fun to do either to be honest.",
    "strengths:\r\n- very reasonable course, tests were adjusted when too difficult, and test corrections were offered\r\n- professor explains most topics well, sometimes too fast\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the class moved faster than the assignments which could be frustrating\r\n- It is really fast-paced so it takes a lot of work to do well",
    "Strengths: Mehdi as usual, weaknesses: none that I can think of.",
    "The course was very fast paced which is understandable since it was a summer course. The content was at times hard to grasp simply because it was so much information to take in.",
    "Strengths: Lots of help\/resources. \r\nWeaknesses: Very fast paced.",
    "Strengths: TAs were helpful and understanding, professor was knowledgeable. Course pace was fast but manageable, course policies and tests were very fair and accommodating. Weaknesses: As an online course and early in the morning it would have been useful to have a brief break from the screen to stand up\/stretch because it was hard to stay awake and engaged so early. Professor could have been more open to questions and homework schedule could have been better communicated since it changed from the first semester to the second semester.",
    "Even though it was online, the professor took care to make sure all of us were understanding what he was doing. It was super easy to stop him by just unmuting ourselves and ask clarification questions and both he and all the TAs were easily accessible to ask questions and go to office hours.",
    "The visual aspects of every class, especially the phet simulations, helped greatly in the learning process.",
    "The lectures are often hard to follow if one did not read the textbook chapter thoroughly before class because the example problems or big ideas are not labelled by the instructor. To improve, the instructor should introduce the main topics in a simpler way then build up into harder examples.",
    "The strength of this course was the amount of topics it was able to cover. I learned how to apply calculus to the topics and took a lot away from the course. However, this is also a weakness since summer courses are especially fast paced and we skimmed over A LOT of material (especially the last 1.5 weeks).",
    "Great professor. Reasonable level of rigour. I was happy with the course, it was fair and I learned a lot.",
    "I really struggled with the online format; I had no peer group to work with, I struggled to remain engaged with the online lectures, and the discussion sections were painfully quiet.",
    "I enjoyed the course. The exams were fair. However, the discussion sections were a bit awkward.",
    "It was sometimes too fast-paced, and lectures could be hard to follow. It is tough to say how to improve this though because the class was over such a short time period in the summer.",
    "I think that less emphasis on examples and more theory during lectures would make the class more interesting, but I also do understand that there is a balance between theory and examples that has to be met as well, especially for an introductory course such as this."

   "comments": [
    "Sure",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a solid foundation in electricity and magnetism. This course is a good gateway into many majors and the difficult is moderate. Good intro without too much difficulty or commitment.",
    "Yes, but only if you need it for a requirement or something.",
    "Definitely recommending this course. If you have a free summer and really need physics for major\/pre-med, this course is super useful to just get it all completed in 2 months versus an entire year. Although it's challenging and fast-paced, everything is extremely fair and the instructors are amazing.",
    "Yes, if you're pre-med and don't want to take a full year of physics. Professor Medhi made the ride manageable while still ensuring a high level of engagement.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student seeking to gain introductory level physics knowledge. This class fulfills a requirement, and while it's an intense 5 weeks, it's not at all unmanageable. The workload was high but manageable, and the class moved at a reasonable pace for a summer condensed course.",
    "the summer session seemed to be much better than the class during the school year from what i understand, so I would recommend doing it over the summer, but only for a requirement",
    "YES! Mehdi is amazing, and taking over summer is less strenuous.",
    "It is pretty nice to knock out a year of physics if you take 180\/181 over the summer and the stuff I learned was really interesting. Thought I might get a shoddy version of the yearlong class taking it over the summer, but truly felt like a took away a substantial amount and it was rewarding (still a pain in the butt sometimes bc I hate consistent homework but that's on me not the class). \r\n\r\nI don't know how other people studied but I have an aversion to reading textbooks my eyes glaze over sometimes if I am tired so I ended up watching way too many Khan Academy videos at 2x speed.. I think almost everybody I knew who I talked to had to supplement the lectures\/discussion sections with readings because function of the class is its so fast. Not anybody's fault but I feel like not possible to really absorb that much that quickly. Just be prepared for some supplement like that outside of class. Your classes are done in the morning but if you want to really learn you're probably not done.",
    "Take it if you have to, or want to get physics over with ASAP. It is doable if you aren't doing anything else for the summer. If you don't then just take it during the year.",
    "Absolutely. Just like 180 with Mehdi, this was a great class. Would recommend to anyone and everyone.",
    "Yes...it must be taken for premed and many STEM majors.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn physics. No, if you're just looking for a science credit.",
    "As a requirement I would definitely recommend taking over the summer especially if you've taken AP physics already and just need the Yale credit. It went by much faster and I could devote more time to it over the summer and get it out of the way without taking up space from the more interesting and limited access courses I want to take during the regular semester. Good class, good professor, good policies all around.",
    "100%. I'd heard from upperclassmen that the physics department is yale's hidden gem of the stem departments and they weren't wrong. This class (along w phys 180) was very well taught and I left the 10 weeks with way more confidence in my abilities than when I'd started.",
    "I would only recommend someone take Physics 181 if they need it for pre-med or a pre requisite. It's a very intense course, coming from someone who did not have any physics background from high school. This course also was a lot more calculus than I expected. It was challenging, and often I was doing a lot of basic foundational learning on Khan Academy to try to prepare for lectures and homework because the lectures often brushed over the basic concepts that one needed to do well.",
    "Yes, if they have to complete it for a major requirement. Otherwise, I don't see the point because it really won't be too applicable in the work field if they're not in engineering. It's still cool to learn about how things work in the world around us, though.",
    "Absolutely. It was taught well and the material was interesting and challenging.",
    "I'm not sure my experience is reflective of how other students experienced this course, largely because I really struggled with the online format, but this semester felt especially rushed, and I didn't retain much of the information that was presented. I only took this to try to salvage something from my quarantine summer, and I don't regret it, but it wasn't something I particularly enjoyed.",
    "Yes, this course gives you a good basic understanding of physics.",
    "Yes, it is necessary for many majors, and taking it over the summer is a great choice in my opinion.",
    "Yes, I absolutely would if Mehdi is teaching! Lovely professor who cares about his students deeply. It is rare to find that in a stem professor. I also think that the PSET were considerably easier than PSETs given in 181 during the semester.",
    "Yes, many students will be taking this course for their major requirements or premed requirements. I think that if a student feels comfortable with calculus and has had previous exposure to physics, they will enjoy this course."
