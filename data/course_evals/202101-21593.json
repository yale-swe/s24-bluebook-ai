                "Really clear instructions and lesson plans",
                "It's a great course! Well organized and instructors cared about the students.",
                "It is generally accepted that even though labs are half credits, they require much more work. However, with the virtual lab, the workload is much more manageable. In my in-person lab the previous semester, it was also very helpful to have access to the videos of Professor DiMeglio going through the lab meant for the virtual sections. Obviously, the virtual format lacks hands-on experience, but it was still a good experience given the circumstances.",
                "strength: course was really facilitated to help students learn",
                "They could have included a greater variety of techniques.",
                "strengths: Dr. DiMeglio is the sweetest, most understanding, and most helpful professor, even online! the class is super well organized and helpful for learning without being an overload of work\r\nweaknesses: it really depends on what TA you get. mine wasn't the most engaging, but I heard other TAs that were super fun and engaging!",
                "Strengths: Very organized and engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "For a half a credit class, this course was extremely demanding with its weekly quizzes, experimental plans, and lab notes in addition to the two post-lab assignments. I would often spend far more time weekly for this course as compared to the full-credit organic chemistry lecture course. It also often feel disjointed from what we are learning in lecture, making it hard to engage and feel the relevance of what we are doing in lab.",
                "strengths: very organized, very clear expectations, feedback was always helpful and clear \r\nweaknesses: it was online (given the pandemic) which definitely took away from the lab experience",
                "Strength - amazing compassion for virtual students, able to understand clearly what was happening \r\nImprovement - unclear rubrics, never knew what they were really looking for sometimes",
                "Strengths: Prof DiMeglio adapted this course incredibly well to the challenges posed by the pandemic. I took CHEM 222L last semester in-person, and the difference between in-person and virtual lab was marginal in terms of content learned (although taking it virtually was less work). Overall organic lab is very enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there was some standardization to TA grading prior to the end-of-semester curve. Would be a helpful means of knowing where you stand relative to the rest of the class. EPs should (ideally) be graded complete/partial/incomplete, since we learn the material we are being graded on after submission. Both Gen Chem and Orgo lab should be worth 1 YC credit.",
                "I wish we spent more time discussing the PLs given that they are worth a lot of our grade. Overall, the TAs were very receptive to questions and the assignments weren't too difficult to do by yourself. One huge weakness was that the online zoom meetings seemed sort of useless, given we would just go over concepts and questions already covered in the pre-lab reading.",
                "Strengths: Honestly, a great class all around. It was great to come in and see everyone every week, the workload is pretty minimal (you get really good at doing EPs every week and the post-lab assessments were a few hours max), and it definitely helps you get more comfortable in the lab. Dr. D, the TAs and the lab staff are also pretty great!\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the answers on the quizzes weren't explained well, and it was hard to get clearer answers by asking the teaching staff.",
                "This course excels in its ability to provide practical experience for students. The option for students to view pre-recorded videos surrounding each week's procedure prior to lab day was particularly helpful, the TAs and lab staff maintained a safe environment in the lab, and I felt supported as I learned to be comfortable in a lab setting. The course could be improved by maintaining a three-hour (rather than two-hour) grace period for students to submit lab notes. This policy was enacted halfway through the semester, and it would be beneficial to renew it next year.",
                "I thought this course was adapted very well for online learning and that Dr. DiMeglio and the TAs did a wonderful job. The only \"weakness\" is that the workload is fairly intense for a 0.5 credit class, especially for in-person lab students. I tend to spend more time on this class than some other 1 credit classes.",
                "standardized grading  would be helpful because things I got right in orgo 1, I got wrong in orgo 2",
                "This semester has been really fun because I got to take it in-person. During some of the weeks, the labs follow and support the lecture. The course was well-organized and clear in what teachers expect students to understand and get out of it.",
                "I took this course in a virtual format so I cannot really speak on what it would be like live.",
                "Strengths of course: You learn a lot about how to analyze FTIR and 1H NMR spectrums, and how to use the equipment and perform experiments from start to finish in organic chemistry labs. These skills will be immensely useful if working in an organic chemistry lab in the future. The course is also very well organized, with clear expectations and weekly emails on what is due for that week.\r\nWeaknesses of course: The repetitive nature of the assignments (experimental plans and lab notes every week) often made it feel like I was doing busy work, especially since I was doing virtual lab this semester. If I was doing in-person lab, I would have found writing up the procedure, chemical table, and clean-up procedures in the experimental plans to be more valuable (since I would be performing the actual experiment using my own two hands and would need to know what's going on), but since I was doing virtual lab, these tasks eventually became monotone and repetitive after the first few weeks.",
                "Having taken labs both in person and now virtually, I was worried this semester how virtual lab would compare, and while I did miss the in-person component of interacting with other students, TAs, and Dr. DiMeglio, I thought that the overall experience was pretty great! The lab experiments were engaging, and the readings provided great insight into what to expect in the experiment and the applications of the compounds and techniques used beyond the scope of the course. Though the structure of the course makes it a little bit of a heavier workload, I think that it's all time worth spent in really learning and understanding the material. The only weakness with the course, in my opinion, was that the TA presentations were often redundant and less engaging, but I do that this is somewhat a consequence of the virtual format. (It may also vary based off of section).",
                "The course was well-organized, especially given the difficulties of running both in-person and virtual labs at the same time. One weakness is that a huge portion of the grade comes from a final exam that consisted of 25 multiple-choice questions, making for a very stressful exam since any missed question had an outsized impact.",
                "Overall it was a good intro to orgo lab. There was a lot of work for a half semester course, and sometimes the requirements were a little unclear. However, it was good overall.",
                "This class is just kind of pointless. In the end, we learned a few techniques over the course of the semester that we probably could have learned within a couple hours. We got to a certain point where every experiment felt the same because each followed the same steps. Doing these experiments didn't do anything to shed more light on the topics under question. Waiting an hour to see a substance change color doesn't make someone better able to understand the mechanism of a reaction. This lab can't help but feel like a drain of time and resources for everyone involved.",
                "In the virtual format, it was essentially busywork -- it will likely be improved just by virtue of the lessening of COVID restrictions.",
                "This course was incredibly well organized and everything was easy to find. However, it would have been better to have some hands-on component like a DIY lab so that virtual students could get a taste of engagment.",
                "The class does a great job of teaching you new lab techniques and does a really good just of correlating with the organic lecture. I think it could be improved by connecting the techniques to an outside career or use and just showing students a practical point at which they could use the skills.",
                "The strengths are that the course is catered for student learning and guides the students through the necessary steps and assignments. One weakness can be the unclear expectations about how thorough the post-lab assignments should be.",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio is a wonderful teacher/really receptive to communication. Also, my TA was pretty nice and open as well. The course really goes through the fundamentals and ensures that you know how to read and collect different types of data from lab. \r\nWeaknesses: grading is really dependent on the TA you recieve, sometimes the assignments can feel like busy work",
                "The organization of this course is amazing. It is very clear what the expectations are from week to week. The only weakness is that it's difficult to stay engaged during virtual lab, but I think the abbreviated meeting time helps with that.",
                "Poorly structured online quizzes which do not give sufficient time for answers.",
                "I think it was pretty good online but still not as relevant as t would have been in person.",
                "well organized",
                "weaknesses: quality of the experience depends on the TA you get. My TA last semester was a nightmare and it affected my enjoyment in the class and my will to keep trying hard to achieve good grades. Too much work for a 0.5 credit course, it was a real drain on my time. The quizzes were very stressful and didn't add to my learning experience.",
                "Strengths- Dr. Clark and Dr. DiMeglio are both brilliant chemist and wonderful people. It is always a pleasure to be taught by the two of them. \r\n\r\nWeakness- It's an online lab course... it stinks that it is online. Lab should be hands on, in person. I think this course did its best to adapt.",
                "There's a good balance of autonomy and support from professors and teaching assistants. The workload is also very manageable.",
                "Very well taught, but sometimes the chemical reaction itself wasnt explained well",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio and TAs are very very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: grading is way more strict than it needs to be, too particular and it discourages students from learning",
                "Strengths: Clear lab videos for remote students.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading differences and varying expectations between TAs/unclear expectations. The one hour given between the end of section and submitting lab notes was very tight for remote students, while it was much much easier for in-person students, making it unfair for the remote learners. I would've love to have more engagement with Dr. DiMeglio, we never saw her outside of the videos.",
                "I loved how stress free and very learning focused this course was and I cant think of anything that would have made my experience even better than it was.",
                "It is hard to judge a lab course that does not have any in person lab components, but the quizzes reinforced the organic chem. concepts and the discussion was great to answer any questions about the material.",
                "This class was structured to accommodate students during the pandemic, and allowed me to not feel overwhelmed by the workload from week to week.",
                "The structure of the labs was nice, allowing us to ask questions we may have to our TF before assignments were due.",
                "By and far so much better than my experience in a non COVID semester taking organic lab 1. Not stressful at all, everybody was helping each other, it almost felt normal in spite of minor changes (wearing a mask). Prof. DiMeglio is a godsend, she must have actually been sent from the heavens because I have no idea how somebody is so bright and cheerful all the time.\r\nI could see myself improving on basic lab techniques: reflux, NMR, TLC, IR and I never felt badly for any mistakes I made. Looked forward to lab. Wow. Never thought I'd say that.",
                "strengths: great teaching team that was super helpful and understanding but continued to challenge us throughout the semester",
                "Strengths: The course itself was well organized. It was very clear what was due when, and the Canvas modules helped immensely.\r\nWeaknesses: I was not very invested in the course itself. This is not a fault of the course itself, but rather the nature of remote labwork. Additionally, there is a swath of busywork due each week that I believe did not add much to the experience or to my learning.",
                "I really loved this class, especially because it was an in-person lab. I loved this class so much that it's actually my most favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. I really don't have anything to add that would make this class better just because, given our current situation, I believe the staff did everything they could to ensure we could have as normal an experience as possible.",
                "Strength is the use of H-NMR, IR spectroscopy, and TLC extremely often as to build habits and reinforce knowledge.  Weakness is the occasional discrepancy in pre-lab handouts and pre-lab videos.",
                "The course is also very well organized with modules preparing for and leading to the next. I also thought the expectations for the work we do were very well established which I thought was very helpful. \r\nThe remote component definitely made it difficult to get laboratory techniques under our belt, such as getting an NMR spectrum. However, I thought it was still useful that the course explained the principles behind these techniques.",
                "I thought the class was run very well! I appreciated the patience of the instructors for students doing in-person lab for the first time this year and felt that I was able to learn without being overwhelmed.",
                "The grading started off harshly/",
                "One strength of this course is that the professor and the instructor were extremely helpful. One weakness is that sometimes the lectures for the mechanisms felt rushed.",
                "I enjoyed the course very much and it was organized to facilitate student learning.",
                "A lot of time",
                "Strengths - the course is very very well organized for learning. The deadlines/expectations are clear and there is an abundance of help available.\r\nWeaknesses - the grading relies too heavily on 2 assignments - PLA and PLB",
                "I really enjoyed this class",
                "Really well-developed lab course, straightforward and organized, every single element of the lab had a purpose and benefited the student, well adapted to COVID",
                "Strengths - fairly well organized, similar to previous semester\r\nWeaknesses - quite repetitive, synchronous lab sessions were not very informative or useful\r\nThe course could be improved by making the lab notes and work less repetitive.",
                "Dr. DiMeglio is the best professor ever - she cares about each student",
                "This course was great, but the lab quizzes were often really difficult for me and I felt a lot of time pressure on them",
                "Strength: The class is not very stressful if you just follow the directions and prepare for the experiment the day before. Everything that needs to be done is generally outlined clearly on campus. If not, the TAs are receptive to questions and emails. The EPs and LNs could get tedious but they do help with learning the experiment and comprehending the chemistry. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Your entire grade is based on the final and the two post-lab write-ups. LNs and EPs count for very little.",
                "Strengths: our TA was the perfect example of what a TA should be like in this class, offering suggestions as to how to improve and taking off an accurate number of points when necessary. The class was very successful in the virtual format, and was a pleasure to take. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is very TA dependent for whether the class is a positive or negative experience. First semester my TA took of a huge number of points for the most trivial  errors; this semester, I did exactly the same level of careful editing of my EPS and LNs and lost much fewer points in comparison",
                "Course was well organized, well taught, and interesting. Only weakness was probably 1)a lack of detail in post-lab writeup instructions and 2) insufficient time limits on quizzes.",
                "The course is organized and taught very well",
                "Strength: it follows closely to the lecture portion. The experiments were interesting and we had adequate time to complete them. Dr. Dimeglio is a great lab instructor. I thought they were very accommodating when it came to quizzes.",
                "Expectations in this course can be arbitrary. If a student were to follow the example written assignments provided by the instructor, the student would not get an A. Points are deducted for writing too much, points are also deducted for writing too little. It can be very frustrating to do well in this course. 12+ hours can be spent on a single set of EP + LN but points end up being deducted due to requirements that were not clearly stated in the instructions.",
                "It was online which cant be helped, EPs and LNs are so repetitive and we shouldnt really have this class focus on formatting. Anybody can follow a format, but not anybody can understand GC/MS, more advanced techniques. The course could move a lot faster w/o making it more difficult for students gradewise. Wouldve wanted to see a lot more reactions and techniques rather than focus on hitting on the rubric points for the formatting of a PL.",
                "Strengths: Online quizzes at the end of the week were great; I could focus solely on the lab on my lab day instead of worrying about the quiz as well. Dr. DiMeglio is a huge strength as well. I felt like she made a genuine effort to connect with every student and her online videos were always very clear. My TA Jenna was also very helpful. I also appreciated the relaxed atmosphere of the class; I felt safe to make mistakes and learn from them, instead of trying to get everything perfect all the time (especially nice that grades were not based on percent yield!). \r\nWeaknesses: not many. I would say though that the workload, while not overwhelming or ridiculous, seemed a bit much for a 0.5 credit class. Also, although not a fault of whoever designed the class, just know that the four-hour lab days with submitting lab notes afterwards can become exhausting days.",
                "It complements the lecture pretty nicely. However, the workload is heavy.",
                "As a student who took lab virtually this semester, the professor and TA's probably did the best they could. Andrew explained all of the reactions very well, and brought enthusiasm and encouragement to every meeting. Prof. DiMeglio's videos were also very realistic, and it was actually very nice to see her make a few human errors and demonstrate ways that scientists recover from mistakes during experimentation because it is very rare for labs to go perfectly.",
                "-it was well adjusted for the online format",
                "I didnt like the time limit of the quizzes.",
                "I though the experiments had a strong variety and were throughly explained",
                "I enjoyed this class, especially since it was in person. I thought it was well taught. Only complaint is that the workload is definitely more than a 0.5 credit class.",
                "Lots of information and methods. Difficult to engage with fully without being in lab.",
                "Strengths: phenomenal weekly lab videos and virtual lab sessions that helped clarify any confusing concepts from the pre-lab reading; Weaknesses: it was harder to stay engaged due to the virtual nature of the course, but that is the fault of no one",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio made the course very enjoyable, she wanted to make sure that we learned the material well while still having fun\r\nWeaknesses: it was difficult to know how to study for the weekly multiple choice quizzes (not many practice problems); how the TAs grade EPs and LNs: I found myself spending far more time with formatting on the EP and LN than on the chemistry itself. I wish the TAs would all have a standard rubric that they followed so that TAs finding minor formatting changes or other discrepancies wouldn't result in a bad grade on the assignments.",
                "This course provided clear feedback and the assignments facilitated further learning in an adequate manner.",
                "The class was well organized and accessible, making the learning easier. Additionally, grading was fair and ensured that all students were able to develop from their mistakes.",
                "A strength of the course was that the pre-lab readings were very helpful and concise. I also liked that there were questions at the end of the pre-lab readings that we could use to study for the quizzes. I also liked that the quizzes weren't every week. A weakness was that i wish we could have gotten feedback on how to do well in our PLs and weekly assignments earlier.",
                "No weaknesses."

                "In-person lab was really smoothly run!",
                "Virtual lab sections were very engaging and helpful.",
                "Socially distanced in person style was very conducive to learning, as are the videos available.",
                "The videos of the professors going through the lab experiment were very helpful for understanding the experiment. It was also nice to know that my TA was always available via email to answer any questions.",
                "Having in-person labs is essential to truly learning the material. As such, it was difficult for me to truly get much out of this course.",
                "I think the integration of recorded lectures with in person lab was great because the videos helped me prepare for lab time a lot (even though it made the course slightly more time consuming). I also think it was awesome that there was an opportunity for virtual lab if that was ever needed.",
                "The recorded lab experiments were really helpful! I really wish these would still be available in the future when things return to full capacity/in-person.",
                "TA sessions were a nice way to actually interact with labmates every week. Also, the weekly quizzes were helpful in staying engaged with the material.",
                "Success - labs, discussion sections, enjoyed how my TA took the time to write out mechanisms \r\nImprovement - more rubric releases, sometimes I was completing assignments not knowing what my TA was looking for, especially on post lab assignments",
                "recordings of experiments were easy to follow and well-edited. lab section was good virtually, although more could be done to facilitate actual conversation.",
                "Succeeded: The canvas page was pretty organized with the syllabus, modules, and videos. There were a lot of resources from past weeks, such as practice quizzes that you could use to study for the exam.\r\n\r\nImproved: I wish there was a review session prior to the final exam, given that it was given earlier than finals week. Another improvement that can be made is with some of the rules for turning work in. On the syllabus it says \"Work is always due on your regularly scheduled lab day, even if you are sick\" which seems a bit much given the course took place in the middle of COVID. I understand that some students take advantage of \"illnesses of convenience\" but there should be some leniency when it comes to being sick.",
                "I thought the virtual lab sessions were fine, but not great, since they focused a lot on the underlying chemistry instead of techniques. Dr. D's prerecorded videos were helpful, though! It was also nice to have our own personal waste containers and acetone bottles.",
                "Students had the option to take this course either virtually or in person. Between my fall and spring semesters, I engaged in both options, and I believe that both adapted well to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual materials available (including pre-recorded videos, sample lab data, and various documentsall organized into weekly modules on Canvas) provided meaningful instruction each week. Pairing these resources with in-person lab experience during the spring semester was particularly valuable, and I felt safe due to the COVID-19 cleaning and distancing protocols enforced in the lab.",
                "Out of all of my courses, I feel that this course was one of the best in terms of adapting to online learning. Dr. DiMeglio spent a lot of time performing experiments and explaining the methodology step-by-step in the videos. I did not feel as though my learning was compromised in this class due to the online format.",
                "I really appreciate that the lab was offered in-person even during the pandemic. We practiced COVID-19 cleaning procedures every lab, and the course went very smoothly.",
                "The holding of short, live virtual lab classes was helpful, since it allowed me to ask questions about grading for lab notes and the specific details of what the TAs would be looking for when grading the assignment.",
                "I think that the virtual format of the experiments with recorded videos was great! Having assignments that went along with the experiments aided in my engagement with the videos, and they were a great length. It really did feel as though you were in the lab watching the experiment! I don't think that the TA sessions were super useful, as they were often redundant to the readings.",
                "Lab is simply better in-person, but I think the course was managed as well as it could have been given the circumstances.",
                "I thought the split between virtual and online was good.",
                "I think the course was tailored well in general. It allowed students to learn quite extensively while still maintaining a workload that is fairly manageable.",
                "Pretending to do the virtual lab on break day was weird.",
                "I appreciated that apart from the weekly discussion section, assignments and lab videos could be done on out own time during the week. I also think that while doing a lab online is not something I was really looking forward to, the great organization of the course and helpful instructors actually made this course a good experience for me. Sometimes, however, the weekly lab notes and experimental procedures could get a little redundant and taxing -- they often took me more than the stipulated 4 hours to complete, and because I had classes right before and after, getting the assignments done was a little stressful for me.",
                "This course is one of those that chose to compensate for online quizzes being open note by making them excruciatingly short. No matter how well I knew the material, opening a quiz and having to do something like analyze NMR spectra with so little time per question made me freeze up and get hit with anxiety. Punishing students for the quizzes being open-note by reducing the length of time to such a short amount that the second we open it we see the timer and everything short circuits and you want to start crying doesn't make the students learn better it just hurts students with anxiety the most",
                "The course was very well organized. Everything was easy and clear to understand and to follow. However, it truly doesn't qualify as a substitute for a full lab experience.",
                "I think Dr. DiMeglio and the entire staff worked so hard to modify the course for a virtual semester and it really showed. The way the entire lab class was structure was a strength and I honestly wouldn't suggest any changes if another remote semester we ever to occur!",
                "The lab videos performing the experiments were really helpful along with the thorough pre-lab reading assignments that had all information necessary.",
                "Given the fact that lab was replicated in a virtual setting, I think this course was likely the best it could've been.",
                "The lab felt very safe for learning.  It was also very nice to have recorded tutorials and the option to complete a lab virtually if you couldnt attend in person.",
                "successful in gearing learning towards pandemic and flexible which was very appreciated",
                "The labs were recorded. They were often lengthy, which sucked. However, it was still shorted than an in-person lab. I didn't mind watching the videos every week. The sections were great because the chemistry was explained by a TF in a humanistic way. Splendid!",
                "I liked that there was an in-person socially distanced component. Everything could be done virtually if needed, but having in-person instruction allowed students to gain confidence in crucial skills like lab techniques and safety.",
                "Professor DiMeglio was excellent in making sure students were engaged in person and online!!",
                "Flexibility with quizzes succeeded, Dr. Dimeglio altered a lot in response to COVID to help the students out.",
                "The recorded labs simply do not convey the same experience and skills as they would in person.",
                "I wouldn't change anything, they should make the regular semester labs more like this year's lab if they could. I had so much fun this semester, possibly one of my favorite classes",

                "The recorded labs were high quality, with clear explanations.",
                "I thought that the combination of recorded lab experiments and live meetings with our TA each week was successful. It would have been helpful if my TA had a tablet for writing neater notes instead of using the Zoom whiteboard.",
                "All of the professors and teaching assistants were completely dedicated to ensuring not just our safety but also our learning in these difficult times. If we voiced that there was a challenge in completing an assignment, Dr. DeMeglio always responded in a timely manner and also accommodated our requests. For that, I am very grateful and couldn't be thankful enough.",
                "General atmosphere of understanding and fairness.",
                "I think that the review zooms when it was not needed to go into lab were helpful, but sometimes there were too many people for just one NMR machine.",
                "The recording of the lab ahead of time is a great feature that should be continued post-COVID. It helped me more thoroughly understand what I was doing and prepare for lab sessions.",

                "This course was great",
                "In-person lab was social distanced but still effective. Remote lab sections were engaging but, of course, were not as comprehensive as in-person lab.",
                "Having recorded labs for remote students of for in person students to watch was really helpful",
                "I thought the in lab portion was well designed and I felt safe going to lab. I thought it was great that we had a long period of time to complete quizzes accounting for different time zones. I really liked having the recorded lab videos. It was a great way to prepare for when we actually did it.",
                "Recorded lectures should always be a thing, even in non-Covid years",
                "Recorded labs were very detailed",
                "While a large part of lab courses should involve hands-on experimentation to give students the chance to learn how to work with chemicals in a real environment, the only way to improve Prof. DiMeglio's recorded labs would be to have software to allow students to do lab simulations every week, which is understandably difficult and impractical to ask for.",
                "it was well done",
                "The recorded lectures were well-made and I felt as if I understood the procedures even without being able to do them myself",
                "The socially distanced lab worked well. I felt safe but was able to learn things I definitely would not have been able to learn remotely.",
                "This class was adapted for the pandemic by refocusing away from practical lab skills toward deeper understanding of principles and concepts. I thought that this worked really well and if anything I enjoyed this class more than the in-person semester.",
                "I thought pre-recording the labs was very helpful.",
                "The weekly virtual lab sessions and lab videos were very thorough and helpful.",
                "The in-person lab COVID-19 changes made were great. I was happy that we were given the opportunity to be in person. The social distancing and individual lab set-ups made me feel very safe. I would not have changed anything.",
                "Lab sessions suffered from a lack of engagement due to the remote setting, but the teaching fellow was able to offer a great educational and supportive environment.",
                "The staff's approach to maintaining a clean lab environment worked great; not only were we able to keep a safe distance from all others, but this also allowed for smaller and more personalized learning environments.",
                "I appreciated the \"lab\" sessions with my TA, but I often felt that they could have been more useful if we were taught more in that time rather than it just being a summary of what we had already written about in our experimental procedures and lab notes."

                "Yes! Take this lab because it helps to reinforce a ton of super important ideas and concepts from orgo. After taking both online and in-person lab, I would strongly recommend taking lab in-person if possible. The online experience just isn't the same.",
                "Yes, the professor Christine DiMeglio made it worth it. We love women in STEM, but she took this saying to the next level. I learned more in her class than I have in many of my other pre-med courses here at Yale. She also made online learning enjoyable.",
                "Yes! probably a pre-req but prof dimeglio is great, and the TFs (at least in my experience) are amazing.",
                "Yes if you need it to fulfill your requirements. It's not bad at all, probably better than most chem labs you will take here.",
                "If you have to take it, don't be scared! It's such a chill class, and it's a nice break from all the other kinds of work you have. If you're interested in chemistry, you also just feel a lot better in the lab after taking 223. \r\n\r\nIf you're just interested in working in a lab or to get a half-credit, also go for it. Low workload, it ends 2-3 weeks early, and there are super clear guidelines for doing well.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who want to gain practical lab experience, aim to solidify their organic chemistry knowledge, or want to cultivate general scientific literacy. Taking a laboratory course familiarizes one with the lab setting, the experiments are synced with the curriculum followed in the corresponding organic chemistry lecture, and the course's focus on producing high-quality scientific work (both in the lab and in the post-lab assignments) greatly improves a student's scientific writing and thinking skills. Also, laboratory courses can be highly rewarding, fulfilling, and funI was nervous about working in a lab for the first time, but I adapted within a couple of sections, and I came to love being in the lab.",
                "This class is a great option for students who would like to learn real-world applications of organic chemistry and build a solid foundation in chemistry laboratory techniques. The professors and TAs are incredible and created an overwhelmingly positive experience.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was really fun and well-organized.",
                "I would only recommend this course to pre-med students, chemistry majors, and other students very interested in the sciences. Obviously as a lab, the techniques learned here would only really apply to fields that use laboratory techniques so if you are someone not really considering that as a future career, I think your time would be better invested elsewhere.",
                "If you are premed, a biology major, or a chemistry major, chances are that you are required to take this course anyways. If you are going to work in a chemistry lab sometime soon or in the future, I would highly recommend the course! (It's a very good introduction to doing work in organic chemistry labs). However, if you are not any of these, I probably would not recommend taking this course simply because the assignments can sometimes feel like busy work.",
                "Yes! I think it is great enrichment to further your understanding of the concepts in Organic Chemistry II.",
                "I'd recommend this if you're interested in synthetic chemistry, as you will learn important methods and techniques. If you're a bio student looking for a lab course, this may not be as relevant to your areas of interest.",
                "It's only taken as a pre-req.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student, especially if the course were taught in person!",
                "Likely if you are considering this course, you have to take it, so you should. It's not hard, just a lot of busywork especially since it's a 0.5 credit yet takes more time than a decent number of 1 credits, but luckily it's not hard just busywork.",
                "Yes if required for their major.",
                "if someone needs to take the class, then yes!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a nice complement to my organic chemistry lecture class and taught the organic chemistry lab skills.",
                "Yes, if you need to take lab or simply want to solidify the skills you learned from Orgo I lab",
                "I would recommend this course for any science majors. Even without the lecture, the content stands on its own. Dr. DiMeglio and all the TAs are amazing. The workload can be a bit high for a 0.5 credit course, but it's lighter than 222L. Highly recommend!",
                "No. Dont take it unless you have to.",
                "Yes.  It was a great way to reinforce concepts learned in Orgo II lecture.",
                "if you need it",
                "Only if you are pre-med or a chemistry major. Not because the course is taught poorly because it is totally not, but because the material is not easy. Dr. DiMigelo and Dr. Clark try to make it as engaging and easy as possible, but its still organic chemistry. Take it if you need it.",
                "Yes, this is my favorite lab course that I've taken at Yale. The workload is not as demanding as some previous chemistry courses, but it is just as if not more conducive to learning the content. I also really enjoyed the focus on scientific writing in the cumulative assignments, which I think will transfer well into later coursework and career.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Obviously only take this class if you have to, but Dr. DiMeglio is very kind and it's a good class to take.",
                "Yes, it was pretty fun for a lab and definitely better in person than online.",
                "Absolutely, definitely the best lab I have taken at Yale so far. Great Professor, amazing TA, and just overall a great experience. Mixing chemicals actually turned out to be pretty fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in organic chem. Most people who take this class are premed students, but I found it to be enjoyable. Prof. DiMeglio was great and really accommodating. Because this course is largely taught by teaching fellows, there is not a ton of universality among sections, so having a great TF is really important for your learning and your grade.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys organic chemistry and wants to pursue research in this field.",
                "Yes, especially if you can get Andrew Streit as your TA, but honestly Christine DiMeglio makes this class amazing. Also, many people taking this are pre-med so I'm guessing they have to take it, so I'm gonna instead give advice on how to enjoy yourself, as much as you can in lab. I would choose the Friday section if you can because it really is less stressful when you have the weekend after, makes lab a happier experience. If you have a friend, consider taking the same section (no guarantee you'll be placed in the same section but you can try)  it's more fun when you have friends, or befriend the people next to you. I did both, and we helped each other make TLC solvents and just passed the time more enjoyably. I would also not do the EPs until the day before or morning of, because spreading out the work makes me feel like I'm doing lab the whole week and also when I came into the lab the procedure was fresh in my mind. Once you get the hang of the EPs, it's super chill. Also, don't worry about messing up or feeling slower than your friends. Move at a brisk pace because everybody wants to have a nice afternoon, but don't punish yourself if something bad happens. I once refluxed my reaction flask for a whole hour and it turns out I had the wrong pH so I was actually doing nothing for an hour. Whatever. I called over Dr. DiMeglio and she helped me through it. Maybe others didn't make that big of a mistake but stuff like that happens to everyone :) enjoy yourself and you'll learn a lot by the end.",
                "Yes, take this if you need to!",
                "Do not take unless you are premed or it is required my your major. More busywork than it is worth.",
                "Yes! Organic chemistry lab is infinitely times better than general chemistry lab. The work is just so much more reasonable and way more fun. I never had a day when I dreaded going to a lab. I was always looking forward to it, and the materials given to me were always enough for me to come fully prepared the day of.",
                "Would recommend.  The experience in lab machinery and techniques is priceless, especially if you plan on working in chemistry down the road.",
                "Yes. I thought the lab was very informative and not too much of an addition to the chemistry lecture.",
                "Yes! Chances are, taking this class is a requirement, but it's extremely reasonable, insightful, and super manageable in an otherwise heavy workload schedule.",
                "yes if you are pre med and taking the organic chemistry lecture.",
                "If they need it.",
                "Absolutely. If taking Orgo 2, Orgo 2 lab gives you a new appreciation for the applicability of the mechanisms you are learning in Orgo 2.",
                "100% loved Dr. DiMeglio and it made orgo class easier!!",
                "Pre-med requirement but if you put in effort you'll get an A and it's somewhat enjoyable :)",
                "If you have to take it you should, it's a fairly enjoyable class.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it's a requirement for a major or for pre-med. There are better courses that would be more enriching in my opinion.",
                "Yes! I learned so much in this lab",
                "yes! favorite lab course I've taken at Yale so far",
                "Yes definitely! Personally, I felt that orgo II lab did a better job at teaching concepts than the lecture. The class is much more organized and the experiments are fun! Though do note that your enjoyment and experience in this class will be based on who your TA ends up being. I was fortunate to have a great TA who did not grade fairly and explained concepts really well, however, I know that this is not the case for everyone (grading though is based on the section, not the entire class so having a harsh grader won't kill your grade).",
                "Yes! This class teaches you the necessary techniques for organic chemistry laboratory and is a nice addition to the lecture course.",
                "A great class, but would really only take it if it is required for your major or premed (or another track) only because what you learn isn't really applicable in any contexts besides organic chem lab.",
                "Yes, take this course if you need it as a prerequisite",
                "Yes. It is a great lab to take. The workload is not much compared to gen chem lab. Overall, it was a pretty stress free environment.",
                "Yeah, not for fun, it was online which cant be helped, EPs and LNs are so repetitive and we shouldnt really have this class focus on formatting. Anybody can follow a format, but not anybody can understand GC/MS, more advanced techniques. The course could move a lot faster w/o making it more difficult for students gradewise. Wouldve wanted to see a lot more reactions and techniques rather than focus on hitting on the rubric points for the formatting of a PL.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to gain a basic understanding of the organic lab and techniques used there.",
                "Yes",
                "No - it is stressful and intense.",
                "Overall, being allowed to sit back and watch a 40-minute video of an experiment is much easier, especially when you can double speed through some of the longer heating times, than physically spending 4 hours straight in a lab every week. However, if possible, I still think much more learning happens when you have the option to actually use your hand to pour chemicals and use hot plates. Because I had no other option, this virtual lab was about as good as it gets, but nothing should replace hands-on lab work if you have the chance to get some.",
                "if you must",
                "I would but only in person, only so much lab work can be learned virtually",
                "Yes! I took the first half of orgo lab remotely, and taking the second half in person made me sad about how much I had missed out in the first half by not being there to actually conduct the experiments. Orgo lab is super chill and fun, and the experiments we do were all super cool.",
                "Yes! Fun class and you learn a lot. A lot of the fun factor came from it being an in person class during remote learning though.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about how organic chemistry works in practice. Even virtual, it was very engaging and I had a wonderful time.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning lab techniques relevant to organic chemistry concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn some into chemistry lab techniques. Dr. DiMeglio makes the in-person lab especially fun. The EPs and LNs were largely focused on formatting and little changes and studying for the final exam was much more memorization than chemistry content itself, but overall the lab was enjoyable.",
                "Yes, this course is a great supplement to be taken alongside organic chemistry, and it covers some concepts that are not seen in lecture.",
                "Yes; the laboratory experiments were always super rewarding and the grading was fair.",
                "Yes if you are taking orgo2, you should take the lab as well. It's taught well and it's useful to see how the concepts you are learning in class apply in the lab.",
                "Yes!",
                "No only if you need it for pre-med bud.",
                "I would, as it is required for a chemistry major.",
                "Lab for organic chemistry was a very interesting class, even over zoom, and I wish I could have taken it in person. I would definitely recommend it to another student as long as they wanted to learn more about organic chemistry."
