                "The strength is that it allowed me to learn calculus, and a deeper manner than just one semester Calc one course would do. The only con is that I have to take two semesters, including math, 111 but I think its very useful, since I want to learn calculus, and a deeper way",
                "strengths: on canvas they copied sections of the textbook that we were required to know e.g formulas and example questions which helped so much when making the cheat sheets we could bring into the exam. professor hall was great at responding to answers in the class and genuinely wanted people to understand and feel like they could ask anything in class. practice exams were very helpful\r\n\r\nweakness: pset questions were way harder than the midterm or final exams so it felt a bit discouraging not being able to do the psets when i did well on the exams."
