            "comments": [
                "We get a broad level understanding from various professors who are experts in that particular field. I think the TA sessions were great and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeakness were the homeworks and sometimes the lack of communication between professors. I think the communication is better from what Ive heard students say about previous years but there are a few bits that could be improved. For example, we had a professor switch lecture dates with another (which was fine) but one of them either got the dates wrong when coordinating the change or just got the date wrong and showed up the day of a test. Thats a great way to scare a bunch of students that now tho k theyre in the wrong place for a test worth a good chunk of their grade. And the homeworks just werent good. I like that you could do them until you got 100% but eventually it just seemed like busy work.",
                "Strengths: TA sessions and their exam review sessions, most professors covered the material they were supposed to cover, professors lectured on topics related to their areas of research and had interesting examples from their field\r\nWeaknesses: InQuisitive did not help me learn the material or prepare for exams. The questions didn't cover what was taught in class and were extremely detail-oriented so I spent more time trying to find the specific words in the textbook that the questions were asking for. Overall these assignments were a waste of my time and only added more confusion and stress. At the beginning of the semester, it was unclear that the sections posted on Canvas were learning objectives not the relevant textbook sections. This should have been made clear in the first week. Some of the professors didn't do a good job covering the relevant material. This was the especially the case for the allergy, transplant immunology, and autoimmunity lectures. \r\nThe TAs were kind of disorganized. It took several weeks to get TA sessions running and sometimes it took them a long time to provide feedback or respond to messages.",
                "Enjoyed attending lectures with many different professors who are experts in the field, felt a little disconnected at times and was difficult to follow lectures where professors did not have prepared slides, did not like the multiple choice and true/false section on exams- felt incredibly detailed and random, would have liked homework assignments that resembled exams more closely (ie. not Inquisitive)",
                "The strength is the lecturer series format, as it ensures that an expert in the field is always talking about their area of research. This is also a downside, however, as some lecturers are better than others.",
                "It was really helpful that some of the lectures were recorded. It would be great in the future if professors could have some slides (most did).",
                "The lectures are recorded which is very nice for going back and watching things. Most lectures had powerpoints but some did not, which made it challenging at times to follow because the lecture on the board went too fast or we had to know random facts. It would have been helpful to see practice exams or get better feedback on our answers to questions. The problem sets were nice to practice and a good resource, but written problem sets would have helped to clarify how to answer questions better.",
                "Homework was disaster",
                "Please make the exams shorter. They were too long for only 50 minutes.",
                "The course covers a broad spectrum of topics in immunology, but more unity could be created between lectures since different lecturers cover each topic.",
                "TA sessions were helpful, powerpoints made the presentations go very quickly and was hard to keep up",
                "Homework does not correlate well to the difficulty of exams or the types of questions/content asked about on exams",
                "The strengths are the professors and the TAs. Weaknesses include the Inquisitive homework and the distance to discussion section. The homework often took much longer than necessary, emphasizing details in the textbook that are not relevant to exams. Discussion section should be held closer to campus.",
                "Weakness\r\nThe examinations: the detail demanded of the exams is not appropriate for the examination lengths. In fact, there was an innane amount of detail required that is largely inappropriate for a class that supposedly tests concepts and principles. For example. GATA was not considered a correct answer where as GATA3 was considered correct. Such detail is best assessed on a take-home exam. This is especially true because the classes and exam questions are not standardized but written by many different professors unaware of the specific detail and content in the rest of the classes and exams.",
                "Inquizitive was useless, as it covered way more detail than we were expected to know in class. I did not learn anything useful from the assignments, and would have appreciated something that would have prepared us better.\r\nExam grading was also quite unpredictable. We were told we were only expected to know content covered in lecture, but sometimes we lost points for material that was not covered in lecture. I felt that the exams did not fairly assess our grasp of the material, oftentimes focusing on details that were barely mentioned.\r\nThe course was a bit disjointed by nature, since there were so many different lecturers.",
                "Course was not well organized and there was a huge discrepancy in what the lecturers put in their talk vs what was expected of us on the exam\r\nThe TAs did a great job at telling us what we needed to know before the exams",
                "Strengths: Content, very helpful for gaining an overview of the field, TA session is great\r\nWeakness: exams can be more friendly",
                "Many teachers are involved in teaching. They cooperate very well so they are no gap or overlap between courses.",
                "Strengths--excellent professors, leaders in the field of immunobiology; overall the class was well done given that it is incredibly complex and ever expanding field; however...\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--lecture delivery, often rushed leaving students with a plethora of minute details that failed to be contextualized in the broader picture of immunity...I understand that it is a complex series of topics; however, rambling off the alphabet soup of signaling molecules is not very productive\r\n\r\nImprovement--1. get rid of 'in quizitive', 2. have professors meet to discuss modules of immunity, rather than just providing them with a topic (that is remove redundancies to make more time for useful material), and 3. give students more time to take the exams...50 minutes and we were asked to answer 7 open-ended questions on the final...plus multiple choice...plus true/false; there was simply not enough time to convey knowledge of these complex subjects in the amount of time we were given",
                "The lectures are recorded and can be rewatched.",
