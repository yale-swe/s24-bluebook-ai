                "I learned how to visualize compounds and molecules and manipulate them in my mind, but also I learned that I am a very visual learner and how to incorporate models effectively into my learning. I learned how to problem-solve like a chemist and break down a question into multiple parts to make it more approachable. I also learned how to digest a very large amount of information in a short period of time and ask for help when I needed it.",

                "The course had a very good ratio of synchronous to synchronous activities. The recoreded lectures allowed for a lot of flexibilty and freedom. The numerous live problem solving sessions and office hours allowed for a lot of interaction and conversation that reinforced the material. Out of all the zoom classes I've had to take so far, this was one of the best run and most engaging.",
                "The prof is very involved and gives in-depth lectures. The exams are very difficult, but as is to be expected.",
                "N/A",
                "This course is very well structured and very fair. The grading policy takes pressure off the first two exams, which is nice especially when exams are in a new format and we were learning over zoom. The modules organized the material really well and everything was super accessible. I appreciated the review sheets that were posted for every chapter, the posted lecture slides, and \"study sheets\" sometimes present at the end of lecture slides.",
                "This course was extremely organized and there was a tremendous amount of support available. Even though it was online, it was very streamlined. The information was very effectively relayed and the problem-solving sessions were challenging, but it was very beneficial to meet others in the class and be able to talk through harder problems and solve them together. The exams were very doable - as long as you studied and understood the material, they were very reasonable. They did not try to unfairly trick you at all. This was a great course.",
                "Strengths: very well structured\r\n                    Dr. DiMeglio's speedy replies via emails are very helpful, as well as her feedback she sends via email after each exams is very encouraging\r\n                    The idea of having a problem solving session despite via Zoom really helps us learn the content\r\n\r\nWeakness: Although the problem sessions as a whole are very helpful, they could be a bit rushed sometimes. Posting answer keys for each problems encountered during the sessions could be helpful.",
                "The strengths were the notes provided and the short length of the class. The weakness was the short length of the class as well. This is the kind of class where if you get lost for a chapter or two, it kind of snowballs after if you don't catch up quickly. Organic chemistry isn't easy by any means. For some people they just get it and for others, they don't. There was really no handholding in the class because of the short time frame. Office hours were available but the course material sometimes felt overwhelming to the point where you don't even know what to ask. This probably has less to do with the setup of the class itself and more to do with the course material and the timespan it is put in.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course! Take orgo over the summer! I was hesitant to take it at first, but it is well organized over the summer and Professor DiMeglio is just amazing. It is also a smaller group than normal large lectures, which made it feel more approachable. Just keep up to date on the work and you will be totally fine. Grading was fair, it wasn't too much work, and there was a lot of support if you needed it.",
                "If you have to take organic chem as a requirement (or want to take it), DEFINITELY take it over the summer and take it with Dr. DiMeglio. I can't stress this enough. She is incredible. She works endlessly to make sure everyone understands the concepts, her videos are succinct and break down the concepts so that they actually make sense, and she is very receptive and helpful during office hours. She cares about her students and understands the demands of the course, especially during the summer, and does everything to make sure that it is a smooth course for all of the students. Be prepared to work really hard if you want to do well, but it is very worth it. I didn't like chemistry coming into this course and left having really enjoyed orgo, in large part because of the way it was taught.",
