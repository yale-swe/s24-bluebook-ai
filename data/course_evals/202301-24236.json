I would have appreciated some more student input on the syllabus perhaps, especially since many of our texts were relatively obscure. I did enjoy how we had the freedom to guide in-class discussion based on our interest.",

Although some weeks the class discussions could have been more engaging, and I assume the reason might have been the insufficient secondary materials we had to analyzing the films and literature."
