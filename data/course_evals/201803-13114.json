    "Learned how to be a better close-reader, gained a new appreciation for poetry, strengthened my essay writing skills",
    "I read a lot of great poetry (the course covers Chaucer to Milton). I also improved my writing skills, and became better at articulating my ideas in discussion.",
    "I developed more skills at close-reading in poetry, analyzing both content and delivery. I gained a working knowledge of Middle English syntax and pronunciation, and a strong familiarity with some of the great poets of the early English Language.",
    "I was exposed to important works of the English poetic canon, and I learned how to analyze poetic texts.",
    "My essay-writing skills definitely improved, and I learned how to engage with poetry with more confidence.",
    "I learned how to analyze poetry. In AP Literature, we tried to learn, during my senior year but we didn't really retain any valuable information. I  learned what I should have learned 2 years ago.",
    "I cant be sure about English skills. Theyre too ephemeral. We learned all we could of Chaucer, Donne, Shakespeare and Milton. We argued in horrid essay form about turgid analyses of beautiful poetry. It was a valuable experience, Im glad I had it, and I would not want it again. I must hedge my words though: Im the farthest possible thing from an English major.",
    "I developed a better understanding of critical analysis and how to present my arguments in a stronger, clearer way.",
    "I developed the ability to close read and write clearly. I developed the skill of looking at a work and developing a claim about it.",
    "I gained close reading analysis skills and writing skills through essays and in class discussions"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n-high focus on close reading\r\n-not too much work\r\n-lots of freedom when writing essays\r\n-exposure to great works of poetry \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-not as much discussion about the actual writing process",
    "The material of the course is awesome. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Donne, and Milton are especially great to read. To improve the course, I would recommend that more time is spent on Shakespeare and Donne and less time is spent on Spenser\/Wyatt\/Howard\/Sidney\/Wroth.",
    "The course is very interesting and does a good job of focusing on those writers that most deserve focus. I would've liked a few more class periods with John Donne and maybe a few less with Sidney or Spenser's sonnets.",
    "Strengths: Our analyses of poetic texts were both in depth and extensive\r\nWeaknesses: It would be helpful if we put some time aside to talk about writing",
    "I think that the course was a good survey of classic English works. I think it would help to maybe include works that are lesser known or that were influenced by the classic works we read.",
    "This class is for students who already know most of the information but want to know more, not for students who are trying to just learn in general. The class is so hierarchical, and it's very annoying and discouraging.",
    "I dont like essays about nitpicked topics, but thats just me.",
    "I really loved the course.",
    "I loved the group discussion of the course. I appreciated how the discussions were relatable to our essays and how they enhanced my understanding of the texts."

   "comments": [
    "To satisfy a foundational requirement, I would recommend taking this course, at least with Prof. Saraceni. More interesting than I thought. One should definitely be exposed to these works as an English major.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in poetry. The course covers some of the great poetry of Western civilization (Chaucer to Milton). The workload is a fair amount of reading each classusually either many sonnets or about 50 pages of dense, challenging longer poems (The Canterbury Tales, The Fairie Queene, or Paradise Lost). There is an essay every 2-3 weeks. The class is definitely worth the time, though; the poetry is incredible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially for someone who, like me, is not as familiar with analyzing poetry. This class made me appreciate poetry far more than I did before, and I enjoyed myself along the way.",
    "Yes - I learned a lot about the complexities of poetic tools and strategies",
    "I would recommend this course because I think it helps hone fundamental skills that are necessary to succeed in the English major.",
    "Yes, but please be go in to the class with the mindset of learning for the sake of learning, learning for oneself. Otherwise, It becomes very easy to get lost in how behind you may feel. Despite the side eye looks that you may receive for not having researched all of the English writers mentioned and memorizing their entire body of work before you were 12, ask your questions anyway (no matter how stupid they seem). Immerse yourself into the works of these insanely white authors as if no pompous student is watching.",
    "Do they like poetry made from English the same way a delicate wrought iron flower is made of steel? If so, sure.",
    "Definitely, I developed a greater appreciation for poetry and developing my arguments.",
    "Yes. I loved the subject matter of the course and enjoyed the texts.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students interested in middle English poetry"
