    "I learned about the nature and means of democratization across sub-Saharan Africa. I also developed a better understanding of public policymaking in the region.",
    "I learned to take a deep dive on party politics - including the positioning of independents, who are common in African politics - to more accurately evaluate national decision-making in Africa. We got a wide variety of information on the aspects of party approach to elections - most strikingly competence vs. valence issues and when those come to the fore. I think the most important thing I learned in the class was how important even a rough study of party politics is to understanding a country, even if the parties don't necessarily differ that much politically. It seems like an intuitive point but much of the study of African countries manages to elide an examination of parties and I learned to seek out the literature that didn't."

    "The readings and topics chosen for discussion were always great. I wouldn't change much about the course, I think that it worked very well as it was done.",
    "I think the final paper was an excellent idea; forcing students to examine a number of policy areas in one country helped me think in breadth and depth and more importantly forced me to examine in detail a field of policy in which I'd had no particular interest previously (agriculture). The overall country study summary was useful in the same way.\r\n\r\nPapers should be due at 11:59pm as is common practice.\r\n\r\nThe mid-term essay was far too broad in scope. I think an individual country study for said prompt is more appropriate because one can bring up endless counter-examples in arguing whether elections have helped voters hold leaders to account across Africa. Furthermore, the political summary already primed students to deeply investigate one country; the syllabus would therefore have already accorded a student some familiarity with the research necessary. A country will have fewer counter-examples and because of the limited scope and more unified historical context a student can give a coherent, firm answer to the prompt with greater confidence."

    "Yes! Professor Seekings is wonderful and all of the topics studied in class were very interesting.",
    "Yes. The breadth of policy covered here is extremely useful and sticks to laws that generally matter to Africans, not just policy wonks. Prof. Seekings' emphasis on deep examination of party politics is also a vital thematic focus for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of African politics."
