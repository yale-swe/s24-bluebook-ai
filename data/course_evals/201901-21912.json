    "I learned so much Chinese. It is kind of crazy how much students learn in the span of a single semester.",

    "Learnt over 500 characters and how to converse and read basic Chinese.",
    "I learned how to speak survival Chinese very well. This means if I get lost in China, I would be able to find my way home.",

    "I learned how to read, write, speak and understand Chinese.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course is how engaging each class was, the daily classes reinforce studying for Chinese often so it forces one to study constantly, and the small size of the class really helps getting a personalized lesson every class. The only weakness is how quickly the course can go sometimes it is difficult to catch up if you miss a class.",
    "Strengths: teachers are very helpful and the class is structured very well \r\nWeaknesses: super high workload",
    "This course is very effective in teaching Chinese. The constant homework, quizzes, and tests make for a tough but effective learning environment.",
    "Some of the strengths of the course include the small class size that is conducive to a warm, friendly, and open class environment, the passionate professor in Shen Laoshi, and how she teaches the course material.",
    "While this course is certainly challenging, I thought it was an overall good course.  The textbook that we used was really great and provided us with useful content to study.",
    "Much better grade transparency--using Canvas would be a huge plus."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are passionate for learning this language and are willing to put in the work to continue building on the skills from Chinese 110 then take this class.",
    "If you are interested in the language, then yes! Dont just take it for a language credit!",
    "I would if the student really wants to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to take Chinese. I believe the Chinese department here is pristine and all of the professors care, and are passionate about their work and their students. The small class size is another motivation as it allows you to really get to know both your instructor and your classmates in a fun but challenging environment.",
    "Yes, I would if you are interested in a challenging language course.  Chinese is definitely a tough language to learn and not for the faint of heart, but it is very rewarding to see all of your hard work pay off.",
    "Yes! The class really is set up for you to learn Chinese, it's just very difficult keeping up."
