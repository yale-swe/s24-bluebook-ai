                "This is like Med School in a nut shell. Learned about all the possible big diseases of lungs, heart, GI Tract, Brain, Kidneys and about cancer in relation to all of these. Learned about the body's responses to injury on a molecular level.",
                "Great course for developing both the critical thinking of a clinician/pathologist as well as broadening one's understanding of the possible origins and expression of diseases.",
                "I learned a good survey of pathology ranging from cancer to gastrointestinal diseases.",
                "I became more familiar with the general pathology of many different diseases and learned how to approach diagnostics.",

What tools and symptoms doctors use to diagnose disease before and after death. Real case discussions and the opportunity to observe autopsies, organ presentations, tumor boards.",

                "The 5 blocks was nice because it allowed you to engage with a  topic without fearing it would slip your memory before the exam.  There is a LOT of info covered in the lectures which makes it kind of difficult to hone in on for the exams.  However, the professors made the tests very fair for the most part and told us what we should focus on.",
                "Strengths: organized into 5 blocks, each with different topics and instructors. Made studying super easy because each exam only covered 4-5 lectures at a time. Instructors were also different for every block, which brought a fresh start 5 times in the semester and kept me engaged and motivated. Focus is always on the big picture, not small details, which helped me stay engaged and just focus on how fun it is to learn the content instead of worrying about details that might be on the exam.\r\nAlso gave us the opportunity to observe autopsies and Tumor Boards of the Yale Med School which was a great opportunity.",
                "I think creating more standardization between tests and grading would greatly improve the course since it was quite difficult to improve on future exams when you have a completely different testing format.",
                "I think the team did a great job with teaching and presentation of material, though maybe the structure could be more streamlined across professors.",
                "The course is most challenging because the professors and exam styles are all very different. Each midterm felt like a bit of a surprise. However, the TFs did a fabulous job helping us transition between units. The material was interesting overall and assumed a reasonable amount of prior knowledge.",
                "I loved getting the opportunity to see autopsies. I think it was a great way to engage with the topic and very helpful as a pre-med.",
                "One strength was the engagement for most professors in the course, being highly engaged with the class. The last section of the course exemplified this well.",
                "Strengths  - good structure, 4 non-cumulative in-class exams that cover specific blocks, and a final take-home, open-resource exam. Professors very knowledgeable in their respective fields and encourage questions/participation in lecture. Learn tools, symptoms, and findings that docs use to diagnose and treat disease; opportunity to observe autopsies, organ presentations, tumor boards\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- few! some modules had just a little too much material to make the lectures not feel so rushed. exams varied in difficulty",
                "The course content is very interesting. However, the course moves quickly and the exams are difficult and very different from each other.",
                "Some of the lecturers went so fast through the content that I didn't have time to absorb it all, but it was really valuable being able to learn from so many professors in one course.",
                "strengths: covered a variety of different topics and systems, an effective overview, I appreciated that the lectures were recorded this year especially when COVID/other illnesses became an issue a month into the semester\r\n\r\nweakness: mixed bag of professors - not all of them were as engaging as others"

                "yes, it was such a cool course, really liked the block structure and more frequent exams rather than large cumulative tests and a final",
                "Yes, especially if you plan on going to med school. This course covers a lot of material that you'll have to learn eventually, and the autopsy shadowing was excellent and very useful. The content connects well to MCDB core courses, without being repetitive because there is more of a focus on histology and clinical presentation as opposed to molecular mechanisms. Overall this is a solid MCDB elective, although it is a shame it isn't a higher level so that it would be more applicable to the major.",
