                "A thorough understanding of environmental injustices in the South Asian context (that was quite applicable to issues outside the region as well). I really appreciated the anthropological lens we used to consider environmental and social issues in a wide range of settings (from forests to glaciers to cities).",
                "an overview of the various environmental justice problems facing South Asia and the various modes of discourse used to discuss them, a better understanding of what anthropological work looks like",
                "I learned a tremendous deal about anthropological literature and research and found the course was a great way to expand my ability to express myself in discussion.",
                "I learned a ton about environmental justice in general, as well as specifics about issues in South Asia. This was also the first anthropology course I've taken at Yale and I felt I got a good understanding for how the subject works, and how anthropology research is conducted.",
                "The readings for class are fantastic. My thinking on conservation, forestry, environmental justice, and more has been challenged and developed in this class. Professor Shivi is also great!",
                "Reshapes my perspective on environmentalism globally and developed my knowledge of South Asia's environmental ideology and implementation",
                "I learned how to critically evaluate lengthy course material (one book per week) and draw comparisons between them, identifying main themes that prevailed across each reading assignment.",
                "I learnt about how dynamic anthropology is as a field of study and ended up adding it as my double major halfway through the semester despite being a junior. This class demands nuance and an uncomfortable amount of unlearning. It truly altered the way I think about a number of things like community, citizenship, development and human-animal relations. I couldnt recommend this class more.",
                "I learned a massive amount about Environmental Justice in India, a topic I knew almost nothing about. Lot of useful lessons and facts to apply to other areas of study for environmental issues.",
                "Lots of knowledge on South Asia, and how those issues relate to the rest of the world",
                "Much about South Asian environmental (in)justice, particularly in rural areas. Resource conflicts, colonial legacies, state making, liberalization ans globalization, class caste religious and gender discrimination within environmentalism; environmentalism from below",
                "Learned from a variety of different scholars about environmental injustice in South Asia, but mostly looking at India. Learned from an anthropology perspective.",
                "Greater Knowledge of South Asia, processes of globalization, sustainability solutions in different areas (rural v. urban etc.)",
                "Every week, Professor Shivi totally changed my perspective/opened my mind to new possibilities with a different topic. The course was very accessible to students with little background knowledge of South Asia or environmental justice topics. Through this course, I became a better writer and became much more attentive to the fact that environmental solutions are never black/white.",
                "I learned very much while taking this course, primarily about social justice and environmental issues in South Asia (India in particular), of course, but also about equality and issues in injustice on the whole. I also feel my reading and writing skills alike improved.",
                "I learned about a wide range of environmental justice topics in the Indian subcontinent, from animal conservation to air pollution to Indigenous forest rights to rights to clean water. This was my first exposure to South Asia in class, and I gained a much stronger understanding in the biological, sociocultural, and geographical diversity of India. The class also pushed us to think critically about the role of the state, private companies, environmental NGOs, and politicians in their advocacy for sustainability, and to recognize the political and economic motivations behind these messages."

            "comments": [
                "I thought the readings were very well-chosen and interesting, and the class structure of discussion posts, brief lecture, discussant and respondent, and class discussion worked very well. However, I think more mandatory guidance in the final project would have been helpful, such as requiring students to meet with the instructor and discuss their sources and argument a few weeks before the end of term.",
                "I thought this course was strong, featured engaging material, and had great context from the professor and TF. One weakness is that students sometimes create an echo chamber; the professor could maybe do more to ensure there's debate between students and some more exchange of ideas.",
                "I loved the books we read, I thought they provided really strong backgrounds for the in-class discussions. I also enjoyed the short lectures at the beginning of every class and felt they contributed lots of important information. The weekly discussion posts were very manageable and I enjoyed reading what my classmates wrote. I think this seminar was a little big, and maybe could have been capped at a lower number. But, I did enjoy hearing so many different perspectives each week, and thought discussions were still facilitated well, even with it being so large.",
                "Strengths: great readings, Professor Shivi is great, and interesting discussions. The only weakness would be that the class was a bit large and so deep and mutually interacting discussions were hard to come by.",
                "I enjoyed the conversational nature of this seminar. Class was never boring to me as there were constantly new opinions and perspectives being shared by peers. I do think one thing that could be improved upon is the length of reading assignments each week. Assigning roughly 1 book per week (or at least several hundred pages) inevitably led to a struggle to finish the full assignment prior to class each week. I think that perhaps assigning less pages each week would help students better master a texts contents.",
                "Strengths: Shivi! Hes an incredibly talented and accomplished academic who is also deceptively down to earth. It was lovely having him ground and enrich our discussions. Shalini (our TA) was also a lovely addition to the class, she was very supportive and pushed us to think outside the box often. The readings were diverse and thought-provoking. They were a great look into the power of ethnographic research and writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were quite a lot, this has been mentioned in past years and im fairly certain that Shivi has worked to adapt the readings over time. The class was pretty large in part because Shivi was kind enough to allow everyone interested to take the class, but it also did take away the seminar feeling from time to time.",
                "Very in-depth discussion of India, but practically zero attention was paid to other countries in Southeast Asia even though the course title suggested it. Could be corrected by fixing misleading course title.",
                "Lots of reading beware. But great discussions in seminar style",
                "Strengths: excellent readings every week, really transformative and illuminating content and analysis; great instructional support\r\nWeaknesses: reading was a lot (one book a week/160 pgs) and not enough focus on urban environments (in my opinion)",
                "Strengths: liked the structure of each course. We started with questions from the pervious seminar, then did a short lecture, then student presentations, then discussion.  Felt like it broke down the 2 hr class and felt really engaging.  \r\nWeaknesses: class went over by 10 min every period, and we were made aware that this would happen at the beginning which was good, but it often felt like the whole class was losing focus by the end.",
                "Strengths: Readings!! All the readings in this course were phenomenal, helpful and enlightening",
                "Strengths: Readings were well-chosen; half-lecture-half-discussion style of the course worked well; Professor Shivi carefully guided discussions without monopolizing them; Professor Shivi was incredibly accommodating and clearly cares about his students (learned all our names by the second week and actively engaged with our ideas in discussion posts/discussions) \r\n\r\nAreas for improvement: Readings could have been trimmed at times; Course grade breakdown might be shifted to place more emphasis on discussion posts/participation to avoid such a heavy emphasis on final project",
                "The strengths of this course are manifold. For one, Shivi is a fantastic professor who is clearly an expert in his field. Though this comes through in class, hes far from heavy-handed, and rather takes a back seat to allow student-dominated discussions, which I really appreciated. Still, his knowledge of his field is obvious and manifests through the fascinating and compelling readings he assigns. Shalini, our TF, was also wonderful, clearly informed and supportive herself. As I mentioned, the readings were excellently chosen, and in-class discussions were thought-provoking and very effectiveit was one of those classes at Yale where I came away really appreciating the insights of my peers (and unfortunately, those classes are more rare then one might think). The one weakness of the class, Id say, was its size. Though a seminar, it was certainly on the larger side, which made it harder to participate in discussions. I think that a 10 to 15-person class, on the other hand, would have been wonderful.",
                "Strengths: covered a lot of ground throughout the semester, good discussions, very interesting material. Weaknesses: heavy reading load every week, sometimes the lecturing can be a bit dull or difficult to connect to the class readings"

                "Yes, one of my favorite classes Ive taken at yale. Shivi is such an amazing Professor, and Shalini an amazing TA, and they both expanded my conception of environmental justice. The reading are all very good. They are long, but so interesting.",

                "I would certainly recommend this course, whether or not youre interested in either anthropology or social justice or South Asia. I went into this course having never taken an anthropology course and knowing nothing about South Asia and I feel I learned so much about those topics. Though I took this class for my major (EVST), I would recommend it for any student at Yale. That said, I think if you really want to get out of this course all that there is to offer, you must be willing to put the time in to readings and the like.",
                "Yes! This is a must-take class for anyone with an interest in environmental justice. EJ has its roots in South Asia through the Chipko movement and through the environmentalism of the poor, so it is so important to have a good understanding of these topics. You learn about agrarian/forest issues to urban issues and go from local problems to national agendas to global implications. This perspective on the sustainable development/justice challenges of the Global South is a rare find at Yale."
