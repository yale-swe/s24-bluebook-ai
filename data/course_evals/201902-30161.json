    "I developed an understanding of the writer's world. How to read for craft; how to think about feelings about certain situations in a piece written by others.",
    "My writing skills greatly improived during this course. I received excellent feedback that showed me where I needed to improve and gave me suggestions to get there.",

    "I learned to analyze texts, especially focusing on the purpose and tone of the text as well drastically improved my writing.",

    "readings that inspire creative style, deep discussions, revisions of self and peers. Great feedback.",
    "Dean Hill is a great professor and created a wonderful learning environment. Feedback was detailed and given promptly.",
    "I think the number of readings we had was a little high since we never got through all of them. I loved the in class discussions though and appreciated the insight given back to us on essays. \r\n\r\nSo, less essays to read and continued feedback and classroom discussions.",
    "I think the variety of essays we read and discuss in class as well as the ability to submit a first draft and get feedback on one essay, perhaps the tprompt we find hardest are strengths of the course.",
    "I honestly thought it was perfect. I wish we could take online classes during the semester.",
    "I wish we could have had more iterations for each writing assignment. I'm not sure how much more lenient the professor was due to our having less time for each paper compared to students taking the class during the school year. I also wish that we had some more recommended books for formal writing technique, but I acknowledge that each person has their own style. I remember the professor mentioning that we should learn by mimicry and examples since we're novices, so in that regard I wish we had more recommended readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this was a very good writing credit. I have not taken a lot of essay focused classes and this greatly broadened my abilities and perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she has an interest in learning to read and write as a non-fiction writer.",
    "If you want to become a better writer, regardless of discipline, take this course.",
    "Definitely. It was well taught and online sessions went smoothly.",
    "Yes! I loved this course and the flexibility in the topic you chose to write about it essential. I also think looking at different writing styles in each unit is very helpful to give an idea of what a humour piece looks like for instance. Both the professor and teaching assistant were very helpful and willing to meet, which I was grateful for.",
    "Absolutely, I loved the course material and felt like I was able to learn a lot about writing.",
    "I think taking it during the summer is a good idea, because you get to focus all of your thoughts outside of work on the writing assignments, which are long but very manageable. \r\nIn general, I recommend English 120 to anyone who wants to get better at writing. You'll also gain more confidence in your writing techniques after dismantling the techniques of other, more accomplished writers."
