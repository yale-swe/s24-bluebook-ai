                "Strengths: Very strong emphasis on speaking and reading comprehension. I believe that I have advanced much further in speaking than I thought, and while the course demands a lot of time outside of class, there is a reason for it, and it helps facilitate my learning in class. I am very glad each assignment is only worth a small amount of points, so we didn't have to worry about making many mistakes. \r\nWeakness: If you are not used to a lot of work in a class, then do prepare yourself. There is a lot of homework that is graded, and much of it won't be perfect. Also try to learn teamwork, because that is essential for the final project.",
                "Canvas is a little confusing but grading was fair",
                "Only speaking in Chinese forces students to improve their listening comprehension and speaking skills. The graded homework reinforces students' understanding of grammar patterns and sentence structure, as well as reading comprehension and vocabulary.",

                "Yes, this course was great! Even though I sometimes doubted I was good enough, my professor Wang Lao Shi was kind and gave everyone fair and generous grades. She was always happy to help and we could come just to even talk about anything. Although for some it might be just a fulfillment of the Language requirement, I think this course taught me not only a lot about Chinese language and Culture, but what it means to work hard, to persevere, to succeed, and that a 12\/60 is not actually a failure; its a stepping stone to learning.",
                "I would highly recommend this to anyone that actually wants to learn Chinese, and is willing to spend some time doing it. This course is not an easy one, but if you actually put some effort into it, you're sure to see good results.",
                "Do your homework well because that will make up a lot of your grade in the end",
                "I would recommend this course any student interested in Chinese for any reason. You will adjust and improve, even if the beginning is difficult.",
                "I would. Although it was a bit difficult, the skills I developed were well worth it"
