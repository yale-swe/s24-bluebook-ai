                "I learned about the history, both general and cinematic, of Southeast Asia, a region so often underrepresented in academia. I improved my ability to critically analyze the formal elements of films as well as how to situate them within their political and cultural context.",
                "A better understanding of film and the complexities of both making and watching one. Writing analytically. Outlining and examining different themes in Southeast Asian cinema like urbanity, temporality, tradition vs. modernity, etc.",
                "I gained so much more knowledge about SEA history, cinema, and people through Prof. Nguyen's instruction but also from my classmates thanks to how Prof. Nguyen structured her class.",
                "I learned so much about the different ways people have experienced the construct that is Southeast Asia, whether it was their experience living there, existing within diasporic spaces, or encountering it as a complete outsider. Through our weekly discussions, I have also learned to talk about film techniques."

                "This course was generally excellent. there were a few assignments that were tricky to understand, but the films were all excellent and the course facilitated discussion very well.",
                "I have little to add. The syllabus included a good variety of interesting films and I enjoyed how they were grouped by region with a corresponding theme. The structure of class was also very engaging in the way it was divided by lecture and student-led presentations. The workload was also manageable while still engaging enough to learn a lot.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of this course and how it gave an opportunity for students to present on films of their suggestions. Because of Prof. Nguyen and the class' structure, I felt that we built our own community through this course.",
                "Strengths: Very useful and relevant weekly themes relating to the films that have to be watched. The discussions that took place were also incredibly engaging and insightful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps the main problem with this class is that a lot of readings we are presented with look at SEA cinema from a foreign, western lens. It would be a lot more interesting to have been able to read more academic work from locals with more direct, immediate experience with SEA and SEA films."

                "I would recommend this course. The films we watched were all of great quality and the exposure to such an underappreciated film tradition was priceless.",
                "Yes! It was very interesting to see a unique syllabus of films, especially as I've never seen anything like the cinemas of Southeast Asia. I feel like I was able to better understand not only the film aspects of class but also more of the subtleties of Southeast Asia's various cultures and topics/issues filmmakers have been trying to explore. I feel like this class has really opened my eyes to the importance of film as a medium that can be applicable to so many other areas of my work.",
                "Yes, yes, yes. Especially if you are Southeast Asian. You are just able to learn so much about the countries in SEA and meet so many other Southeast Asians. I hope this remains true in the future. Also would highly suggest it if Prof. Nguyen is teaching it. Don't know how it would be having another professor fill in.",
                "Yes! I have never taken a film class before, but Professor Nguyen was very helpful in introducing film terms that were unfamiliar to us. The movies were all very interesting and the readings helped broaden your understanding of the movie and helped you realize its significance too.",
                "Yes! The films are great. The discussions are very insightful. If you have any interest in Southeast Asia or films outside of Hollywood, this is the class to take."
