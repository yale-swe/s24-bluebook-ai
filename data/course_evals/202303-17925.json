                "This was my absolute favorite class this semester! I learned so much about development, and it was a great addition to my psychology major at Yale. It provides a lot of insight into developmental research (while also incorporating the history of studies within the field).",
                "This course provided a great overview of the field of developmental psychology, drawing on studies from a diversity of sub fields to provide a complete picture of all that this field has to offer.",
                "I learned immensely about development and how amazing children are. I came in thinking I knew most of what there was to know about child development, but this course opened my mind to so much more in the field.",
                "Interesting info but hard to memorize for exam",
                "I learnt more about how children develop and the various theories and experiments within the field of developmental science.",

                "I learned about the most important theories of developmental psychology and the empirical studies that support or contradict these theories.",
                "I learned how psychological notions and processes exhibited in adulthood develop and change from childhood to adolesence. The course equipped me with knowledge about various theories, hypotheses, and research findings related to the development of fundamental psychological concepts, such as  personality and cognition. This course enhanced my critical thinking and analytical skills, and deepened my appreciation for the complex processes involved in the development of psychological phenomena from childhood to adulthood.",
                "Learned all about developmental psychology, from very granular neurological nuances to broader philosophical debates in the field. This course teaches you why we are the way we are, and answers questions that you subconsciously wonder about but don't fully understand. You learn what makes a 'good' study (not necessarily conclusive/accurate results) and how to use studies to advance your thinking."

                "Strengths was the content in lectures was very interesting and I loved learning about the everyday applications. The professor also knew his stuff very well. Weaknesses was that I didn't feel incentivized to read the textbook or even go to class (although I did) because the only assignments were two tests. Although these tests were very reasonable.",
                "Keil is too old to teach",
                "Strengths: this course tied concepts together throughout the semester, allowing for intermittent review\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weekly summaries did not provide the best way for me to synthesize my knowledge, a more discussion-based approach with a larger character allowance would have been better",
                "I enjoyed lecture and the readings, though at times it felt like we were taking in an immense amount of information during lecture.",
                "Exam formats was really hard. But interesting concepts",
                "Strengths: I think Prof Keil is a great lecturer and there's a lot of content to be learnt.",
                "I liked the weekly summaries and the exams were scary but ultimately not too bad.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Keil and Aaron were both great and so knowledgeable. They give you everything you need to succeed in the course. I really liked the exam format (get a list of ~35 essay questions to study, 5 of which appear on the exam), which essentially meant that if you studied well, there was no reason you wouldn't do well. It also made me feel like I knew that I was studying all of the important things, instead of getting lost in minutia.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the potential exam questions were super convoluted and badly worded, and made studying quite challenging and ridiculously time consuming."

                "Yes I would. While content-heavy, I think there was a lot of interesting insights I gained about the mind of a child.",
                "A crucial class to take if you want to understand the mind -- how do minds come to be the way they are? Are there many constraints or few? How does the environment shape aspects of ourselves? Is development stagelike or continuous? And so on... The professor is outstanding, though unfortunately has Parkinson's and will be retiring soon. His passion for developmental psychology is contagious. Generous grading, though you do need to study well for the exams.",

This course explores various theories and research methodologies related to the manifestation and evolution of psychological processes and examines their complexities across different early life stages.",
