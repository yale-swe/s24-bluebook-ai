The main things I learned were how to analyze the response of second-order circuits (circuits with two storage elements) in the time domain, how to estimate/construct how a Bode plot of a circuit will look without using software to plot it, and how to solve second-order circuits more easily by converting them and their sources to the frequency domain using the Laplace and Fourier transforms. I learned almost solely by teaching myself using the textbook. We also learned a bit about basic filters, mostly a review from EENG 200. In the lab we learned almost nothing, since all we had to do was take screenshots of the oscilloscope and Scopy for the lab reports. We did learn the basics of using Multisim.",

                "The lectures for this course were clearly well rehearsed and were very understandable besides their lightning fast pace. The 50 minute time slot of the lectures warranted the speed at which they were delivered, but nonetheless the course was often difficult to follow due to its speed.",
                "Awesome class, professor Tang is an amazing lecturer.",
                "The lectures should include more discussion over practical applications of circuit design, not just theory.",
                "The labs were the best part of this course. Keep the soldering labs; they were the highlight of the semester and of my engineering classes so far.",
                "Just learn math and not intuition",
                "Some strengths are the note summaries that Tang provide they were critical for me when it came time to study. A weakness is that sometimes Tang moved quite quickly and we had to ask him to repeat or slow down",
                "It would be nice if there are lecture slides.",
                "Bringing in hands-on lab projects literally with the last couple of labs made the class significantly more interesting. Less math and more practical application would probably serve every student well.",
                "Strengths were interesting course material, weakness was a bit of lack of clearness about exams.",
                "Lectures were unclear but material is important",
                "I feel like the labs could have built on what we were learning in class a little better and could have been more useful to us.",
                "This was the worst class I've taken at Yale, with EENG 202 being a close second-worst. The teaching is terrible, Prof Tang clearly didn't want to teach and just scribbled all his notes on the board expecting us to understand them, while maybe one or two people really did. The course should be completely restructured so that there are slides for each lesson, or something similar. I had to learn everything by just reading the textbook, I don't even know why I bothered going to lecture. Tang's lectures were way too fast, and it was shocking that he seemed surprised when people told him they had no idea what was going on in class. So yeah: make slides, with neater examples, explanations, and diagrams. Also in class, definitely go slower and pause often for questions. And the main issue I had with the course is that it assumed students could somehow just grasp concepts like conversion to frequency domain and Fourier series without explanation. We learned how to do the math and the equations, but I have NO clue where all of said math and equations comes from. And that's sad.",
                "The lectures/examples are lifted straight from the textbook without much context so you will often leave class confused and have to spend several hours after class to catch up using the textbook. However, the labs are well developed and provide an excellent environment to see how the theoretical content works in the real world. The weekly problem sets are also not very representative of the types of problems you will cover in class, so I would highly recommend working in study groups to minimize the amount of time you are spending on the weekly psets."

But the teaching is terrible, and you'll come out of the course with a ton of questions about what's actually going on with frequency domain and Fourier decomposition of signals. It's almost impossible to do this course without teaching yourself from the textbook. The one plus was that (most of) the homeworks were fairly straightforward, and the labs were easy with basically no lab reports. (Labs are weekly). A few of the homeworks were really thick and actually took way longer than the others, so beware of that. And beware of the answers in the back of the textbook being wrong sometimes. Labs are very boring except maybe the last two, but you don't actually learn anything in the last two except how to solder.",
