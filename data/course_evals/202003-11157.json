                "The material presented in class prepares you really well for the homework problems and exams. The material is not easy but there aren't too many surprises. Prof. Qiu did a really good job of navigating the virtual format with the use of an iPad for deriving equations and working through examples.",
                "I feel like a lot of the lecture could've been covered much more quickly using the book. A lot of the days where we just went over examples could've more focused on pulling apart examples in the book for a more in-depth understanding rather than going through them line-by-line, which would've really helped me in grasping some of the more abstract concepts of the course. But I think that's more of a personal preference type of thing. Office hours with either the professor or a TA certainly can help out with this.",
                "The course organization is fantastic. The topics flow into each other and build in a reasonable way. It feels very close to applications which I enjoy a lot. Open book exams spanning a day was the correct move for covid. It takes so much stress off the students' shoulders (we get enough in stem) and I honestly felt I learned better because I wasn't cramming to memorize everything for each exam. I focused on learning the concepts and theory, and used the text as a reference for detailed situations. This is much closer to what an actual engineer does in the working world, and I feel like I'll retain the ideas from this class better because of it."

                "Prof. Qiu switched between sharing screen to present slides with information and sharing her iPad screen to write out derivations and examples. It worked super well and felt as similar to in-person learning as possible.",
                "Some sort of flexibility in grading policy -- there were no dropped problem set grades and late ones penalized (would be a nice accommodation to allow one pass), and other than hw there were very few ways to earn points aside from one midterm and final. Very straightforward, but if you slipped up on midterm very hard to redeem.",
                "Lectures were a bit slow. Otherwise, this felt like a pretty standard course -- I'm not really sure what else to say.",
                "In my strengths and weaknesses for the class I mention the open book 12 hr window exams. Of my classes this semester, thermo's exams went the most smoothly because of this. Recording lectures for those unable to come to the live 9am was nice. However, I also feel as though it resulted in minimal communication between student and professor for many in the class, which is not great for the students and even worse for the professor."

                "I don't think anyone would likely take this class unless it was required, but I honestly enjoyed it and it was fun to learn about how power plants \/ engines work.",
                "Yes, most MechEs and other sorts of engineers have to take either this class or chemical thermo. I really found the course material interesting, and it was well-taught. Some of the concepts may be a little out-there if you're rough on your chemistry but it becomes easier to figure out.",
                "Yes! Thermodynamics is an interesting field of study that also isn't particularly difficult, compared to something like fluid dynamics. Most problems are approached with the exact same problem solving method (basically, conservation of energy). It doesn't involve many gross derivations. Usually, we start with a physical application and see the thermodynamic model for it, which is exciting and practical. Also Diana Qiu is hands down amazing."
