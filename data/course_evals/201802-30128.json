   "comments": [
    "I learned French grammar that is useful in both the written and spoken language and has help to improve my ability to speak and write in past and future tenses. I can better understand texts due to my ability to recognize past and conditional tenses.",
    "I gained proficiency in French grammar, reading and writing",
    "I developed my skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening inn French, as well as became familiar with multiple french novels and films.",
    "French!",
    "I learned the basics of French grammar language structure through classroom exercises, listening programs, and the study of multiple pieces of French literature.",
    "That I shouldn't have taken French - the department cares nothing about its students and simply focuses on piling as much work as possible onto them. The courseload is manageable if one decides to sacrifice a social life and hopes of experiencing other French sights while maintaining a normal grade within the class. The unwillingness to modify the curriculum in any way or provide additional help to struggling students is absolutely astonishing. When I asked for more help in a certain topic (the conditional tense), I was simply given a page to read out of a workbook that did nothing to help me, and further confused me. Only by pestering the professors did I manage to gain some insight into what I was doing wrong. The test structure, with the garbled and muted audio sections, lends nothing to one's learning and students are not prepared whatsoever for these sections - verbal cues in class and given in normal speed and normal volume levels, while the audio on the test was read at a breakneck pace, and as quietly as possible, and often not repeated. I absolutely hated this course and wish I could go back in time to not only reclaim my summer and pursue an internship or an independent study, but to also recover the crippling cost of the program."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course was the that the texts were a good level for our understanding while also helping us to expand on on vocabulary and provide a somewhat of a challenge. The course also helped improve both written and spoken french since assignments involved written pieces and also our class participation.",
    "Mostly review or L1 L2",
    "The first day of class begins with 93 pages of \"Le Petit Nicolas\", which in my opinion is rightly chosen as the first book for reading. But 93 Pages of reading is a lot on the first day of class. This was the largest reading ever we had to do in the course over a day. This really discouraged me from the start, since I was not used to reading so much french at a time; the jump from F129 to F130 is a big one and so it might help to cut down the first day's reading and add it to other days later in the course.",
    "I found the greatest strength to be the set up of the class, with three hours of class each day. It allowed me just to focus on my language study, to have the material always fresh in my mind.",
    "Less essays and more talking.",
    "It would be nice to know resources we could reach out to, such as tutoring and office hours, when we need help.",
    "This course was overall very well taught and I enjoyed it a lot. My one problem with the course and the possible weakness associated with it is that the majority of my time outside of class was spent reading the assigned texts, while in the evaluations they represented such a small percentage. This also led some of the important grammar lessons to be cut short, because we were spending so much time analyzing the text.",
    "That I shouldn't have taken French - the department cares nothing about its students and simply focuses on piling as much work as possible onto them.

   "comments": [
    "A very challenging class because of the grading and the workload but does help improve your french significantly,",
    "This course is really helpful when it comes to revising and solidifying one's grasp over material he or she may have forgotten. It also improves your French reading skills.",
    "Absolutely! While the daily workload is much larger, I found it much more productive and rewarding to have all class work solely devoted to language study (as opposed to juggling it with many other courses during the year).",
    "YES! The opportunity to travel abroad and stay with a family will help your French in ways nothing else will.",
    "Yes! I was never really a fan of my high school French classes, but really came to love the way this course was taught. With only 11 students, it makes it very easy to participate and engage in discussion during class time, while still getting any individualized help you may need.",
    "Absolutely not. It is a waste of a summer, and (speaking from September) I have already forgotten most, if not all, of the french I have learned."
