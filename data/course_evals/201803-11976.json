   "comments": [
    "Got better at speaking just from being in class every day but to be honest I don't think we went over anything we hadn't done in L2 except for conditional sentences. Even the vocab had a ton of overlap",
    "This was a very well-rounded and well-organized course that helped to improve my Spanish skills in reading, writing, listening, comprehension, and speaking.",
    "I learned to think analytically about texts in Spanish. My writing skills and grammar improved greatly in this class. I liked having the opportunity to speak in spanish everyday.",
    "I learned some more basic Spanish grammar that I didn't get the chance to learn during high school.",
    "I learned lots of vocabulary as well as grammar, especially the subjunctive. I learned how to write much better and how to speak more precisely with accurate grammar.",
    "I developed my grammatical skills to a great extent.",
    "I developed grammatical complexity in Spanish, as well as a plethora of interesting and useful vocabulary. I bettered my reading comprehension and conversation skills.",
    "I would say I temporarily memorized endless verb tenses and vocabulary, but I would not say that any skills or insights were developed in this course. It's all about memorization and no one cares if you remember it after the assessment. The majority of the time spent in class has nothing to do with any sort of knowledge or skills. The work is busy work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The CC was confusingly organized. I think it would be possible to make it more accessible. I appreciate having an accompanying book to the textbook, but it could have been more streamlined.",
    "The strengths were getting us speaking in class and the weaknesses were that we didn't really learn anything new all semester",
    "This is a very strong course. To improve it, I think there should be more of an emphasis on speaking.",
    "Strengths: small class so personalized attention and relationships with both the professor and my classmates, everybody had the opportunity to participate, homework was an actual supplement to classwork \r\n\r\nweaknesses: homework assignments were sometimes annoying because instructions were sometimes vague and answers were too specific in my opinion, we focused more on writing and grammar than speaking (would have enjoyed more speaking exercises)",
    "It does a good job of teaching us important grammar skills that we need to know, but we waste a lot of time doing unnecessary activities. I think if the class were three days a week it would be equally helpful.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I like the fact that it met every day because it was a great way to ensure I thought, wrote, and spoke in Spanish every day. However, the 5 days a week schedule makes it very difficult to take the class because it conflicts with so many other classes. I also wish there were more of a focus on conversational fluency because this is to me the most important component of learning another language--I am taking Spanish to be able to speak in Spanish, not for writing essays in Spanish, so I wish there were an option for a class that was focused on conversational skills more than writing because that would be more useful. I also think that reading a book in one week at the end of the semester was an unrealistic and unfairly difficult assignment. The challenging level of the literature meant that it was virtually impossible to read several chapters a day with our level of Spanish, especially during a week filled with midterm exams. I don't think it's a bad idea to have us read a book, I just think we need to have more time in which to do it.",
    "Strengths-very engaged and it helps make our Spanish very precise\r\nWeaknesses-Not enough oral activities",
    "The tests\/quizzes could be more evenly spread across the semester. Study guides could be made available earlier. The course is super well organized and seems engineered to teach you a language, so I get its intensity but it could be paced a bit chiller.",
    "I do not think there are any strengths of this course. The major weaknesses are the teaching, the classroom environment, and the work. The actual, difficult material of this class (verb tenses, readings, vocabulary) is briefly or never mentioned in class. The time in class is spent watching animal videos and going over homework that does not need to be checked. Considering this is a intermediate level Spanish class, the teaching and use of time is unbelievably bad. The homework is just busy work that takes forever and doesn't really help you learn the material. I absolutely dreaded coming to class every day and left each class knowing no more than when I came in. No one in the class wants to be there and that only makes it worse."

   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot in a short period of time. I am very pleased with my progress. The oral exam comes out of nowhere because 20 minutes is a long time to be speaking and in class you are able to prepare everything and only speak for a few minutes at a time.",
    "Yeah I would say do it just because you have to if you want to learn spanish",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in improving their Spanish skills, especially in regard to comprehension, reading, and writing.",
    "Yes. A good intermediate spanish class. Learned a lot and really do think my spanish improved.",
    "For pure learning, I would, but honestly we work hard for a grade that might not reflect that.",
    "I would if the student was simply trying to improve their Spanish. But it is not a particularly interesting or engaging course.",
    "Yes. It fills distributional requirements and teaches you a useful skill--a new language.",
    "Definitely not. Even if you need the requirement, do everything in your power to avoid Spanish L3. Choose a different language if this will be your first Spanish class at Yale. My biggest regret at Yale is choosing Spanish, and that is mostly because of this course. The work is terribly tedious, the teaching is not engaging, and I don't feel like I know as much Spanish as I should after 3 semesters. You will dread coming to class every day and will regret taking it every single day."
