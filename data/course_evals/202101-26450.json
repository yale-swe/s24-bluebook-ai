I think out of the many political science classes I've taken, I learned the most from discussions in this class. You'll definitely get back whatever you choose to put in (if not more, honestly). Take it!",

The seminar helped me to understand unifying ideological traits of the extreme right as well as how and why people become affiliated with extreme right movements. Our readings were highly informative and our meeting discussions were very helpful in providing different perspectives on how to combat the extreme right.",

As someone on the left, I felt as though I came out of the course with better skills regarding interacting with people on the right, which is often neglected at places like Yale. I also highly enjoyed hearing from my peers during the discussion section of the course, and adding their ideas, thoughts on readings, and personal experience to my collection of knowledge from this course.",

                "This was really a fantastic class generally. Prof. Aslanidis relies on a variety of media (academic and non-academic, like movies and manifestos) to expose students to the interstices of far-right ideology and practice.",
                "Paris is a huge strength of the course, he's an excellent professor who will really engage with your ideas in class and in any of your writing. Also, the class is usually a mix of discussion, short screenings, and a very short topical lecture--you'll stay interested.",
                "Strengths: The content of this class is really interesting. The response paper prompts were good, the discussions were interesting and well-paced",
                "Extreme and Radical Right Movements did a very good job of integrating Professor Aslanidis's insights and media about the extreme right into peer-based discussion on the subject. The readings were generally highly informative and intriguing. The response papers helped me to develop an understanding of different aspects of the extreme right, and the final paper helped me to apply the knowledge I gained from this seminar to a specific area of personal interest.\r\n\r\nMy only critique would be that a couple of the readings felt more like political philosophy than direct perspectives on the extreme right, and I found these texts very difficult to comprehend.",
                "I really loved this course! It was over half women and is only of the only PLSC seminars where I felt very little trouble unmuting to speak! Professor Aslanidis also really helps make sure to call on students and not let people speak over each other which made it easier to speak. I really loved this course and also appreciated how reasonable the readings and assignments were!",
                "I have all good things to say about this course. I really enjoyed the readings and discussion, and the course content is incredibly interesting in itself. Oftentimes, Yale courses use 'clickbait'-y titles that sound wildly compelling, only to devolve into outdated and confusing readings that focus an entirely different topic entirely; Extreme Radical Right was NOT an example of this. I consistently felt excited about the units and coursework, and Paris intentionally included up-to-date readings and opportunities to discuss current events and personal experiences in class.",
                "Professor Aslanidis does a great job of compiling provocative video clips and interesting news articles for class. I really liked how the readings were varied and not too academic-heavy (for example, one week we read the actual manifesto written by white nationalist mass murderers, which was super interesting). The course's quirky topic naturally made class discussions engaging, and the workload was fair. No significant weaknesses."

Every class was broken up into different parts to keep us guessing; sometimes Paris would share a few video clips in between discussion, to provide more perspective on the readings, and allow us to take a break from the big block of time allotted for the seminar. Additionally, discussion was always active in the class, and at times Paris encouraged us to use the chat feature (during video clips especially) to have another layer of engagement.",

If you're down to engage with some of the more heavy, theoretical arguments and do a bit of reading every week then you should definitely take the class.",

Especially if you identify as somewhere on the left, and come from a community of somewhat like-minded people, I would highly recommend taking the opportunity to educate yourself on the other side, the dangers it poses, and the ways in which we can combat extreme right movements.",
