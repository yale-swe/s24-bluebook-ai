I had never thought so deeply about the intersection of memory and history, and I approach every historical conversation or monument more thoughtfully because of our discussions. I also wrote the longest paper of my Yale career (pre-senior essay) in this seminar.",
                "I learned a lot about thinking about history in a critical manner and I think this class also helped improve my writing",
                "This course helped me develop an understanding of the politicization of significant historical events and how we remember them.",
                "I gained valuable insight into the battles for historical narrative surrounding important historical events in America. The final paper also provided an excellent opportunity to really dive deep into a topic, and do tons of original research. This was a unique opportunity that I very much enjoyed. The class is so enjoyable that if you're unable to finish the readings you feel upset because the in class discussion is so rich.",
                "I learned to think about the world in more multidimensional layers.",
                "I learned about many history wars of the past and those ongoing today in U.S. Historyranging from the Sand Creek Massacre to the Enola Gay Controversy to the Civil War. I learned about the disparity between individual and collective memories and the ways in which these narratives are shaped.",
                "This was a fantastic seminar where I learned a broad approach to history and memory studies. It developed my critical thinking and research skills. I really enjoyed the structure which was different than a typical history course - we covered a few historical examples and focused on themes in history studies (via memory and history wars) over just one area of history.",
                "Broad overview of \"history wars\" in the US - particular emphasis on the Civil War era and the 21st century",
                "The notion of the history of history, and, more acutely, that the division that we face as nation on politicized history is not a new thing. It was the perfectly complementary course to the Civil War lecture."

                "strengths: super interesting books and content; weaknesses: discussions could be a little all over the place, also be sure to budget into your schedule that this class will always go 10-15 mins long",
                "Strengths: Fascinating discussions. Professor Blight has the best stories of any Yale professor. The syllabus is well designed: the first few weeks talk about the philosophy of memory and public history before diving into case studies for the remainder of the semester. It was also fun to take a class more focused on method than any particular historical period, because all of us approached the class with different interests (as opposed to a seminar on a specific period in a specific place, where student interest can be more homogeneous). Weaknesses: none.",
                "The course discussions were great and I thought the class was structured very well.",
                "Professor Blight was accessible and facilitated great discussion.",
                "Professor Blight is a treasure. His moderation of the discussions really adds to the experiences, and the feedback on the papers is invaluable. The course readings are all excellent. There are truly no weaknesses.",
                "I thought it was an excellent course, one of my favorites ever. My one recommendation would be for the Professor to enforce shorter student presentations on the weekly readings to better facilitate discussions",
                "The lack of structure in this course is both a strength and weakness in my opinion. It allows for Professor Blight to insert his thought-provoking commentary and experiences into class discussions which was super interesting, but also means that sometimes we got sidetracked in our conversation and didn't cover all of the assigned readings (of which they were a LOT, but he doesn't always even expect that you have read them all loljust bring something to talk about). While Professor Blight doesn't explicitly provide much guidance for the papers in the assignments/in class, he is always open to meet in office hours, which are super cool and definitely worth taking advantage of as he is very helpful. He also leaves helpful commentary on papers and returns them in a pretty timely manner.",
                "The biggest strength is that David Blight is FANTASTIC! Every Yale student should take a course with him. The content was super interesting and I thought that while there was a good amount of reading/writing both the work and grading was fair/manageable. The one real weakness that comes to mind is over the course of the semester the brief reading presentations grew from taking up a few minutes of class to the majority of it. This just felt like a waste of time that could have been better used for discussion or hearing Professor Blight talk (he is incredible, so smart, had amazing anecdotes to share, cannot sing his praises enough).",
                "Strengths: wide-ranging syllabus covers several important events in public memory (the American Civil War, the Enola Gay crisis, recent elections); the class invigorates your sense of public duty and the importance of history as an academic discipline \r\nWeaknesses: scope of the class was probably too broad, final research assignment was much too self-directed, discussions were disorganized (esp with student presentations taking up far too much time)",
                "The only weakness is that I kind of (in a twisted way) wished that there were more reading quizzes/ small reading assignments. Some weeks when I was busier, the reading fell on the back burner. Maybe I'm the only one who lacked the discipline, but I wish I had been somehow pushed to be even more engaged with the reading"

                "Yes! You must take a course with Professor Blight! He is brilliant, caring, and tells the best stories. I also think it's important for history students to take a class that thinks about public history. No matter how much we work on getting every fact right from the archive, history becomes alive in how we remember it, for better and worse. Knowing more about the ethics of memory and how to grapple with public history should be necessary to earn the history degree.",

                "Yes. Interesting course plus David Blight.",

                "Most definitely",
                "Yesvery interesting and thought provoking class. Although it was a 9:25 am class, Professor Blight's personality and expertise really make it worthwhile and I always felt like I learned something interesting each day. It is a lot of reading, which is worth reading but not always feasible in the time frame given (I took 3 history seminars and this had the most reading assigned) but do the best you can.",
                "YES!!! I thought this was a really special history seminar and one of the more unique/valuable classes I have taken. I felt both challenged and engaged and I felt that I learned both a lot of content and honed a lot of useful skills as a history student. Take a class with Professor Blight while you are at Yale, and if you like seminars, this is a great one.",
                "I'd say this is more of an intro history seminar but the research paper is more suited for an advanced seminar, so be prepared for pretty \"entry-level\" in-class discussions and a hefty workload outside of class.",
                "Yes wholeheartedly, even to non-history majors (good luck getting in though). Really awesome being able to engage with my peers and hear all their thoughts as well."
