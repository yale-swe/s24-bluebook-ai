                "I learned how to engage with musical theater history from multiple cultural perspectives, but also how to analyze and talk about music, dramatic narrative and performance in songs. I learned about minstrelsy, concept musicals, what makes pieces sound the way that they do. Overall, a survey courseespecially in musical theater, where you have to pick and choose which shows to studyis difficult, but I think Egan does a great job. I wish this class could be longer\/meet more often!",
                "I learned a lot about the history of American Musical Theatre, from its earliest days to its current state. I developed a critical eye for the form of entertainment, understanding both the capabilities and limitations of its storytelling. Professor Egan did a great job of introducing us to a more analytical view of reading music and listening to musicals to give us a better understanding of how traditions were followed and challenged as the musical progressed through history.",
                "I learned different ways to go about analyzing musical theatre, both by looking at how it fits in history and how it's music deepens the meaning.",
                "Wow. The real question is what DIDN'T I learn? I had a brilliant overview of the history of American Musical Theater. It was not general or cliche -- it was a TRUE and detailed look at its significance on every layer: social, political, etc.",
                "I learned how to better manage time, especially when it comes to writing essays. I also learned to think outside the box when it comes to things I thought I knew a lot about, because there are many different lenses to look through and I gained different perspectives about theater."

                "Strengths: Great blend of media, reading, and discussion! For an MT nerd, this class is heaven. \r\nWeaknesses: Picking what shows to study is always difficult, and it would be worth incorporating more discussions at the end of term about historiography. A great project could be having students pick their own shows that we haven't studied and either present on them\/make a pitch as to why they should be included in the class (or MT canon in general) and are \"worthy\" of study. Professor Egan tries to strike a balance between his own lecture agenda and letting the class be guided by student discussions, and sometimes veers toward the former (or tries a bit too hard to fit students' points to his agenda--though, again to his credit, he's very conscious of this and checks in to see if he's interpreted your own thoughts correctly!). As for improvement, it might be helpful to place the song analysis class before the song analysis paper is due (instead of after), to help students prepare their framework and learn what to look for in a piece. Additionally, I would love to get more written feedback on assignments (to help me understand how I can improve as a writer). Sometimes, too, that Professor Egan doesn't need to show as many full examples (especially those assigned for homework) in class, as it takes away from valuable discussion time.",
                "Professor Egan is definitely the highlight of this course. Every class was interesting and engaging, and he definitely challenged us to think as critically as possible. The lineup of musicals we listened to was a wonderful mix of the most famous\/classic musicals, and lesser-known, but equally great, pieces as well. The course was really well structured and had a clear structure and progression from week to week.",
                "Because of the small class size, it was very easy to speak up in class without feeling intimidated. Sometimes it felt like we were moving through history very fast, and I wish we could talk about some shows more than we did.",
                "Strengths: Everything. Dan is simply amazing.",
                "This is a fantastic class that delves deeply into theater history and makes students think about theater in many different ways. It could be a bit challenging at times as students were often put on the spot to answer questions, but this ultimately challenged us to work harder and come to class prepared with our own ideas."

                "Yes, from a casual fan of musical theater to a seasoned performer\/writer\/self-proclaimed aficionado of the art form. Prof Egan tackles historic issues, music analysis, cultural analysis, and performance studies throughout the class, so there's always a new angle to consider works that you might already think that you're intimately familiar with. It's a bunch of listening and reading, but the readings are fascinating. DO THE STUDY QUESTIONS! They're great and really make you think.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you enjoy musicals, take it. Even if you don't have a very strong background in musical theory or in theatre, Professor Egan guides everyone to a better understanding of what is going on.",
                "I'd recommend this class because it's a great way to sharpen one's own analytical skills (specifically of musical theatre). It made me fall in love with the artform again because the shows we looked at were so varied and interesting. I loved how easy it was to speak up in the class, even when I wasn't confident in what I was saying.",
                "Yes!!! Especially with Dan! It's such a fun and engaging class and you learn so much. You don't even have to be remotely related to theater.",
                "Yes, this course was very interesting and always a highlight in my week. I would definitely recommend this course to any students interested in musical theater in any way. It challenges the way you think about musicals and forces you to look at them more deeply and analytically."
