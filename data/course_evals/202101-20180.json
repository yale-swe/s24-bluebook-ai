                "Professor Sexton designs the class well by mixing his Master Class book with classic works of fiction. As a result, this did not feel like a generic fiction class but rather a well-structured tour through the construction of a story. He also offered one-on-one feedback throughout the semester. This class is well set up to improve student writing. Beyond that, this class is also very fun for anybody who likes to read and write. I enjoyed going to class and talking with my peers each day. Regarding weaknesses, the middle of the term dragged a bit as we tried to read full novels while also completing writing assignments. Perhaps short stories (rather than full books) could be more effective for encouraging student participation\/readership.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is having workshops for our short stories. It was really helpful to interact with the other students and hear their feedback on my writing since everyone offered very insightful advice and comments. One suggestion is that sometimes some of the readings were unnecessarily long, and detracted slightly from my enjoyment of reading them. Another comment is I did not know where I stood in the class until the last week of classes, so I wish the professor was a lot more upfront about grades as the semester progresses.",
                "Professor Sexton is a kind teacher. This is a gift that can go a long way. It is a course that teaches you the formalistic elements of writing fiction and gives you a framework through which to learn more from the texts you read.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sexton is a fantastic professor and facilitates a warm, engaging, and fun class atmosphere, the assignments are reasonable in length, and the readings are fun.\r\nWeaknesses: The lack of rubrics\/concrete feedback for each short essay (from Professor Sexton) and especially the final essay, really tripped me up.",
                "I think the intimate setting of the class made it really easy to communicate with everyone. Additionally, I loved the small group workshopping sessions we had in breakout rooms which I believe should be continued even in the classroom setting. As for weaknesses, sometimes readings became very long and we did not discuss them in as much depth as I'd like to. Specifically, I did not find As I Lay Dying as important as other novels we read, such as Beloved.",
                "This was an incredibly strong course. The class discussions and revisions throughout the course made it incredibly engaging, and the only weakness was how the Zoom format occasionally hindered conversation among my peers--but that was no fault of the course at all."

                "Certainly  This class is a lot of fun for anybody who likes to read, write, and talk about books. I am to an English major, nor am I an especially adept fiction reader\/writer. Still, this class was set up well for people of all skill levels. If your section is anything like mine, you will also meet exceptionally talented writers in the class. I enjoyed this portion of the course because it was a wonderful reminder of how bright many of our peers are! As a note to other students, this is no 'gut.' The workload is very manageable, but Sexton is a tough grader. You will be writing a short story for your final project. Still, the course is very worthwhile.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a strong love of reading and writing. The homework assignments, although sometimes a lot of work, were fun and enjoyable to complete. I definitely feel as if I improved as a writer.",
                "Yes. There are writing courses that can take you from 0% - 90% (however arbitrary those numbers are), and there are courses that can take you from 90-95. This is very much the former. It build your capacity as a writer and takes you to a place where you can gain from more advanced work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else if you are remotely interested in learning how to better your narrative writing. It was very low pressure but also gave room for all of us to grow as writers through weekly exercises and our final short story at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes! I think this course is a must for any student that wants to refine and gain confidence in their creative writing abilities."
