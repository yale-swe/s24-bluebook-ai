                "overall good course",
                "All of the material was clearly a bit out of date with what we were doing in lab and it was also clear in many instances that the professor and TAs had not reviewed the material before hand  and were in many cases not super helpful or concise at answering questions. Also there was not much background for a lot of the content or instructions for how to do specific statistic/logistical things on our lab reports which made them a lot harder than they needed to be.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content, easy to follow procedures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Difficulty scheduling office hours (when requested, no actual office hour was offered, I was only allowed to visit the other section's time which seemed disrespectful of the time of the other students), inconsistent information for lab reports (asked the same question to a TA and prof, got different answers, resulting in docked points), Seemingly no communication between members of the teaching team (when I asked for feedback from one prof, I was almost always directed to another one), huge time delays between lab report submission and grading (sometimes even 3 weeks after submission, no way to know what was wrong with the next report before submission resulting in docked points), no clear lab report guidelines/rubric, generally when I emailed the profs about concerns in the class they were condescending and provided no real answers or solutions opting for pacifying statements.\r\n\r\nOverall, the in-person content of this course was fabulous, and the organization of lab procedures, pre-class quizzes, and preliminary content made sense. However, the interactions with profs and TAs as well as the inconsistent communication and grading made this class incredibly frustrating.",
                "Strengths were having the lab every other week. It took a while to complete labs in class so it was very helpful having the rest of the week to work on lab reports. I think that the TFs were also very good as they would provide good advice and concise answers to students. I think it was ok having the final as a written assignment but perhaps a mix of performing a lab and memorizing content would have been good. I think a weakness was the harshness with which lab reports were graded. Oftentimes, it seemed like points were taken off for the same thing multiple times.",
                "Need set office hours and rubrics for the lab reports that essentially make up our whole grades",
                "This course is very applicable to the BME major, but it has some organizational flaws. My only qualm with this course is that any of the questions in the lab reports are incredibly vague and students would never be able to figure out what is required without the TFs checking the answer key. Additionally, the TFs often deducted points from lab reports for missing details that weren't even asked for by the questions. I was told several times when trying to figure out why I had points deducted that despite the question not requiring a graph or discussion of the implications of a phenomenon, \"students in previous years included it, so we expected it.\" I fail to understand how it is reasonable to expect students to know how comprehensive lab reports must be given such unclear instructions.",
                "Lab instructions and report format could be improved. The lab that required matlab code was very difficult to code and figure out on my own.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized, three professors with three different lab report styles and no rubric. Did not receive feedback on lab reports until after multiple submissions so I was not able to use this feedback. Professors are very hands off. Some of the labs did not even have an introduction and were not super clear with feedback.",
                "I thought that there was not enough instruction given in the lab handouts to properly convey what was expected from the lab reports.",
                "Class meets roughly every other week, and lab reports are due one week after the lab, which make for a relaxed timetable. The labs themselves are not too difficult, although they can sometimes take the whole afternoon to complete. The instructors are available throughout the lab to answer questions, but each of them specializes in only one or two labs, meaning they're not always well-equipped to address issues during each lab.",
                "I really liked the structure of this lab course, where different professors led lab sessions most relevant to their work. It allowed us to learn from many professors, which was a great opportunity. Sometimes it could be difficult to obtain ideal results, seeing as how our samples were taken from live subjects. But, that was a great experience for what we can expect in future biomedical engineering work. I also really liked that lab did not meet every week, as sometimes those labs can feel like we're running experiments just for the sake of using up time. This lab felt very purposeful and intentional.",
                "weaknesses: poorly organized, grading scheme is bad (they took off points on the lab report for things they didn't tell us about before we submitted it), lab equipment was confusing\r\n\r\nstrengths: profs and TAs would help when you asked",
                "I would say the major weakness of this course was the teaching team. With multiple instructors, it was difficult to keep track of who was responsible for each lab. During the lab time, the instructors were helpful enough, being able to help with adjustments to the apparatus or with confusions about the procedure. However, the instructors were difficult to access outside of the lab time for help with the lab reports, because there were no set office hours, and to me it felt like questions about the lab reports were treated as inconveniences. This inaccessibility was also true of the TAs, who worked together to grade our reports. The fact that they distributed the responsibility of grading different sections of the same report was confusing, and first round of feedback only occurred after we had already turned in additional lab reports. This left what was expected of us in our lab reports unclear for some time, though this was later resolved after communication with the teaching team.",
                "This course's main weakness was poor communication from instructors. The course could be improved if it only had one instructor instead of multiple. Overall, the instructors seemed very disengaged with this the course. They did not provide much instruction outside of pre-lab reading assignments. The expectations for lab reports were unclear, and little feedback on the assignments were given until the middle of the semester. A strength of the course was that it did include some interesting topics that supplemented physiological systems well. I would suggest modifying the neuromuscular lab so that it does not involve electrically shocking students, or so that it can be done for a shorter period of time."
