    "The one-on-one structure is excellent and could only be improved, perhaps, by a few more partial paper deadlines. It would also be great to have a senior colloquium at the end of the year for Humanities majors to present their theses to each other."

    "yes!",
    "I would recommend the year-long thesis option to all Humanities majors! It's incredibly important to learn how to engage in a sustained way through an extended idea. The thesis teaches time management, research, and communication skills. It was my most satisfying (and challenging) intellectual project at Yale."
