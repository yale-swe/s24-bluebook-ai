   "comments": [
    "Ive learned that one should not be afraid to write what they want to write, tell the truth, or simply say that they can relate to a piece read. This course has taught me to have confidence in my writing but also ways I can use different styles of writing and manipulate their use in order to make the audience feel what I was experiencing at the time. Ive learned too much to put into words but I know I am better writer and person.",
    "By taking this course I did not just simply learn how to write fast and analyze different author's techniques in creative writing but also gained confidence in my writing. I have always felt insecure about writing in English because English is not my first language and I was always afraid of people judgment on my writing due to my insufficiency in grammar. However, as I was getting feedback from students in the course, I gained confidence in their compliments and even their feedback on writing. Also, I learned how to carefully craft an essay that is about my family because family people who we know the most about yet we don't know all about-- it's a very mysterious subject. There are things in the family that we do not want to share with others, but by writing this out on a piece of paper led me to realize the importance of family and how \"powerful\" family is. Family is like a treasure full of untold stories.",
    "Writing about family is emotionally, intellectually, and ethically rewarding and challenging endeavor. I learned how to navigate conversations within this field--in essays, in workshops, with my own family, with the families of others. It sounds simple, but it's anything but. This class taught me how to commit to my writing, my values, and the values I wish to pass on to my family, biological and chosen.",
    "I learned to structure my writing and organize how I choose to present my experiences. More importantly, I was able to discuss the moral and ethical responsibilities that come with writing about family.",
    "I finally internalized that there is no \"correct\" way to enter a topic, that any point of entry works. I learned that family is a topic worthy of rigorous academic\/intellectual exploration and that we do not navel gaze by writing about our own private lives - to the contrary, it's basically impossible to write about the people close to us without also thinking about social issues in some capacity. (I think writing about family is actually a really effective way to explore politics, since it's hard to make generalizations or hyperabstractions when you're exploring a familiar person and their particularities.) There's so much more I learned -- about the absence of any objective truth when it comes to our emotional experiences, and about the simultaneous existence of an interior reality that we are each capable of uncovering; about the joy of writing in a supportive environment; about the necessity of revisions. I'd say the main things I gained skills-wise are a thoughtfulness about incorporating documents (e.g. photos, letters, etc.) into my writing and an exposure to different modes of personal essay writing.",
    "I learned that even writing about my own life and my relationship with my family is a valid form of writing."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the professor as she was lovely and could not have had a better professor because she was very lively, clearly passionate, flexible, and high insightful. The expansive writing styles were also a strength as I learned about styles I did not know existed. The weakness were that there were none, the entire 5 weeks were the best because of this class.",
    "The strength of this course was that everyone in this course was so engaging and passionate about writing. Despite the common conception about Yale students from the outsiders, each one of us had different unique family stories that are so valuable and everyone was willing to share it with others in the class. People in the class were so supportive of each other (and so friendly!). There is no weakness in this course.",
    "This class really allows you to learn how to write with structure and purpose. It makes you think about your experiences and organize them.",
    "STRENGTHS:  It is fun and sometimes a little therapeutic.\r\nWEAKNESSES: It can get super boring being a three-hour class. There is little time to actually write and improve upon the essays due to the five-week time constraint."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! I wholeheartedly loved this class. All the readings Dr. Hopper chose were amazing guys and even though we had a short amount of time together it really felt like I learned so much about both myself, my family and writing. If Dr. Hopper is teaching it again this summer I would encourage everyone take it!",
    "I would for sure recommend this course to another student because it is about family. Family is a subject most take for granted or dont think deeply about it and this class forces you to think about your place in your family and how you have attained that place and how your family has shaped you. It gives you a new sense of appreciation for your family and a new perspective as you dissect your family dynamics in comparison to others. I know they would enjoy it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student because it helps students to craft well-written creative writing pieces and guide how each student to become a better writer, whether they would write about family or anything else.",
    "Yes. Taking this class with Professor Hopper was an incredible experience. Her boundless support, knowledge, and openness for these ongoing conversations in writing about family (and writing, overall) made this class worth every moment.",
    "I would 100% recommend the course it is amazing.",
    "Yes!!!! And if you aren't able to take this course for whatever reason, I recommend finding a supportive setting to write about family.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. You learn a lot about how to become a better writer without feeling judged."
