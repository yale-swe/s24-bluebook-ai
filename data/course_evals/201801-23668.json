   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: too much work, some of it unnecessary. My professor made the class boring and the rest of my classmates werent too engaged.",
    "L2 Spanish and the department is so flawed, its almost a joke. I know more people who lie about their experience with Spanish and skate by with their prior knowledge rather than them actually learning and understanding the material. I would recommend anyone take another language.",
    "There is too much going on. I felt it was more important to do all the work than to actually learn Spanish. The grading is too strict and stupid in that way.",
    "There was an insane amount of work, and while I sometimes could see why it would be important, sometimes I really couldn't tell why we were doing it and did not feel it helped with my Spanish speaking abilities.",
    "Too difficult",
    "The course is extremely well-structured.",
    "Strengths is that it is an extremely intense language course with lots of homework\r\nWeakness, the pace is too fast",
    "The strengths included encouraged and constant participation in class and working with classmates often doing practice activities. Weakness was the strictly set system of grading where even correct answers were considered incorrect if they didn't exactly fit the answer key.",
    "The course structure is overly rigid and places too much emphasis on continuing at the expense of mastery. We should have continued to review preterite and imperfect throughout the course but we did not. This left the students in a bad place for the final test which required mastery of all tenses."

    "Its a requirement. If you dont have to take it, dont do it.",

    "No. I'd suggest just taking a whole new language.",
    "No, if you don't have to take Spanish, I wouldn't. I would choose a different language.",
    "No, it was too difficult.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they have the passion to learn the language. The class facilitates learning in both a fun and enjoyable way.",
    "There are some tight deadlines and you need to study to make sure you really understand what will be on the tests and quizzes. Be diligent and do all your work. The points add up.",

    "Yes, to those who want to improve their Spanish speaking proficiency",
    "I would recommend that other students take this course seriously in the amount of work it presents. I would advise students to take this course if they wish to be on the road to achieving fluency."
