                "An in-depth understanding of the dynamics of gender and citizenship in the Middle East. We read a book each week and every book was illuminating and enjoyable to read. They covered topics such as Islamic piety, Orientalism, religious conversion, social sacrifices, etc.",
                "In this course, we read twelve full-length books, mostly ethnographies. While anthropology is definitely fraught, I think Professor Pepi chose some really amazing books for us to read. It was also nice to read books that were mostly published in the last few years and by professors that the professor knew personally. Professor Pepi's flexibility with the final project allowed me to pursue a creative project which I am really proud of. I was able to develop skills tangentially related to the course that I can take with me in future endeavors. Important topics in the course were: the nation state, U.S. empire, how women perform culture, the moniker of Islam, and transnational movements of people, goods, and ideas.",
                "Lots of really diverse information about gender issues throughout MENA region!",
                "I gained so much knowledge from this class! I got better at reading quickly and interpreting an author's purpose and influences. I also learned a ton of information about the Middle East and specific people/group's relation to gender. I learned a ton about Foucault, nation building, and the relation between gender and the state.",

                "The professor is incredible! She made each class immensely engaging and enjoyable. She also brought a lot of insight and helped draw out some of the more complex aspects of the readings. The book themselves are outstanding. This was the first time I have read anthropological works and I loved it.",
                "A major strength of the course was reading a full book each week. This really helped with retaining the information from each week and seeing the author's overall arguments. We also formed an amazing community as a class. Almost everyone in the class had a personal connection with the region. It was so nice to have diverse perspectives that allowed us to talk about the region in a way that felt close and familiar. A weakness is maybe that we didn't get to meet any of the authors. This definitely isn't an expectation, but Professor Pepi had mentioned that in previous iterations of the course, some authors had visited the class. In the age of COVID, this was a bit harder to realize though.",
                "Tiresome to read/focus on a book a week, but helped in the end",
                "This might have been my favorite class at Yale. I loved the book a week format! I loved every single book we read and was engaged with them every week. We had two writing assignments for the semester, and could choose for ourselves which week we turned them in/what book we wrote about. I really liked this format because it allowed me to write on weeks when I was less busy and for the books I was most interested in. This deepened my learning and engagement without causing undo stress. I'm not sure if this is a weakness, but I thought the class was a little large for a seminar. I was worried about it at first, but everyone turned out to have so much unique stuff to contribute that by the end I was glad it was so large. I think in a smaller class we could have had more critical discussion about the book and spend slightly less class time summarizing. But also I liked the larger class, so not totally sure that's a weakness. Besides that there are none, this was a phenomenal class.",

                "Absolutely! This is a phenomenal class. It provides such a unique perspective on MENA at Yale. A lot of classes here are US foreign policy oriented and do not engage with the region on its own terms. This course was very refreshing. We learned about people lives in the region through their own voices and experiences. I would highly recommend this class!",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in understanding the contemporary workings of U.S. empire and developing a more nuanced critique of the nation-state. I think a personal connection to the region would also make the experience more worthwhile. I would recommend taking this course instead of Marcia Inhorn's related course on \"Middle East Gender Studies\" if you are more interested in critique of empire.",
                "Yes! Prof Pepi is fabulous if you pay attention",
                "Yes! This class is so phenomenal. I would recommend taking it in a not crazy busy semester so you have time to read all the books. I'm not sure you would get much out of it if you didn't do the readings because the discussions were very specific to the material. But yes I would absolutely recommend it. It changed my course of study and so much of what I think about the world.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has a more holistic political science perspective on the subject of gender&citizenship in the MENA region and who want to expand their perspective to include what Anthropological work on the ground level can teach us. I do think anyone interested in the topics of gender, post-colonial theory or the MENA region in general should take the course."
