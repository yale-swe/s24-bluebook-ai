                "A strength was the focus on foundational concepts and recurring themes as opposed to specific details like the mechanisms of individual reactions. This course really helps you connect all of the biological and chemical processes you learn in other courses (orgo made so much sense after taking this). The pace of the lectures was very reasonable, and having the lectures on Canvas to review was essential, I really hope STEM lectures continue to regularly record lectures in future semesters.  A weakness was the lack of practice questions presented before each exam, which made it hard to study for the first and third exams. Also, I did not like the inclusion of a TA-led lecture into the exam content for the final exam.",
                "Strengths: Great organization with the lectures, passionate and kind professors, amazing TAs\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The second half of the semester had a lot of topics that needed to be described more in-depth than what was covered for proper understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Learn a lot\r\n- Very supportive TA and instructors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not as much interactions with students",
                "Strengths: very clear instruction by both professors, interesting content, wonderful teaching staff",
                "I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the in depth focus on mechanisms of metabolism. I really appreciated when Professor Breaker put the mechanisms and steps of metabolism into broader context, and think that perhaps a bit more of this could help.",
                "Great course. First test was unfair though",
                "Lectures sometimes could be dry and lot of info was taught that we didnt need to know",
                "Maybe we could have problem sets in addition to the exams to make sure we have understood what we have been taught",
                "This course is very good and informative but it is a lot of information to process.",
                "I liked that this course was split into two different parts between two very different professors -- when things are online on Zoom, it helps to shake things up a bit. I loved the emphasis on mechanisms. Slides were great, and exams were very reasonable and even interesting. But, I wish there were more assignments\/problem sets\/other ways to practice and learn concepts hands-on, and more simpler grades to even out the 4 exams.",
                "A strength and weakness is that grading is based solely on 4 exams. Its a strength because theres not a lot of homework throughout the course, but its a weakness is that grades rely solely on 4 exams and theres no extra credit or way to make up for a bad exam.",
                "Strengths - material was relatively well taught, clear; there was a focus on learning major concepts rather than specific details\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes it was unclear what material was expected for the exams; sometimes it was unclear what concepts were the important ones",
                "Weaknesses- the content is very dense, professors are ok\r\nStrengths- great TAs",
                "the course was very organized",

                "Strengths: Both professors excellent, lecture slides clear, tests fair \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA",
                "The course material was super interesting. I really enjoyed the lectures and discussion sections. \r\n\r\nHowever, switching professors halfway through was pretty jarring. They had very different lecture styles, teaching styles, and testing styles.",
                "I liked that the course was broken into four sections which seemed coherent and manageable amounts of information. At times it was difficult to know what the expectations were for exams  it would be helpful to have more guidance in the form of extra practice questions (more than just last years exam) since there was a lot of TMI information especially in the second half of the course.",
                "This course is really challenging but was made bearable thanks to the work of the TAs being readily available. I'd give them more resources.",
                "The lectures follow a logical format and are generally clear to understand. Some of the lectures (esp the unfamiliar material) seemed to go too quickly, but the lecture powerpoints themselves have ample writing so that students could learn the material on their own after class (thank you for that!). The Achilles heel of this class is that the final grade is based solely on exam performance. Therefore, it makes it difficult to know how solid of a grasp you have on the material until you are tested. Thus, the problem for studying becomes \"I don't know which aspects of the course I don't understand.\" Having (1) a few problem sets, even if they're optional, or (2) posting multiple practice exams per midterm exam would aid studying tremendously."
