                "Not a lot of homework assignments to really grasp the material but grading system was lenient.",
                "Learning more outside of the excel sheets would be really useful",
                "Strengths - Prof. Antle does genuinely care about you learning this stuff. If you have the desire to learn accounting, he'll go above and beyond to make sure you get it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lectures were a bit unorganized, and I found the course canvas a bit hard to navigate (I didn't realize there were readings until the end of the semester). Mostly user error, I'm sure, but the website and the class itself were just kind of complicatedly structured. I ended up Credit D'ing the class just to avoid taking the final on the 21st.",
                "Better organization and clearer communication with the instructor would be helpful. I was often confused by due dates since the timeline on canvas didn't match the pace materials were being covered",
                "Strengths: lots of online resources available to help me with the assignments. Weaknesses: not always very clear instructions on assignments and how to go about completing them.",
                "Professor Antle created a great Excel program to help teach us accounting. However, I wish that he had gone through each line item in the journal in a more traditional lecture style where we learn where to find it. Instead, he taught by providing a large amount of ungraded practice, which I did not find facilitated much learning for me.",
                "you have to go to lectures to understand how to do practice problems.\r\nprof would give out these assignments without any guidance and expect us to know how to do them.\r\nhe never explained what an accounts receivable is which i think is a good gauge as to how this course was taught.",
                "This course focuses a lot on applying Excel skills in accounting settings. It was interesting and potentially useful, but took at least two weeks of stumbling through the assignments until I really felt comfortable with it. I understand the \"learning by working through it\" approach, but I felt that I was only really understanding the \"how\" and not the \"why\" of the material.",
                "The homeworks were incredibly well thought out and helpful. I also appreciated the opportunity to review the homeworks together as a class.",
                "I'll be honest, an 8:40am class at SOM can be pretty tough sometimes and I think that caused the low attendance at lecturers. But other than that, amazing professor and teaching style.",
                "I have a little bit of accounting experience. I think we could have learned more about schedules, like PP&E. I think this course could really improve if we learned how to make revenue assumptions and project out and income statement and then use that to build a dcf.",
                "Great course",
                "I really appreciate how we were given a key to check our homework, specifically, the use of the accounting tool was extremely helpful.",
                "This course was very organized and methodical, which I found very helpful going in with no accounting background. One possible weakness is lectures being recorded as it allowed students to miss class.",
                "The first half of the class with valuation was extremely interesting, the content could have done with more diversity in accounting side as it felt very repetitive."

At least half of my time spent working on problems was trying to fix issues with the excel sheets (tabs moving, trying to figure out why my answer was \"wrong\" only to realize that I did not have the numbers in the order that the sheet was programmed to mark as correct). From this perspective, I think I spent a lot of time on this course but did not necessarily learn a lot of accounting.",

I still think that any student looking to do so would do well in this course. However, the professor mostly provided practice instead of teaching new concepts, and nothing was graded, so I do not feel like I took away as much as I would have liked to.",
