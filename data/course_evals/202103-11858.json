Gee, that sounds like a lot, what a productive semester. You know when you try to do too much and the quality of everything goes out the window. Yep, no offense, but that is the truth - ya, you're getting it. Most of you looking at this have probably taken single and multivariable calc, so yes, the course does waste time on that (and the first midterm did not even cover any of it, just the newer, harder topics, which would be fine with me, if more time was dedicated to them).",

                "About half the semester consisted of a very basic review of concepts we were already well-versed in. The other half was very complex material that we were only able to acquire a surface level understanding of. The course would be much stronger if less time was spent on review.",
                "Bad: \r\n\r\nQUALITY OVER QUANTITY. \r\nDrop Calculus, Focus on linear algebra and differential equations, please. \r\n\r\nAdd some TF hours for help. \r\n\r\nThe book is quite subpar. The example problems don't cover all the bases; maybe they do if you have already seen the material. It feels more like review guide ssthan it does a legit teaching tool. \r\n\r\nGood: \r\n\r\nI guess it takes a lot less time to \"prepare\" you for trench warfare that is physics than the traditional (full, dedicated class) route.",
                "The textbook is pretty good and the problem sets are sometimes difficult but generally rewarding, as are the exams. The major weakness is that this class spends so much time going over material that just does not need to be covered, or could be covered much quicker. I am taking this course to learn complex analysis, linear algebra, and differential equations, not calc 1-3 material which I already know. The result of going over so much math in only a semester is that he pace is very rushed for the topics that actually matter and about right for a comprehensive review of the topics I already know. Personally, I think the class would be better served by only covering topics students who took Math 120 will not have seen yet.",
                "Somewhat unclear teaching",
                "The strengths of this course are that they complete the math requirement of the physics major. However, I feel like I did not learn the necessary math for a physics major and will most likely take linear algebra and differential equations anyways. The first half of the course was focused on a review of calc 1, 2, and 3, which mostly felt unnecessary. However, when we began tackling more advanced topics like complex analysis and linear algebra, we rushed through and I didn't really retain anything. Also, there were no teaching assistants in the class.",
                "This class has very clear issues with pacing. More than half the class is review material, but the same attention is given to it as is given to the new material. We covered all of linear vector spaces and diff eq. in a month or so, and it is very easy to get lost. The book only offers handwavy proofs to theorems which adds to the confusion. The former half of the class should be dropped and the latter half expanded upon."

As said, this course really is the epitome of whatever that saying is, \"Quantity over quality\" (you get the point). AVOID it if you can. Take Differential Equations as soon as possible, as well as linear algebra and talk to the DUS about it (I know plenty who did that). If you are in a pinch (upperclassman maybe) and you absolutely need to take the course and don't have time to take the dedicated courses, buckle up for some serious trucking cause this really ain't it chief, you got a whole interstate highway ahead of you.",
                "I would only recommend this course if a student needs to take it for accelerated access to the major. While the class itself is not overly difficult, I think a student looking for a good math background for physics would be better served taking linear algebra and differential equations separately.",

                "I probably wouldn't recommend this course if a student is planning to go to graduate school for physics later in their career. I think a stronger background in these math topics that will be used so frequently throughout a physics career is important. However, if a student is just trying to complete the major, this class could be a good choice.",
