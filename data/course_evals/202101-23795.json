                "I learned more about analytical writing.",
                "I learned much about reading, writing, analyzing, and thinking about autobiography. I have come to appreciate the nuances of the genre, as well as the difficulties involved in telling the story of self and others. I also learned a lot about many tremendous people by reading their autobiographies.",
                "When I took Literature of the Black South with Professor Mahurin last spring, I so appreciated the breadth of the syllabus: from poetry to fiction to memoir, as early as the 1930s and as recent as 2018. \"Literature\" is far broader a term than \"autobiography,\" and so I was pleasantly surprised that the syllabus for African-American Autobiography this semester felt just as expansive. The authors on our reading list spanned form, time, gender, and all had different beliefs about what the autobiography\/memoir genre really means. In addition to further strengthening my close reading skills and ability to collaboratively engage with texts, this course gave me an appreciation for the boundless possibility within the autobiographical genre, and insight into how this genre has been particularly significant within the black literary tradition.",
                "This course provided understanding as to the strategic decision making that goes into the autobiographical writing processes. We tackled questions of how authors choose to what and who to write about, in what ways they want their life events portrayed, and the different motivations they have for doing so. I think this course helped developed analytical skills.",
                "Amazing class. You must take.",
                "I learned of the triumphs and limitations of autobiography as seen through the lens of our syllabus's authors. These writers challenged us to consider what it means to write not only your own story, but those of other peopleof the ways our lives naturally intersect with multitudes of others. Why is this a valuable project? What act of imagination does it take to render the truth of one's story? How is autobiography different from the project of fiction\/poetry\/playwriting? Also, these texts cover a wide breadth of time and extend across many geographies, offering a mosaic of America and Black life.",
                "In this course I thought deeply about the rich history of African American autobiography, The excellent syllabus allowed me to consider how these different books spoke to one another."

                "strengths were the books choices they were all amazing and the conversations were great as well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mahurin (!!!), the books (some of the most important, compelling, and moving texts I've read at Yale), the insightful class discussions, student presentations, the creative writing option for the final project \r\nWeaknesses: only being able to spend two classes on each book. But it's a difficult trade-off: cut an important book from the syllabus to have more class discussion, or keep all of the important books and have less discussion on each book. No right answer. \r\nAlso, in the future I still think the final should be remote with access to texts. This way, the focus is more on analysis and understanding of the texts (which I appreciated), as compared to some stress of memorization",
                "I'm inclined to say this course has no real weaknesses: Professor Mahurin strikes a near-perfect balance between leading conversation and allowing the texts themselves to lead, and the reading list was wonderful. I suppose my two biggest \"critiques,\" if they can even be called that, are: (a) it was nearly impossible to give each text the time it deserved, but this is an unfortunate logistical reality of any literature seminar; and (b) as we discussed collectively on several occasions in class, the reading list for this course is tough: there isn't much in terms of levity or emotional relief. But I am personally still on the fence about whether or not that is something that should be 'changed,' as each of the texts on the syllabus certainly demands and deserves to be read. (Furthermore, this critique prompts broader examination of the realm of African-American Studies, for which this single seminar can't be held accountable.)",
                "This course was so engaging and so thought-provoking. I loved the texts chosen on the syllabus. It felt very fast-paced and could have benefitted from a reduced book count but going into greater depth on each one.",
                "This class was fantastic. No changes.",
                "This class is perfect. Dean Mahurin is a wonderful instructor who clearly loves these books and wants to share everything she's gleamed from them with you. Class discussions were always lively, even in the face of the limitations posed by remote learning. I'm hard-pressed to think of ways the course could be improved.",
                "This course has many strengths, the reading list being the greatest of them. The books we read in this course are unbelievable, some of the best books I have ever read. Professor Mahurin is also an excellent teacher who leads great discussions. The option to do a memoir as the final essay was also great.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness was with the final exam. Professor Mahurin told us there would be ten short answer questions on the exam, but instead there were ten short answers and an essay. I would have liked warning about this, so I could have planned my time differently."

I am really grateful to Professor Mahurin for making the in-person classes work as well as they did, and for bringing a bit of life to a semester bogged down by the monotony of Zoom. At the same time, she never went through with these in-person meetings if she believed it would be to the detriment of those who were not in New Haven, another testament to her thoughtfulness and care.",
