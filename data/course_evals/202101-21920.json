In particle physics we covered the fundamental forces and their properties. We also covered symmetry and conserved quantum numbers"

                "This class was great because the exams were concept-based, rather than math based. The problem sets are also weighted more heavily than exams, which I prefer. I wish we got to go more in-depth during the particle physics chapter, rather than skimming past it at the end. Sometimes I felt that the lectures were a bit unclear, as it is more difficult to follow a professor reading notes than a professor writing out the lecture in front of you. However I understand that the pandemic caused limitations, and that reading through notes was the best option for Professor Baker.",
                "I think the strength of the course was the Professor and the content. Professor Baker is very knowledgeable of the subject and he highlighted the importance of what we were learning in class to real world experiments. The content itself was also very interesting ( especially the particle physics half of the class) and made the class enjoyable.  I think one weakness was the format of the class. I think in person the lectures would have been easier to follow than online"
