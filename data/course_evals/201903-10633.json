    "BEST CLASS EVER! I especially loved the observations at Calvin Hill Day Care",
    "I learned so much about raising children with developmentally appropriate practice.",
    "We learned about child development, societal problems and policy issues regarding early childhood education, different aspects of the curriculum that make a strong early childhood education program, and we were able to write a final research paper on any issue involving early childhood education (that we could back up with observations from our weekly practicum) at the Calvin Hill Daycare.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken outside of my major, and I would definitely take more. Early childhood education is often viewed lightly in America, seen as more of a daycare than a critical place for child development and growth. This is really where children start to form their ideas about the world, about their identity and about how they fit in this world. You learn about early childhood development theory, about curriculum and about a lot of real social issues being dealt with at this young age. It opened my eyes up to how thoughtful and difficult the job of early childhood education is, in addition to how flawed our incentive system is for this field. You also get to see these practices (as well as challenges) in action in the classroom at Calvin Hill Daycare Center.",
    "I learned how history has informed practices in education, and how to now adapt this historical knowledge to the state of early childhood education.",
    "I learned about the developmental importance of early childhood education and upbringing. Through observations at the preschool, I developed a greater knowledge of the different teaching practices and interactions that are most appropriate for children. I both researched and observed the different ways that children learn about concepts, physical movements, language, writing, and the social world around them. I also developed a more large scale understanding of the political and economic barriers that may impact minority children's access to education and prevent quality teachers from working in low pay early education positions.",
    "This was an excellent course. I learned about early child development in many areas including psychological, physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development and was able to gain real life experience observing children at Clavin Hill Day Care.",
    "Early childhood education theory, including multicultural and emergent curriculum, and about the psychology of young minds. We learned how to apply these theories and principles in the classroom through our observation. I learned the best way to get children to talk about their work and how to get them excited about learning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: the journals take a while to write. def give yourself more time to write them.",
    "The observation sessions are absolutely incredible.  The only weakness is that the class feels like a lecture when it should be a seminar.",
    "Strengths: Professor Horwitz (she has so much experience, is an incredible educator, and obviously cares so much about this topic, Calvin Hill, and her students); the readings (they were fascinating! there also weren't too many, and were generally pretty brief but got to the point); the ability to talk with actual teachers from Calvin Hill Daycare and hear about their philosophy towards teaching and their experience); the observations!!!!!! (We got to visit the same classroom each week for two hours and observe and interact with the students there. It was such a rewarding experience to be in the classroom and meet these wonderful children). I don't really have any weaknesses to comment on!",
    "Strengths of this class are Professor Horwitz. She is a pioneer and leader in the field of early childhood education. You can tell she just loves this job so much, she devoted her life to it, and she is continuously seeking to learn and improve more. She really fostered our personal interests in the field and had so much expansive knowledge, she pulled out readings left and right for us to look at. She is an exceptional woman and has changed hundreds of children's lives. It's inspirational and tremendous to learn from her. The active part of this course (having observations at the daycare center) really brought this class off the pages of the books into the real classroom, into the real world and really contextualized the consequences of this study. I think that was seen and felt by everyone in the class. It was also important that everyone who takes this class really cares and loves this stuff and so class discussions were always curious and thoughtful and stimulating. No weaknesses. One improvement we discussed that I just want to emphasize is having more opportunities to talk with the teachers in the classroom one-on-one. I was lucky enough to have a ton of conversations with some of my teachers, and they were some of the most illuminating conversations I've had. They really help piece together what you might have just seen, and it's very informative to hear their perspective and how they think through a response. They also know these kids so well, and often offer other little stories that give more perspective into the children and why they might have acted that way and in turn, why the teacher chose to respond in that particular manner to that particular child.",
    "The course is well organized to learning. I am hard pressed to think of weaknesses.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. Discussions were engaging and inviting. Professor Horwitz maintained the perfect balance between lecture and discussion. It was clear that she respected and critically acknowledged every student's points and opinions in class. I did find the observations incredibly useful for writing assignments, discussion points, and deeper understandings of readings and lectures. However, I wish there was more flexibility in the times for observation.",
    "Watching children for two hours a week was a lot of fun! Weakness: You should give more facts to both sides of an argument. Your opinions are very clear and it does not allow for conversation on both sides of the coin. I had many ideas that I wanted to bring up but I felt that I would be attacked very much so if I did. Still a great class because children.",
    "The observation period is amazingso fun and joyful and refreshing. Getting to know the kids was a highlight of my semester. I wished that the seminar discussions couldve had more direct relation to the preschool, but I know that its difficult to mediate a discussion of that nature when everyone is observing different things. For example, maybe we couldve had a class period where each classroom met with its respective teachers.",
    "This was an excellent course that is unique at Yale and allows you to put your learning into practice.",
    "One of the only weaknesses is that the observation is at the same time every week. It would be more interesting to be able to observe at different times to witness more of the activities the kindergartners\/other grades participate in. I also think our responsibilities and activities during observation should be stated more explicitly. The class is also very far, but this is outweighed by the strength of having the class at the day care.\r\n\r\nThe strengths are Professor Horwitz, who is probably the kindest, most compassionate and dedicated educator I have ever met. She always puts the children first and doesn't hesitate to answer difficult questions. The observation is an incredible strength - I learned so much and had so much fun being around the children. The weekly topics are very pertinent and the readings are informative. Also bringing in the day care teachers is extremely helpful and very entertaining to hear specific stories about the children that demonstrates why they do what they do.",
    "This is a great course, especially because of the observation and opportunities to talk to the teachers\/have them as guest lecturers. One improvement I would suggest is doing more collaborative work earlier on. It's a seminar, but I didn't feel like I got to know the people in the class very well. I think that would have led to more lively discussions, as I think many of us were timid around one another. I also had trouble navigating the layout of the canvas page at times. It would be helpful to have separate folders for each week's readings in case the links in the syllabus aren't working and also to distinguish them from other materials like rubrics that were collected under \"files\" as well."

    "Yes! Please take it! Prof Horwitz is so amazing! And so are the Calvin Hill staff! And the children! THE BEST CLASS EVER!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in learning how to raise children.  The observation experience is truly invaluable.",
    "YES! This is an underappreciated topic yet incredibly important class. If we had more respect for early childhood education in this country, so many social issues would be solved. Professor Horwitz is great, and the class is wonderful.",
    "Absolutely, if you are interested in children and education.",
    "I surely would. It is one of the most educational and unique classes I have taken.",
    "Absolutely! Especially as undergraduate students, it is essential to speak about issues of bias within the classroom and inequity in access to education.",
    "Yes I recommend it! Kids r so cute! It brings u back to when u were a kid",
    "Absolutely! I took it because I needed a SO credit, but it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. I learned so much and am now thinking about pursuing education in the future. I fell in love with the preschoolers and it makes me sad to think that I wont be able to hang out with them next semester. Please take the class!",
    "Definitely! Anyone inyerested in child education or development shoupd absolutely take thithis course.",
    "Yes 100%",
    "Absolutely! If you like children you should definitely take this course. I wanted to understand why a lot of my childhood memories were unhappy and why I felt a lack of respect from many adults who talked to me. I wanted to better understand the mind of a young child to better understand my own experience. I was not disappointed and learned very much about myself and my relationships. Expect to have tons of fun even if you don't have such drastic self-actualization.",
    "Absolutely. It's a great introductory course into the study of early childhood education, as well as to the study of education in general. Great for those interested in policy, development, child psychology, etc."
