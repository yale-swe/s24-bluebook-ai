   "comments": [
    "This course covers big questions about the purpose of a trial, the power of story telling, and the difficulty of overcoming prejudice. It covers trials ranging from Eichmann and Nuremberg to Socrates and Cicero. My writing improved immensely from this course.",
    "Makes you think about the trial in literature and culture, not just as a legalistic and adversarial procedure (although it certainly does not ignore this aspect of the trial). Good insight into the trial through history, and addresses broader ideas of persuasion, prejudice, and judgment\/morality\/law.",
    "Helped me improve as a writer and analytical thinker.",
    "My writing skills improved greatly due to Professor Thompsons detailed and thoughtful feedback.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. We talked about specific trials, but what I really loved was finding throughlines and talking about the big picture. I feel like I gained a lot of important knowledge about really important topics. None of my big questions about life  were answered, but this class helped me realize that they really cant be.",
    "This is one of the few courses at Yale to have changed my perspective. The reading list and discussions will cause you to consider the process of seeking out the truth and of analyzing narratives spun out of the truth.\r\n\r\nThe class made a lasting impression on me. You'd do well by yourself to take it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class discussions and readings were really engaging -- I always looked forward to them. There was a lot of breadth with the paper topics, and for the most part, you could write about what you wanted. The small class size helped to facilitate student learning. However, sometimes the questions asked were so broad that just they resulted in long silences. The syllabus could also be a bit more cohesive.",
    "Strengths. Professor Thompson is great and wonderful at leading discussion. Excellent readings. Weaknesses. Sometimes readings were quite long.  Overall excellent course and little to improve.",
    "Strengths: readings were interesting and class discussion was highly engaging. Professor Thompson's overview of how to write strong papers was very helpful, particularly her comments on outlining the logical flow of the essay before writing.\r\nWeaknesses: as with all thematic courses, we jumped around quite a bit from text to text and I felt as though we did not get enough time to dive sufficiently deep into any particular text. More exegesis around a few of the texts would have been helpful.",
    "The course feels disconnected in its various sections. The first section, which deals primarily with the Eichmann and Nuremberg trials, was what I signed up for in taking the class. The second section, to me, felt very disconnected from the first, with readings as far removed from the trial as Jane Austens Emma. The third section felt like more of a bridge, but it was a bit disappointing that we almost never talked about the state of the modern American trialand all of the structural barriers that erode the ethos of the trial today.",
    "This course is great. The syllabus is fantastic, and so is prof Thompson. The discussions were great.",
    "The course has a strong reading list. I especially enjoyed the fiction readings. As mentioned, the discussions are rich and Professor Thompson's leadership is felt and valued.\r\n\r\nI did not get that much out of Aristotle, and I think it can be summarized\/cut instead of read in full. Reading Emma felt slow to me because we had 3 discussions about parts of the novel and only one on the full novel. Of course, this is unavoidable without making each day's assigned reading longer so as to shorten the reading and get to the end more quickly. Perhaps a shorter novel would be better to allow for more time to discuss the end and spend less time stuck in the middle. Just my opinion."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I feel that I got a lot out of it. Be prepared to be challenged intellectually and to make significant changes to your writing. This isn't one of those \"life-changing\" Yale courses, but it will certainly make you think. You will grow a lot as a writer and a thinker, and Professor Thompson is just brilliant.",
    "Yes, definitely. Amazing professor, great readings and discussion.",
    "Yes, it is a great humanities seminar. The class discussions were great and the readings (particularly those on the Holocaust) were highly interesting. You will leave this class with a greater appreciation of the trial.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if their interests extended beyond the trial itself, to encompass the trial as a part of the broader Western tradition of the humanities.",
    "Yes 100%. If you love humanities courses that tackle big questions and are entirely discussion based, this class is for you. Prof Thompson is fantastic. The readings and the classes are super engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This was one of the few courses to have changed my perception and made me really think about interesting ideas. I enjoyed  most of the time spent writing my essays. The pursuit of truth, and living a true life, is something I care much about. And so I became invested in more parts of the discussion in this course than I would in other courses."
