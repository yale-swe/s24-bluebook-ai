I learned how to bring my own personal background and apply it to discussions in class.",
                "Thinking about how shows today have been influenced by the past, different collaborative styles throughout history, how to write and think critically about theatre",
                "I learned a lot about the origins of musical theater as an art form and the way it has developed over time.",
                "A great overview of American musical theater history. Developed my skills of musical analysis and writing about live performance.",
                "This course not only taught me a lot about theater history but also how to speak about the subject of musical theater confidently and skillfully.",
                "Learned a lot about the development of Broadway as a genre and how it was shaped by various cultural and historical forces.",

Great discussion of trends (conventional vs rule-breaking theatre; racism and exclusion), history, lyrics, musical form (AABA!!!), orchestration, and economic factors. Learned what good writing about musical theatre looks like and how to approach it myself.",
                "Knowledge of American Musical Theatre trends throughout its development, including discussions of form and subject matter. Ability to write about observations analytically, combining a theory analysis with a plot-based one."

                "The classes were very engaging and interesting, and there are many opportunities to participate in discussions in accessible ways. The course material is overall very interesting. It can feel like a lot of reading/viewing material at times, especially if you are unfamiliar with the shows assigned for the weeks. Professor Egan is extremely understanding and accommodating.",
                "Great class discussions and everyone felt very motivated and engaged. I wish we got to hear more about other people's essay topics because we spend all this time refining our ideas and then only Professor Egan got to hear them! The class could have benefitted from hearing everyones different perspectives on each essay.",
                "Strengths- very engaging, informative, interesting content \r\nWeaknesses- lots of readings that we didn't always get to touch on",
                "Strengths: Professor Daniel Egan is the best instructor I have had at Yale. He is incredibly dedicated to his preparation for class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only one seminar per week. Would have liked to meet twice to engage with more musicals rather than rushing through many of them.",
                "I think this course is a great survey of American Musical Theater and does a great job of showing how the art form has evolved. My only wish is that there was more discussion of American history alongside the development of musical theater history because I believe that the two are inextricably linked, and we could've done more to see how one influenced the other.",
                "Discussions were generally engaging, Dan is a great facilitator. Readings could be heavy but were generally interesting. Always great feedback.",
                "Strengths: INCREDIBLE readings/assignments varied in style, tone, and period; I appreciated the mix of written, audio, and video resources and think it contributed to a nuanced, context-driven, and mature understanding. Dan is a GREAT lecturer -- I honestly took the course because I find his way of speaking so captivating and dynamic and inspiring for how I want to communicate. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class participation felt dominant and unfocused -- I would like to have discussed more specific parts of the readings. Furthermore, I would like the chance to engage in other student's essays/thoughts about the course. Everyone came from such unique backgrounds and it would have been cool to be partnered with different students on assignments to encourage teamwork/make connections with people we otherwise wouldn't have/engage with other students on specific ideas about how to change theatre.",

                "Yes; if you're interested at all in theater, take it!",
                "Yes, I would. Anyone interested in musical theater would appreciate learning the history of the artform and its extension into the post WWII era.",
                "Absolutely. Whether you're a theater major or just interested in musical theater, this course is the perfect way into the genre.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Take it. Do yourself a favor. Now, when I see theatre, I know what I'm seeing I know how it fits into the cannon and can use analytical tools to dissect it. I have developed a greater appreciation for American musical theatre and that's not to say Dan doesn't delve into the complexities and negative aspects of the industry but I understand how not only the plot of a musical but the composition and process of making it is relevant to the story it tells.",
                "Yes. Excellent for expanding ability to analyze lots of different aspects of a work in one coherent paper; also an excellent intro to a variety of shows and serves as a reference for aspiring performers/composers/directors/writers/creators in general."
