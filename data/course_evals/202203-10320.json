                "I would self-describe myself as able to \"speak a bit of French\" now! Basically-- this course will teach you all the grammar and a good collection of vocabulary, especially vocal needed for travel and everyday affairs. I would describe my skills as highest by far in reading, in which I feel fine reading basically anything, though I probably look up 5-10 words per page, followed by writing, in which I can express most things I want to say in some form without looking things up, and better if I can look up maybe 5-10 words per written page, then speaking, which I can do well slowly but much more basically, followed by listening. Listening to the news, I can make out the sounds well and understand the gist, but would need a lot of backing up and rewatching to understand every single word even on familiar topics. Watching TV or French you tubers is more difficult since they speak casually, but I can typically follow a show's plot with visual indicators, or understand at least 40-50% of spoken language even with some speed.",
                "I started the course knowing no French at all and over the course of just one semester, I feel I have learned an incredible amount. This course and Mme. Sherak are very good at emphasizing not only grammar and writing but also listening, understanding, and speaking."

                "Excellent course",
                "I think one of the main strengths of this course is that the class usually has few students and therefore every student receives a lot of individual attention and care from the professor. The course is set up so that you are immediately immersed in the language and practice all aspects of language learning (speaking and pronunciation, reading, writing and dictation, listening comprehension, etc.) from the very beginning and throughout the entire course. I also love how we did a few things like visit the art gallery and get crepes during some of our class times to practice using French outside the classroom."

Though the course moves fast and requires a lot of dedication, if you stick to it, you will get so much out of it. Every time I think about French, I'm blown away by how much I know from just one semester."
