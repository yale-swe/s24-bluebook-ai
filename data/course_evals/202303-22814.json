I learned about these topics and their correlation to Asian Americans in STEM. I gained greater insight on different perspectives on Asians Americans that is not usually taught or talked about in classrooms, textbooks, and online. I learned how to write a research paper on a lesser-known Asian American scientist.",
                "I learned more about the history of science in regards to Asian-American scientists. It was interesting to examine the hidden stereotypes and influences in western media and culture that hide Asian-Americans form the scientific scene.",
                "I learned a lot of events and figures in Asian American history, and I was able to find that connection between humanities and science.",
                "I learned more about Asian American history and also how to read with a more critical eye.",
                "Through this course, I've learned a lot about Asian American history and their contributions in STEM that are often glazed over in traditional history textbooks and courses. This course has taught me to be a skeptic of how a story is told, and that history and science should not be taken at face value.",
                "How to think critically about Asian American history and their relation to STEM fields; how to analyze scientific papers from a historical and social perspective; how to use Zotero and Yale databases to write a Chicago-style paper."

                "Strength: Eun-joo is the kindest person ever and she made the seminars excellent. Course content was interesting and the final project was a good chance to culminate knowledge of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings got a bit repetitive in the middle of the course before becoming interesting again. Was not a 50/50 humanities to science split as advertised - not enough science.",
                "Strengths: The course is very well structured to cover many facets of Asian Americans in STEM. Plenty of time is given to work on the Final Research Project and there are several checkpoints along the way to help with progress during the ample amount of time. There were two guest lectures and one Wright Lab visit, which were very fun. There are weekly assignments which consist of short answer responses for some weeks and problem sets on physics concepts for other weeks. The assignments are very reasonable, and help with gaining a better understanding of different fields and perspectives in STEM. All students contribute to class discussion, every time the class meets.\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of readings vary by week some weeks can be very heavy on reading, while some very minimal.",
                "I think that it was a very well organized course, however the 9am class time was a bit early and I sometimes found myself struggling to wake up on time for class.",
                "I think a strength could be how there are guest speakers in the class which brought new insights. A weakness may be that this class isn't very engaging, felt like the discussion questions can be answered by one person, and there's not much to build from there. I also felt like the lecture was a lot of reiteration from the readings; I think it might be good to introduce something new or add more to the readings. I think discussions can also happen organically by just starting with how everyone thought about the readings and that can trail off to important things that we got out of it.",
                "Strengths: The course is interdisciplinary so it was cool to see some of the connections. Also, the weekly assignments helped me formulate my thought process for my final paper. Grading was also pretty easy.\r\nWeaknesses: I think it focused a lot more on the humanities side than the STEM, and the STEM was very physics-heavy (not difficult though).",
                "I feel that it could be more inclusive of diverse Asian backgrounds like South Asians and Middle Easterners.",
                "I think this course had a great balance of humanities (through readings and writing assignments) and sciences (concepts and problem sets), and it goes to show the significance of the crossover between the two.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course content was very interesting and refreshing; the history of science, especially that of Asian Americans scientists, is something that is rarely touched upon even among Asian Americans in STEM.\r\nReadings are generally digestible (with the exception of some scientific papers) and not too long.\r\nThe science problem sets felt connected to the historical events and scientific research we were reading about, and they were easy to approach, almost to the point where they felt like high-school-level STEM questions.\r\nLots of freedom and preparation for the final paper, which made it more manageable.\r\nEun-Joo is always available for students and encourages us to meet and talk with her outside of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe execution wasn't entirely as advertised; it felt more like 80% history and 20% science in contrast to the 50/50 it aimed for, though I think that was to be expected, as it's a hard balance to achieve.\r\nDiscussions sometimes felt lackluster and awkward; I think requiring responses to and questions about the readings before class instead of afterwards would have made for more engaging discussions, as it forces each student to think critically about the source before class."

A lot of material that is taught or that is in the readings would not be taught in a different class otherwise, but are extremely relevant to understanding motives behind racism and discrimination. There is also much conversation on stereotypes and unconscious racism that is interesting and important when understanding the history of Asian Americans in STEM.",

                "Yes! This is a very interesting course as it is different from traditional history courses. Especially as an Asian American, this course has led me to appreciate my roots more.",
                "I would recommend with a caveat: the content of the course was really good, but the quality of the discussion really depends on the students in the class. No offense to any of my classmates, but I felt that some of them either weren't engaged in the content or the actual discussion itself, which sometimes made the discussion feel stagnant."
