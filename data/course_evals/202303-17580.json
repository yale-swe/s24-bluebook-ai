We covered religious, political, economic, and cultural changes primarily between the 4th and 10th centuries, and were able to delve into more specific historians and intellectuals (primary and secondary sources) relating to this period.",

            "comments": [
                "Professor Freedman's lectures were very insightful and engaging, and discussion sections were extremely helpful in reviewing and understanding the material. The assigned readings were extremely long, such that it was impossible to read everything thoroughly, and instead I had to skim for the key points; however, this is not necessarily a weakness because I still felt that skimming the reading was enhancing my understanding of the material and allowing me to obtain a wide breadth of knowledge about each topic.",
                "Was a great class overall. Loved the content and the prof, not complaints",
                "The recordings were really not good quality so I often watched the recorded lectures from about 10 years ago on YouTube. I would never be sure if there were something I missed unless I watched both. Its also interesting the class hasnt changed much over the past decade. Other than that the content was interesting. Sometimes it was hard to tell what the important themes were but this was always clarified in section.",
                "The course covers an immense amount of time and vast regions in what would become parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, mostly in chronological order. The readings can be quite long and hard to complete in a given week. Sections provided opportunities to expand on the material. The exams were comprehensive but approachable, and provided opportunities to demonstrate specific interests within the material. The availability of recorded lectures on Yale Open Courses was really helpful.",
                "Although the breadth of the course was helpful, a bit more specificity might have been preferable. Courses on Byzantium, the post-Roman West, early Islam, or the Anglo-Saxons, Irish, and Vikings would all be interesting and might be able to cover more details. I felt like I did not get a great sense of Visigothic Spain, for example, and going completely chronologically made it feel like there may have been more of a gap between Clovis and Charlemagne than there really was.",
                "The course is very well structured. My only wish is sometimes the lectures could be more focused. But, it is a great course",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures, organized efficiently, and very well laid out expectations. Great reading list for the class\r\nWeaknesses: Barely any slides which made it hard to follow the class, especially during the more complex periods of the class",
                "The class unfolds in a way that gives us a taste of the breadth of history that is to be learned of this often overlooked period. \r\nThe readings are interesting as well.\r\nProfessor Freedman is a great lecturer and was accessible throughout the semester.",
                "This class has stood the test of time. Freedman has been teaching it for a while and he has it down. The TFs were also very competent. This is a well-organized well thought out class.",
                "It was taught very well, and tightly, by Professor Freedman and the TF's. The material was always relevant and was always the focus of the instructors, and the mixture of secondary and primary sources was a key strength.",
                "My TF was quite challenging and rude to students who made mistakes. I wish this class was seminar because I think I would have interacted with the readings in a more meaningful way.",
                "Strengths: great Professor and teaching team, the course itself isn't very stressful (only one short essay, a final paper, a midterm, and a final exam); very straightforward history survey lecture, but interesting material; also, all lectures were recorded, and you can also find the transcripts of Prof Freedman's 2011 lectures from Yale online; the final paper assignment was a primary source analysis paper, and it was a very valuable experience to read obscure Middle Ages texts and write a paper on them; grading did not seem very strict || Weaknesses: sometimes it was a little hard to see the bigger picture through Prof Freedman's lectures, but once it all clicked the information was really interesting (and I found looking at the transcripts from his publicly available 2011 lectures for the same course to be extremely useful to supplement the current course lectures); also a significant portion of the first half of the course is about the expansion and suppression of various Christian heresies, and while some might find this interesting, if you don't have an existing framework of understanding about Christianity you might get a little lost without some outside reading/studying"

For anyone interested in religious history, or the development of modern states, this course demonstrated not only the continuities of a very far away period, but also how technology and resources have shifted over time. It was really engaging and interesting, and I believe most history majors would benefit from learning the material.",

Anyone who wants to learn more about what happens between the fall of the Roman Empire and the high middle ages would benefit from this class.",
                "Yes. The early Middle Ages is a very interesting yet oft-forgotten period of history and was a formational one for the West.",

                "This class is designed so that if you engage with the material and lectures, you can do well. However, I recommend briefly reviewing the developments during this period, as some find the content itself interesting and others do not. There were less interesting moments or confusing parts of the course, which made it hard to engage at times. However, the papers did foster deeper understanding of the class content.",

                "Yes. This was a good course taught by good people in a good way.",
                "Yes I would. It definitely has a higher work demand than other history lecture but I think that level of engagement with the material might be necessary for true understanding.",
                "Yes, if the subject matter interests you and if you are in need of a preindustrial credit."
