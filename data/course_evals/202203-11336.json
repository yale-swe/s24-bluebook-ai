I also learned a large amount of vocabulary and grammar.

                "The biggest strength of this class was the awesome, relaxed but conducive-to-learning environment in class, facilitated by Im seonsaengnim and aided by the active engagement and interest of the students. Personally, I very much looked forward to class every day, and I think the same could be said for a large portion of students in the class, which made learning easier. Im seonsaengnim made the classroom very comfortable for people to learn and practice, especially with speaking, which made the class much better than language classes where nobody wants to talk. Another strength were the once-a-week TA sessions. My TA was fantastic and very helpful. Workload for the class was not high, yet I still felt like I learned a lot. Can't think of many weaknesses.",
                "I think this is mostly because of Professor Lim, but I don't think there were any weaknesses. If I could say one thing, when I was sick it was hard to learn over zoom (but that would be an issue with any language class). Strengths: not too much workload but you're still learning, adaptive teaching, lots of practice",
                "The strength of this course is that it meets every day, thus exposing you to the language consistently throughout the week. The pace of the class was quick but manageable; I think this course does a good job of not overwhelming you too much with new material. I do wish that there were more practice worksheets throughout the unit, but I found the review worksheet and workbook lesson to do before each test to be very helpful.",
                "It is a very engaging course with an amazing instructor. There is a lot of content reviewed and covered within the L1 level of this class.",
                "professor lim is the greatest asset to this course, he was a great professor",
                "A begging of semester overview of what will be taught would be helpful but aside from this, this course was very strong.",
                "Some strengths were that the TA sessions were only once a week so they didnt get in the way of our schedules. The class always started promptly. We got advanced notice of when homework and exams were. We got to work with our classmates a lot so that we were better able to practice the language.\r\n\r\nI dont really think there is any need for improvement besides being able to see the corrections on the workbook submissions.",
                "This course was great at exposing students to cultural information as well as language knowledge, though it would have been improved by more structured and concrete lesson progression.",
                "Loved the pacing of the class and the workload for a language class is a blessing. Very organized as welll.",
                "The breadth of this course is very large and offers many opportunities for students to practice their skills with their peers as well as their assigned teaching assistants."

                "100%, if a student has any interest in learning Korean, I would recommend this course to him or her. I feel like languages like Korean are often a more enjoyable experience than, for example, Spanish, because almost everybody in the class makes the choice to take the class as opposed to just having to take it to finish the language requirement. I enjoyed learning Spanish in my Spanish classes here, but this class I enjoyed even more and I think most people with any interest in learning Korean would feel the same. Also, very low stress, pretty low workload, and something to look forward to each day.",
                "Yes! If you don't know what language to take, Korean is a great one to take! It's easy to learn as a beginner and you don't need to know anything beforehand. The workload isn't that much and if you study just a little every day you'll be fun. I would review what we did everyday in class and that was enough to get a good grade.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because Korean taught here is not intimidating to learn at all, and with the help of the professor and TA, you get actual, constructive feedback to improve your learning.",
                "If you are interested in exploring an East Asian language or culture, yes! Take this class. Professor Lim is amazing and very enthusiastic about the Korean language and culture.",
                "yes!",
                "If another student is interested in an easy introductory level language, I would recommend this course.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! An excellent starter class for Korean!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to learn more about Korea or to students simply interested in foreign languages.",
                "Yes! It was a very fun course, although the pace of learning quickly picked up later in the semester. The grading is very lenient and the class is very engaging.",
                "Take it! One of the best language classes at Yale",
                "Yes! It is an amazing introduction to the Korean language. By the end of the course you will be able to communicate simple statements and questions as well as fluently read Hangul."
