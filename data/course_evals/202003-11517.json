                "It's difficult to do instrument lessons over Zoom, simply because the sound quality differs from what one could hear live. However, we used Cleanfeed and both had external microphones, so the sound quality was not bad. I also recorded myself and sent the recordings to my teacher to provide a clear sense of my progress. Making reeds via Zoom is also difficult because diagnosis of reed problems often relies on visual cues as well as sound, but we were able to use the Whiteboard feature to effectively draw reed diagrams."
