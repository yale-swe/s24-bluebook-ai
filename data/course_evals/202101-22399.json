We hit on each type of renewable energy, spending the most time on hydropower, wind, and solar but also covering bioenergy, nuclear, geothermal, and energy storage.  The course started out with a nice introduction to energy including emissions, economics, how the US grid works, ISO/bidding system, and key components of the grid such as transformers.  During each renewable energy topic, discussions shifted more to scientific themes and technology, while still covering environmental benefits and challenges, pricing, policy, and plant examples.  Great intro to a topic everyone should know about.",

I learned about the science behind how they create electricity, how that electricity is transmitted, upon numerous other things. If you are interested in renewable energy, I highly recommend this course.",

Content was also interesting and provided a good mix of mathematical elements and real-world topics.\r\nWeaknesses: The material is quite dense and can be somewhat boring at times",
                "interesting material, reasonable grading/evaluation requirements",
                "Strengths: Nice overview and we covered basically every form of renewable energy.  Loved the interdisciplinary nature of this course.  Very accessible even for students without a STEM background.  Great professor who cared about the students and has done some amazing work in his field.  The study sessions were very helpful to me and you can get to know the professor if you attend.  I also appreciated Professor Smith's guest lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the information on slides came from 2016-2017, which would be fine, except this field is changing so rapidly that some more current info may have been helpful. Also, I thought the final was significantly more difficult than the midterm and I felt like there were some concepts we didn't cover in class.",

                "Strengths: interesting content, extremely organized, flexible instructor, fair amount of work. Weaknesses: no field trips this year due to covid",
                "Weaknesses: lecture slides were inundated, however some were unnecessary. ~60-70 slide of lecture per class is hard to follow live because of sheer volume. Extremely different expectations and teaching focuses by two instructors made some aspects of the course challenging like on psets. \r\nStrengths: course was extremely informative and reviewed a lot about solar and wind. I enjoyed Professor Oristaglios constant attempts at showing theory in the real world by narrating how real plants operate. Course review packets and answer guides were great. Midterm review guide was even well-organized and impressive. Overall, grading was extremely fair and I deeply enjoyed the course.",

However, I thought sometimes the questions on the problem sets were subjective, or not covered in the slides, and very difficult to answer without attending office hours."

Lots of helpful study materials for the midterm and final provided by the professor.  I know this course will be even better in the future when students can go on field trips to various energy sites.",

He is super knowledgeable about the field as well. Professor Smith guest lectured a few times and they were interesting as well--though he tends to be a little more quantitative.",
