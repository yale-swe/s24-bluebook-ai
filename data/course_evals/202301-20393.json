Covered both old and new religions, and challenged the traditional definition of \"religion.\" Covered Buddhism, Confucianism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Shamanism, new religions, Islam, and more. All of the course's content was new to me as a person that has never studied Korea before.",

                "It's a breadth course for sure, and it works well. There's so many random little interesting topics that even for someone just taking it for the Humanities credit I found it interesting. Topics include how Christianity spread in Korea, Buddhist monasteries starting to switch from tea to coffee and what it actually means to be religious.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Korea as well as the main religions in Korea! I also learned about a different definition for religion that was more open compared to the standard Western definition",

                "Strengths were the selection of readings and the structure of the course.",
                "The strengths are the structure, Professor Kim's thoughtfully-designed lessons, and the engaging discussions. Not a lot of weaknesses, but maybe just the wide variation in reading lengthsometimes we had only a single paper to review and sometimes we had an entire book.",
                "Professor Kim is deeply knowledgable about the subject, and clearly has a passion for the material. I found the structure of each class  first half lecture, second half discussion to be helpful.",
                "This class was pretty disappointing to me. I was looking forward to learning more about religion in Korea having; with knowledge of Catholic theology and having taken a class on Chinese philosophy, I thought it would be an interesting intersection of other religious studies courses I have taken. However, lectures were very basic and I do not feel like I learned anything from the lectures. The readings were interesting, but the second half of every class was taken up by a student presentation summarizing the readings with discussion questions and that also was not very engaging.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the student-led presentations/discussions. Readings were mostly very interesting, and people were pretty engaged with the seminar discussions. I also appreciated how the course encouraged students to attend outside lectures on Korean religion and culture happening throughout the university.",
                "Strength is the class size and Professor Hwansoo Kim. He cares about students' learning and happiness. It is a good class. No weakness.",
                "The class was well structured with weekly assignments allowing for reflection of the readings.",
                "The splitting up into different sections was nice, but also led, at times, to everyone in class not really taking the latter half of class seriously. Most of the time people would be on laptops doing something else while others were presenting or whatnot, and this led to less interesting/involved discussion.",
                "Hwansoo is the BEST professor I have ever had in my four years at Yale.",
                "The lectures are intersting, coursework is light and PROFESSOR KIM IS AMAZING. I had no interest in the course material going in, and only took it because I heard professor Kim was good, and it ended up being such an amazing course. There are no tests or quizzes on lecture material, which means you can go to each lecture and just listen, you don't have to worry about taking notes and remembering every detail, which means you can actually enjoy lectures. The main strength of this course is absolutely professor Kim, and just going and listening to lectures was fun even for someone who had no prior interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nEvery week you need to do a short reading and write a short discussion post (300 words). Can be done in about an hour. Final project can be a 10 page paper, or you can do a more interesting project (podcasts, artwork, poems) and write 3 pages. Professor Kim is super helpful about picking topics and projects, so don't worry about this at all. \r\n\r\nI don't think you need to be, but if you are worried you can also attend guest lectures (usually 1-2 a week, about an hour and a half long) and you get 1% bonus on your FINAL GRADE for EACH ONE. These lectures can be hit or miss, but with the incentive of extra credit I found myself going to a bunch and it was pretty enjoyable.",
                "The course was extremely well run despite sometimes being at the mercy of guest lecturers. I thought the professor and TF handled coordination really well. It was refreshing to have guest speakers from different backgrounds and perspectives.",
                "Professor Kim was definitely the strength of course! He was such a great professor and so understanding! He made the class so interesting and the discussions in the class were also great! He makes the class focus more on the enjoyment of learning instead of focusing on grades! There is no weakness to this class",
                "I really enjoyed the course format! The seminar format in a larger class size works very well and they split the class in a seamless way to maximize our time.",
                "Strength: Hwansoo kim, Jusung Lee  they were so great",
                "Strengths: Super chill and relaxing environment!! I liked the structure of the class where it was a good combination of lecture from Prof Kim and student led seminars \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strength: very high level of engagement. The Professor is an animated, cool speaker who takes care to try to remember everyones names and direct the lecture in a way thats absolutely riveting. \r\nWeakness: I wish at times, we could submit 1-2 of our weekly reflections and ask for feedback. Sometimes, I felt like I was writing them just for the sake of work and they wouldnt get seen. I wish I couldve gotten some feedback so I can improve on my writing and my critical thinking on the course.",

Its really a class that is easy to gain from because it is an unfamiliar topic that addresses multiple assumptions. If you are wanting to decipher religion or Korea just a bit more, take this class. If youre interested in learning more about your Korean heritage, take this class. If youre interested in a unique outlook on religious studies in a casual, fun format, take this class.",
