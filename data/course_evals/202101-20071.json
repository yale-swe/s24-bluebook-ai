                "course format was really well designed for a virtual semester, content was always engaging, professor and TA were very accessible with lots of office hour time and quick email responses. lecture content fit very well with the weekly reading assignments, which were way more interesting and easier to understand than typical readings in other courses, all of the lecture content and assignments were very organized and posted well in advance of lectures\/due dates. pset questions allowed us to engage deeply with course content without being unnecessarily hard: if you do the readings and watch the videos, the homework is easy. the final paper about whatever we want related to the course is fun too, and also a very manageable length. class discussion did not really teach any new information than what was in the lecture videos and didn't always feel necessary.",
                "I thought that the course was designed very well. I always enjoyed attending class sessions due to the enthusiastic and relaxed atmosphere, and developed some basic astronomical and cultural knowledge that I have found myself applying in everyday situations.",
                "Strengths: The material is pretty interesting. Weaknesses: The problem sets can be a bit tedious.",
                "Weekly problem sets seem a bit unnecessary and sometimes remedial. I also wish we could have dedicated more time to and focused more on non-European sky cultures given they're inherently not as well-known by students today.",
                "This course is organized terribly for student learning. The lectures are of lower quality and depth than most YouTube informational videos, and section is absolutely useless. Problem sets are often abstruse and didnt actually develop insight or skillone literally involved counting dates to a hundred and eighty days for an exercise. No assignment here felt like it actually provided value or helped me learn except the final paper.",

You leave the course having learned some foundational knowledge about a whole range of topics (both scientific and cultural), while having a good time throughout. Dr. Faison is very easy to get along with, flexible, fair, and knowledgeable. The problem sets were sometimes a little more involved than I had anticipated, but I got a lot out of doing them - and most questions were open-ended enough that they enabled students to explore the subjects to the extent that they wished.",

The course did a good job introducing basic astronomical concepts and then pivoting to a more cultural focus. The only drawback was that the problem sets are somewhat tedious.",

The grading is often mechanical, inflexible, and sometimes wrong. The material we learned is around the level of skimming a pop science book.",
