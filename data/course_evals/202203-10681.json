                "I think this course was very strong in terms of the scheduling. The in-person class days were very engaging with helpful activities to review and having an asynchronous day to review and do work on our own was a great way to balance out the class.",
                "The strengths of this course are how much Spanish I am able to practice in various forms. The main weakness for me was the lack of feedback for large projects, which felt more like hit-or-miss.",
                "Strengths: Profesora Sab is an amazing instructor and the course was incredibly well organized, with the syllabus showing the homework and class agendas for everyday. There is also a variety of class activities that offer different ways to practice your Spanish.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Student engagement in the class can be a little low some days, especially at rougher times of the semester when waking up before 9am to get to your two hour language class really hits you hard."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. Especially if you get the chance to take it with professor Lourdes. Meeting for 2 hours every morning and having an additional hour+ of homework every night all in Spanish developed my skills very quickly. Profesor Lourdes is enthusiastic and funny. She makes the 2 hour 9am class as engaging as it could possibly be with different activities every day. There are lots of opportunities to act and be funny. If you're going to take this class, sign up to get a peer tutor and go to office hours with your professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is willing to engage in the time commitment that it takes given that its worth 2 credits.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great introduction to Spanish if you have a bit of familiarity with it before, and it teaches you language learning in a better way than if the class operated only twice a week.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is only taking 2 other classes or credits the semester they take this course, totaling to a schedule of about 3 classes, 4 credits. I took this class as a sophomore taking 4 classes/5credits and working 2 jobs so balancing the work for this class and my other commitments was exhausting and hindered my ability to 100% practice, learn, and memorize all the course material."
