Not only that, but I was able to formulate a process for my papers that made it easier and easier as I went, with the grades improving as it goes. There's a system to write a good paper, and nobility in its deviations. I didn't know how to write an introduction paragraph, conclusion, or get really deep with my analysis before I came to this school. This course pushed me to improve and taught me how to do so.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I learned how to understand a single page of literature. Last semester nearly every paper was meant to be a deep analysis of a single page. I was never too good at it, nor did I understand why we weren't supposed to go beyond that page. I was unable to really express my thoughts nor derive good ones from such little context. This class showed me how academics can truly spend months debating a single Wordsworth poem. There's so much we can get from so little.",

                "improved writing skills, analytical skills. This course specifically forced me to focus on close readings of a text without losing the bigger picture (i.e. why is this important). I think my literary analysis skills and my ability to read a text as a student of literature have greatly improved."

The texts we read in class are interesting and in general as representative of the western literary tradition as it can be for a semester long class. Katja is very good at easing discussions and encourages student contributions. She is also extremely helpful in improving my writing. No major weaknesses.",
                "Usually, a DS complaint is that we don't spend enough time on each work. However, I think this class remedied this problem greatly from its fall predecessor. The consistency of a book a week, and short works that we could really discuss greatly in the two and a half hours we had together, made for a great learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe only negative I could think of is the lectures. We did not discuss the lectures in any detail, especially towards the end of the semester. Even a brief discussion would motivate people to watch them - I feel as if they were skipped by a lot of people towards the end.",
                "Strengths: time to interact with other students in breakout rooms, and lots of breathing space because Katja is so forgiving and accommodating. Weaknesses: I feel like we focused on some specifics that were interesting, but I wish we could have talked more about the importance of texts as a whole and bigger themes.",
                "I think this was a very strong course! I especially appreciated Prof. Lindskog's extensive feedback on each of our papers and her flexibility with deadlines in a difficult semester. I think it will only get stronger when it resumes in person."

Reading and commenting on other students' perspectives further broadened my own and our discussion posts proved to be an invaluable resource when I was studying for the exam and had to go back and refresh my memory on what he had discussed about some of earlier texts. I also really looked forward to our check-ins at the beginning of class as it allowed me to share something about my day, get to know my classmates more informally, and it helped me get really comfortable speaking and engaging in this class."

This course is a nice and accessible introduction to the western literary tradition, but it also helps students think about some broader connections between literature and its intellectual contexts. Its a good way to learn to read closely and effectively as well as to improve ones writing.",

But I don't really like her style, because she really likes close reading and we only get to cover a few lines or pages of the work before we have to move onthere are just some things in the text that I'm curious about that I feel like we don't talk about. But we do love our professorso I guess it depends on the type of student, whether the class is a hit or miss.",
                "Yes, definitely! I think that this is one of the courses in DS which has a reputation for struggling, curriculum-wise (the two really being second semester literature and first semester H&P). I did not have this impression. No, I didn't get an overarching narrative from this course, but each book we read still felt tremendously important and relevant to modern literature. Plus, it's a seriously enjoyable class."
