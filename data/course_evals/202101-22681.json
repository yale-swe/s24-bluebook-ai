                "Strengths: Thiti is great. He really cares about his students and their learning. The plays that we read were challenging yet engaging. Assignments were open-ended and allowed students to focus on topics of interest to them. Weaknesses: No major ones. The virtual format could make discussion difficult at times. Texts could be difficult to understand, though Thiti usually did a good job of helping us understand the day's readings in class.",
                "Strengths of the course were the material and instructor. Thiti was super engaged as an instructor and made really thoughtful presentations for every class meeting. His feedback on our reading responses and essays was also super detailed and helpful. Reading entire works in German was challenging but rewarding--I've now probably read more complete plays in German than in English!\r\nCan't really name weaknesses: just be aware that if you're not a native German speaker that you'll be spending a lot of time looking up vocab/plot summaries to supplement the readings.",
                "The course covered a great amount of material in a short period of time, which was both good and bad.  I feel that perhaps it could have focused on a slightly narrower scope of material and gone deeper with some of the texts, considering that many of them were challenging to read in the amount of time given."
