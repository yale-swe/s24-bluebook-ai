   "comments": [
    "I really got to dig in to Chinese culture in a new way. Was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I developed the ability to apply the traditional texts of China into contemporary life through the structured discussions and think pieces I wrote. I was able to read a large amount of texts and synthesize them into concise arguments to use in class and my papers. I learned so much about traditional China through a literary sense of ideals of beauty, cultivation, and the good life.",
    "This is an incredible class. I learned a great deal about early chinese literature, but also about history, politics, and philosophy. Professor Chang is great at including personal and historical events related to what we are reading. The papers are a lot of fun to write.",
    "I learned a ton about ancient Chinese literature! With no prior background, I was a bit hesitant about taking this course but professor Chang does a great job making the material fun and digestable.",
    "I learned to appreciate literature from a time and region I had not engaged with before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love the professor and the subject matter. The way it could be improved would be having some kind of short textbook with a one pager on each poet. I really liked how much we covered but as someone who does not study the topic it would be nice to walk away from the class with an overview of the course.",
    "Strengths are the great readings and materials. Weakness is the large amount of class time taken up by purely Professor lecturing.",
    "The reading selection is great, Professor Chang is fabulous, and it definitely works as a seminar. I would recommend having a separate section; the 50 min lecture and 25 min section meant that sometimes it was hard to have a full discussion during section.",
    "Great energy and atmosphere, only thing to improve would be the organization of the lessons",
    "This course is tailored to the student who genuinely enjoys the poems read in\/for class. If you aren't into the subject matter, you probably won't find this course that fulfilling. That said, Ptof. Chang and our TA (James) did an incredible job of making the poems interesting and relevant to our personal lives. Prof. Chang is wonderful and very approachable!",
    "Professor Chang is a passionate, kind, and humorous professor who never fails to make class interesting. In particular, she always provided very thorough feedback on papers (and got them back to us extremely quickly). It provides a really broad and important look at the history of Chinese poetry and literature, stretching over a very broad era. However, at times it did feel slightly disorganized, and the readings did feel like they were blending together a bit, especially toward the end of the class; I don't know if that's something that could be changed, though, given it's a just a product of what the writing of those times was."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I didnt expect this course to be one that I would love, but after shopping and then taking it it has been one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes. To understand the traditional Chinese texts in a intellectual and applied sense is truly a wonderful journey of the mind. I loved nearly every reading we did and felt cathartic and better off by doing it all. Recommend to all those who are curious about learning life lessons and poetic appreciation, regardless of affiliation with China.",
    "This is an incredible course and Professor Change is fabulous. You learn not only about ancient Chinese literature, but also about life, history, philosophy etc. The readings are fun and very manageable (maybe 4 hours a week, you can spend more time on them if you want to dive deeper). I highly recommend the course.",
    "Definitely. This course equipped me a clear understanding of the masterpieces in traditional Chinese literature, especially on poetry. It increased my interested in this field, which has never happened in my previous education on Chinese poetry in China.",
    "Absolutely! This is one of my favorite courses offered.",
    "Yes! I recommend this class! I learned to appreciate literature from a time and region I had not engaged with before. Be advised: this course is tailored to the student who genuinely enjoys the poems read in\/for class. If you aren't into the subject matter, you probably won't find this course that fulfilling. That said, Ptof. Chang and our TA (James) did an incredible job of making the poems interesting and relevant to our personal lives. Prof. Chang is wonderful and very approachable!",
    "This is a really great survey class of the Chinese literary tradition, particularly in poetry. Professor Chang is amazing -- incredibly insightful and humorous, and she's so warm and helpful toward her students. The reading isn't at all overwhelming (though after a bit it can start to blur together a bit) and the assignments are relatively light -- three short papers spread out over the semester, with no final."
