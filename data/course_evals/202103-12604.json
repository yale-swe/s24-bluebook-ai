                "I learned a lot about the ties between Marxism and abolition. Definitely learned how to read and interpret a lot of classic Marxist texts and develop a thorough understanding of Marxist and abolitionist theory.",
                "I learned so much about different theorists and Marxist theory",
                "I learned so much about the wide range of ideas in Marxist and abolitionist literature. The class provided a critical overview of the history of racial capitalism and colonialism that I have never encountered in another class at Yale. I gained writing skills from Cecilia's helpful feedback, and I learned to question and streamline many of my Leftist beliefs. Most of all, I got to hear from my awesome classmates, who I am convinced comprise the smartest and most thoughtful people Yale has to offer.",
                "I learned how to put modern struggles for racial and economic justice with Marx's theories. I also learned about how the Black radical tradition and the feminist movement has responded to Marx and sometimes disagreed with him. My close reading skills were much stronger by the end of the course too.",
                "In taking this course, I gained familiarity with Marxist theory and other writings. The focus was heavily on Marx, rather than abolition. We engaged with texts about labor movements, liberation struggles, and capital, spanning time and place for a broad range of topics.",
                "Aided by the discussions and readings of the class, my understanding of political economy and abolition expanded immensely. It has become easier to articulate the connections between the two and I know the foundational theory that makes this articulation possible. Because of this knowledge, I am able to critique and analyze better the contradictions in society, specifically the contradictions within the (American) carceral system. I feel more prepared now to engage in abolitionist discussions.",

                "The syllabus was great, the assignments were enjoyable and challenging, the student presentations were a good way to start each week, and the instructor led discussion well. I would only suggest that, since it was a larger seminar, we could have had more small-group discussion or low-stakes activities to get everyone involved, since it can be intimidating to participate when you're new to critical theory and in a room with so many brilliant people.",
                "Cecilia is very knowledgeable and cares deeply about her students, shes invested in everyones success and cares more that were learning than anything else",
                "I loved everything about this course !",
                "This class was perfect. The only thing I will say is that you don't really read that much Marx for a class with \"Marx\" in the title. It was more like a survey course of Marxist and abolitionist literatures since Marx. The readings were phenomenal and class discussion really helped clarify the ideas. Most of my classmates seemed to agree with the core assumptions of Marxism and abolitionism, which honestly made discussion way more productive and intriguing, as we were able to get into the weeds of the different ideas. Cecilia was also phenomenal and a major strength of this class. She really listened to and pushed us when we shared ideas. Her vast knowledge of the topics we discussed was truly inspiring, and she showed she genuinely cared about us in every class period.",
                "Professor Sebastian was one of the course's biggest strengths. She was a GREAT discussion leader, and was invested in making sure everyone had a chance to speak. The presentation assignment was helpful for thinking about all of the different ways that has Marxism influenced Black freedom movements and anti-imperialism around the world. The readings were thoughtfully selected and manageable. As for weaknesses/potential improvements, some kind of discussion question thread would have been helpful for seeing what my classmates were thinking and preparing for class.",
                "The two greatest strengths of the course were the selection of readings and the discussions the class had. The readings were extremely enlightening and captivating; each selection felt relevant to the course and well defined the progression of the class' themes. Likewise, the discussions were often richin my opinion, this class provided some of the most engaging conversations I have had at Yale and I genuinely felt that I was learning with my peers. The one weakness would be that, given the consistent discussion format of the class, sometimes it felt a bit monotonous and discussions would at times stagnate. One suggestion would be to incorporate more dynamic styles of instructions such as group discussions or class activities.",
                "I expected the course to be more focused on prison abolition, but we spent a great period of the semester in the 19th century discussing slavery abolition. I learned a lot! But I expected a different emphasis.",
                "One strength was the thoughtfulness and knowledge of Cecilia who was always ready to engage on any topic we wanted to dive into. A weakness was that the material was sometimes pretty dense and it was hard to engage in the specific seminar format."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn more about Marxist and abolitionist thought. I think Yale College would benefit from more classes like this one. The syllabus is so rich. Cecilia did a great job of leading discussion with difficult but provocative questions. The presentations and two essay assignments really allow you to explore your own interests. Most of all, I feel grateful to have had the chance to learn from my classmates, who were full of brilliant insight. I cannot remember ever taking a class in which I learned so much from my peers. Their contributions and questions pushed me to think in new directions. Though the world is a cruel and bleak place, and it can be hard to summon much hope for the future, the fact that these people exist is in itself a cause for hope.",
                "Absolutely. Great intro to a lot of different important thinkers, helped me develop a clearer understanding of my own politics!",
                "Yes!!!",
                "100%, especially if you consider yourself on the Left ideologically, but even if you do not. It is wild to me that this class is in the German department but not History, Sociology, or Political Science. It clearly demonstrates Yale's lack of Marxist classes, even though Marxism is one of the most influential ideologies of the past two centuries. The people who take this class are also so amazing, and I'm sure that will continue in future semesters. I'm not sure if Cecilia is teaching this again since she will be finishing her Ph.D. this year, but if she is, do everything you can to get into this class.",
                "Yes, if you have taken Black studies courses or Intro. ER&M courses.",
                "I would recommend, if you are wanting to improve your familiarity with Marxist theory. You get a lot of exposure, and will do particularly well if you already are familiar with the texts. If the course in the future were to focus more heavily on the abolition component, I would more readily recommend it.",
                "Would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings were extremely illuminating and the class discussions got to the meat of each text. This class is a must-take for those seeking to expand their knowledge on and of theoretical texts.",
                "I would recommend if you are willing to fully engage in seminar discussion. You get out of the discussions what you put into them. The class environment is very kind and welcoming and everything that is said is met with intention and response.",
                "Yes! This is an enjoyable and engaging course, even for people who aren't super familiar with the subject."
