She also invites students to engage with the material by reading related articles and giving their own opinions while simultaneously learning about insightful public health matters.",

Although it was somewhat hard to stay engaged due to the online format, the homework assignments helped me practice my writing skills and use the medical terms we learned in context. It wasn't stressful as an online class, and there weren't any quizzes or exams throughout the course. You'll get out of it what you put in, especially when it comes to participating in class because she does not force anyone to speak and allows people to volunteer when they feel comfortable."
