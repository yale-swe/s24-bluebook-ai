This does result in a bit of monotony after about two or three months, but mostly allows for productive time management.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course lie in so diligently following the textbook. Luckily, my professor this year kept our small class engaged by supplementing materials from outside the textbook, and picking and choosing bits of the textbook they found valuable (some of the other professors in the department did not follow suit). I think this approach should be standard practice, because it truly facilitated a more productive and fun classroom environment."
