We learned film terms like long shot, POV, and mise-en-scene. I loved watching the films and hearing Prof. MacKay's thoughts on each of them.

                "Professor MacKay is a clear lecturer, but at times he is not very engaging. The subject matter is interesting, though, so it balances out. Additionally, the online format of watching the movies made it harder for people to focus on the film at hand, but that isn't anyone's fault really.",

                "This course goes very deep into film theory (at least from my perspective as someone who has never studied film before), and it never feels boring.",
                "Strengths: Professor MacKay is an awesome lecturer with an incredible wealth of of insights and knowledge. I learned so much from his analysis of the films, as well as his thoughts on film genre and history. Honestly, I would recommend any class with him. I think another strength of the class is that we watched so many cool films. The syllabus gives such a nice variety of popular movies you may have heard of (Citizen Kane, a Hitchcock movie, a Star Trek movie) and less conventional movies. One weakness of the class is that it's a lot of work to keep up with. 2 weekly lectures on Zoom, one additional recorded lecture on Panopto, watching the films themselves, readings, canvas discussion board, and section. I think it's well worth it though!!!!",

                "Strengths: Professor MacKay is very kind and passionate about the subject matter. To me, the lectures were actually a nice and relaxing break from constant work that allowed me to always learn something interesting on Mondays and Wednesdays. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: Professor Mackay is great along with the TA's that are selected.\r\nWeaknesses: Four papers was a bit too much for this course but they were all fun to write.",
                "I really enjoyed all texts and films I engaged with in the course. One suggestion would be to explore more on critical race theory and diversity in the industry, as it seems in the news that there is a new wave or approach to diversity in film production (thinking about ARRAY).",
                "Well-structured course, with clear deadlines and a fun final project. Professor MacKay explains topics clearly and concisely, and offers additional learning through smaller, pre-recorded lectures on a given topic for that week. No weaknesses really, it's a great course.",
                "I thought that a strength would be to allow for movie recommendations from the class, as I feel many kids in the class would give recommendations of movies that were similar to the content we were learning, and by taking their suggestions we could have an even broader selection of films to learn from.",

It caused me to begin to see films as messages conveyed within a certain context, whether the filmmaker is responding to world events or simply reflecting on their own inner thoughts.",

                "The online format of the film watching was a bit odd, which was my main issue with the class in regards to differences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Professor MacKay and the TAs were very accommodating of various situations.",
                "This was a great class presented virtually, no comments",
                "Having the lectures recorded was extremely helpful, since it let me return to specific information after class. Additionally, when I had to miss class, I was able to catch up by watching the recordings. However, the amount of class content was excessive. In any given week, we would have to attend two lectures, watch additional pre-recorded lectures that could be up to 50 minutes, attend a 50 minute discussion section, watch and analyze up to two movies, and read from both the textbook and additional readings. There was not a single week in which I could keep up with this workload. This is part of a larger trend of professors assigning undue amounts of work during a pandemic, something which I do not understand the motivation behind, as this adjustment is hard enough.",
                "I wish that we had been able to watch films in a theater, on a projector rather than alone in our rooms. I felt that there was really something lost by not having screenings. When I was watching the films, I found it very helpful to pause, rewind, or take breaks, although we were discouraged from doing so. Because of the nature of Zoom classes and screen fatigue, I would recommend that viewing habits like taking breaks and pausing be less discouraged so that people feel better about doing what they need to for their mental health. It just feels incredibly draining to watch Battleship Potemkin and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari alone in a dark room during a pandemic. However, the class itself translated very well into Zoom and our section was lively and helpful.",

                "Panopto lectures were far too numerous. I don't think the students signed up to view extra hours of material every week.",
                "All of my other courses had groupmes -- I don't know if I just wasn't added to this one or if there wasn't one, but having one for the whole class would be helpful for students to communicate",

As stated above, use of the media library and breakout rooms during lecture would do well in the course.",
                "Virtual all year. I thought the discussion sections went well through Zoom.",
                "I think that it would have ben nice to feel more unified and present in the class especially considering that we were so separated due to the pandemic. However there isn't much that can be done about that. I think the class did a good job of making the materials accessible for the students."

I was scared I'd find older movies boring and hard to get through, but I fell in love with almost every film on the list, from Hitchcock and Godard to Star Trek.\r\n\r\nYou can take this as a gut and skim all the readings and still learn a lot and do well.

                "yes, if you are interested in films and want to have a formal understanding of it.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in film, this is a great way to get a very important baseline in your knowledge.",
                "Yes! This course is great if you have a curiosity of film beyond just watching movies passively. This class is writing intensive though as you will have to write four papers (8-10 pages in length each).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because of all of the subjects it touches. From a student with no experience in film this allowed me to get a good taste of what is out there. I also appreciated the diversity initiatives the TFs and a guest lecturer did with the experimental films and animation, respectively. While there is more to expand on, the intention is something I appreciated in this course.",
                "Yes- anyone who is interested in film studies should take this course!",
                "I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in film\/film major as it provides key foundations for your journey ahead, but also to those not geared towards the film major because I think it provides you with an interesting take on the way the world is perceived through this creative medium.",
                "This course serves as a great introduction to film studies, and therefore I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in film. This is also a good course for those without a defined interest in film because this course succeeds in making the medium interesting and relevant.",
                "I would recommend this course if there weren't as many panopto and if the final were less intense. the intensity of the final was jarring.",
                "Yes! It was an engaging intro course, educational and accessible",
                "On campus, yes. Virtually, think hard. You'll not be as engaged as you should be just because of the in-person nature of the class.",
                "Absolutely. Great introduction to film analysis and its themes, insights, and challenges.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed watching the films each week and discussing them with my peers during section.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed it",
                "Highly recommend.  A great class to introduce people to the world of film and to learn how to view them critically."
