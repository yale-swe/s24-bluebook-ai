   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of discussion which was nice and I think the best way to interact with this material. There was a lot of reading involved, so those two things together meant that if you couldn't get around to all of the reading then you would be lost in the discussion.",
    "This class is fantastic! I learned so much about childrens literature, children, and even my own childhood. Professor Stepto is engaging and so wonderful!",
    "I really enjoyed the selected works but would have enjoyed to do a bit more analysis of the impact of the work on children and comparing it to developmental stages... or, moreover, critically analyzing the influence of certain messages on the story!",
    "This course has two main strengths: Its comprehensiveness, and the brilliance of Professor Michele Stepto. If there is a type of children's book you'd like to learn about, the chances are astronomical that you will get a chance to study it in this class. More importantly, though, Professor Stepto is a truly awe-inspiring mind. Her insights and ability to articulate nuanced points are second to none among professors I've had in Yale's English department."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, depending on how much time one was willing to commit to it. I think it can be very valuable and interesting if you are willing to take the time to do all of the readings.",
    "Absolutely! A truly fabulous class that will make you want to keep reading childrens literature forever.",
    "I think it was a fun class today and for those with interest I would recommend it!",
    "Take. This. Course. It is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The structure, the syllabus, the assignments, the professor, the workload--everything about it is fun, engaging, and intellectual stimulating. The class is what you make of it, and it seemed as though all of my classmates brought away something completely different, but equally enlightening and important. Professor Stepto is an absolute treasure. Don't miss out!"
