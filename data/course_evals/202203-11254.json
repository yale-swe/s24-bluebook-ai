                "I learned how calculus concepts can be applied to relevant biological topics. Some incredible interesting topics included phase plane making, Jacobian matrix to analyze stability, and the SIRS model.",
                "I gained a strong appreciation for modeling and the real life applications. Furthermore, by the end of the course, I realized I was able to develop models on my own."

                "The classes are often disparate. It's very different from Math 115, and the work is much harder. I hate how problem sets are almost always undoable without going to office hours. I also feel like the reliance on office hours may also lessen my understanding, because I often need someone to guide me through the problems. I'm not sure how related it is to Pre-Med but there's a lot of biology models.",
                "Strengths - Solid overview of Calc ii concepts while also making each concept feel important to the real world when we discussed our biweekly papers.\r\n\r\nWeakness - The weekly PSETs felt unnecessarily difficult compared to classwork and the 3 tests.",
                "I think it is just a great course overall, it is challenging, but it pushes you to try new things as well as approaches to problem solving which makes it very interesting.",
                "I really loved the small class size, as it allowed me to ask more questions and hence understand the content better. I also liked how accessible office hours were for this class, as it was a great resource to solidify concepts. I think the tests were a fair reflection of the course content.",
                "I really loved this course, probably my favorite course this semester. I wish there was a little more help with the p-sets in the sense that that we had more of an idea of how to solve the problems before starting.",
                "Strengths: the lectures are well-organized and the problem sets facilitate the understanding of concepts. The workload is fairly manageable and the professors are helpful with answering questions. \r\nWeaknesses: the readings on biological models are a little difficult and may require some time to understand, but they are explained thoroughly in class.",
                "I really like the style of note-taking in our guided notes that are given out to us at the beginning of class and how they are adjusted accordingly to how far we actually get in class. The discussion-oriented atmosphere with less students per session is really nice as we get to know the students better. I think that one suggestion our class could benefit from is having filled out notes or lectures on canvas."

                "If you love and enjoy modeling stuff with Math, you might really like it. I'm you're taking it simply because 1) huh the name looks interesting 2) I wanna do something that's more realistic than pure math, 115 sounds boring 3) Wow small class size, liberal arts --- then don't. I'm not sure how helpful it would be for Pre-meds. The course gives you very little time to grasp the concepts before handling out advanced homework.",
                "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in biology, neuroscience, or medicine, 116 does a great job of applying calc ii to these fields. It is certainly a \"more difficult\" course that its counterpart 115, but I found that the smaller class size and more focused material helped me stay engaged.",
                "I would probably recommend the non-Biology focused version of the course, Math 115, because for me in particular I was taking 2 other sciences courses and when Math 116 starter being almost too science-heavy it overwhelmed me in the sense that I felt as if I couldn't escape the science of it all.",
                "I definitely would. I would let them know the p-set work is a little extensive though.",
                "Yes, especially for those interested in biological sciences\/premed.",
                "Definitely would recommend this course to a student interested in biology as they of course can apply their knowledge of the material to future situations where they have to look at papers that deal with mathematical models. Even for students not interested in biology is this class also very nice to take because of how it explores very conceptual things and teaches individuals how to apply and approach things such as diff eq's."
