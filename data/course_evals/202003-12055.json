                "This course was absolutely amazing! While this class engaged with dark subject material, Professor Marcus and Professor Samuels were amazing in the way they facilitated respectful student participation that could still critique the art form in which the material was expressed.",
                "Strengths: Great professors. Dr. Samuels and Dr. Marcus are amazing people. They are so approachable and interesting, and do a great job of leading an engaging seminar.  My peers were also really intelligent and thoughtful during class which added to the experience. The texts we read and the movies we watched were often phenomenal. The ones we read\/watched that weren't were chosen intentionally. The professors did a great job of making sure we got a wide diversity of the literature and film in the Holocaust genre. The TAs were great and really really helpful for writing our papers. The class is two papers and a final exam (which is two 1200 word essays). This was nice because It felt like we were doing work but not an overwhelming amount.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TOOO many books and movies. The class is a book and a movie every week which is really hard to keep up with. Some of the books were really long and it was clear that by the end of the semester, few people were able to keep up (less people spoke during seminar discussions). Although I loved the class format for the most part, I would have appreciated some breaks in structure. Maybe an opportunity to talk to my peers in a breakout room.",
                "The strengths of this class were definitely its syllabus and professors. We had a great balance of readings and films, and professors Marcus and Samuels were clearly enthusiastic to teach the class. \r\n\r\nBiggest weakness was the amount of reading each week. Reading an entire novel each week proved to be a challenge, and I wish we had more than one class to discuss so much content.",
                "The workload of this course was heavy. I felt that we hardly got to talk about the intricacies of some of the works and that it would have been nice to devote an entire week to some of the pieces we looked at. I also found that the expectation to do two papers and a final exam was a lot during this semester in particular in which we were dealing with a worsening pandemic, a national election, and being sent back to our homes at Thanksgiving. I also felt that sometimes it felt as though we were not addressing the very real-world implications of studying representations of the Holocaust. Specifically, I wondered whether we could talk even just a bit about current genocides and how we could fight against these atrocities as so many  bystanders didn't during the Holocaust.",
                "Strengths - incredibly engaging, great content, excellent professors \r\nWeaknesses - none",
                "Strength: really interesting course material and really interesting discussions surrounding representation and testimony. I learned a lot through this course.\r\nWeaknesses: this course was often more like a lecture and it seemed like the professors were searching for the \"right\" answer instead of facilitating open discussion. Also, the final was essentially two take-home 5 page papers, which was a lot  of work and very difficult. It was impossible to finish this in the normal final time (~ 2.5\/3 hours) and a bit overwhelming.",
                "The readings and film assignments were on the heftier side, and may require top-notch planning to finish everything in a timely fashion. But they were really worth your while once you put in the work to actually do them. I also felt that there wasn't that much guidance writing-wise, but I believe that was more because the professors had high expectations for students' writing skills before entering the class.\r\n\r\nThe class was absolutely phenomenal, and a must-take for any Yale student who wants a life-changing experience.",
                "strength: great choice of books and films. great organization. great discussion. Medium workload. \r\nweakness: none.",
                "I thought that the syllabus of this course was very well done. I am glad that I was exposed to these works and thought that the discussions flowed smoothly and effectively. However, I felt that the course got a bit repetitive. I understand that we were covering the Holocaust and that all of the works described the same period, but I thought that the seminar could have been improved if it did not follow the same rigid format each day. I also feel that if other activities or formats were introduced that I would have been encouraged to participate more.",
                "I think the combination of film and literature is essential, and I appreciated how we were taught to work with these different mediums, this was of course helped by sharing the film clips during class and having the opportunity to speak with one of the actual authors of a text we read. I wish we had had the opportunity to discuss other incidences of genocide, not to make comparisons with the Shoah, rather to analyze how narratives of genocide emerge in other cultures, what were their limits of representation, etc. However, this is not the fault of the course, as we had a very brief and condensed semester with a lot of material to cover, but I think it would be interesting to see more courses like this at Yale.",
                "I thought the syllabus for this course was extremely strong. The professors and TAs were also kind and helpful. They were clearly knowledgeable about the material. We were also given the opportunity to interact with the Fortunoff archive, which was an amazing experience.  I do wish that this course provided more opportunities to discuss the works with our peers in smaller groups.",
                "Strengths: works chosen. \r\nWeaknesses : does not feel like a seminar so much as often a lecture with participation. The grading is not clear because of the giving out of borderline grades on papers (ie. A\/A- or A-\/B+). The final paper (10pgs) did not seem plausible to accomplish in the 2.5hrs frame that most finals are.",
                "Prof. Marcus and Samuels are wonderful at leading discussions. Certainly one of the best seminar I've ever taken. \r\n\r\nSome book selections are quite dry, and the guest lectures aren't very engaging (a bit too moderated)",

                "Absolutely! You learned so much in each class period and definitely left the class with a new way of critiquing and analyzing books, movies, and TV shows that deal with darker subject material.",
                "YES 100%! One of my favorite Yale courses. This is a fantastic, very engaging course. Dr. Samuels and Dr. Marcus are both great professors who lead discussions (even virtually -- minus the few wifi errors) very well. They are also both super approachable and friendly, and put a lot of energy into the course. All my peers in this seminar were wicked smart. They would say things that would genuinely blow my mind.  Basically everyone engaged in the class and material, and it never felt like it was dragging on. The material in this course is challenging. It's incredibly important we study and understand Holocaust history , and particularly the ways in which this history is presented and preserved. This course took a critical and analytical lens to the texts and films we viewed in a way very few of my Yale courses have, and I greatly enjoyed that. Having two TAs was also grreat. I felt I really got to talk through my papers, and my TA gave great feedback.\r\n\r\nMy big caveat is that this course is A LOT of books and movies -- maybe too many. Near the end of the course, as the semester got rough for everyone, I could tell fewer people were able to keep up with the books (including myself). Thus, our discussions definitely got a little worse and weren't as free flowing as in the past. Honestly reading a 300+ page book and watching a 3 hour movie in the same week are a lot. I think cutting down on that workload a bit would add to the class experience. On the note of workload, however, the actual assignments were not overwhelming at all. They included two 5-7 page papers, a final exam that was two 1,200 word essays and weekly reading responses (only 250 words).\r\n\r\nAll to say, take this class if you have the time and capacity to do all the readings and watch all the movies. If you do, you will thoroughly enjoy the course.",
                "Its a great class if you have the time and emotional energy for it. Be prepared for some pretty heavy content and discussions. The writings arent too bad, although the final we received was quite long for the time constraints.",
                "Yes. Just be aware of the workload and make sure you can emotionally handle constant engagement with and discussion of literature and films about the Holocaust for several months without a break.",
                "Yes! One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Definitely a highlight of my Yale experience for all majors and backgrounds",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in learning about representation and analyzing how the Holocaust is represented (as opposed to learning just facts about the Holocaust).",
                "Totally. Absolutely. This course was easily the highlight of my week, even despite its virtual format. I really enjoyed listening to my peers and professors share our insights on the literature and films we consumed.",
                "YES. excellent class. highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to get a better understanding of the Holocaust and the works that have been created to represent it. However, I would advise the student that it is a decent amount of reading \/ film watching and that they should be comfortable participating frequently during class.",
                "Absolutely. This course was taught by passionate professors and TAs. You receive clear and helpful feedback on your writing so that you become a better writer, watcher, and thinker. Any student who is also passionate about participating in the \"chain of witness\" and remembering the Holocaust and human suffering should take this course.",
                "Yes, I think courses like these should be required at Yale. I think it is necessary to be able to think critically about topics like the literary and cinematic legacy of the Shoah because often times we censor ourselves when it comes to distressing subjects for fear that any criticism somehow means you are delegitimizing someone else's experience or tragedy. This course taught me that you can critique films and literature of the Shoah because not all are \"good\" per se, instead they reflect the limits of representation that we so often discussed.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I would take this course for the syllabus alone. The professors and TAs were extremely passionate and kind, making the course even better. However, I would only recommend this course to someone who is ready to be highly engaged with the material because it is a fair amount of work. As someone who was interested in the course material, I found the work enjoyable, but I can see how the work could become overwhelming.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone, although I would caution that the workload is high.",
                "Yes absolutely, the discussions are wonderful, both professors are extremely insightful and encouraging.\r\n\r\nBUT BUT BUT be emotionally prepared to read some hard stuff -- trauma, tragedy, unimaginable horror. The topic is not light and you will certainly feel its weight as the course progresses.",
                "If you are interested in engaging with some of the most important Holocaust literature, this course is for you. It will force you to confront many texts and films, though often emotionally overwhelming, that are crucial to read and see."
