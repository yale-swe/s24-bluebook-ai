    "This class gives an interesting approach to German Idealism in that in frames it in terms of some religious\/Jewish thought. I thought the syllabus was well-formed in that each time I did a new reading or we moved to another topic, I felt like I had exactly the foundation I needed from the previous one.",
    "This is a great class for an introduction into German Identity philosophy as well as the general context of philosophy at the time. It covers new ways of thinking and the construction of grand structures of thought, and represents an interesting nexus between physics and philosophy. Interpretive skill is key and through lecture, readings, and papers, valuable skills are gained.",
    "I feel like Ive developed a pretty thorough understanding of the questions and issues that 18th-19th century German philosophers were engaging with, and the kinds of responses they developed for these questions. Much of the class is devoted to an investigation of the honkers and workers that furnished the context for the philosophies of Schelling and Hegel. I definitively gained a decent understanding of some key ideas of these two central thinkers, in addition to several others.",
    "Deeper understanding of continental philosophy, specifically German Idealism.",
    "Developed a strong understanding of Hegels Phenomenology, the works of Schelling, and works that influenced these two philosophers. Also subtly interacted with numerous critiques of Enlightenement ideas.",
    "This course is an excellent start to understanding post-Kantian idealism through the works of Jacobi, Fichte, Goethe, Schelling, and Hegel. While Hegel is very difficult to understand, this class gives you a pretty good working knowledge, though the class definitely focuses more on Schelling. I felt like I got better at understanding and decoding difficult philosophical texts.",
    "One key skill that I've gained from the course is the ability now to read post-Kantian German Idealism with good context. The works of Hegel and Schelling, which are renown for being extremely dense and illegible, now become somewhat more transparent with the historical and intellectual context that I've learned from the course. And as a philosophy course, the philosophical insights from this course is immense: Hegel and Schelling have such a different way of thinking than from the Anglophone analytic philosophers, and their use of inspiration from the sciences and history bring incredible relevance to doing (very ambitious) philosophy in modernity.",
    "Greater understanding of German idealism, ability to write critical papers in philosophy improved greatly, and also an insight into the larger German national consciousness; a lot of 20th century German ideologies make more sense now that I've reviewed Hegel and Schelling."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure and the syllabus could be more explicit.",
    "Professor Franks does a great job balancing lecture time (i.e. teaching) with Q&A and discussion. It would be nice if there could be a discussion section for the course, though. The readings and lecture slides are great and well-organized. Some quotes on the lecture slides were too large to really get a grip on in the context of lecture. Maybe more bolding of key sentences\/words if we need quotes this size, which may be the case.",
    "Great philosophy course on continental philosophy taught in a traditional way.",
    "The course assumes a lot of knowledge about Kant, which is fair. The class moves pretty quickly and can be hard to follow at times. Additionally, about half the course was devoted to giving the backstory\/history to Hegel and Schelling, and I kinda wish more time was spent on Hegel.",
    "Strengths: the course is extremely well-structured, and I like how it culminates at the end with the battle between Hegel and Schelling, described rather hyperbolically and dramatically by... Engels!\r\nWeaknesses: None I can think of.",
    "Strengths:\r\nVery interesting array of topics, gripping narrative about each of the philosophers, and lots of resources offered to study from.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nOnly one female student ended up taking the class out of maybe 20 or more total students, which is certainly something to think about and seems like a broader problem in the philosophy department."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class is a very solid and serviceable introduction to the systems of philosophy developed by Hegel and Schelling, as well as excellent coverage of the surrounding context. After taking it I feel very prepared to read and understand Hegel and Schelling. For the most part Paul Franks does a great job explaining the material and maintains an excellent class atmosphere.",
    "I definitely recommend. This class gives an interesting approach to German Idealism in that in frames it in terms of some religious\/Jewish thought. I thought the syllabus was well-formed in that each time I did a new reading or we moved to another topic, I felt like I had exactly the foundation I needed from the previous one.\r\nIt's also a great class for someone without a philosophy background because it is lecture rather than discussion-based, so there's lots of explanation, and opportunity to ask questions.\r\nThe amount of work is totally reasonable.",
    "Definitely. This is a great class to challenge the way you think as well as learning about some of the great German minds.",
    "If the course description and syllabus intrigue you, then I think you will enjoy this course and get a lot out of it.",
    "Yes. Those interested in the history of philosophy especially. It's a good in-depth survey of post-Kantian philosophy.",
    "Without a doubt. This course is both less and more than it promises. It is less Hegel than some would like. But that is because it is really a history of German thinking at the turn of the 19th Century  meaning that it includes Kant, Jacobi, Goethe, Fichte etc. And this is a worthy trade in my mind. The course is masterful and fascinating. Professor Franks must be the best and perhaps only person at Yale under whom to study this material.",
    "Anybody interested in being to tackle Hegels Phenomenology and actually understand it should take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in philosophy, as Hegel is one of the most important philosophers of all time. He set the groundwork for Marxism and existentialism, and you can draw parallels between Hegel and many later thinkers. However, I would recommend studying Kant first (like through Phil 126) since Hegel's work is definitely building off of Kant. You should also beware that Hegel and Schelling are extremely challenging, so don't go into this lightly. If you're unsure if you can handle big boy philosophy, I'd recommend taking one of the easier classes first.",
    "Yes. For any student of philosophy serious in philosophy cannot not know how Hegel and Schelling (and even others that we've read: Goethe, Newton, Jacobi, Sextus Empiricus) has influenced and shaped philosophy. Further, it should be obvious that it is difficult to teach about Hegel, considering how difficult the work is. Professor Paul Franks is a clear expositor of the difficult works, bridging the gap between the ignorance of the students (or, myself) and the meaning of the works.",
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in the history and development of philosophy in the West, otherwise you'll probably find the armchair science of German philosophers to be more annoying than enlightening."
