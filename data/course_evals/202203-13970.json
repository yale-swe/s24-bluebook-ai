Each class consists solely of student presentations on papers related to the course theme, in our case this was neural networks. Having taken no prior classes in machine learning or computer graphics (this course lists no prerequisites) I was completely beyond my depth in terms of understanding any of the math or code of any of the papers we talked about in class. That said, I did take away a broad understanding of which areas and topics are relevant to computer graphics researchers working with neural networks today.",

                "This course was extremely poorly organized. There was very little learning since student presented on articles that we were required to write responses to prior to the presentation. Additionally, there were no other assignments besides the reading responses/presentations until we got to the final project. It was very difficult coming up with and executing a full coding project after not learning how to actually implement anything in AI for computer graphics during the semester.",
                "The teaching style is good  the number of presentations helps to keep students engaged throughout the semester. The comments from Prof. Dorsey on certain papers are often the most valuable, as they give insight into industry and research from someone who has a huge amount of experience.",
                "I really liked the presentation projects",
                "This is not a good course. I can imagine that, for those already set on going to grad school in the particular area of graphics, that it's helpfulit lets you review relevant literature and practice your paper-reading and presentation skills. Otherwise, it's not worth iteven if you are interested in separate subfields of computer graphics or computer science.",
                "Beware that there is no \"teaching\" in this course: beyond the first lecture, there was no lecturethe only class time consisted of student presentations and guest lectures. It was clear that the only students able to follow the presentations were those with prior background in the field, aka mostly masters and PHD candidates. I would love if professor Dorsey devoted at least half of the class time to breaking down some of the papers and learning about the most useful and relevant techniques, instead of having us present on them without much explanation. It would also be great if a machine learning course was listed as a prerequisite for this class, as it is clearly necessary to understand how neural networks work before taking it.",
                "Students engage in the paper reading and discussion actively. Students develop various interesting course projects and learn a lot from each other.",
                "I feel like there should be more instructor engagement in the course as most class sessions consisted almost entirely of students speaking.",
                "Strengths:\r\nStudents have chances to get fully envolved in class discussion and presentation.\r\nThe workload is fair and helpful for students to learn solid knowledge.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe feedbacks on homeworks are not enough."

It allows you to learn about the most modern techniques in your field. The topic of this class changes every year and is always cool, modern, and exciting.",

                "It's an okay introductory course but it didn't cover state of the art methods as much as I would like",
                "Yes, especially to those who want to get an insight into computer graphics and vision research. This course is organized in the form that requires student to present their own understandings of papers in graphics. The preliminary of presenting the papers in an organized way is to fully understand the paper, therefore students can learn a lot from doing these presentations."
