I improved my abilities to articulate thoughts in a discussion and to apply readings to conversation.",

I better understand the general vocabulary used to describe ideas of spatial justice and the pursuit of a true public realm in an architectural sense. All collage and written work done in this course bolstered my appreciation of the material presented as well.",

                "The format of this course was helpful to challenging my stream of reasoning rather than challenging my notetaking ability. The use of images in this class required me to engage with images and their ideas. Sitting at a table with our professor made me feel comfortable contributing in discussion. I loved the open discussion and development of ideas that was directed by the professor but fueled by class comments. The conversation was open to all students.",
                "I think Professor Schlabs' immense knowledge and engaging teaching style was a huge strength of the course. I also took a lot away from my peers' perspectives and ideas. The readings were often also very well selected and I enjoyed seeing them fit into the class discussion.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the professor! Surry was incredibly engaging, insightful, and encouraging, and even though I had absolutely no knowledge of architecture prior to this class/had never traveled to any of the cities we were studying, I never felt afraid to make observations and comments in class. The readings, although they were a bit dense/jargon-filled at times, were absolutely fascinating (I especially enjoyed the Abidjan, Commons, and New Haven units). Occasionally, I wished there was a bit more connection between readings and seminar (class sessions mainly focused on visual aspects of cities/art) and the collage/art assignments were quite tricky to execute well as someone who hasn't had much art experience in the past. Overall, though, this was a super cool humanities credit and a wonderful start to my 4 years at Yale!",
                "The readings were always directly relevant to seminar discussions. Professor Schlabs always curated his discussions to a point where all subject material was covered, but there was still ample opportunity for abstraction from the group. This allowed for an enriching experience in understanding how different personal backgrounds affect interpretation of the built environment.",
                "Some strengths of the course were that almost every reading was absolutely fascinating to read (though some were very long) and the collage assignments were very enjoyable to do and allowed for a lot of creativity and freedom. Professor Schlabs has so much knowledge and runs a very fun, interesting discussion based class that covers so many topics like architecture, politics, protest, art and more. No weaknesses.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course helped me question space and accessibility in cities. As a person, encountering the city is inevitable, and becoming conscious of privilege and problems in the city is important for all students, not just those interested in Architecture or Urban Studies.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students as I think the professors way of guiding the classes analyses was deeply helpful and improves analytical skills across disciplines. In addition, I think the student would enjoy the content regardless of a specific interest in architecture or urbanism.",
                "Yes, if you feel confident discussing art and architecture in a seminar setting! This class was full of interesting, new experiences (presenting my artistic work in the architecture building, reading urban studies documents in the Sterling manuscripts room, analyzing modern art), and I always looked forward to attending class and hearing the fascinating insights and opinions of my classmates!",
                "Yes, this course was amazing. I recommend it to anyone that is at all interested in the subject matter.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to others. Was much better than I assumed it would be. Great for any student considering architecture or any student with a love for art",
                "Yes, I would",
                "This is an amazing, comprehensive course that is super interesting and covers a lot of cool material in a manageable way while also leaving room to foster your particular interest! I absolutely loved the course and it builds an amazing foundation for other courses but it's definitely interesting enough to take just as a standalone/introduction class. Just take it!",
