                "I am better equipped to handle college writing. I now know how to insert myself into the narrative using my writing skills. I've learned more about medievalism than any other class previously taken, and the wonderful thing is that you do not need to be well-informed about medievalism to take this course. I was able to appreciate the current example of medievalism more, whether it be architecturally or socially, just by taking this class.",
                "Going into the course, I originally saw myself as a weak writer. I always struggled putting my thoughts onto paper, but this class has changed my perspective on writing completely. I am now able to write research papers and present an argument from a variety of resources.",
                "The primary skills I developed were (1) reading: doing close reading and looking for evidence in the text; (2) writing: techniques for (mainly) academic writing but also writing in general; (3) research: how to make a research proposal and how to find and use bibliography; (4) identifying and understanding medievalism around me.",

                "I learned a lot about analysis and writing skills that I will need for later Yale courses. I loved learning about medievalism in the present and past, and nowadays I can apply these ideas to my everyday life and later intellectual endeavors."

                "The professor was very nice, understanding, and straightforward. I think the in-class activities and discussions could be more interactive to encourage participation.",

                "The readings were awesome and relevant to the course. However, you do get intimidated by the content of the initial readings because they are difficult to digest. Some readings are convoluted as to what the message is trying to articulate. This causes some discussions to go bland because the readings themselves don't make whole sense.",
                "I have no weaknesses for this course. I think the biggest strength of this course is Professor Koepke. He is always giving amazing feedback on essays and truly pushed me to become a better writer. I would recommend this course solely because of the Professor.",
                "Strengths: very well-structured; accomplishes the goal of teaching academic writing in a fun and engaging manner; a lot of valuable feedback from the instructor to help improve writing.\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any.",
                "Strengths: lots of critical reading\/discussions\r\nWeaknesses: could use more time to focus on writing",
                "Strengths: very open in engagement between students \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "A big strength of this course was the breadth of topics it covered. It felt like it fully explored the topic of medievalism. I felt the only weakness was the lectures that were purely based on writing. I lost focus during these lectures I think because there was no student engagement. These only happened about two times when we were deep in the thick of paper writing. I think that for lectures purely based on writing, the more classwide activities that go on, and the more deviation from the powerpoint, the better.",
                "I loved the use of Perusall and how it was able to let students participate with each other virtually. I also loved the subject matter and how each week corresponded to a different type of medievalism within pop culture. My favorite part was the screenings we would have of certain films and television series and how they would affect our next class. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would suggest would be a place where students could begin their research on a certain subject matter for their research papers, as some subjects, such as medievalism in video games and music, was hard to find even using university resources. However, it wasnt impossible, and this is only a possible suggestion to get started on research."

                "Definitely take this class to improve your writing for college. You do not need any knowledge of medievalism, Professor Koepke is amazing and understanding of his students. You will learn more at the end of class than you realized. You may even notice that the answer was right in front of you the whole time.",
                "Please take this course! We were able to read many articles on medievalism that truly pushed my thinking. I originally had a very limited view on medievalism, but this introduced me to a complete new world. In addition, the readings are not super long and a delight to read for discussion.",
                "Definitely! Will greatly help improve reading, writing, and research skills, and is also interesting and engaging.",
                "I would recommend it. It opens your mind on how to engage with historical topics. Also, Professor Koepke is very diligent with his writing feedback and course activities.",
                "Yes, a course that offers a different perspective of the world and is enjoyable",
                "Yes. It really tickled my brain and explored topic i was super interested in like card games and board games.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It wouldnt matter if they know a lot about medievalism or not, because the subject matter in the course was so interesting it kept me enraptured. I loved the course, and I implore any student to try this course."
