                "Strengths: knowledgeable TFs\r\nWeaknesses: not enough practice questions for exams",
                "Strengths: Doesn't require a large amount of week-to-week engagement. Generally interesting material. Focus on climate change is fascinating and extremely valuable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections. This course should not have section meetings. They are almost a complete waste of time. A format where TFs hold an extended group office hours one day a week, such as on Sundays from 1pm-4pm, where students can go discuss the lectures and ask questions about the material, would be far more effective. Another weakness were the exams, which varied drastically in difficultly (exam 2 being absurdly difficult relative to exams 1 and 3) and were graded unreasonably stiffly by the TFs. \r\n\r\nCourse would be dramatically improved if one midterm exam were removed and instead replaced with a creative project or presentation that students could research, complete, and present in section. This would have the advantage of both eliminating the unnecessary 3rd exam and making section meetings even marginally useful or stimulating.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe TAs - they were all so knowledgeable and helpful, section was well thought out and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nThe material - the course covers a broad range of topics such that I do feel I have learned a lot. \r\n\r\nExams - these exams feel like they break the course up nicely, I appreciated not having giant cumulative exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nChanging Professors - this was a very difficult part of this course for me. I felt that once I had learned how to learn from someone, there would be a new professor. While all were very knowledgeable in their fields, I think that the neurology and virology units were a bit difficult to parse due to lecture style. \r\n\r\nExams - these were also tricky die to how the course was broken up. The first exam was great, it covered all material taught in the first unit. The last two exams were over three units and I found it hard to switch gears between teaching styles, content, etc. Ideally these would correspond to a unit, so there would be four exams.",
                "I feel like lectures moved quickly and most of the time, I learned better studying lectures on my own than in class.",
                "I think the exams should come with a study guide since often times the information that was rarely mentioned in the lectures made up a majority of the exam. I also think that each lecturer should be required to provide the information needed to answer the learning objectives at the end of each presentation as a way for students to study.",
                "This course was great in the discussion sections where it talked about the social net impact of using different scientific technologies but its weakness lies within the amount of material within each lecture and it gets very difficult to keep up with. I found the exams to be difficult because I did not take biology in high school and because the exam was memorization heavy, which was not my strong suit. However, for someone with good skills in memorization, this class might be good for them. I wished the class had psets that served as review and for that to weigh in our grades instead of the exams weighing 60%.",
                "Cool to have rotating lecturers. Sometimes a little more consistency between them would be nice",
                "Interesting, get to hear from many different professors which is cool",
                "Lectures were not very engaging, but section was very engaging",
                "Strengths: the different instructors and topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures werent always very engaging",
                "The main weakness of the course if the inconsistency of the difficulty level. Some topics and lecturers were easy to understand, while others were less thorough.",
                "I think conceptually the idea of highlighting the social aspects and impacts of biology is a good one, but I didnt feel like those themes were emphasized as much through the assessments which focused heavily on simply memorizing scientific facts and figures.",
                "I like that we had different professors. I hate that the tests were on wednesday.",
                "This course provides a lot of great information, but with that being said it is a lot of information. It felt as though there was so much going on that the main objectives were sometimes unclear.",
                "Sections have no connection to course meterial they feel like a waste of time",
                "Lecture slides were well put together",
                "This course definitely provides a simple introduction to Biology for non-science majors. The learning objectives and variety of lecturers and perspectives was helpful.",
                "To further the exploration of various biology perspectives, my discussion section was amazing, and I was able to have an interactive experience through asking questions to guest speakers and touring the Peabody Museum.",
                "I think this course could be improved with providing better practice materials",
                "Honestly the course is pretty good as is.",
                "some of the concepts are pretty hard, despite being for non-stem majors. Some things were not as simplified as they could have been for an intro level class. The prep and support for the units on neurons, for example, should not have been as in depth as it was.",
                "Strengths: genuinely interesting\r\nWeakness: some lectures were repetitive",
                "Strengths: Processes are presented in understandable ways and tests are pretty fair as long as you've thoroughly reviewed course content. Sections also cover super interesting topics and don't add extra stress to the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there are different instructors, you have to adjust to different teaching styles throughout the semester. They also vary in how much information they put on slides.",
                "The strength of this course was the section material that we would go over every week. It was great to have a seminar to discuss key concepts that we learned in lecture. The weakness of this course was not having more consistent assignments to keep track of my learning.",
                "Strengths-structured lectures with clear key takeaways\r\nWeaknesses- the discussion sections were often unrelated to the lecture and not examinable",
                "The lectures could be more engaging considering it's an intro class",
                "I really enjoyed the class so I dont have any weaknesses to describe.",
                "The course was great! I kind of felt the first unit less directly applicable to policy related questions, but I understand why we started with it nonetheless. I think there should be clearer instructions about what to study before the first exam (eg. What experiments are important to remember about for the exam).",
                "I think one strength was our conversation during discussion section. I really liked debating the ethical concerns surrounding interesting topics like gene editing and vaccines. However, it was frustrating at times because very often the conversation we were having in discussion section did not have anything to do with what we were currently discussing in class. Thus, although I was interested in the topic I often wondered why I was learning this material if it did not correlate with our class discussion.",
                "I liked the course structure.",
                "There could be more opportunities in section and outside of class to review the material and prepare for exams.",

                "Well organized, fair workload, fairly engaging professors.",
                "Strength is wide ranges of topics covered. Weakness is inconsistency in course load due to numerous professors.",
                "very good overview of subjects! unfortunately sometimes felt like professors were reading directly off the slides",
                "For the last two exams, there was a lecture of material covered two days before that was not included on the review sessions. There could have been better review for that material, or that lecture could have carried over to the next exam.",
                "Lectures werent recorded, pure memorization for exams so if you like that then this class is for u",
                "Overall the course was very strong, although the sections sometimes were somewhat not very related to the content in lectures and tests.",
                "I really do think lecture can go over my head sometimes, especially during the pain unit. Most of the content I had to teach myself.",
                "Strengths: Well directed towards non-science majors. Weaknesses: Some of the lecturers were more engaging than others, and one went really fast.",
                "They made great applications to the real world and how we can apply this knowledge.",
                "- strengths: a lot of interesting content, good sections\r\n- weaknesses: too much content in lectures, not enough review,  focus on memorization, no constant update about progress in class",
                "The course covered a broad range of topics that were very interesting, although given this broad expanse of information, the exams covered a lot of material which was difficult to study for. Additionally, discussion sections covered their own discussion topics rather than the material covered in lecture, so clarifying the material from lectures was a little difficult.",
                "Strengths lay in the lectureres, the structure of the exams, and the guiding questions at the start of the powerpoint. Weaknesses lay in the sections and the lack of consistent difficulty level across the different lecturers.",
                "I LOVED discussion section and felt that the activities and guest speakers were an especially engaging part of the course.",
                "I think its cool how the course has several units on topics very relevant to our lives and that our discussion sections bridge topics to ethics and our daily lives",
                "Strength: non-cumulative exams\r\nWeakness: discussion sections could cover more direct content from what we learn in class",
                "strengths: i was in the \"experience science\" section, which is one of the best sections i've had yet at yale. i really enjoyed exploring more of yale as well as meeting experienced researchers in different fields\r\nweaknesses: most of the lectures were not too engaging, but as long as it was relevant to exam content, it was okay",
                "Love the course structure and the discussion sections are very beneficial.",
                "strengths: some cool topics, some good lecturers\r\nweaknesses: you think this is going to be a gut and then its not which is annoying. One guest lecturer was also absolutely abysmal.",
                "I felt like I wasnt learning in class so I stop going the teachers would just read the words on the slide and move on",
                "I honestly really liked this class, despite having heard from many people the contrary. I learned about a lot of things that I feel like should be just basic knowledge. I'm really grateful for having taken this class; I gained a lot of knowledge not just from the lectures but from my discussion section as well, both of which were very engaging. I also felt like the exams were very appropriate for the class. Yes, they required some studying, but they weren't impossible at all. All of the questions came basically directly from the lecture slides, so nothing asked was a surprise.",
                "The interactive discussion section was absolutely amazing! It allowed us to see many parts of science at and around Yale, and the instructors were extremely understanding of all of our questions which further developed our interests. Having 4 professors teach the different course topics was an interesting change of pace yet aided in differentiating the material and generally worked well.",
                "The lectures were irrelevant to the course since the speaker frequently (almost every time) read from the slides word for word, adding little to no outside commentary or explanation.",
                "The strength is how organized the course material is. The expectations were clear and that was very helpful for me to study and engage with the material.",
                "I really liked the course. It was so accessible - the course felt very welcoming, and like no matter my previous knowledge I could show up and do well. I liked the exams, they were very straightforward, and I felt like I knew exactly how to study for them. The information we learned was interesting, and I especially liked the more interactive elements, such as the active learning activities we'd do with Professor Paulsen. I wish that the other lecturers incorporated more of activities like this in their lectures, that would have made it more engaging! I also thought the whole unit on COVID was not as engaging, since we have all already lived through Covid and don't want to hear any more about it. That being said Prof Zimmer was a good teacher, and I did like learning the language about mis and disinformation. My favorite part of the class was the experience science section! The highlight of my week.",
                "I think the exams should better reflect the content discussed in class and discussion sections, it seems the exams were much more biology focused and sometimes questions were hyper specific on topics lightly covered in class.",
                "Overall, it was a great introductory course. The first and last sections (intro to cell life, climate change, and COVID-19) were fascinating and well-taught! The neurons section of the class was NOT it. The lecturer flew through the dense material without much explanation of the content. It was difficult to understand and the one weakness of this course.",
                "Strengths: It's...relatively easy to do well in the course. All of the necessary information you need to pass exams are included in the \"learning objectives\" included on each slides presentation, which was SO helpfully when it came to organizing information and studying. The slides were a great resource to have to return to after lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The way that the exams were timed throughout the semester, I would have 3 drastically different topics on the same exam, which would make studying sort of time-consuming and difficult. The questions on the exam would also sometimes ask quite specific questions instead of broader questions that would better reflect my learning.",
                "A strength are the section activities. There were some well-structured debates. A weakness is the clarity of the lectures. It can be hard to tell what is super important and what isn't when taking notes in the moment."

                "Yes, good course to take for non stem majors",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. Studying for exams (there are three midterms) requires significantly more time than expected and does not translate into better scores, as 95% of the course is just memorizing and regurgitating information.",
                "Super easy. Would recommend. Make sure you study for the exams, but they are not that bad.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a science credit and is curious about the material. This is not a work intensive course, and you can engage with it as much or as little as you like.",
                "Yes I would, it wasn't a class that caused me major stress, but I also feel I learned a great deal.",
                "It is somewhat of an easy science credit for those with no prior experience in college level science. I did not feel like I needed to have taken AP Bio before taking this class. The exams do require a fair amount of studying beforehand and some of the lecturers are not the best at expressing the main points that students will need to know. Overall, if you need a science credit I would say take it.",
                "I would recommend this course only if someone either has a background in basic biology already or is really good at memorizing details. The exams are very detail oriented, and you need to be able to write down more specific details rather than just the basis of how processes work.",
                "Not if this student is looking to take a science course for non-science majors. Some of the information was useful for anyone which is what I was looking for in this course, but some of the information that was taught was hard to understand for any non-science major and I don't feel like I need to know it whatsoever.",
                "Yes if you want a science credit that's not much work besides 3 exams.",
                "Yes, interesting and not too difficult",
                "yes",
                "Yes! If you are a non-STEM major this is definitely the class for you. As someone in a humanities major with no background in science, it was pretty engaging and interesting, even when I did have to put in some work to understand the more scientific side of things. I honestly enjoyed it.",
                "Yes! This was a wonderful survey course in  recent Biological topics. I also thoroughly enjoyed the experimental science section, which allowed us to take part in various scientific endeavours around campus.",
                "Yes, good science course and broad range of topics covered.",
                "Yes! This is a great science course for non-science students, but only if youre willing to put in the effort",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who want an easy GUT science credit and students who are interested in biology. I don't think I would take this course again because I'm not that interested in biology and I think I could have found a different course to fulfill a science credit which I found more interesting.",
                "This is not a gut. If you want to do well, you need to study for exams. However, if you keep up with the class, it is very easy to be successful. There is no final exam which is great. A lot of the content r like climate change and Covid is already known in general so there will be less studying there.",
                "Yes and no. I am neutral to recommending this course. I think it had its positives and negatives, but overall it was a fine course.",
                "Yes for students interested in science without developing the technical skills associated",
                "Yes, great class to fill a distributional requirement.  Just need to study for the exams",
                "I would recommend to non-science majors because the course gives scientific insight in a way that can be applied to writing.",
                "Yes. If you are a not a biology or any science-related major and looking for a science class that is interesting, I recommend this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is thinking of taking a science major path at Yale. To get a good understanding of baseline biological science",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of foundational science stuff without being overwhelmed.",
                "Not if they are expecting a gut. Some sections are definitely more challenging than others and require more knowledge about biology.",
                "Absolutely, if you're looking for a science requirement. The lectures are pretty distilled and comprehensible, and the course organizers and lecturers do a good job of making sure to highlight what is important to learn so you don't get bogged down in details and unnecessary information.",
                "Absolutely. As long as you attend class and pay attention it is not too challenging",
                "yes! science credit that was thoughtful but not overwhelming for a non-stem major student",
                "I think I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in the time to engage with the course's content. There are science classes out there that have similar workloads and more niche topics that I'm sure can more specifically cater to someone's interests. However, I think you really get out of this class what you put into it. Grading is fair and as long as you don't write this class off as being super easy and not worth studying for then you'll do fine. It also didn't add significant extra stress to my semester. I invested the most time into this class when we were nearing an exam which is to be expected.",
                "I think this is a wonderful course for anyone looking to get a broad education in interesting biological topics. I had a great time learning about the various topics covered in class and feel like the instructors all did a good job explaining their content to the students.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is an insightful course that gives you the ability to question how biology impacts our world.",
                "Yes! Its a great way to get a science credit while having enriching dialogues about how science impacts society",
                "Yes. Good easy science class",
                "Absolutely! As someone who hates science, it made learning about science do practical and necessary for understand major issues in everyday life like climate change and COVID-19. Everything I learned felt like it had purpose.",
                "Yes. Its a great science class for humanities and social sciences majors.",
                "I unfortunately do not think that I would recommend this course to another student only because the formatting was a bit confusing for me. It was a bit frustrating how the discussion sections did not correlate to the conversations in lecture. It was also a bit jarring for me occasionally when we would have fairly easy understandable lectures and then suddenly an extremely complicated lecture that utilized scientific terms that a lot us didn't recognize without explanation. The structure of the course just made it a bit challenging for me to comprehend all the material.",
                "Yes, its a great intro into a number of scientific areas from which students can branch out into other areas too.",
                "Yes, I would. I would encourage them to increase their engagement with the material however possible, but also recommend the course because it is a great opportunity to learn comprehensive biology.",
                "Yes. Good overview of scientific concepts without being too difficult",
                "Yes, its a straightforward and relatively easy science credit.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone. Whether you're in need of a science credit or wanting to take an intro level biology course.",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, if you want to learn more about bio and applied situations. Exams are purely memorization from slides",
                "Yes, especially for students who are not stem majors, it is a great way to gain a working understanding of biology in everyday context.",
                "Yes! If you enjoyed bio in high school but havent done it since, this will be great. Its fun and worth it to study with friends so try and take it with friends if you can",
                "For sure, if you're looking for a chill course to fulfill a science credit, you should probably take this. Interesting climate change unit, I really hope they keep that in.",
                "I would recommend this course to none stem majors for a basic knowledge of biology.",
                "helpful if you want to know basic concepts of bio on surface level; do not take if you want to go in depth on one topic and if you like to monitor your grades in this class because they do not use canvas",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, given the understanding that the course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time, so it is time consuming to prepare for exams.",
                "Yes. I thought this course was very informative.",
                "Yes, but only because I find it very hard to find enjoyable & not overly challenging science credits at this school",
                "Yes! I think it's great for anyone who wants a solid foundational understanding of biology, especially for those who aren't STEM majors.",
                "Yes Yes Yes. A gutty science for sure.",
                "Yes, I feel it is a great science credit with material that allows you to stay engaged if it is not in line with your planned major.",
                "Yes if they want to learn about personally relevant biology and a course that is not too demanding.",
                "I think so, the topics we discussed in the class were interesting and most of the lectures were engaging. The tests were a bit challenging, but most of the content on them was expected",
                "yes!! especially for students who may have loved high school bio but didn't want to take the biol sequence here at yale",
                "Yes, for students wanting to explore multiple avenues of biology and its impact on the world.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who needs a science req!",
                "yeah its a fine science credit, but there are probably better options that are more engaging",
                "If youre looking for a fun class then no",
                "Yes!! If you need a science credit and aren't a STEM major, I definitely recommend this course! It's literally tailored for non-STEM students, so it is very accessible for people who don't have a big science background. I think it was a pretty easy class, and you learn about a lot of interesting things.",
                "Would definitely recommend it, especially to a non-science major looking to gain a general understanding.",
                "Yes, because the class material is interesting with a flexible workload.",
                "Yes, this is a good course for non-science majors. It does require some effort but it is not overwhelming and very doable. The content is well-taught and I feel more confident in my ability to consume scientific news and to be an informed citizen in our age of pandemics and climate change.",
                "Absolutely! I am the hugest fan of bio the world and us. It was fun, accessible, and insightful! It made me feel confident again about science - and like oh yeah science is something I can do! All the other STEM classes I have taken at Yale have been discouraging, and have made me feel like an imposter, but in this class I felt celebrated, and welcomed into the field.",
                "Yes! great science credit and intro to biology with a focus on how they affect us. Topics were very engaging!",
                "Yes! Good basics to know. Fun science credit.",
                "Maybe? While I do feel I learned a lot of interesting information on certain topics (neuroscience, drug use, etc.), lectures weren't always helpful and it would feel a great deal of my learning had to happen outside of the classroom. This course is traditionally thought of as a gut, and while that may be true as far as lecture attendance goes. students HAVE to study pretty extensively for exams. I do feel there are other more compelling courses to take to complete the science requirement, however if a student ends up having to take this course, its not...terrible.",
                "I would to a non-science major who needs a science credit, which is how the course is advertised."
