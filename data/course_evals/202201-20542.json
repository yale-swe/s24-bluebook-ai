                "This course gave me a new ways to look at and think and talk about, well, anything. The course, which started out super nebulous, ended up manifesting in fascinating conversations on topics from Kanye to Climate Change. More so than any other course I took this semester, this course captured my thoughts and dominated my conversations at dinners.",
                "I learned a lot of theory about thing power and materiality. A thing was a word that I didn't give much thought to before, but know I realize holds so much meaning.",
                "This course was in an area where I had very little prior experience. I developed a literacy in this unfamiliar academic world and learned how to discuss topics of religion and philosophy with others.",
                "I learned how to digest and apply complex philosophical theories to situations and events that I encounter in my everyday life.",
                "This was a great class. I learned to think critically about material objects and human interactions, as well as the ways that material objects communicate religious significance. The course professors and students fostered a positive discussion space.",
                "Was exposed to different perspectives and novel ways to view this world.",
                "A lot of this course is about materiality - i.e. how things manifest themselves\/have power in the world, and how ideas (e.g. religious ones) are inseparable from the ways they are physically manifested. For example, one of the projects we did in this class was a podcast assignment in which we embodied a thing and talked through the experiences the thing might experience, the ways the thing was entangled with other things, and the ways in which the thing was critical to the fabric of things it was situated in. For example, a pencil might be a thing which is necessary for writing things, without which a student might be powerless (or much less effective at) writing things; but it can also be an agent for artistry (doodling), and what is a pencil when it can no longer write anymore? What truly defines a pencil? - And the pencil is also the result of wood being cut and processed into a pencil, and also the practice of notetaking (the physical act of taking notes is a practice which is not just a result of learning but an embodiment of it), etc. - This might not be the best example, but my point being that what I learned from this class was to have more appreciation for things and the ways we interact with things in the world, and the way our lives are necessarily tied to things and physicality. - Talked a lot about thing theory, entanglements, emotions as practice, and studied different case studies, e.g. how Kanye West or Goldman Sachs can be studied as pseudo-religions, and the ways in which they have physical manifestations of their religious-esque ideas, etc.",
                "The course gave me a new perspective on the ways we classify objects as animate or inanimate and generally altered the way I perceive my surroundings and my place in them. With discussions of materiality, archaeology, and religious implications, it offered a unique perspective on embodied spirituality."

                "I think the main strengths of the course are Dr. D and Professor Angelo. They were so kind and interesting, fostering friendship and conversation, it was remarkable. I think the scope and scale of this course are amazing. We had people providing profound insights rooted in things such as quantum physics to Russian literature on a huge array of topics. The overall structure of this course, where it started with general theory and then went into case studies, was helpful for this. I really can't think of any improvements; the course was awesome!",
                "Strengths: fun assignments, interesting content, engaging discussions",
                "The course did a great job of facilitating conversation between students despite the difficulty of material. The readings were reviewed in depth which was necessary in my opinion. It might have been nice for the first class to be more of a crash course introduction in the field so that the beginning readings aren't so intimidating.",
                "The strengths of this course were first and foremost Professors Davis and Angelo--their kindness paired with their respective expert knowledge about ancient ritual and archaeological practices helped to ground the theory of this course in historical religious settings. I also really enjoyed the assignments for this course---they made engaging with the material very fun and low stress, which I greatly appreciated because a lot of the material was really difficult to wrap one's head around without a formal sociology or philosophical background.",
                "great professors, positive group discussions, interesting course material",
                "Really enjoyed our conversations, especially the small group conversations",
                "Strengths - the topics are definitely very interesting, and the ways in which the students were asked to reflect on their own experiences and bring them to the classroom helped engage me in the content. I also thought that the assignments were reasonable and thoughtful - one was a podcast through which we embodied an object, which helped me apply the ideas in the course to a very particular case; and the second was a creative project, which let me apply the ideas we learned to something I cared about. - In general the workload\/readings were reasonable. Dr. D and professor Angelo both are very knowledgeable about the content matter, and have a lot of things to say and connect to the material. Weaknesses - I do think that classroom discussions could have been centered around student voices more - as I said, Dr. D and professor Angelo have a lot to say, and it is valuable; though I felt that them responding to each student response in a class discussion disrupted the flow of student voices sometimes, and I did feel that having students speak for longer before the professors synthesized \/ helped direct the discussion would have benefited the discussions. Overall, however, I thought the class material was interesting and on the whole the class was interesting, and I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: The materials we looked at were really cool. I loved that the class looked at religiosity and materiality from so many different perspectives and through the lens of so many different cultures, as it kept the discussions fresh. The teaching team was also amazing; the two's approaches to teaching worked well together.\r\nWeaknesses: The more complex philosophical texts could get confusing and felt over my head at times, but the professors did a good job of grounding those more abstract topics when the students expressed that we were having trouble."

                "Yes! Gives a fresh perspective and I think a lot of students would benefit from this new way of thinking",
                "This class definitely made me think of the world differently - I didn't realize how much I disregarded the material aspects of the world until I took some time to think about things and the ways they're deeply tied to my existence. - The course is definitely very accessible, and very personally applicable, which I appreciated and found relevant to my own life. Take this course if you want an introduction to religious studies, or if you want to think more about materiality and the ways life is necessarily physically manifested, etc.",
                "Yes! It was completely new to me, but the discussions were consistently engaging and the material we covered was interesting to someone who's not at all involved in the field. You could tell that the professors cared about what they were teaching and genuinely wanted to hear student perspectives.",
