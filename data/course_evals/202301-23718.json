                "I learned a great deal about the lives of women from various social groups in medieval Europe, as well as their place in literature, religion and art. I also improved my ability to read archaic Italian.",
                "This was a terrific class! As a lover of history and women studies, this class introduced me to so many amazing women and their accomplishments, some of whose texts I willingly engage with outside the classroom setting.",
                "I improved my ability to read and analyze primary sources! I also gained insight about historical bias and interpreting secondary sources.",
                "Learned how to examine and analysis history papers and write one.",
                "I learned about religiosity and society during medieval Europe. I learned how to engage critically with primary texts (letters, poems, and other manuscripts).",
                "I learned so much about women in the Middle Ages- both conceptions of women by men and broader society, but also how women conceived of themselves in their letters, books, and other writings. We spent a lot of time analyzing primary sources, which was incredibly interesting, and also doing comparison of texts. I think my close reading skills really improved and my knowledge of the Middle Ages was expanded quite a bit."

                "Lessons were engaging. Presentations were a good way to learn from fellow students. Reading responses were helpful in understanding the texts. Guest lecturers provided additional insight into the material. Classroom discussions were productive, although some students talked too long and too often.",
                "Strengths: Professor Pellegrino is one of the loveliest I have had the pleasure of learning from. Her genuine passion and excitement for the class (both topic-wise and student engagement wise) make the class much more enjoyable.",
                "strengths: great selection of readings and women to discuss, helpful homework assignments to work on writing skills\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more guided discussions, a framework for what we should look for when we're doing the readings",
                "The discussions were thought-provoking and engaging! I loved the readings and the final paper assignment!",
                "strengths: diverse syllabus and appropriate reading load\r\nweaknesses: discussion was sometimes hard to engage in",
                "Honestly I don't think this course had any weaknesses! Potentially a smaller class size would be nice, but everyone in the course contributed meaningfully. The presentations were a nice way to learn historical context for the women that we discussed in class, and the discussion posts actually mattered and weren't just filler assignments. The primary sources and other readings assigned were a manageable length and were all impactful."

Even if you aren't super interested in the Middle Ages, this is a great way to learn about women in history, even those that are not the most well known. None of the work is overwhelming and everything is super well communicated to students, plus Professor Pellegrino was really flexible and accommodating. The guest lecturers are also very knowledgable and provide great insights to the texts."
