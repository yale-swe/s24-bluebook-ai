Overall a wonderful experience.",
                "The way that the concentration project is largely self-directed could be a strength or a weakness, just because there are not many other Yale assignments like it, so it can involve a pretty big adjustment to the way that you work. Every advisor approaches the concentration in a slightly different way, and my advisor was perfect for me, so it worked out very well."

There is so much room to grow as a writer and collaborator, and presenting the finished piece at the concentrator's ball was one of the best experiences of my senior year.",
