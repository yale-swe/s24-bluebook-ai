Although not all new topics for those with a mechatronics/control theory background, this course truly enriched/enforced topics such as the Jacobian, similarity transforms, stability analysis, etc. As you might expect from any graduate level course, it also exercised the ability to traverse through math-heavy material without panic.",

                "The strengths all come from the fact that Prof. Venkadesan truly enjoys this material. The structure was centered around providing enough understanding to work through a seminal paper's data as the term assignment--however, this structure was flexible and Prof. Venkadesan was very open to listening to students to gauge what we wanted to get from the course. I have very few notes for what could be done for course improvement, beyond the midterm. I believe the midterm did a great job of both testing knowledge we knew, while throwing curve balls asking us to intuit further. I think as a graduate student with possibly less concern for grades this is a fantastic approach, but I could see that this may be concerning for an undergraduate. The course as a whole truly embraces learning for the sake of gaining knowledge, which I was a fan of. While homework assignments are thorough, they are fair and where I truly began to embrace the math required for the course.",
                "It is difficult to say how to improve since it is such a unique and specific course. Although the material was challenging, it is mostly because it integrates a lot of math and physics knowledge detail that we need to review. Great course, but I just had to recall details of classes that I had not taken in years."

                "I believe this course is fantastic if you have any desire to know more about dynamics, control, musculoskeletal systems, muscle biology, or stability. I would caution undergraduates that this may be an intensive course without a firm understanding of linear algebra--however, Prof. Venkadesan provides resources for refreshing yourself, and is more than accommodating if you are up front with him regarding things you don't understand.",
                "Most definitely, especially to anyone wanting to get into the field of computational/ analytical biomechanics. Intellectually stimulating for sure and would take again."
