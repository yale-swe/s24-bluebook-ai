   "comments": [
    "I greatly improved my writing and reading skills.",
    "I learned (and implemented) a wealth of creative writing strategies across a wide range of non-fiction topics. More than anything, I learned how to tackle the writing process: how to provide and respond to feedback, how to revise, and how to surprise.",
    "I thought I was a good writer in high school, but this class absolutely transformed my writing. I learned so much about how to craft, edit, and tinker with the structure of my sentences and stories.",
    "I learned so much from this course and became a much better, more organized, more concise writer because of it.\r\nI learned how to better give an essay a sense of closure and overall structure, how to write humorously, how to portray people in writing, how to truly edit a piece, and most of all how to incorporate creative writing into nonfiction.",
    "How to read and write the modern non-fiction essay, writing techniques",
    "I learned how to write about a myriad of different topics.",
    "- Writing creatively, which is a rare experience for non-literature\/language students. \r\n- Gets to know some general tricks to make the essay more attractive\/interesting",
    "I learned how to write a good essay using different techniques.",
    "Besides the obvious fact that this course definitely improved my writing skills, I also learned how to most effectively read and analyze nonfiction essays from different historical periods. Additionally, I became more confident in my ability to pinpoint and replicate devices and strategies from the essays that we studied throughout the course in my own essays."

   "comments": [
    "readings, essays; there were no weaknesses.",
    "Strength: Amazing feedback. During the semester, you learn not just from the prof, but from other students as well. It's a productive and intimate process. Also, the readings are insightful and helpful starting points in terms of writing. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The pace of this class is its greatest asset and greatest flaw. The expectation of turning in an essay every week is part of why this class can cover so much, but it would be dishonest to say that the pressure to produce a polished essay every weekend isn't remarkably draining. Expect to be grinding pretty often.",
    "The strength of this course is the amount of feedback received. For each of the five essays, we received detailed comments from our instructor, and during workshops, from the entire class. My one suggestion for improvement would be finding ways to stimulate class discussion, which at times lagged.",
    "The only weakness was that there was too little peer review for my taste- each person was only edited twice by everyone else. I understand that there are time constraints involved, but fitting in a few more peer editing sessions before the creation of the final draft would be very helpful.\r\nThe strengths were a stupendous ammount off organization and foresight on Professor Saracenis part (I could tell she planned every lesson meticulously), an accepting and intellectual environment, great assignments, and deeply thoughtful advice from the professor.",
    "strength: reading of many different essays, forces you to work efficiently by having a high work load concerning writing essays, workshops of essays very helpful\r\narea of improvement - more variation in structures of classes, not discussing the lead for half of the semester, students already knowing that what they are going to do is to find the lead makes them less motivated...",
    "I thought the stregnth of the course was the discussion of texts and papers. Thd only weakness was the lack of time in the semester to discuss certain things more.",
    "- strength: lots of different topics\r\n- weakness (not exactly): some essays do need cultural background to understand\/ appreciate. Here's an international student occasionally out of the loop.",
    "Strength: lots of reading and writing, which really helps you to improve\r\nWeaknesses: with all the writing it takes a lot of time and can be hard to keep up with the workload and other classes.",
    "Strengths: I really appreciated the depth of passion that Professor Saraceni poured into each of our class discussions and her critiques of our writing, the small class size, the very useful comments Professor Saraceni gave when editing our essays, and how kind she is! \r\nWeaknesses: This is due to the structure of the course, but I was definitely extremely stressed at several points during the semester because of how quick the turn-around period between essays is. I personally am a slow writer, and I think that at least part of one class period in 120 should be devoted to suggestions on how to best approach the challenge of adjusting to such a rapid brainstorming, drafting, and editing speed."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "yes! I learned so much",
    "Yes. Take this course if you are a) interested in creative non-fiction and b) strongly invested in improving your writing. This class does both masterfully, but expect to work for it.",
    "Absolutely! I believe every freshman at Yale should take an English 120. It improves your writing tremendously, while also teaching you how to edit effectively.",
    "I absolutely would (assuming this student enjoys writing). I think this class would help anyone become a better writer - the material is so diverse in topic that there is something appealing for everyone. Professor Sareceni is a great teacher and is very invested in this class.",
    "yes because it gives a new perspective on writing, not the classic research essay, but non-fiction, more creative, more freedom, you learn new dimensions of writing.",
    "Yes, definitely",
    "Recommend to those who intend to regain the ability to write creatively.",
    "Yes. I think this is a really good class for people who are just starting writing college essays and receive significant feedback on them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to challenge themselves and want to become better writers.",
    "If you want to read great nonfiction writings, take this course! If you want to polish your English outside the academic writing, take this course!",
    "My answer depends on how you handle writing under pressure. As Yale students who already endured the college app essay writing process and came out on top, I assume that this stress is not a major concern for most people considering English 120. If you are prepared to devote the time and mental energy to this class, then yes, take it! It is a fantastic writing course. However, if you already have an arduous schedule this semester, then no, this course would not be a wise choice."
