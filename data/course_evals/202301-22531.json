Through this course, I learned several ways that emotions can be used as literary devices and how to write critically about literary emotions. The course also covers a lot of early novels and interrogates what makes a piece of fiction a \"novel.\"",
                "I learned how to close read and analyze philosophical texts that deal with emotion and human feelings. I also learned how to use these texts as a lens with which to read novels through. Using this lens, I learned how to pay attention to things like desire and morality in novels, and think more deeply about the consequences of these portrayals."

There are tons of strengths: the biggest just being Professor Eccles. She is so wonderful, and I'm lucky to have been able to fulfill my senior seminar requirement with her. I also enjoyed the peer-letters and the presentations.",
                "Prof. Eccles does a great job of making sure that you're engaged the whole time (the letters to other students, essay presentations and small-group exercises in between discussions were all super useful). She was also really helpful with providing guidance on final essays and getting us interested in texts that, at points, felt a little foreign.",
                "Overall, the course was very well organized, informative, and interesting. It was carried out in a concise and coherent way, which I really appreciated. We often received hand-outs that further elaborated on what we were discussing, and that was extremely helpful. I wouldn't say there were many  weaknesses to the course. Only that the amount of reading was sometimes too heavy."

                "I would highly recommend for any English students with a fairly in depth understanding of the novel and its history. Eccles is a fantastic teacher and the amount Ive learned and engaged with in this class is incredible. Ive both a better understanding of the sentimental novel as a concept, but also the history of the novel itself and the ways that its form has come to exist",
                "yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they're a junior or senior English major and even if they aren't one.",
                "Yes!! If you like learning about affect theory and literature from a more theoretical/philosophical perspective, then this class is great. My favorite part of this class was the texts we were exposed to, which I can't imagine reading in another class.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring the function of emotion in novels. The conversations we had in class were so thought provoking and enriching. Throughout the course I realized that the unique topic of emotional philosophy in novels can actually be applied to many different aspects of life outside the realm of novels."
