Going into the class, I only really knew things that I had heard through the news, but this class took a very academic approach in trying to help us understand the extreme-right and their role in modern politics and society.",
                "I developed an understanding of historical events and how they impact current environments",
                "I learned which definitions were important and which media to engage with.",
                "The course gave an in-depth examination of both the history of the radical right and what the modern day iteration looks like. Discussion centered around the ideas espoused by individuals and movements, and was particularly fascinating to discuss in an academic session. The final paper allowed for lots of flexibility to explore a topic of particular interest, and helped to strengthen research skills. The class was also helpful in learning how to engage with at times very uncomfortable topics, but never made me feel uncomfortable which is a testament to the instructor and students.",
                "As someone who did not know much about the extreme right before taking this class, it became clear to me that I had very biased opinions on the topic. This class taught me how to think outside of my preconceived notions and bias in order to understand the dynamics of the extreme right.",
                "I learned about American and international extremism. The course did a great job defining theoretical approaches to the extreme and radical right and then dove into practical/more concrete examples and manifestations of extreme groups."

                "Strengths: Paris is an amazing professor who consistently makes us look forward to going to class. Also, it was very able to participate in class and there was much to learn from him and from my peers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some week's readings and seminars were more interesting than others, but that was just a personal thing. Students should be fairly engaged for every lesson, and for the most part, that was true.",
                "The assignments were laid out in such a way that they forced you to intellectually engage with the material and readings instead of just providing summaries, which I thought was a strength of the class. The only weakness was probably the second response paper, which felt more limited by the prompt than the first and third response papers.",
                "Strengths: every reading has a purpose \r\nWeaknesses: class time was long and discussion was hard to stay engaged with at times",
                "great structure, best when guided by professor but mostly led by class discussion",
                "The structure of class discussion is a major strength as it incorporates supplemental information that helps to facilitate conversation. Perhaps a big midterm paper instead of three short ones would have been more \"fun\", but I think the short papers helped to allow all students to participate so it was beneficial in that sense. No weaknesses, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "The reading for this course, though rather long, are engaging and relevant. However, all of the response papers were graded out of 10, which I don't feel is always a fair scale for grading. I wish that the professor gave more frequent and dynamic feedback.",
                "Weaknesses: Discussion can be quite intense with a select group of students taking charge of the entire conversation and leading the discussion off topic. \r\nStrengths: Receive good feedback on papers in order to improve on the next ones.",
                "Professor Aslanidis definitely makes the course more interesting. He asks provocative questions that are engaging and make for class discussion. The reading load is pretty reasonable for a seminar. Would always be better with more student engagement/class discussion, but that's more student-dependent/based on student interest in the material."

If you don't like PLSC, this may not be the best class for you. Also, the final paper is open ended which helps everyone explore concepts and themes that they otherwise could not.",

                "I absolutely recommend this course because the content is extremely relevant and important to today's politics. In my opinion, this course is absolutely necessary for a well-rounded, comprehensive understanding of societal politics and how they develop and affect the world as a whole.",
                "If you are truly interested in the topic I would recommend as it is quite niche and requires a level of interest in order to be dedicated to the class",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who's even mildly curious about the far right and wants to take a course that challenges you to think about \"the other side\" more critically."
