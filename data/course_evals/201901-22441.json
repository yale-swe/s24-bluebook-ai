   "comments": [
    "I gained exposure to contemporary philosophical accounts discussing the concept of recognition, ranging from Kant and Hegel to more modern accounts like Judith Butler, Axel Honneth, Nancy Fraser and Althusser. These accounts shed light on the range of accounts about what it means to recognize another as a person. I also sharpened my skills in philosophical writing, especially since we had multiple opportunities to submit assignments and receive feedback, ranging from reading responses and a presentation commentary to an essay.",
    "A good overview of the concept of recognition as covered in ethics, beginning from Kant and moving to more contemporary philosophers like Axel Honneth. This course as Professor Russell organized it was particularly geared to bring the concept of recognition in conversation with contemporary issues of social concern like sexism, which is very helpful for applying philosophical thinking to everyday issues. Professor Russell is also very precise and exacting when it comes to essays and class comments, so it was helpful for training those sorts of analytical skills.",
    "Learned about recognition theory within philosophy",
    "This course did a great job discussing the relationship between myself and the Other. In addition to Kant, Hegel, and Sartre, the course went into depth about more modern recognitive theorists. I learned a lot more about continental philosophy and how the Other is an integral part of my world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a great course! I can't think of any ways it could be improved, but a particular strength was having everyone give a five minute presentation once, which gave all of us the chance to engage more deeply with the texts than we might with just reading them.",
    "Strengths: The syllabus felt incredibly relevant. It was fantastic to be able to engage with a philosophical topic that had political relevance. Francey is also an attentive and nurturing seminar leader. She ensures discussions are always focused, grounded and directed.\r\nGiving class presentations at the start of classes was also a great way to engage with the material on a deeper level.\r\nI also enjoyed doing reading responses, as they were a helpful way to consolidate my understanding of the texts.\r\nImprovement: I found the week on aesthetic recognition fascinating, and it would have been cool to have spent more time on that.",
    "Strengths: The syllabus is amazing, seriously to-die-for. If you like Kant, Hegel, Sartre, Althusser, or other thinkers you might not have heard of, I would highly recommend this course. Professor Russell is amazing: so clear, eloquent, and always gave very good summaries of the thinkers we were reading as well as the problems immanent to the text that we should be paying attention to. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since Professor Francey Russell is leaving Yale, i'm not sure if her amazing teaching skills will be quite matched by the next instructor!",
    "The class was pretty disorganized and we got bogged down in minutia a lot (which is slightly understandable b\/c the reading was dense), but the Prof. should do a better job of facilitating the discussion imho. That being said, I really enjoyed the content of the course.",
    "The course could be improved by spending more time discussing Hegel. I feel that he is an important figure in the philosophy of recognition. Also, I would have liked to know more about Professor Russell's own writing on self-opacity."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to all levels of students interested in philosophy; it was structured to be interesting to everyone taking it, even though we were at different stages in our college careers.",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in moral philosophy, political philosophy or theory about what it means to recognize another as a person, this is a fantastic course.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this course to another student. The discussion was in my opinion overly concerned with the minutia of a given reading and as such the conversation often circular. That being said, I think Professor Russell brings a great energy to the class and the subject material is interesting.",
    "Yes!! It's a great syllabus and not a lot of people in the philosophy department look at this sort of stuff.",
    "Probably not...? Content was great, but again, the disorganization of the Prof made it pretty hard to enjoy the class at times. That being said, if she gets more on top of everything, I'm sure this class has a lot of potential!",
    "This course has profoundly affected the way I think about the nature of social relationships, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in philosophy. Future iterations of this course will unfortunately not have Professor Russell, but the content is still important."
