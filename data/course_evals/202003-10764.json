            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Koelle & Simon were great profs, very clear and articulate. The study guides were also helpful when studying for the exams.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like this online teaching format was an excuse to dump more material into this course because they could just keep adding more online videos for us to watch. In in-person teaching, students can modulate the pace of teh course, by asking questions in class or just by giving quizzical looks to the prof, who slows down. In online teaching, this feedback isn't possible, and I felt like the course went along at a terrific \/ breakneck pace just bc the profs could. The live zoom was supposed to take care of this, but that's just not true. The live zoom was helpful, but in no way did it modulate the pace of the course.",
                "Good course. Lecture load was alright, even including the live zoom session. Coverage of material was very thorough, although could be nit picky at times. Weakness mainly centers on having three different lecturers with very different styles of teaching\/coverage of material.",
                "This class goes extremely in depth while maintaining a wider perspective, allowing for deep and broad understanding. However, the graded material focuses mostly on the minutiae of deep content, so much so that any broader insight gained feels like a bonus. The three instructors also each had three very different styles, which meant that the three sections of the course lack a feeling of cohesion.",
                "The strength of this course is the textbook (Lehninger is great!) and the professors, who are also really great. Teaching\/instruction is very clear overall, and I appreciated that during COVID the professors were great about being accommodating, making pre-recorded lectures interesting, and keeping me engaged with the class through live sessions.",
                "Strengths: definitely the professors and TAs. The lecture materials were presented in an easily understandable and digestible way, and it is evident that the professors put in a lot of work to make sure that was the case. I appreciated that the exams were not memorization based, instead, it is more application based, making it more enjoyable. The TAs also played an important role in making this class more manageable. Not only do they do an amazing job reviewing the materials, but they also put in so much time leaving comments on Powerpoints so we have them for future reference, making up practice questions, holding review sessions, and holding multiple office hours, all so that we can succeed in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One minor weakness is that the live lectures could include more practice questions instead of focusing on reviewing materials. Personally, I think the recorded lectures have already done a very good job covering all the materials necessary, so the lectures can focus more on applying what was covered through the recorded lectures in more of a question format.",
                "This course requires a great deal of memorization, although that is typical of any biology course, which made it difficult for exams. There was seemingly unnecessary details about membrane structure that was not really evaluated. That being said, the professors were all experts on the topics and brought enthusiasm to teaching.",
                "Strengths: Gaining a good conceptual understanding of biochemistry. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We all know that there should be one professor teaching the class, and we all know which one at that",
                "Strengths: The recorded lectures were incredibly clear, engaging, interesting, and informative. Because the lectures were prerecorded, students could watch them at any convenient time and replay sections of the lecture to better understand the material. The live Zoom sessions were great; the thought-provoking poll questions and discussions in breakout rooms were very helpful, and made the course as enjoyable and interactive as possible. The supplements (non-tested information presented at the end of each live Zoom session) were all incredibly interesting. All three professors were very clear in their lectures, and they gave detailed and clear answers to any questions asked during the live Zoom sessions. The problem sets were thought-provoking and interesting, and took up very little time, which was wonderful. The tests were all fair, and so is the grading. The only arguable weakness of this course is the amount of time it takes up (recorded lectures, a live Zoom session, and a live discussion section every week take up a lot of time), but this is made up for by the fact that the live Zoom session and discussion section reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures very well. Overall, this was a great course!",
                "strengths: professors and teaching staff were very accommodating to virtual learning and did not make synchronous attendance of lectures part of the grade\/required. Everything except sections were recorded and TAs were very responsive to email and piazza. most but not all videos had captions which made them easier to follow given much of the video was a powerpoint slide that albeit informative, could be difficult to follow when it was just a picture\/figure requiring close attention to commentary. study guides and learning goals for each lecture were provided well in advance as well as tips for how to successfully navigate exams, including practice exams and keys to prepare students for what to expect. Overall course climate lended incredibly well to transitioning from in-person to virtual learning and made the class one of the most enjoyable to be in from quality of teaching to professor compassion for current circumstances.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some lecture videos did not have the clearest slides to follow or captions to better accommodate students who learn better with reading, especially important when all there was to rely on for the most part was lecture slide videos that could differ from the textbook at certain points.",
                "Discussion sections were unnecessary \r\n\r\nAll three professors were freakin' fantastic",
                "Strengths: We covered all the biochem information that is on the MCAT. Professor Simon was a great professor to start out with. He taught clearly and in an organized fashion. The PSETs are very helpful for test preparation since they, themselves, are old test questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of material covered in this course, and it isn't always clear what needed to be studied. Some professors were better than others at clearly emphasizing the important concepts.",
                "Strengths: incredibly well-organized, fascinating material, accessible teaching team, plenty of practice resources\r\nWeakness: grading ambiguity-- it is so frustrating to be told that the class is \"not on a curve\" but then not receiving any firm cut-offs and being told that the course typically sees a 25-25-remainder breakdown",
                "Overview: Overall a really fantastic course. The first half is a lot of review from other courses, but still interesting (and the profs add a lot of new details). Simon is a really great lecturer. Paulsen goes really fast but does teach you a lot of content. Koelle does a really great job explaining metabolism but a lot is packed in to this segment of the class.\r\n\r\nMain weakness: I did not find breakout rooms during live lectures helpful--I know they're meant to encourage participation and discussion, but I would rather just think about the problem on my own for a little bit before going over it as a class; much more time efficient so we aren't just waiting around.",
                "I give the teaching team major props for pulling off this class so well. Honestly as intense as this class was (a lot of information and material gained), it was even more rewarding and encouraged my passion for science. I was deciding between this class and MCDB300 and I am so glad I picked this class-I highly recommend it over MCDB300. The professors are some of the kindest teachers I have had at Yale and truly cared and tried to make this class a really great learning experience, and spent a lot of time helping us. The asynchronous lectures were probably too long at times and information-packed so this class took up a lot of time on a weekly basis to watch the lectures and come prepared for class. However it was a really great learning experience and especially the metabolism with Michael Koelle was really cool and interesting, and Prof. Koelle would make super helpful Piazza responses. I think all the professors did a great job making the lecture videos really high quality, with subtitles and quiz questions (you get an automatic 100 if you do them, its to learn the content better). The psets were really helpful and I thought this class was really transparent and great. Matt Cook would make review packets and we would have practice tests for everything which took off a lot of stress.",
                "Strengths: taught very well, organized lectures and schedule, engaging and challenging questions, the Piazza forum, and the ability to drop a pset and midterm made studying less stressful\r\n\r\nWeakness: I honestly loved this course, aside from the grading. It was somewhat discouraging to see how strict the grading rubric for exams could be (and the exams, though most of the questions are fair, were very challenging under a short time limit). I frankly think it's ridiculous to tell students to focus on learning and enjoying the material when you know that the grades aren't curved...Despite learning the material, I was highly stressed about how'd I do on exams (because a point can literally make such a huge difference). I have no idea what my grade will be in this class. But my one advice is to just stay on top of the material and work hard.",
                "I think the pre-recorded lectures were excellent and the office hours held by the professors were also great to help answer any confusing questions. Piazza was also extremely helpful to clarify any confusion. In terms of improvement, I did think I was spending way more time than I had thought for the course from the combination of pre-recorded lectures and live sessions. It felt like ~3 classes per week instead of 2 and it was hard to finish everything on time. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf MBB 300 has to be taught virtually again, I would try to either do live lectures that are recorded or somehow minimize the live sessions. Overall, I don't have any other problems with the course.",
                "The course structure was ok, although the live sessions in addition to the recorded lectures was a bit overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: clear organization, helpful TAs, plenty of resources, fun and engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of content to cover (and with the recorded + live lectures, it takes up more time per week than it usually would if it were a regular in-person class), never knowing how in-depth we should be covering certain topics, exams were fair but on the difficult side",
                "This was an amazing class. The biggest strength was definitely the teaching staff. Profs. Koelle, Paulsen, and Simon were amazing lecturers and made sure to answer any questions as they came up, were clear with expectations, and genuinely cared about our progress. The class was not stressful at all with grades, you always felt as if the class was built for you to learn rather than trick you. The TAs were decently helpful as well, and the peer tutors were great. A focus on conceptual learning rather than memorization was amazing, too.",
                "The strengths of this course are the instructors in their patience to answer questions. I appreciated how they focused on the larger concepts rather than all of the details. I learned a lot this way, and they made sure we had a lot of problems to practice with so we knew what to expect. For improvements, I just wish there were more clear solutions on our actual exams, especially the multiple choice problems. I also liked Professor Koelle's format of lecture quizzes the most because they were not just straight recall but they made you synthesize and problem solve based on the lecture material.",
                "The course is quite well-taught - all three professors are pretty good lecturers and I think the overall structure of the course is very logical and the material builds off of itself.",
                "very well organized, especially the study guides were quite organized!",
                "strengths: amazing teaching team",
                "This course was run very well. The lectures were presented clearly, and were clarified further by slides and study guides being posted alongside them, as well as by the embedded mini-quizzes. The order of topics made a lot of sense. While the class asked for very little prior knowledge, it didn't feel like it was just repeating things I'd learned in other classes (or at least taught the same subjects in further depth, with the possible exception of the membrane content).",
                "This class was one of the best organized and best taught classes I've taken at Yale! I thought the video quizzes were a good way to keep students on track with watching lectures and also helped check our understanding of the lecture material without adding too much stress. The live sessions and discussion sections were a good chance to have more direct interaction with the professors and TAs, and the live sessions would be recorded, which were helpful for reviewing before an exam. We also got practice tests and TA-led review sessions before each exam, so I thought every exam was pretty fair and there was never any confusion. Even though the 3 professors had slightly different lecture styles, the content still felt cohesive and each one of the professors were really good at breaking complex topics down to terms that were easy to understand. The TAs and professors were also very responsive to any suggestions we gave through Piazza and always addressed our concerns in a timely manner, which I especially appreciated since we were all adapting to the new online format. The organization and the teaching of this course were genuinely superb, and I really could not have asked for more.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professors, interesting content, engaging, low workload\r\nWeakness: I would have loved if we discussed how the facts that we are learning were discovered",
                "This course really provided a in depth understanding of biochemical principles that made the topics more interesting and easier to learn.",
                "I thought that the professors did a very good adapting the class into an online format.",
                "The course was emphasized to be focused on principles, but I felt like sometimes the exam questions were focused on specific details and memorization. That being said, I though the exams and the lectures were well organized and someone without the strongest background in chemistry or biology could follow along.",
                "This course was extremely organized, and I think other Yale courses should use this course's organization as an example.",
                "Strengths: Lecturers are great, really enthusiastic. TAs are great and very responsive. It's a standard biochemistry course but the material is interesting and applicable.",
                "very organized, learned a lot",
                "Very engaging, liked the short problem sets",
                "This course was perfectly organized. The recorded lectures presented information in an information-dense way, but then the concepts were applied during the virtual live sessions. I found this very effective as the live sessions included interesting questions about the lectures. Specifically with the grading, this course could be improved by shifting away from memorization and the repetition of very specific phrases on midterms and problem sets.",
                "strengths: lectures were good, information was effectively communicated, readings were good and consistent\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the psets were only out of 3 points, which sometimes could be very frustrating because it was easy to get a lower grade. it would be fair if they graded all of the questions to make the grades more fair and reflective of our abilities. the wording on exam questions was sometimes confusing to interpret, which was frustrating when you feel like you have the knowledge to answer questions if they were only worded quickly. and we were not given enough time on the midterms; i was scrambling to finish.",
                "Less difficult exams would be nice.",
                "The course is very well structured and it is apparent that the instructors really enjoy teaching this subject to others. The way each section of the course builds upon the past helps students to stay engaged in the course. The instructors had plenty of office hours for students to meet and discuss about content.",
                "Weakness: office hours are extremely restricted.\r\nStrength: Video lectures are generally well thought out. Material is very interesting.",
                "I thought all three professors were enthusiastic and engaging, and they all presented the course material very clearly.",
                "The biggest strength is the teaching. Professor Simon was one of the best professors I've ever had, and Professor Paulsen is also incredible. They made this course what it was. The content is also absolutely fascinating, and I felt the exams were hard but fair.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would note is that the amount of course time was more than it should've been, and that was frustrating. We had two hours (and sometimes more) of lecture content and a one hour required live session, and that's a lot more than the two 75 minute lectures that it should've been.",
                "Big weakness, the exam questions were often graded harshly, and students were not awarded points for demonstrating biochemistry knowledge or ingenuity. The questions were not posed in ways in which students could share what they did know in some cases, and partial credit was not given for correct biochemistry but alas wrong MBB answers. Professors, be wary of the way you structure questions on Canvas quizzes. More open-ended questions or even \"pick 2 of the following 3 long-essay questions\" would have been a better way to go about testing us and representing the course content.",
                "I think this was a very well-taught course!",
                "More communication about content for final",
                "Strengths: The instructors and TFs were all really amazing and the material was taught well\r\nWeaknesses: At times, there was a lot of material to learn at one time",
                "Strengths: Focuses on principles rather than rote memorization, which was nice, exams were fair, instruction was done very well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not too many tbh",
                "super well organized, midterms are reasonable. I would prefer if office hours could be drop-in, instead of scheduled, though.",
                "Very willing professors, keen to help, excited about the course, I liked the course format, hw's are not too long yet effective, overall very happy with the course.",
                "Strengths: Easy to follow lectures, clear course expectations\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded format meant more material was covered and harder to clarify difficult topics.",
                "This course is wonderful-- the lectures are fascinating, the problem sets are interesting, and the professors have extensive office hours and are willing to answer questions about anything. The embedded quizzes were helpful to check comprehension, and the textbook was surprisingly well written. I found the midterms extremely difficult, but I also don't think they were unfair. I will note that as the semester went on, the recorded lectures became longer and more dense, which made keeping up with the class (especially as other classes became more difficult) a little difficult. I often had to pause and rewatch large portions of those videos, which made them feel even longer. Perhaps if this format continues, on weeks with longer discussions there could be shorter live sessions?",
                "Well structured. I wish we had more practice homework problems throughout the semester to help reinforce material we had learned in lecture.",
                "Although I have a good understanding of all the concepts, I wished the final didn't count for such a high percentage of our grade. This covid period has been tough on the mind to get through, and I felt like I was running out of steam at the finish line.",
                "Strengths are it is supremely well taught and straightforward. The exams and problem sets are generally fair, and the learning experience is pleasant. The teachers are nice and the material is presented clearly and concisely. Not any weaknesses I can think of. Maybe it would be nice to have more practice problems, but this is minor.",
                "The course places a large emphasis on a thorough understanding of materials, so it is a great environment to learn much about the materials. The structure of the course was great and the professors, TF's, and peer tutors were all very helpful.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized with clear expectations, interesting material, lots of ways to get support if needed\r\n\r\nWeakness: not very collaborative (might partly be remote style, but was particularly hard to make new friends and form study groups so do take this class with friends), the three professors are all very wonderful at teaching but they do have slightly different expectations for what types of material is most important (i.e. one professor requires textbook reading but another professor considered assigned reading as voluntary and \"beyond content tested on assessments\")",
                "It was really nice that the instructors put in effort to connect with students and they made sure that everyone understood the topic by having different types of assignments (quizzes and problem sets)",
                "I think this class was as best as could be for these times. A strength were definitely the professors and lectures.",
                "I really enjoyed the course and felt that it was taught really well remotely. The professors were super helpful and there were many resources for us to use.",
                "Strengths: The recorded lectures were well-taught and comprehensive, the live lectures were engaging (the polls were particularly effective), and professors were very reasonable and understanding. The study guides were extremely helpful for test preparation and lecture summary. The PSETs were also great practice for solidifying lecture material.\r\nWeaknesses: The recorded lectures were extremely long (and took a very long time to digest). I wish that the office hours with professors were a little longer. The initial midterm also could have been shorter to allow for more time per question. However, the later midterms had a good time per question proportion.",
                "The teaching team for this class was incredibly kind and accommodating during an unconventional semester. They worked hard to ensure that students gained a thorough understanding of the material, provided extensive materials for review and office hours, and made sure students' opinions were heard.",
                "Despite the circumstances, the course did a very good job of providing structures for students to do well in. The fact that the course deviated from memorization, and rather focused on concepts was a step necessary in light of the current circumstances. The problem sets were helpful in reinforcing the concepts that were taught throughout the week. If there was one note I would make, that would be that the exams were promised to be more so focused on big concepts and fundamentals and present them in challenging ways, but many times through exam questions it appeared that they were either ambiguous or reflective of very specific and seemingly unimportant details in the scheme of the course.",
                "Strengths: nice to watch most of lectures on own time, good ways to ask questions live through TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much material covered in too short a time, some material was not taught well in class and was very TA dependent in turn  I understood things so much better when I switched my TA which shouldnt necessarily be the case even though it worked out for me",
                "this course was fantastic. all of the professors were great and the material is very interesting",
                "The lectures, study guides, and live sessions were very clear about what the students were charged with learning.",
                "I thought all three of the instructors for this class were very engaging. They explained the material well and clearly cared about students' learning. The lectures were definitely information packed, but I thought they did a good job of explaining what was important and giving us a solid biochemistry foundation, as well as going deeper into some of the pathways we learned about. The class definitely is challenging, and there is a log of material, but I think it was all useful and well-taught.",
                "Strengths: Very organized, frequent office hours, review sessions with the TAs, peer tutoring, and study guides all made success in the class very doable. Especially enjoyed the teaching styles of Prof Simon and Koelle but I felt that Prof Paulsen's lectures were really rushed (a LOT of info to memorize and understand crammed into each lecture, more so than in others, and a lot of info included that I found out in OH were really not required for us to learn)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Paulsen's teaching style. Also felt that some more transparency in the grade cutoffs would have been nice."

I liked that we received credit for watching the lectures by engaging in quizzes, which motivated me to watch the lectures on time, keeping me to a schedule, while also testing my knowledge in a non-stressful way, since we were able to retake them until we got the correct answer. The live sessions were a great time to recap the content from the past week, although I personally did not find the breakout sessions very helpful. The polls during these were fun, though.",

                "Succeeded: Professors were very flexible with timing, i.e. there was no mandate to attend live lectures, and they were cognizant of those in inconvenient time zones when it came to exams.\r\n\r\nCould be improved: The presence of prerecorded lectures disincentivizes people from attending live lectures and actively engaging with the material.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were successful.

The polls and breakout room discussions during the live Zoom sessions and discussion sections allowed for virtual engagement - the ability to actually discuss course material with other students in real time. This was also successful. Nothing comes to mind that really needs improvement.",
                "successes: video lectures were mostly very efficient and effective ways to communicate material, save for a few without captions or unclear learning goals\/commentary. embedded quizzes that could be retaken without penalty helped increase understanding of material and engagement with the video, especially in the last third where quizzes were embedded partially through videos rather than at the end. recording lectures and not making live sessions require or part of a grade greatly increased accessibility and contributed to an environment more conducive to learning virtually, especially for students in different time zones.\r\n\r\nimprovements: honestly none the class went extremely well in my opinion and even the canvas quiz exams utilized online infrastructure available very efficiently.",
                "The tests, especially the final, seemed to be quite different than practice test questions and PSETs. I assume this is because the exam was held remotely; however, it would have been nice to have had practice with these types of questions beforehand.",
                "I enjoyed having the live and recorded lecture components. The live lectures deepened my understanding of the material and provided meaningful practice. However, I was a bit frustrated that the course exceeded its designated lecture time overall and think that it made planning for my other courses difficult.",
                "Recorded lectures ended up taking pretty long to actually get through, though I'm not sure there's much that could be done about this. Maybe restructure a little to cram more into the initial lectures and less into later lectures? The material seemed to be weighted towards the second half of the class.",
                "I would suggest shortening the lecture vids because they took a lot longer than I think a live class would take. Otherwise, I think the class did a great job combining things asynchronously that we didn't need to do live with a more engaging live session. Of all my classes, this was the only one that came up with a great model for live sessions where you actually learn and do great reviews from the pre-recorded lectures. Especially Matt Simon's part was really great in this regard. Also they did a good job taking our questions during the live sessions and answering them, so more people asked questions than usual since it was anonymous. Matt Cook was an amazing TA and really cared about the class and did a good job coordinating everything, giving us extra help and review, and I really appreciate it!",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful\r\n\r\nI really really hope that you will all be generous with the grading for this class this semester.

                "The time commitment I spent on this course was a lot more than I would have spent on the course if it were in-person, and even then I didn't do as well as I thought I would've. I felt like the amount of work I put in was not accurately reflected by my grades, and the feedback I received was not necessarily built to find a way to help me succeed but it was very much of a \"figure this out on your own\" type of class that left me feeling lost in a class full of people that seemed to understand what was going on.",
                "I  really enjoyed taking this class in a virtual format. I think having the lectures recorded to refer back to was really instrumental to success this semester when it can otherwise be difficult to engage with virtual learning. There were checkpoints throughout all of the recorded lectures to ensure you understood what was going on, which was useful when you couldn't do polls in class that you would normally expect. Further, there were ample office  hours and Piazza was a great resource for any questions that came up. Even the break-out rooms were less painful in this class than in others.",
                "This course adjusted extremely well to virtual learning. I was able to learn a lot of the material, and the breakout room formats within lectures and discussion sections were especially helpful in learning. This allowed all of us to interact with each other to solve a problem and ask questions. For improvement, perhaps maybe more office hours would be helpful (or at least being cognizant of who is in the waiting room so they don't wait for an extremely long time like I was once).",
                "I definitely felt it difficult to truly engage in this class because I didn't really know anyone in the class and so I didn't really feel I had someone to work on problem sets or talk over material with.  I would suggest that for the future, if this class has to be taught remotely again, it would be really helpful to give people the option to be paired with a study partner at the beginning of class.  It's the kind of thing that would happen serendipitously in an in-person lecture because you would meet people by sitting next to them.  I think that the awkwardness of zoom makes this a bit harder.",
                "the discussion sections and live zooms were very useful in studying, and the discussion sections had enough information to study before exams. the psets were also reflective of the exams.",
                "The balance between recorded lectures and live sessions were great, as was the use of video quizzes. Posting the lecture notes and study guides for each lecture was really helpful for taking notes. Piazza was also a good tool to communicate any questions and for students to have discussions with each other, despite being online. Offering discussion sections but not making them required was also a good strategy, since it allows students to interact with their TAs if needed, but it also accommodates for the fact that everyone has different personal situations due to the pandemic. The organization of this course and the use of various tools (Canvas, Piazza, recording live sessions, discussion sections) was very effective.",
                "I think the live session every Tuesday was a great way to keep the students engaged outside of recorded lectures",
                "Having recorded lecture videos was very helpful, especially with the live virtual Q&A component.",
                "I like virtual lectures but think that overall, more could have been done to acknowledge the transition to remote learning. I think professors tried too hard to stick to the class's usual format instead of being more considerate of the challenges of taking this course through Zoom. (Namely the test format and quizzes)",
                "I thought that the professors were very flexible and organized the course very well.",
                "The lectures being asynchronous was very successful; It helped me a lot to be able to go back and rewatch the lectures and work through difficult ideas multiple times through. The breakout rooms during the live sessions were a bit awkward though; one time I was even in a room by myself.",
                "I think the mixture of recorded lectures and weekly live Q&A sessions were extremely helpful.",
                "I feel like the teaching team should have made the exams open note and more application-based, because the exams weren't proctored in any way despite being closed-note. Also the total class time was increased because we needed to watch pre-recorded lectures and also go to live sessions.",
                "really good!",
                "I thought they did great!",
                "I found the multiple choice practice quiz questions during the live sessions to be very helpful. The balance between live sessions and recorded lectures was also great! This was the most organized course that I have taken remotely.",
                "I wish there were more resources available. While we did have class sections, I did not learn as much as I could have in them. I did not feel like I received the engagement I needed.",
                "flexibility on deadlines was good, virtual lectures were good for the most part, although sometimes they went too long, longer than an in-person lecture would be, and they also took longer to watch because I had to pause a lot to take notes, so it ended up taking a very long time to watch all of the lectures.",
                "Better opportunities to work with TAs. Less stringent grading.",
                "I liked having the prerecorded lectures to watch before the live session, and having the live session as a time to clear up any confusions on the content. The polls and breakout room sessions were a great way to engage with other classmates and check our understanding of concepts. The videos were quite a bit longer than prerecorded videos I had to watch in other classes, especially towards the end where there was a lot more content that was harder to understand.",
                "Problem sets were effective; study sheets helped as an overview to guide study.",
                "The amount of course time was more than it would've normally been. We had two hours (and honestly in the last third usually 2.5) of lecture content AND a one hour required live Zoom, and that's just way more than the two 75 minute lectures that it should've been. I would've liked this course more with lectures live over Zoom to ensure that the class time stayed reasonable.",
                "Having practice questions in class helped. I think polls and break-out room sessions were both helpful. It was nice to be allowed to watch the lectures on our own but also have a tentative deadline for when they have to be done by so that we can have some semblance of structure. Although the psets were only graded based on one question each, my TA did not share what question was graded or why points were taken offthe TA usually just wrote good job. I understand that the answer key is released, but seeing why my answer did not fit would have been helpful too.",
                "The recorded lectures and live session mix was helpful",
                "Success: The live sessions were really helpful\r\nTo be improved: Breakout rooms were awkward and sometimes no one would participate",
                "I thought the structure of remote lectures actually worked really well, since there is little point in lecturing synchronously online. It was nice to be able to watch things on my own time, and the points\/due dates associated with the lectures kept me honest about watching everything when I should. I didn't feel like I got all that much out of the in-person discussion time laid out for the class, and it put the amount of \"class time\" quite a bit above what is normal for a non-pandemic version of the class. Other than that, however, I thought the class was structured really well given the circumstances.",
                "I thought it was very well adapted to online learning!",
                "Pre-recorded lectures worked great with only one live session per week.",
                "I enjoyed the live lecture very much and thought it helped reinforce the recorded lectures. The deadlines for watching the lectures should be removed.",
                "The embedded quizzes were very helpful-- it's hard to stay engaged with a prerecorded lecture, but having to pause and check comprehension (and have the opportunity to get a few extra points) was excellent. I also really liked the format of office hours. It was nice to use the canvas tool, which allowed me to have a slightly smaller office hour session with the professors, but also didn't require me to email the professors specially. Finally, I'm not sure if this was a pandemic practice, but I found piazza incredibly helpful. It was great to be able to ask questions whenever we thought of them, rather than having to wait for the next class, and it was useful to read what other people were asking. Finally, I didn't love the live sessions-- I really enjoyed the supplements, and found some of the practice questions helpful, but it would have been nice if these sessions were a little shorter given that we also had to listen to two extremely long lectures by the end of the course.",
                "Having lectures recorded, with quizzes sprinkled in, worked very well. I was able to go back to review concepts I didn't understand, and the quizzes helped me understand things further.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were great. I loved how you could pause or rewatch them if needed. I seriously think I learned more than I would have in a synchronous setting, and the professors did all they could to accommodate us.",
                "The live sessions and the discussion sections allowed for virtual engagement. They allowed for time to ask questions and clarify lecture content.",
                "Success: recorded lectures with live Zoom sessions\r\nWeakness: harder to engage with peers, sections not mandatory, breakout rooms too short to really get to know new people",
                "The professors made sure that there was close captions for the recorded lecture videos!! Which was so so helpful for virtual learning.",
                "The set-up of the class was the best. Having the basis of recorded lectures and live virtual sessions were very helpful at always being able to get the material and also having a time to ask questions for more engagement. The greatest help with the recorded lectures were the quizzes in them that allowed you to always keep track of the timeline and not get to behind since with recorded lectures it can be easy to slack off or get behind.",
                "I liked that we had a mix of synchronous and asynchronous learning which wasn't too overwhelming. I enjoyed the poll questions and break out room questions.",
                "I loved the polls during the live zoom lectures. They were engaging, gave me a sense of where I stood in the class, and helped me identify areas where I was less familiar with lecture material.",
                "The format of the class worked very well.",
                "I appreciated the live sessions, as they offered some opportunity for direct contact with the professors, and an opportunity to ask questions directly. I really appreciated the recorded lectures, as they gave me an opportunity to watch the material in my own time. The structure of the final and the midterms was definitely one that aided my learning more so than it disrupted it. I appreciated the fact that the course moved away from memorization and towards understanding of concepts. I think that the fact that I did not have to memorize concepts actually allowed me to learn the material better and in a more substantive way.",
                "Glows: Captions made by Michael Koelle were very helpful on recorded lectures. Asking questions through Matt Cook was a helpful format. Overall tests and psets on canvas worked well. \r\n\r\nGrows: Breakout rooms felt like a waste of time because it was hard to get people to participate in them. I think suggested deadlines, not hard deadlines for lectures would be helpful. Would have been helpful to have exam pdfs for the exams to avoid so much scrolling up and down.",
                "optional section, recorded lectures, and live sessions were all very effective.",
                "The instructors presented material in very engaging and relevant fashion."

                "I took this course for the MBB major. It was okay, there was a lot of content and I felt like the profs didn't modulate the amount of content to accommodate for the fact that there's a PANDEMIC going on. It was like, okay, here's all the info you need, here's all the videos -- you have a textbook and two eyes ,right? READ the book, you so-called Yale student, Can you READ? There's no excuse not to know the material when you have the INTERNET at your fingertips, GOOGLE the shit and READ it. So those are my thoughts about this class -- after taking this course, I start to wonder what the value of a Yale education even is when all this info is on the internet, and when i have a question, It's easier (and clearer) to just find the answer on Wikipedia.",
                "If interested in biochemistry at a thorough level, otherwise stay away.",
                "Without an independent interest in the content of the class, it is likely that any student who took the class for reasons other than that it was required they take it would not enjoy the graded aspects. I therefore suggest that any interested student who is able audit the class, so that a general understanding can be formed without concern for minutiae.",
                "Yes, 1000%. Even if you are not an MB&B major, the professors care deeply about their students which was super evident during COVID. The workload is pretty low, except for exams, and even these are not super stressful due to being able to drop your lowest exam score. The course topics are fascinating and interesting without being too difficult or inaccessible, and it's overall very enjoyable to learn biochemistry.",
                "Yes definitely. Although hard and challenging, this is a class worth taking for how well the class was taught and how supportive the teaching team is.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning the basics of biochemistry. It was well-taught and engaging. Unfortunately, a great deal of memorization was required. For pre-meds: just stay present and try to digest (no pun intended) the material taught. It is important for your future careers and classes.",
                "If it's between MB&B 300 and MCDB 300, I don't know if I can make that strong of an opinion since I have never taken MCDB 300, but from what I have heard, the consensus is that MB&B 300 might be harder but it's a better taught class. Also after the whole MCDB 300 election fiasco, MB&B 300 looks really good now",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures are clear, the live Zoom sessions are as engaging as a virtual class possibly can be, the information is interesting, the number of assignments is low (one three-question problem set per week that takes about 30 minutes), and the tests are fair. This course does require quite a bit of reading, but given the broad topics that are covered, this is justified. All three professors are wonderful; their lectures are clear, and they give very detailed answers to student questions. If you have an interest in biochemistry, you will find this course very engaging, and the information covered and enthusiasm of the professors will motivate you to want to learn more about biochemistry. This course was excellent!",
                "yes; 100% over MCDB biochem; especially during COVID-19, hearing how MCDB biochem had 5 exams with one during election week and the refusal to postpone said exam despite extremely high levels of stress not just from school but life, COVID-19, the political tension, etc. MB&B 300 shifted lecture content on each exam to lighten the load covered on each of the 3 midterms and was very receptive to student suggestions for improvements throughout the semester in addition to mostly excellently taught\/explained content over video lectures. while nucleic acids might not be covered, taking MB&B 301 or learning about it yourself for the MCAT or whatever is definitely accomplishable with the background and foundation the class sets you up with to think about biochemistry, biomolecules, and metabolism. \r\n\r\ntl;dr YES ! over MCDB biochem !",
                "Hell yeah. Best lecturers at Yale. Learn the secrets of life except the most important one which you'll get more detail on later",
                "I would recommend this course for premeds who need to take biochem for premed requirements\/mcat studying. I would not recommend this course to anyone else because the material is very dense and time consuming.",
                "Yes, the material in this course is absolutely fascinating and made marvel at our microscopic environment. The professors are devoted and available to students and truly hope to share their passion for science with all of their students. I am a Chemistry major taking this as an elective, and thought it was well worth the time, it should be made clear that the workload in this course does not come from the p-sets, the readings, or the lectures-- it is studying for the tests. The tests come down to memorizing the information presented on the slides, and this memorization is critical for one to be successful in the class. I made over fifty pages of study guides and 100's of Quizlet terms in preparation for the exams in this class-- the material makes it worth it but come prepared for this workload.",
                "For most students, I would definitely this over the MCDB version, regardless of your major. Yes, the content is probably a little harder, but the course is much much better. The workloads are pretty similar, and in my experience, it is always better to pick the course with better teaching and structure. You will learn in much greater depth in this course. It is also very fair, the PSETs are very short and graded leniently, and the exams are difficult but nothing too terrible. To be sure, this course does have a high workload. A little more content than orgo I (maybe about the same as orgo II), but definitely less than cell bio.",
                "Yes!! Such a great class in many ways, the professors actually cared about our learning and making interactive sessions for us to participate in and learn from. It also felt a lot more personal since there was extra segments after every session talking about breakthroughs in science and the professor's personal experiences in academia, which I think they should expand on even more because it is important for people to hear that are deciding whether to go into academia.",
                "If you're deciding between MCDB and MBB, I'd say choose MBB if you prefer a more organized course. Just be prepared to work very hard in this class!",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in medicine or biology. The intro bio sequence turned me away from wanting to study biology, but this course renewed my passion and interest in the field.",
                "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course to other students that aren't just MBB majors. You learn a lot about biochemistry and will really have a greater appreciation behind basic concepts of biochemistry. Also, it's helpful for the MCAT if you're a premed!",
                "If you need it or are really genuinely interested in the subject",
                "I would recommend this biochemistry course over the one because I think this one is just better structured and goes more in-depth with topics, which I appreciate. I liked the challenge that this course gave me despite my hardships in grasping the content.",
                "Absolutely! This was my favorite science course I've taken at Yale. The teaching staff was amazing and supportive. The content is naturally very interesting because you're learning about processes in your body and building on past courses, but the way it was presented in this course was really easy to follow and stay engaged. I highly recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course because you get so much out of it from learning the material. At times, you will feel overwhelmed from all of the information, but if you focus on the main concepts, you will learn how to problem solve better about biochemistry. You will take away key concepts that will be applicable in all of your future biology or biochemistry related courses. The professors do a great job of teaching the material and making sure you have enough practice.",
                "I think if you have to take it, yes. The course material is dry, and the online lectures do not really facilitate learning.",
                "YES!! If you're deciding between MB&B biochemistry and MCDB biochemistry, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. The professors are extremely kind and very willing to meet with students outside of class for extra help. Professors Simon, Paulsen, and Koelle were all great lecturers as well, and I found each lecture compelling and interesting, which I can't say the same about for most of my pre-med classes. The three professors made biochemistry super enjoyable and have honestly helped to re-ignite my passion for science. The workload isn't too bad-- concise 30-minute problem sets each week, three midterms, and one cumulative final. The real-time drain was watching the lectures each week just because they held so much material and I really needed to go through them slowly and carefully to catch all the information. Overall, an outstanding STEM class and I would highly recommend you take it over the MCDB version if you need a biochem course!",
                "It's not too bad as far as stem lectures at Yale go, but I would still probably only take it if you have to.",
                "yes! especially if you are premed or interested in small molecules, it is a brilliant class that teaches you the general principles on how biology works.",
                "yes, the best teaching team I've encountered at Yale, enthusiastic pool of peers, hard but wonderful",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - it was probably favorite course at Yale so far. The content is fundamental to modern biology and taught very well. The homework was useful for review but short and not busywork, the exams were very fair, and there weren't any of the unnecessary stressors you get in some other classes.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who needs a biochemistry credit, even if they're not an MB&B major! The workload was very reasonable, the exams were fair and I always felt properly prepared for them, and I thought the content was really interesting as well (especially the last section on metabolism since it ties together everything we learned this semester. The professors are also all excellent and very receptive to feedback. They really do try to engage students as future scientists through supplements and office hours. The entire teaching team also wants you to succeed. Since this course isn't curved, there's no sense of competition between students, and the professors lay out very clearly what is expected of us to succeed.",
                "Definitely",
                "I would definitely recommend this biochemistry class. While the class does take a lot of time in terms of learning and studying, the class really provides a in-depth exploration of biochemical topics that made the topics easier to understand.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because it was very interesting.",
                "I would recommend it if you are interested in chemistry especially.",
                "Yes, this course teaches you HOW to think about biochemistry.",
                "Yes, the material is interesting and the teaching staff are all very dedicated. I chose this course over MCDB 300 because I preferred the class format of asynchronous lectures with psets so your grade is not entirely dependent on exams. The psets are really not too difficult but it helps to have a friend in the class to talk over answers together.",
                "yes, if you are interested in biochemistry!",
                "Yes",
                "If you are deciding between this course and the MCDB version, I would recommend this one! The teaching team is fantastic, the class is explicitly not curved, and the entire curriculum felt very thoughtful, with everything fitting together by the end. The cumulative final is kind of annoying but it's mostly second-half-of-the-semester content anyways.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if you're willing to put in the work. The course content is extremely interesting and has very important applications for future STEM courses as well as for premed students.",
                "Seeing as this class is needed for students on a premed track, I do recommend it for that reason only.",
                "It is required, so sure. Ok, the teachers are really sweet.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those who are premed. At the end, we connected all the concepts we learned to understand some of the diseases that occur in the human body, and it is so interesting to see how everything you've learned can be applied.",
                "This course is extremely effective at providing the foundation for understanding this field of science.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. All three professors were great and the material was interesting.",
                "Yes!!! I of course have not taken the other biochem, but this course is truly fantastic. It's not easy, but it's so, so interesting, and also VERY well taught. I can't recommend it enough!!!",
                "Do not be afraid to take this course even if it is considered the harder of the two biochem choices. This class does not require an organic chemistry background nor much of any background. They catch you up, but do not fall behind. This class will make you either love science or hate it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in biochemistry, particularly those aiming to major in the biological sciences.",
                "Yes, very interesting.",
                "Yes. The material is taught well and in an interesting way, definitely a lot of support for students.",
                "Yes! No one's really gonna take this unless they're pre-med or its for their major, but I would definitely recommend this biochemistry over the MCDB option. It was one of the few STEM classes I've taken here that I felt prioritized learning concepts over just memorizing stuff, and you get a unified picture of biology and chemistry that is pretty satisfying after years of taking them separately.",
                "Yes! Especially if you think you like biochem, I think this is a much better option than the MCDB version of biochem.",
                "Very interesting for anyone who's into chemistry and biology. Very good professors, willing to help and excited about the course. Not too much work on a weekly basis, but a lot of material is needed for the tests and they also require excellent understanding of the course.",
                "Yes, you truly develop a great understanding of principles. It will be useful in any STEM career.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course-- interesting, enjoyable, and fun!",
                "Yes, this class is essential for understanding biochemistry, and is taught quite well.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course 100%. It is very well taught, the lectures are clear, the problem sets are simple, and besides the exams, the workload isn't too stressful. I felt like I learned a lot and I would take this class again. Don't know how it compares to the MCDB counterpart, but this class is solid and you can't go wrong taking it.",
                "Yes, the course is a great way to gain a strong foundation in the principles of biochemistry.",
                "I would assume that most students shopping\/taking this class will use this towards a major requirement, so perhaps the consideration is sometimes between MCDB and MBB 300 sequence courses. I never considered MCDB because I really preferred to have more chemistry-focused in a core biochemistry course and potentially to know more students\/TFs\/professors in related majors. It is a very enjoyable core required course overall!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The lectures and professors were amazing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is taught really well and I learned a lot.",
                "Definitely, especially if you're interested in medicine. This class was by far my favorite this semester.",
                "Yes definitely! All of the professors were great and it was easily one of the best taught classes I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "Chances are that if you're taking this course you need to, either as a requirement for a major or for premed. There is a lot of talk at the beginning of the semester on whether the MBB or MCDB biochem is the one one should take. At the end of this semester, I find myself not at all regretting my choice to take the MBB version. The professors outlined the material clearly, and in most cases there was a clear understanding of what is required for us to learn within the scope of the material. The live sessions allowed for a useful summary of all the material covered the previous week, and gave the professors an opportunity to present example problems that might be similar to the ones they used in the exams. The dropped midterm grade really helped alleviate some stress. The problem sets were manageable, and the professors tried hard to make sure that everyone stayed up to speed with the material, so that the midterms did not feel overwhelming. Even though I did not enroll in the MCDB biochem, I heard comments and concerns that would stir me personally towards the MBB version of the course. My personal experience with the course was a pleasant one, and I got to learn so many things that I saw connecting with material in a lot of different classes I took within the MCDB major.",
                "It was a fine course. I learned a lot. There is a lot of work if you want to learn the material and do well. In terms of weekly commitments, on paper it seems like not much. I probably spent 15 hours a week on this class.",
                "yes",
                "Yes. The instructors reveal much about how biochemists search for solutions.",
                "Yes. I took this class because I am a premed student, and I definitely feel as though I learned a lot of useful information for the MCAT. Furthermore, the instructors went above and beyond to teach us not only the material we needed to know, but also give us a deeper understanding of how our bodies work. If you're at all interested in biochemistry, I would definitely take this course.",
                "I don't know what the MCDB biochem was like but I definitely came away from this class with a thorough, mechanistic understanding of biochemistry"
