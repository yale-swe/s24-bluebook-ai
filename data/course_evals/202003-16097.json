Daily homework may seem annoying, but it truly helped me learn more. I wish we received more opportunities to speak in class or with our peers. I struggle to form coherent sentences and fluidly conversing with others, at times, so I definitely would have found this helpful.",
                "The course is well-structured for learning but can feel somewhat repetitive. It requires a lot of self-learning and guidance, though Liu Laoshi and the TFs are really available and helpful as well. The immersive aspect was great, so you are guaranteed to improve to some extent, even with low levels of engagement."

                "Online classes worked, however, for a language class, there are always difficulties. For example, when reciting a passage from a text, everyone's audio is out of synch. In addition, casual partner work was pretty much eliminated, but breakout rooms as its substitution were quite successful. I'm not sure if there can be any improvements since the Chinese Department already has tried so hard to give their students the best possible learning experience!",
                "This virtual version of the course was dramatically weakened. The typical lecture-style class made it easy to stop paying attention. The cold calling is effective and helps students stay attentive. The breakout rooms were alright but also made it easy to slip out of Chinese and get off track. Id just rather take this class in-person."

The professor did an amazing job at facilitating engagement and curiosity, and I didn't mind waking up every morning to learn! You get what you put into it, and I think this course truly helps you improve your Chinese if you work hard enough.",
