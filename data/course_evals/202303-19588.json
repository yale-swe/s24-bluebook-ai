            "comments": [
                "I enjoyed the lectures and topics, especially the rotating professors.",
                "I think this course would be improved by having a requirement for coding experience, it was listed as accessible for students without coding experience but I found a large barrier for those of us that were hoping to learn more about how to code in this class before it came to applying it.",
                "It was disappointing that this course states it is designed for people with no coding experience, but the coding module itself is not taught in a way that is beneficial to those with genuinely no experience. Julien Berro is an expert in coding, but does not have insight into just how little people who have no coding experience will understand. Following the coding module, we were given complex code throughout the rest of the class, using functions etc that we were never taught, but expected to be able to use and understand on homework assignments and, particularly, the final project.\r\n\r\nTHAT SAID, I think this course could be an excellent and valuable introduction into quantitative approaches given that either a) coding is added as a prerequisite for this course or b) the reliance on coding is removed from the non-coding modules or c) the coding module at the start of the class is curated for beginners, and made to be much longer to give students a better understanding.",
                "Strengths: the homework assignments are straightforward in the sense that it never felt like busy work, but would truly test your understanding. I liked that there were many chances to provide feedback and check in with our understanding \r\nWeaknesses: Our class was larger than usual this year and could have benefitted from an additional TA for more office hours",
                "This course taught the concepts clearly and the homeworks helped cement the concepts.",
                "Strengths: The course material was interesting and very applicable to real biology work in research labs. The teaching team was also very knowledgeable, approachable, kind, and helpful. Weaknesses: Some of the lectures were a little boring. It would be helpful to engage students in in-class participation somehow.",
                "A strength was that I enjoyed getting to learn about many different methods that are used in biophysical analysis. A weakness is that because we covered a lot of different techniques, we didn't get to spend a lot of time on each one, so it felt like we just got a quick introduction rather than learning enough to actually be able to use some of the techniques on our own in some cases.",
                "The course is taught by three professors and broken down into well-defined units which was a strength of the course as it was very organized. Overall, I think the course provided numerous opportunities for feedback on learning.",
                "It is confusing how much background knowledge this class assumes the audience to have. First, although the class states coding experience is not necessary, having experience will help a lot in understanding the code provided by the instructors and completing the final project. The \"introduction to MATLAB\" segment is too simple for coders but too fast for beginners. The Fourier transform segment is advanced (and very engaging for me). But the statistics segment seems too basic. The different segments also don't seem cohesive enough to be in the same class, especially the modeling and large dataset analysis.",
                "The course offers a nice survey to some quantitative approaches used in biology, but doesn't really go deep enough to be helpful. Final projects seemed to rely on prior knowledge with people have coding experience being more advantageous.",
                "Some of the strengths include that professors Yong Xiong and Sibel Yalcin were excellent at teaching the material about Fourier transforms and statistics in a clear manner.\r\nSome of the weaknesses include that the way Matlab was taught was slightly confusing. We learned Matlab at the beginning of the semester, didn't use it in the middle of the semester, and had to use it at the end. So, we only knew some of the basic functions of Matlab at the end of the semester. It would have been better if we were continuously taught about Matlab throughout the semester so that I would be more comfortable with how to use Matlab beyond the basics (for, while loops, making graphs are some of the basics, but it would have been cool to learn about how image processing works on Matlab) or how to develop a skillset for develop code that can be applied to other languages such as Java or C++.",
                "Lectures were clear, and the course covered many topics. A better introduction to MATLAB and more resources could be provided.",
                "While I learned a lot in this course, the pre-requisite should account for some coding experience. I feel as though most of my knowledge obtained was theoretical and not practical. I often found that some of the lectures seemed unorganized."

The course teaches you a lot of quantitative skills that will be useful in any biological research; it is very important to be able to analyze data and simulate biological systems. The Fourier Transform module was especially well taught. I have been taught Fourier Transform in the past but was never able to understand it. However, Professor Xiong teaches it in a way that makes it interesting, less intimidating, and easy to follow!",
