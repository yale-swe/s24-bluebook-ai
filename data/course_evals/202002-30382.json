   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely helpful in expanding my knowledge of Russian grammar and my comfort with more complex syntactical constructions and my general reading comprehension. This course managed to address difficult and complicated grammatical topics like participles, gerunds, rules involving numbers, and also touched on grammatical aspect. Where reading comprehension is concerned, this course required us to read decently complicated texts about 19th century history. The course texts were challenging but ultimately deeply helpful.",
    "I learned how to read complex texts such as history readings and newspaper articles in Russian, write longer assignments using more complicated sentence structures, and speak more freely in Russian during discussion.",
    "I developed a higher level of Russian language knowledge and proficiency."

   "comments": [
    "Frankly, this course was fantastic. Its main strengths were a) the quality of reading materials, and b) its in-depth explanations of grammar. As an aside, I would like to add that Professor Muravnik's explanation of grammatical aspect, which is always a thorny problem for students of Russian, was very enlightening. As for weaknesses, I would say that there wasn't enough provision made for speaking. Of course, that's partially inevitable when you're trying to cover a lot of difficult material quickly, and only have 2 hours a day. Professor Muravnik did require a number of student presentations, but perhaps some provision could be made for additional conversation sessions as well?",
    "I felt that Third year Russian was very well designed--there was a large diversity of written and oral assignments that challenged us as Russian students in different ways. The history readings were difficult, but I felt that by the end of the course I was reading more quickly with higher comprehension than at the beginning. I also loved how the readings were supplemented with pop-culture and art history references, giving a better sense of Russian culture. I also appreciated the small size of the class.",
    "It is engaging and informative, without being overwhelming. Would have been better if offered in St. Petersburg rather than online but what can you do about it, we are in a middle of a pandemic."

    "Yes! The course is a lot of work, but any student can expect to be much more comfortable reading, writing, and speaking Russian at a conversational level by the end of the course.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone seriously taking Russian."
