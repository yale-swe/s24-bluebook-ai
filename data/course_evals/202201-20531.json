                "It's very good.",

Also helpful grading system.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were too fast-paced and new concepts were introduced without enough conceptual explanations. The examples that we were shown in class were much less complex than the examples on the homework, and often involved incorporating some other mathematical tools (brush up on your set theory) which were themselves not intuitive. I also wish we were allowed to drop a problem set from the overall homework grade, as we could in 241.",
                "The course is really interesting and well organized.",

                "it is great in every way",
                "The availability and generosity of the teaching staff was a strength (shout-out to Zhou, David, Daniel, Neeha, and Katherine in particular). I also really appreciated the neatly typed class notes to supplement the hand-written notes during recorded lecture. An area for improvement might be better tying together the higher-level big ideas connecting the various concepts, and better clarifying when various approaches might be applied in practice, with real-world examples.",
                "Strengths: good teaching, recorded lectures and the many different office hour times made the class accessible, great late homework policy / Weaknesses: psets were quite time intensive, both exams felt long and difficult in comparison to HWs, wish more preparation materials (like practice exams) had been made available prior to exams",
                "Strengths: Professor Fan is an excellent instructor. His lectures are clear, his lecture notes are organized and easy to understand, and he is very helpful in office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours are so homework-driven. I feel like at least one or two office hours in a given week should be dedicated to conceptual questions, and not just homework questions.",
                "I really don't like how the exams are much harder than the practices or reviews. The practices were useless and not helpful in regards to prepare for the exams. It is very frustrating.",
                "It is cover a lot of concepts and skills, from which I learned a lot. The weakness might be there is lots of homework the whole semester, but I think it is necessary for me to grab those concepts.",
                "I think Prof. Fan is a very clear and organized lecturer. I appreciate the notes that he released, and I think he does a good job of explaining things in lecture. I have only two critiques: \r\n\r\n1. The lectures can be rather dry at time. A lot of time is spent on algebraic manipulation, which I feel could be omitted without loss of learning.\r\n2. The exams were more difficult than expected. They were perhaps a bit too difficult for a 200 level math class. I felt that success on the exams hinged more on mathematical maturity rather than understanding of course material at times. However, do not let the exams discourage you from taking the course.",
                "The strength is the amount of outside help the course offers. The weakness is that because the lectures are so long, there is a ton of information to process per class, and it can be hard to keep up. I am also not sure why we had to code for the course, it was definitely interesting to learn about, but became strenuous at times for a class that did not have pre-requisites of computer science.",

                "The course is well organized with the notes, video, and topic of each class posted on the course website. The problem sets are relatively short but the problems can be difficult, and came down to bashing algebra a lot of the time. I wish there was a little more guidance on equation solving since that is usually the most difficult part of the homework and exams.",

                "The scribed lecture notes were extremely helpful in accompanying the live lecture and the assignments were well-designed. However, I don't think the content is particularly interesting or engaging. I also wish there was more practice material for the exams because Zhou Fan likes to include problems that require more general math intuition, not necessarily knowledge about statistics.",
                "The instructor and the notes he gives after lecture are a true strength of the course. The psets and piazza definitely help build intuition. However you have to be on top of your work since the start of the semester for concepts to make sense.",
                "Strengths are that the course is challenging and will therefore give you a rigorous treatment of the material. The weaknesses are that the PSETs are not too representative of what we do in class and are often too hard to do without going to office hours.",
                "We did not have a lot of extra practice material for the exam",

                "great",
                "Strengths: high quality lecture notes, Zhou Fan great lecturer, exams were good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets felt tedious at times but were good overall, textbook readings did not line up with class",
                "Great, challenging course.\r\n\r\nCan be hard to learn how to attack problems bc in office hrs the ULAs mostly just tell you how to do them (not how to figure them out).",
                "Professor Fan, while very interesting, spends a lot of time going into depth. I quite liked learning the concepts, but the exams were hard.",
                "The recorded lectures were a very nice component of the class. Additionally, having the homeworks be both theoretical and coding questions helped to really understand and apply the material. A weakness of the course could perhaps be homework length - some of them were very long and took a great deal of time to complete whereas others were much shorter, which made it tough to gauge week to week how much of a load it would be.",
                "This course is great",
                "I really enjoyed listening to lectures during class. I also thought the homework problems were helpful for helping us understand content, as well as somewhat see empirical results through the few examples in R.",
                "Strength: systematic knowledge and clear, understandable handouts",
                "The lectures are great. Only complaint is Piazza. For a class with this number is people on the instruction team, the response is very slow.",
                "More programming examples.",
                "I think the lectures were excellent. The material got very abstract at times, but it wasn't too hard to follow because the notes were very clear and thorough.",
                "This course is well-organized. However, it will be better if the exam difficulty match with the course level.",
                "Very clear and concise notes. Representative practice exams. Some pset questions were a bit too vague it was clear from lecture what we had to do.",
                "The class exposes you to a strong foundation in mathematical statistics that I think will greatly help me move forward with my major and studies. The class material could seem easy at first, but it ramps up quite quickly and would likely feel challenging to many.",
                "This course covered a lot of material, which was good, but I would have appreciated an understanding of how this material fits into the field of statistics as a whole.",
                "Having the lecture notes uploaded and ready was a huge plus, as well as having the topics all outlined from the start of the course made it easier to follow along. Also, reviewing the previous lecture's content at the start of each class was a plus. A weakness was that it was sometimes hard to take notes, since the class sorta just followed the lectures notes, and sometimes the written notes were too fast for me to process and copy down at the same time.",
                "It is a bit hard.",
                "Strengths: it's taught by Zhou Fan, an amazing, wonderful, and accommodating lecturer -- I wished I gotten to connect with him more! The psets are also reasonable -- you get a week to do about 3-4 questions (there were 10 psets this year). There aren't many weaknesses, however, due to it being at 9AM, I quickly fell behind lectures and resorted to the recordings. Make sure you're on top of the lectures, the material is interesting!",
                "Strengths: organization of course; fairness/helpfulness of PSETS; high-quality office hours; PSETs graded quickly and with plenty of feedback; Piazza extremely helpful for finding answers to questions--Professor Fan and his staff responded quickly\r\nWeaknesses: lecturing was a bit dry--Prof. Fan just read off of slides or copied slides from his monitor",
                "The notes and slides were amazing. They were very thorough and well-organized. Zhou was really clear with his teaching. You can tell he knew what he was talking about. The midterm and the final exams were challenging. Most ULAs were good and there were a lot of available office hours, although not the most convenient times or locations. I really liked the late day policy where you get 5 late days. Sometimes u just need a day to get ur stuff together.",
                "I felt like the class moved very rapidly",
                "Strengths: Prof. Fan is very invested in his students' learning experience; this class, in my opinion, was a much more pleasant experience than S&DS 241.\r\nWeaknesses: There were so many examples during the lectures that it was difficult on occasion to tell when important new material was being introduced.",
                "The lecturing was good, and the problem sets were fun. The course could be improved with more applications.",
                "The teaching was excellent and super clear, the material was interesting, the problem sets supported learning",
                "It would be difficult to overstate my appreciation for this course and Professor Fan as a teacher. Prof Fan was, without fail, a kind, motivated, clear, pedagogically-minded teacher. His office hours, in which he would so patiently and helpfully walk students through more challenging problem set questions, have been a highlight of my semester. It was clear that considerable forethought had gone into the structuring and progression of the lecture materials, and the lecture notes were an incredibly useful aid that covered all required material and allowed for revision of the course content. I was deeply appreciative of the course overall.\r\n\r\nAs one point of feedback, I would suggest that sometimes the density of the course and the regularity of problem sets meant there was little time for more conceptual revision. For example, office hours were predominantly spent reviewing problem set questions, as opposed to going deeper on course content or having more conceptual discussions. The course would be enriched by allowing slightly more time for this.",
                "Zhou is amazing and his lecture notes and office hours are especially helpful. The psets and exams are beautifully written and weave together all the concepts that weve covered.",
                "Very hard to learn outside of class. Office hours are packed and mostly only discuss homework answers.",
                "Great class. The time is really early at somewhere reallly far away though. It was also a bit too easy I think. Maybe casual inference will be better in that regard",
                "Very well structured, sufficiently challenging and interesting course. Professor Fan was a phenomenal professor and was good at teaching and explaining concepts",
                "The professor is a great lecturer but the material is very dense and challenging. I wish the office hours were held at bigger classrooms as it was always packed and hard to find seats.",
                "The course is great but it is too difficult, making students overwhelmed",
                "Pretty good course",
                "Strengths: Rigorous theoretical statistics class with fascinating material\r\nWeakness: Tests are not \"directly\" from the material, which in my opinion, is suboptimal when the tests are timed. I would also love if one question were added to each homework using actual data, which would make this class prepare students for applying the theoretical knowledge.\r\n\r\nOther: I'd prefer Ed Discussions over Piazza.",
                "Strengths: Zhou! He is an absolutely incredible lecturer, very organized and thorough. I love the way he writes out the notes in class. He provides beautifully typed latex notes for every lecture, all lectures are recorded, and he is extremely organized in his thoughts and the way he presents his material. Lectures flow well from other lectures, and he builds up the concepts over the course of the semester in a way that makes sense. He is kind and soft-spoken and really wants students to learn. The homework questions are good, and there are enough office hours throughout the week that you can always get help. Weaknesses: If at all....the tests are crazy and hard!!!! No matter how hard you study he'll pull some context out of left field that will stump you. But I still believe Zhou's tests are much more thoughtful than the exams I've seen from other professors teaching this course.",
                "I think overall the level of difficulty of the course was completely unnecessary.  Exams were extremely difficult and somewhat resembled the work in class but always consisted of something that I had basically never seen before.  Overall, I think that if the artificial difficulty was lowered and I would have gotten much more out of the class and it would have been interesting.",
                "Too much material taught quickly without time to digest because we needed to code abs understand theory",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\n1. The teacher has a class-apart teaching style. Professor Fan is one of the best in the field and he makes sure he covers stuff in great depth and the students have a good intuition in the topics covered. \r\n\r\n2. This class can be a little more practical oriented. I felt this class is a little too theoretical. Some more practical emphasis on the models taught would be good for students.",
                "I was certainly not a fan of the exams. I spent a good amount of time reviewing the material from lecture and the homeworks, but when it came to testing days I felt that only one or two ideas from these sources were used to address the problems we were given. The rest was just an abstract test of mathematical intuition. It is possible that I just needed to understand the content a bit more but the class averages seem to disagree. The homework problems were pretty interesting and forced us to view the ideas presented to us in class in a new light. I just wish there was a greater emphasis on simulation.",
                "very structured materials and well-explained",
                "Great course, hard exams.",
                "Strengths: the lectures are arranged in a logical and complete way, which is important for every student who plan to learn statistics.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the lecture after midterm is somhow difficult for me. The homework takes up a lot of my time.",
                "The professor taught the material in a very clear manner.",
                "The course was very well organized. The professor explained concepts very clearly throughout lecture with detailed and useful notes provided corresponding with each lecture. The homeworks were also well designed and offered good problems to practice and better understand the material.",
                "strengths: very organized, broad coverage and has the depth of the materials at the same time\r\n\r\nweakness: class assignments are a bit difficult sometimes",
                "The professor did an excellent job making the topic accessible and it was an overall very interesting class. I would have liked a little bit more rigorous proofs here and there but that is just my personal preference. I can't say much about the exams or homeworks because I audited.",
                "A fantastic course, despite being very hard. I learned the most in this class out of any I've taken at Yale, I think. The lectures were incredibly straightforward and organized, and the lecture notes were the best resource of all.",
                "Quite good.",
                "The assignments are difficult and the exams are hard. Even though I listened to every lesson, I still found it very difficult to write assignments and exams.\r\nThe professar is a very kind and talented teacher who talks about things in class that I can understand, but when it comes to the classroom and changes, it doesn't.",
                "The problem sets are shorter than other stem classes, and they are very well organized. They accurately represent the course. The exams are difficult, but they also accurately represent the course. There are many office hours are a variety of times to help out with the problem sets."

                "Sure. The course is helpful to learn more about Statistics.",
                "yes",
                "yes, well-organized and very clear lecture",
                "Yes. The instructor is excellent and the course is well organized. I can alway learn things from this course even when learning something I've already known before.",
                "Yes, but I with the caveats that my answers to the last two questions about intellectual challenge and workload were \"much greater\" relative to other courses I've taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend taking this with Zhou specifically, as I thought he was a great professor.",
                "If you need it for your major, sure, it isn't bad. But maybe not just for fun",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. Prof Fan is very good at teaching and explaining.",
                "Perhaps. It can be a little dry sometimes, but if you intend to take more S&DS courses in the future it seems like a necessary prerequisite.",
                "Not if they do not need it for their major. It is extremely difficult and time-intensive. The concepts themselves are incredibly hard (even though the teacher does a good job), and it is in general a lot of work.",
                "Yes if interested in probability/statistics, or needed for major/certificate",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory course to understand the theories behind statistical methods. In addition, the proofs are accompanied by examples, and therefore the materials are motivating and interesting.",
                "Yes if they need it, otherwise probably not",
                "Yes take it. You learn a lot and it is pretty fair.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes",
                "Only if you're interested in the theory behind statistical stuff. Otherwise take classes more focused on application and R",
                "If Zhou Fan is teaching it, absolutely. He is an excellent lecturer and many of my friends also taking this class can agree. This course is pretty content heavy compared to 241 but he makes sure concepts dont get confusing because he makes sure to adequately justify every step while going at a great pace for covering content. The problem sets are not significantly heavy workload wise and the midterm/final were reasonable, given a curve and we were allowed to bring a cheat sheet. I definitely got a lot out of the class given the strength of his lectures.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if you want to understand how statistics works a bit better, this is a great option, in particular with Professor Fan.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about hypothesis testing and model estimation in depth, but it does require a solid knowledge in multivariable calculus and probability, and there are easier classes that focus on more the applicable contents.",
                "Yes. Build a solid foundation to the further statistics study.",
                "sure!",
                "Yeah basic math course solid",
                "If you are a stat major, then I would recommend. If youre not, dont give yourself extra trouble",
                "Yes, although it's definitely harder than 241. Zhou's a great professor and his lectures are clear.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about statistical inference. It's very theory heavy, but there are some applications with coding questions in the homeworks",
                "It is a difficult course but it was very rewarding. I struggled in the beginning and didn't do so well on the midterm, but I got the hang of it and did better on the final.",
                "Yes! Its probably required for you, but honestly I enjoyed it and I feel like I learned a lot. Exams are difficult, but the curves are very generous.",
                "Very informative course",
                "Only if you're interested in statistics. As a non-SDS major, I didn't really see much benefit in this class. The material can be interesting, but it's not for everyone.",
                "It is a very useful course with concepts used in research and many real life field work.",
                "Yes!",
                "No, unless for the S&DS major, which in that case I'd say take it. It's extremely difficult and highly theoretical, therefore, I don't think I came out learning anything about statistics that will help me in research or experimental design.",
                "I would not. It was so really hard with not a lot of practice provided before each exam",
                "Only if you need it for the major or plan to do heavy work in stats, otherwise is not very useful.",
                "yes",
                "yes",
                "Yes, good if you want to learn statistics and a more theoretical level.",
                "I would! Great course for the foundations of statistics. Leaves me excited and prepared for future courses in the dept.",
                "Yes if they are interested in statistical theory",
                "I would recommend it to other students only if they have a strong interest in theoretical math AND this isn't the first high level math class they've taken.",

Prof. Fan is amazing and manages to make what I expected to be dry and boring content very interesting and digestible, and for that reason I don't regret at all waking up early to attend his lectures every M/W at 9am.",
                "Yes\r\nVery useful",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. Seen more for fundamental math computing skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes math or has an interest in the theories behind why we do things the way we do. A lot of applied courses brush off questions of \"why\" or \"how\" things work, but this one really tries to get you to see the logic behind the statistical models we take for granted.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot from this class",
                "I would recommend this class to any student who wishes to take higher-level statistics classes. It is a requirement in many cases, but even that aside, it helps with building the foundations that would be necessary to do well in any other statistics or mathematics course.",
                "No.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, the essential concepts that you learn are all reinforced in the following lectures, and feel important to know. The tests may be a bit challenging since it's not memorization but problem solving, but overall this class isn't too hard while still being rigorous.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this was a great class to take -- I've taken S&DS 230 and 241, and after taking both, this class has been able to explain many of the concepts taught in 230, and answered the \"why\" we do this. I especially appreciated the lecture that talked about designing good experiments and questions--Zhou Fan's an EXCEPTIONAL lecturer and I really wished I had talked to him more. The psets are reasonable -- you get a week to do about 3-4 questions (there were 10 psets this year) and there is usually one coding question for every PSET for the latter half of the semester. There aren't many weaknesses, however, due to the class being at 9AM, I quickly fell behind lectures and resorted to the recordings. Make sure you're on top of the lectures because the material is interesting!",
                "Yes! I'm taking it just out of interest for the subject material, and I thought it was tough, but not too tough, and that I learned a lot.",
                "Required for the S&DS major and I can see how this stuff is foundational for more advanced statistics courses.",
                "Important to take but I will say that it was challenging",
                "Yes; it's a good theoretical introduction to a toolkit of useful statistical techniques, taught by a great professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as it provides a strong statistical background useful in any setting.",
                "It was very good. I think good teaching is very important, this course had very good teaching, in addition it was quite interesting.",
                "I would recommend the course in strong terms to any student looking to gain a deeper understanding of statistical theory to supplement other more applied courses. I would suggest that anyone with a background at the 238 level would be more than prepared to take the course.",
                "Absolutely! You have to be confident in math and a solid probability background (some concepts from 241 turned out to be extremely helpful) but otherwise theres not much to worry about.",
                "Only if they are prepared for the class being heavy on learning on their own.",
                "Yes, great overall view of basic stats",
                "Absolutely, particularly for a budding data scientist.",
                "This is the course that takes you from \"knows a little R\" to \"understands statistics\".",
                "If the student is interested in theoretical aspect of stats and data science, then yes.",
                "Yes. The workload is in control. You can learn almost all the necessary knowledge for a statistics student.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Excellent instructor",
                "I'd recommend this class for students interested in Ph.D. in statistics or other similar areas.",
                "Yes. It is not an easy class, but if you want a solid introductory foundation to the principles of statistical inference, this is a very good course. I believe Zhou is the most difficult of the professors who teach this course, but I think his method is well worth it. His notes are very organized and there is always a way to get help and the TAs, ULAs and the professor make themselves available throughout the week. His homework and exam questions are in-depth and make you really think about how to apply the material in context.",
                "If you are super super into statistical theory then take the course, if not then I wouldn't suggest it.  Also, be ready for a solid workload and some tough exams.",
                "It is required",
                "Highly recommend this to any student trying to gain any insight in the field of statistical analysis. Professor Fan is one of the best in the field and his teaching style is just phenomenal. Please do take this class. It won't be an easy one, especially the exams TBH, but I can assure you , you would learn a lot from this class.",
                "I would say only if you need to take it as a prerec or have a deep interest in both statistics and math. Coming into the course I was definitely more interested in the applications of what we learned rather than the theory behind it and this course really solidified that for me. I would say the most valuable thing this course had to offer someone like me were some new tests/estimation techniques and some reasoning behind which ones to apply to questions down the road, but I feel like I could have gotten that information from another source with less hand-wavy proofs.",
                "No",
                "yes, this is a very nice and comprehensive intro course",
                "Yes! Interesting topics that anyone who studies statistics should know, but also hard exams.",
                "For those who plan to learn more on statistics, yes.",
                "yes! this class covered interesting content but the exams are brutal",
                "Yes if interested in the more theoretical parts of statistics.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes, I learn a lot from it.",
                "Yes, it definitely gives a good overview about the most important concepts in statistics.",
                "If they are a S&DS major, definitely. If not, I'd recommend Cr/D/F the class, but still very much worth it.",
                "Quite good.",
                "If the student is very interested in mathematical theory, I would highly recommend it. However, if he wants to do a direction that is more applied, I would advise him to think again.",
                "This is a fantastic class. The exams can be difficult, but the material is explained very well and there are plenty of opportunities for additional help when needed. The mix of derivations and programming on the homework makes the problems much more interesting."
