                "I learned a lot about the history and culture of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia during and after the Soviet Era, and I was exposed to a wide range of political artists.",
                "The history of protest art in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, exactly as it says on the course title! Not too many hard skills, but this class was definitely a milestone on my journey to becoming a better writer, mostly due to the extensive and incredibly helpful feedback that the instructor and the teaching fellow provided for the midterm and final paper.",
                "This class was a fantastic way to dive deeper into protest culture in soviet and post-soviet Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Andrews personal connection and dedication to bringing in guest speakers also served as an amazing way to learn more about a topic very often overshadowed in the US the deep differences between Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia and how they push back against totalitarianism."

                "I appreciated the different formats the materials took, from videos, to plays, to journals. I think there could have been more communication between the professor and the TA, but overall it was a very enjoyable class.",
                "I wish there had been more organization as to the lectures, particularly in the early semester when we were covering eastern European history pretty quickly, as the lectures could be hard to follow and I personally had very little familiarity with the topic. Sometimes the discussions involved questions that it seemed many of the students didn't necessarily have the historical and political knowledge to be able to answer, so it was at times challenging to participate. But I really enjoyed the assigned material and direct interaction with guest speakers, and it was great to hear firsthand experiences from the professor and read his own artistic work.",
                "One strength of this course is its breadth of curricula; i.e., the information in the syllabus is super concentrated and thus you can learn a lot of information in a short amount of time. I think the breadth of curricula is actually also its weakness; if one's field of study isn't adjacent to Eastern Europe, or theater, or anything else listed on the course listing, it's a little hard to be as engaged with the course as you'd want to be."

                "Yes!! Great for those in the RSEE and THST majors alike to broaden their horizons. A lot of films on the syllabus, which I enjoyed, but good to be aware if that's not your thing. Learned SO much, and Andrei and Alana are both fantastic inistructors.",
                "Yes! It was very interesting and relevant. I gained insights into different parts of the world and I am grateful for it.",
                "Absolutely! I think that the syllabus explains it well, and if this topic sounds interesting to you, you should take the course. The workload is very reasonable, and the readings are not too challenging. The opportunity for a creative final project was also great to apply the knowledge acquired over the course of the semester in an interesting way.",
                "YES!! A fantastic class that doesnt have a crazy workload that can really open your eyes to protest movements in Eastern Europe."
