   "comments": [
    "As opposed to earlier classes in Korean, in Korean L4 you focus less on personal topics and more on abstract topics. You learn to debate with your classmates and think critically about concepts in Korean. Having to speak every day in class motivated me to work harder, and I'd want to come in prepared with concepts that I knew how to explain with the Korean I knew.",
    "I improved a lot especially in Korean speaking fluency and writing\/grammar",
    "I learned lots of new vocab and practical ways of speaking Korean, not just how to write formally.",
    "Korean 142 was an incredible class -- you learn integral Korean vocabulary necessary to communicate at a more advanced level, are able to practice reading real Korean literature\/articles, can improve more advanced writing skills, and have the opportunity to practice speaking and listening Korean. The class is very well catered to heritage speakers who have grown up speaking\/listening to Korean but need more support in vocabulary and written skills.",
    "I improved in my writing and speaking skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class is the professor. Angela Lee-Smith comes in to class every day with all of the day's lessons meticulously planned. She makes sure to work just as hard as the students, if not much more, and that inspires the students to work even harder to meet her expectations, which is definitely a point to consider: she does expect a lot out of you.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that with so many students this year, the speaking portions of the class could last the entire class period. On discussion days, usually there would only be enough time for each person to share one point of discussion.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lee is literally the best. You can really tell that she cares about your learning and always pushes her students to be better. She also cooks Korean food for us every Friday so that's also a plus. I improved your Korean speaking fluency a lot through debates and discussions, learned more Korean vocabulary, and became a better writer.\r\nNo weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: very engaging, the class dynamic is really fun and great, learned tons of new words, improved my speaking, many fun projects",
    "The course is a very manageable workload (I did not spend more than 30 minutes on homework) and the occasional vocabulary quizzes are very manageable. In comparison to the Chinese\/heritage Chinese courses offered at Yale, this class is much more relaxed and has a much much lighter workload -- I would say the only stressful aspect of the class is speaking during class if you are not fully comfortable speaking in Korean."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course, but only if you are TRULY committed to getting better at Korean. Do not take this class unless you are  you will stick out like a sore thumb in the discussions if you are not prepared. Angela Lee-Smith likes to call out people to make sure they have truly done their homework for the class.",
    "Yes! It's not too much work and you get a lot out of it.",
    "Yes! Would definitely recommend this course to those heritage students who want to get better in Korean! It is not a heavy workload at all, Professor Lee-Smith is so friendly and desires for everyone to improve in their Korean, and it is just such a wonderful and fun class.",
    "Especially if you are a heritage speaker who is looking to improve your reading and writing skills, I would highly recommend this course. I had experience taking other Korean classes at the Korean embassy and other places, but this was definitely the best fit. You get to know some of the other Korean heritage speakers on campus, and you realize that you and many of your classmates have common experiences. Professor Lee also does a great job in keeping students engaged and maintaining a strong energy in the classroom. And the language tables every Friday with amazing Korean food is also an amazing added bonus to help relieve homesickness and a break from dining hall food."
