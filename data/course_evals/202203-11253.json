                "Learned a lot about series, biological modeling, phase planes, differential equations in terms of a biological standpoint.",
                "We went over integrals, infinite series, and systems of differential equations, even dipping into topics of multivariable calculus and linear algebra at the end of the course. There was a large focus on the idea of equilibria, and we learned about it in the context of competition (prey vs. predator, language), and pandemic dynamics. We also read papers on topics spanning medication effects on viral load, neuronal firing, language death, predation, and pandemics, and sought to learn the math modeling each situation. While I definitely learned the math expected of me, I felt like I learned so much more in this class too, just by nature of the application and having to read the research papers and understand the math before debriefing in class. We also learned how to use the Wolfram Mathematica software.",
                "besides just calculus the biological modeling was very interesting to learn about",
                "How to understand models for different biological phenomena and an overview of calculus 2 topics.",
                "I learned how to interpret complex math equations in papers and all the contents in a normal Calc 2 course.",
                "This class taught me how best to tackle PSETs. I would stat start by going through the whole assignment and trying to answer the questions I knew how to, not spending too much time on one question. After doing this, I would return to the questions that troubled me and attempt to solve them. If I find myself not progressing, I will ask some classmates for some help and go to office hours. This has proven to be the best way to conserve time when doing PSETs. This class has also showed me the importance of stating PSETs as early as possible.",
                "I learned calculus 2 and it was very helpful. It was very difficult but worth it at the end of the course.",
                "I learned how to relate math to scientific readings.",
                "Overall, I learned about certain applications of calculus in biological models. Some focuses of this class were phase planes, competing species models, and disease models. We also learned some new integration techniques, and focused extensively on sums and series.",
                "This class is not your standard Calc BC class, but it is quite interesting to learn the biological perspective of math. While I dont think Ill apply the knowledge much in the future, its definitely more interesting than just learning straight math. I will say the Psets are unnecessarily hard and take quite a while but the tests are not bad at all as long as you do the practice tests. Prof. Hall is also a really caring teacher so overall decent course.",
                "This course made me feel like I was able to succeed at Yale because it was hard but I understood the material. I learned a lot about calculus and modeling, and I am now considering further pursuing learning how to model and applying it to archaeology.",
                "How to apply calculus to real life biological researches. Methods of calculus.",
                "I learned a lot about calculus, as well as various real-world applications regarding it! The problem sets and tests formats taught me how to develop more critical thinking skills, and different approaches to questions.",
                "I gained an understanding of the mathematical content of Math 116, as well as an appreciation for the way calculus fits into the scientific articles we read. It was really neat to see how math applied to modeling biological systems.",
                "I learned more about how math relates to biology and its importance in the real world.  I also learned more about integration, jacobian matrices, and partial derivatives.  It was very interesting and unlike any other math class I have taken.",

Professor Hall is always willing to answer questions or clarify something. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The connection to biosciences is not as strong as it should be. The papers are relevant for a certain midterm but then are never talked about again. The application of the paper and the math were are doing did not have a strong connection.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall is awesome, and he is great at teaching. Weaknesses: psets were sometimes insanely long and difficult",
                "john halls videos were extremely helpful, and having an index card for exams was very useful too",
                "The material was very interesting and built off of each other. I felt that the amount of practice problems really helped me. The psets were way too long.",
                "Strengths: Content is super interesting, Professor Hall is an amazing professor, and midterms are fair tests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes psets were a little too long.",
                "This course is very applicable to the real world; this is what excited me about what I was learning. Though the academic journal articles I had to read were very abstruse, the instructor made sure to go over them in class.",
                "I wish there were more resources other than the TAs and office hours.",
                "Some strengths of this course were that the professor (Hall) was very approachable and willing to answer questions, and his lectures were generally pretty thorough and well-explained. However, I would definitely say that the extensive workload and the content on the p-sets was a weakness of this class. Unless you had significant background knowledge in the content area, extensive office hours attendance (about 6-7 hours per week) was essentially required just to get the p-sets done, so I would say that the total workload for this class was quite high. Additionally, I would say that a weakness of this course was that content questions for this course specifically couldn't be answered by the textbook, so you really just had to be diligent with attending lectures, going to office hours, and asking questions in class.",
                "I enjoyed that the course had wonderful peer tutors and passionate lecturers. I disliked that we had multiple psets due close to the final exam.",
                "I felt like the class was very fast paced, sometimes skipping over delicate but important details.",
                "These weaknesses were only slight, but I felt that the class moved along faster than I was able to keep up with. Working through the problem sets were also very difficult, and felt extremely challenging without the help of going to office hours. I don't think there's much ways to improve this, but this is just a difficulty I had.\r\nIn terms of strengths, the amount of office hours held was really helpful, even if I didn't end up going to many. It was great having many options to get help. The professor was also really attentive to answering students' questions, so I appreciated that.",
                "This course was very well organized. The peer tutor evening office hours were very helpful, as were Professor Hall's after class office hours. Gradescope worked well for turning in assignments, and Perusall worked well for annotating the journal articles.",
                "The main strength of this course was its emphasis on biology and real-life experiments and systems.  One weakness of the course was the lack of examples and the difficulty of the problem sets."

It is difficult if you are not familiar with differential equations. However, I would recommend this course because of John Hall, he is an awesome math professor.",
                "Yes, only if they want to learn more about disease modeling",
                "Absolutely. Learning about systems of differential equations in all of the contexts presented in the class through the different readings and class activities was fascinating. It felt more meaningful learning the math with the applications and interpretations in mind, as well as made it easier for me to conceptualize each step and component of the problems asked of me.",

If you like bio and math, this course should be a no brainer. You learn really valuable skills in the scientific aspect while also learning how to do calc 2.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. It adds a spin to the usually Calculus 2 curriculum by showing students how the Calculus 2 concepts can be applied to biological systems. It is highly recommended for those who may have already taken Calculus 2 during high school; it will likely be different from any other math class students had taken prior.",
                "Yes if you are interested in some biological aspects of calculus",

However, if they are just trying to check off a math course off a list of major or pre-med requirements, or if they have not taken calculus beyond calculus A/B in high school, then I would not recommend this class.",
                "Yes over Math 115",
                "I would add that the course should be labeled as intensive, which was not clear to me when I signed up, but yes the course is very good and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes! It is calculus, which is a class required for a lot of majors, but this class offers different kinds of applications that seem relevant to many areas. Overall, I think the class was doable and with a bit of effort anyone can do well.",
                "Absolutely. It was super neat to take a math class that showed how calculus-based mathematical models are deeply relevant to modeling everything from diseases to language death to neuron firing. Professor Hall is an incredible professor, and I'm glad to have taken the course with him.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they like story problems in math.  This class isn't just about formulas and correct answers, it is about understanding and comparing.",
                "Yes, it does a good job at teaching important concepts, but the biology aspect makes it much more engaging."
