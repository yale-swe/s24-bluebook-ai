Overall, pretty good introduction to historical linguistics, but a LOT of the course overlapping heavily with Introduction to Linguistics.",
                "I learned how to use the comparative method to reconstruct proto-languages using only the modern forms of its daughter languages. I learned about the different pressures which drive language change and how we can use these to do anthropology. I also learned about pidgins and creoles, language endangerment, and the evolutionary origin of language.",
                "I was introduced to the fascinating field of historical linguistics, including their methods and motivations. I became aware of how much goes into language reconstruction, as well as the social implications of issues like language revitalization.",

                "An in-depth understanding of how languages develop the way they do, and how they grow to become more different (or more similar!) over time. Through this we also learn about how language relates to culture and how we can study history through language.",

                "Prior to taking this course, I had no knowledge of linguistics, although I was definitely interested in language families as well as Bantu languages (e.g., Swahili). Through this course, I was able to gain a very basic conceptual understanding of most of the major fields in linguistics, including phonetics, semantics, morphology, and even phylogenetics. I was also able to learn the International Phonetic Alphabet, which was extremely interesting. Within diachronic linguistics, I learned basic applicative methods of comparative and internal reconstruction, sound change, semantic change and more. I also learned about the importance of languages in influencing and preserving culture (e.g., endangered languages, archeology, writing systems, etc.). Although the course itself did not make me interested in linguistics, afterwards Im definitely interested in taking more linguistics courses (as I am taking quantitative linguistics next semester)."

                "can feel overwhelming at first if you have no prior experience in linguistics",
                "Strengths: Professor Bowern is super smart and very knowledgeable about the field of historical linguistics. It's cool to take a course with not only the professor who wrote our textbook, but a foremost expert in the field of phylogenetic modeling for historical language reconstruction. Weaknesses: I think this class should be reorganized slightly. The problem is that it currently is trying to cater to both linguistics majors and people who've never taken a linguistics class. For the people who already understood linguistics, the class felt largely like a review of concepts taught in previous classes (several of the lectures were basically identical to those Professor Bowern gave in Introduction to Linguistics) and the way we covered material felt too surface-level, while for students unfamiliar with linguistics much of the material was difficult to grasp quickly, because understanding it fully required discussion of linguistic concepts that the course didn't delve into (i.e. phonological features, phonological processes, morphology, etc.). In an ideal word, I feel like this class should have a pre-req of some sortIntroduction to Linguistics or Phonetics of Phonologyso that students taking it have enough of a background in linguistics to engage fully with the concepts. I felt like the class in its current form needed either a lot more depth or an opportunity (i.e. a paper or a final project in place of the final exam) for students to engage with the material to the degree that they want to and practice applying the concepts we'd learned to a real historical linguistic analysis. Also, I don't think nearly enough time was spent discussing the process of historical reconstruction, and the methods used by linguists to perform such analysis. During that whole unit, I felt like we were sort of flying blind, in that it didn't feel like we had nearly enough discussion of the logic necessary to justify subgrouping, or the direction of sound change. Historical reconstruction very much felt like the heart of the course, and I felt like we spent too much time talking about things sort of tangentially related to the actual reconstruction process (i.e. writing systems, the origins of language) that we couldn't really go into depth in this area.",
                "This class was really well-structured and was interesting for students of all levels of linguistics experience. It assumed no experience before hand and did a great job introducing basic concepts while still being interesting for those with more experience. I especially enjoyed all the moments where students were prompted to engage with material in group discussions. I have found no weaknesses in this course, its great!",
                "The course is paced pretty well, with interesting lectures and discussions. More in-class examples about some trickier topics, especially internal reconstruction and the comparative method, would have been very helpful; the class was a bit of a rocky start at first due to the difficulty of those p-sets.",
                "Lectures feel very intro level, but the homework definitely does not. If the homework difficulty remains the same, maybe section ought to be mandatory, since I feel like that is where most of the helpful knowledge/practice came from. I think getting more real world examples of the concepts presented would make the class much more engaging (for example, the guest lecturer for semantic change gave a lot of examples from English that were super interesting). I found it weird that the most interesting examples often came from students in the class with previous linguistic knowledge. I think there was a little too much small group discussion in class. Professor Bowern was kind and open to feedback though.",
                "One difficulty was that although slides were posted, lecture notes weren't and recordings weren't taken, so if you had to miss class it was difficult to catch up on what was missed as the slides only had topic outlines and not much content.",
                "Strength: prof very nice and understanding \r\nWeakness: class structure a bit disorganized",
                "Strengths: the material was very fun! And the homeworks were super well-balanced; they were productive, and I was learning, but they weren't overly difficult. Also, Prof. Bowern is a wonderful teacher. I never worried about asking questions to clarify in class, and her passion for the subject shines through with every lecture. You couldn't get a better professor for this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is a class for current linguistics majors OR as an introduction to the major. This is great, because the subject is fun, but it also makes balancing units a little harder. I think either a little more time could be spent on the phonological features at the beginning of the semester, or maybe a recommendation of either Phonology or Phonetics I before this class would be nice (the latter would allow for more focus on the differences between phonotactics and language change).",
                "The psets were really really long.",
                "Strengths: Almost all of the material was very interesting and not terribly hard to follow. Weaknesses: The lectures could feel a bit aimless at time. Although no less interesting, I felt that we could veer off topic relatively easily.",
                "This was a really fun course. The teaching style connects topics to our own language background, and classroom discussion is encouraged, which makes it an engaging environment. The homework is a little challenging but there are more than enough opportunities in section and office hours to ask questions. The professor and TF are always happy to answer questions and help you understand the homework better.",
                "I personally found the course to be extremally well organized and very well taught as well, throughout the course us students were confident that we were learning many important things.",
                "This class did a great job of having engaging lectures. However, Including answer keys would have improved my learning, although I know this isnt always a possibility.",
                "The topics are interesting and the order of the topics was good. I think the homeworks making up the majority of our grade makes sense. The textbook was helpful. I liked all of the guest lecturers. \r\n\r\nThe class needs to decide what kind of level class it's going to be--intro, or not. There was a discrepancy between the challenge level of the lectures and the psets. The lectures sometimes felt slow-paced and that the things we were learning were common sense, whereas the homeworks were a healthy challenge. I got the sense that since some of the topics are not all that difficult, so there's not that much intellectual challenge that needs to occur during the lectures anyway. In that case, I think the class time time should be split in half: first half lecture, second half working on sound change data sets or other data sets with study groups. This way, the pacing would be faster, the lectures would be more engaging, and we could spend more time developing strategies for the data sets that were such a big part of the final exam and the homeworks. Or, alternatively, Prof Bowern said they didn't want to teach us a bunch of definitions because they were in the textbook, but teaching these could actually be a more effective use of the lecture time.\r\n\r\nI wish the answers to data sets were explained in a more objective way. When we went over how to internal reconstruction/the comparative method, there was sometimes not a clear right answer. Of course nuance is okay, but then when we went to do the psets, it was impossible to decide what the right answer was, and it felt like we were expected to read Prof Bowern's mind. This lack of objectivity was a theme overall--it applied to the Language Spread and Distribution topic. We spent a lot of time in class suggesting different patterns for how and why a language spread the way it did, but we never really landed on a clear answer. \r\n\r\nI also think there needs to be a more helpful IPA review/explanation of basic linguistics at the beginning of the semester. I had already taken linguistics classes, but I could only understand some of the things in this class because of this PRIOR knowledge, so I imagine it must have been hard for those who had no other linguistic experience. \r\n\r\nAlso--it is not necessary to spend the first 20 minutes of every class going over administrative things that could otherwise be sent in an email. \r\n\r\nFinally, I think the 48-hour grace period for the homeworks is a mistake because students including myself just treat this as the new deadline. Instead, each student should be granted 2 free late days for their homeworks per semester, or something along these lines, because the optional extension for ALL of the assignments does not have the intended effect of kinder deadlines and instead just causes students to get behind.",
                "The courses major strength is in its material. I found myself extremely compelled to learn historical linguistics, partially because languages are interesting in general, but also because the lectures tended to focus on extremely fascinating aspects of the field. The classs later focus on sociolinguistics, endangered languages, semantic change as well as regularly interacting and learning about the subtle yet interconnected nuances of different languages (i.e., sound change, IPA, etc.) made it easier for me to be invested in the course. Although major concepts like comparative and internal reconstruction were hard to learn, because an interactive mood had been fostered early on, the class itself was never too stressful. The encouragement of class participation also contributed to a low-stress environment that was sometimes even fun. The way due dates for problem sets were done was also really effective; it helped me a lot to know that there were always some late days available for every assignment. \r\n A major weakness in the course was there was a great disconnect between what was taught in lecture and what was in the textbook that created a little confusion early on. At times the lectures did not communicate some key information that was in the textbook, which was a little frustrating, though this flaw became less apparent later in the semester. As a lot of homework material was dependent on the textbook, at times this made the class really difficult, although it was never too bad that one couldnt catch up later. Another major issue was that the class itself was not an intro linguistics course at all even though students with no prior knowledge of linguistics were encouraged to take the course. Encouraging (not really requiring) prior knowledge of linguistics might prepare future students for the difficulty of the class."

The class is really fun and gives a really wide survey of various methods in historical linguistics. Its not very stressful and understanding the underlying forces which shape the way languages change is fascinating.",

You're going to learn a lot about a very, very important aspect of linguistics.\r\n\r\nTo an anthropology major: Yes, if you like studying languages and enjoy puzzles! The material is very puzzle-like, because most of linguistic study is.\r\n\r\nTo someone who wants to try a linguistics course to see if the major interests them: This isn't a bad class for that, but I might recommend LING 110 instead for a general overview (especially if taught by Prof. Bowern!). But again, if you like puzzles, you'll like this class.",

However, it is definitely doable. I highly recommend this class to those interested in linguistics.",
                "Yes very much, it is a bit niche I suppose so I would not expect every single student in the college to find the work involved in it to be enjoyable but I am sure that the overwhelming majority would find it intriguing and illuminating.",
                "If they were particularly interested in this topic, maybe I would recommend it, but if they were just looking for an interesting, intro linguistics class, I would probably recommend something like Cog Sci of Lang instead because I took away more from that class and it was more intellectually stimulating.",
                "I would recommend the class to someone who might be interested in linguistics and have a lot of prior knowledge of the field beforehand. This is just because while I was taking the course, I had to learn a lot of basic linguistic concepts on top of learning historical linguistics, which made the class a lot harder than it probably really was. This also at times even hindered interest as well. Nevertheless, the course itself is extremely compelling, definitely one the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale."
