                "Especially near the beginning, I left class wanting more motivation for why we were learning what we were and what it went towards. There was a haze of scanning datasheets blindly, so maybe some restructuring of the material order or adding more blips of foresight about what things we'd eventually do.",
                "The class is supper entertaining but the prof moves very fast and assumes a strong math foundation as for there's lots to cover in the class",
                "Lectures went really fast without much detail which made the homework challenging. The labs were well written and where I received most of the learning. Ian is a really nice professor who cares about learning and offers ample opportunities to receive help.",
                "I think some of the labs could have been more neatly organized, and perhaps more focused on the finals project. The classes were sometimes difficult to understand, but Ian was great at helping students get a good grasp of it and not waste their time on pointless things.",
                "This course had some really good labs, that directly reinforced what we'd been talking about in class.",
                "It was geared toward someone who knows how to code. I dont know how, so it was tough to jump into on day 1. Professor Abraham was very good at breaking down what was under the hood.",
                "Strengths: the prof is very responsive, flexible and really open to explaining confusing concepts. Homeworks, labs exams and projects were very straightforward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overall structure was kind of confusing. At one point, I am pretty sure 95% of the students had absolutely no idea what was going on in class. Might be just the material, I don't know.",
                "This course was run amazingly. The labs were focused in on the content, and the homeworks were fit for student learning. Recorded lectures may help the class to allow students to review material again.",
                "The material is interesting. However, it was not presented in an understandable fashion. The assignments did not really help in learning as well.",
                "I think the professor is what made the course as engaging as it was. Lectures sometimes felt a little too fast and like too much information all at once, but he was always willing to answer any questions and he always asked for feedback on the way he structured labs and other assignments. He just made the material interesting even if it was too abstract to understand at times. We also didn't have a lot of psets and we had 2 weeks for lab reports (5 labs) so the workload wasn't bad at all. Labs were a little difficult sometimes too, but interesting and fun as well!",
                "Strengths: well-organized, interesting final project, succinct lectures. Weaknesses: sometimes the context of specific material wasn't given before/during lecture and it made it really hard to follow, some of the labs were really long and I didn't understand them  very well",
                "It is a fun course and the labs were great. I wish there was more builds in the labs.",
                "I was initially skeptical about how all the different parts would come together to an understanding of how engineers design robots, but it ultimately did and I was pleased. Honestly cannot think of any big weaknesses of the course. Some small ones, maybe, such as I never quite got the time to understand how root locus plots translate to motion."

It was not that challenging and the workload was low but some problem sets got very difficult (though there were only five all semester). It is a cool elective and also ABET requiremnt",
                "To any mechanical engineering major (and even EE / EECS) this course should be a priority. It is a really cool way to use what you've learned in other classes and get to play with robots. There is a bit of coding, and some maths so definitely take those prereqs, but I would highly recommend taking this course before graduating, and even before doing capstones if your capstone will involve robotics / Arduino / coding.",

                "Yes! It's a MENG requirement, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes!",
                "Yes I would, good balance of theory and hands-on, Professor Abraham is great",
                "Yes, it is a great course and I learned a lot about electronic systems.",
                "Yes, even to those for whom ABET doesn't require it. I definitely feel much more aware of the connections between code and movement. I think it would be even better to take this course followed by another robotics course such as the 400-level elective that Ian is planning to teach."
