The course was an extremely helpful (continued) introduction to the fundamentals of chemistry, by way of demonstrations and experiments that really allowed us to see and comprehend various chemical processes.",

However, I simply learned how to turn in assignments; I did not necessarily learn material. I learned how to get through and displayed grit all semester long.",

            "comments": [
                "Very very few strengths that are greatly outweighed by the weaknesses.  Lab point deductions are completely arbitrary.  Post and Pre lab quizzes without open notes are just plain unnecessary.  Why should I need to memorize and rigorously study each lab report so that I have it memorized? If the grading process was improved maybe I would feel neutral about this class.  Taking two semesters of chem lab is tedious.  Most other undergraduate institutions only require one.  \r\nI often found myself dreading the walk up to science hill each day before class as I knew I had four hours of misery ahead.  The labs are somewhat interesting, but I wish students had more of a say in what they could do.  Its really just regurgitating clumsy procedures before hand, that can actually be simplified/better by the student.",
                "This class was helpful in deepening my understanding of chemistry because it covers each topic/experiment very thoroughly. Additionally, Dr. G is extremely kind and genuinely wants everyone to understand each concept, which creates a very encouraging learning environment. \r\n\r\nThe one weakness of the class was the workload. Although the course is only worth half a credit, I spent at least double the amount of time per week on this class than I would spend in a full credit course. I found the pre-lab lectures and videos to be helpful, and I thought the lab reports were very useful in building a full understanding of the material. However, I thought that the post-lab quizzes ended up being more stressful than helpful; I was already working on the lab report to gain the same understanding of the previous week's experiment, so the additional quiz seemed redundant. Additionally, it was stressful to juggle studying for both the pre-lab and the post-lab quizzes in the same 24 hour time span  there was just a lot of material to cover. It might be helpful to eliminate the post-lab quiz, or to just make it an assignment graded for completion rather than for correctness.",
                "prelab quizzes were online but \"closed book\" which wasn't fair for people who didn't want to cheat. Academic honestly not enforced and it messed up the curve.",
                "The strengths of this course is that there are a ton of materials and resources available, and they are generally well-thought-out.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that it is way too cumbersome. The assignments are unnecessarily arduous and demand way more than a half-credit course should demand.",
                "Both Dr. G and our TA were great and always happy to help. The class was very structured. However, as a result there is also little autonomy. You follow experiments to the dot and you write pre formatted lab reports to the rubric. So while I felt I had a good introduction to lab skills, the assignments for the course were utterly unenjoyable.",
                "Strengths of the course are the interactiveness of all of the labs and weaknesses are the time spent on the assignments for the class for the credit only being 0.5.",
                "This course is much more work than a half credit course really should be. Concepts from lectures and lab directions are never fully explained.",
                "For a half-credit course, there is a disproportionate amount of work. A lot of it is busywork that does not really improve our understanding of chemistry. Some of the things we are tested on really don't make sense, like memorizing chemical equations in the labs.",
                "I think this course was insanely difficult and asked students for far too much time a week. I worked upwards of 20 hours a week (usually more), which was far more work than any of my full credit or even 1.5 credit class. I found that getting help was really difficult, and there was no understanding or sympathy from the instructor.",
                "I think i did the labs very precisely and carefully, but the post lab quizzes were really difficult for me/learning how to apply the concepts to specific questions",
                "I personally enjoy the format of the course and I feel like I actually learned a lot. That being said, there are some aspects that make the experience incredibly stressful like the post-lab quizzes. Some questions seem nearly impossible to just remember off the top of your head.",
                "This course has significantly more weaknesses than strengths. The only strength was the TF, and even that can vary drastically. I am thankful for the TF because that is why I was able to do well in the course. \r\nSo many weaknesses! Unnecessarily time-consuming lab reports. Post-lab quizzes were not helpful nor conducive to learning. I had to devote WAY too much time into this course, and I am disappointed.",
                "This course was very time consuming. For only half a credit, I lost most of my weekends to doing lengthy lab reports. I feel that this class should be worth a full credit. I spent more time on it than most of my full credit classes. The post lab quizzes were also very challenging and didn't always reflect what was done in the lab. Overall, if you start early on lab reports and reach out for help the professors and TA are great.",
                "Strength is the way lab reports are formatted. The weakness is definitely the post-lab quizzes. They are extremely unnecessary especially with how much time and effort is put into the lab reports. It is highly unfair especially with how much of a percentage it is and the stress that comes with only 20 minutes."
