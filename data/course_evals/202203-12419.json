                "You learn a lot of advanced mechanics using the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, and very little Newton's II Law in the first part of the semester (which is great, since it really feels like you're progressing from your foundational Mechanics class!). You really start gaining an appreciation for more complex mechanical systems and you feel like you can actually start solving real-life problems that don't involve very simplified frictionless etc. settings. I always hated Classical Mechanics before taking this course but thanks to Prof. Girvin and the TA's I've honestly developed a great appreciation for it and I feel like this was an excellent foundation for more upper-level Physics courses.",

                "This course was super helpful in my physics trajectory. I now feel like I can tackle most any mechanics problem with confidence.",
                "This is a great course that develops Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and relativistic mechanics in an enlightening fashion that is very effective in providing deep insights applicable to a wide range of further studies. This course is very successful in making connections between the different approaches, their strengths and weaknesses, and the assumptions and postulates they come with, and because of this develops flexibility of physical thinking and an exposure to different systems of physics beyond just the specific knowledge of the methods of Lagrange and Hamilton.",
                "Advanced classical mechanics knowledge.",
                "I learned two new formulations of physics that, while equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, often made problems easier: namely, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. I also learned a lot about various types of oscillators, as well as some special relativity.",

                "I learned the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods of solving mechanics problems, a whole lot about harmonic oscillators, and special relativity (and very basic relativistic mechanics).",
                "Before talking about the class, it is worth mentioning that the year before this, Professor Girvin taught phys 260, one of the intro classes that feeds into this, and did NOT teach phys 200, which was the other. If course progression is set up like this again in future years, I would maybe warn Phys 200 students that are enrolled in this class--it's definitely doable, but you have to be prepared to be significantly more challenged on content/exams than your 260 peers. Professor Girvin seemed aware of this issue after the grades from our first midterm came back, but I'm not sure how much could be done. \r\n\r\nWith that said, I really think the material covered in this class is valuable and well worth learning, probably moreso than phys 401. With a handful of friends in the class and regular office hours attendance, you can definitely grasp the concepts. My only other major complaint about the course is that there is one midterm early in the semester, and the final covers SIGNIFICANTLY more material (probably four times the amount of content that you'd never been tested on.) Other than that, though, if you're prepared to put effort into the course, I think it's well worth it!",

I also had a revelation - it's actually so useful to read the textbook, it's a really great resource!! You get to have a concept explained to you in a different way than the teacher, so you'll come out really understanding more than you did before."

                "The biggest strength of this. course was the collaboration was the help of other students and teaching fellows who were incredibly helpful in going through the difficult problems on the problem sets and helping us review for our exams. One small weakness of this course was the lectures which were a little bit difficult to follow at times and often went through examples that were a little bit too complicated for students to get very much out of.",
                "This class was taught as if everyone in it had taken PHYS 260 with Prof Girvin last year, so those of us who took 200 and 180 struggled a lot. 260 is not a pre-requisite for the course, but it was treated as such, and that led to a lot of stress and imposter syndrome among me and my friends.",
                "Strengthsyou learn a lot, Prof. Girvin is an excellent professor, the TF's are incredibly helpful, and you really start feeling like you belong to a community after countless hours of struggling over PSets with your friends.\r\n\r\nWeaknessesthe material can be very challenging, especially if you don't have a relatively strong mathematical foundation in concepts such as complex numbers, vector calculus, some understanding of linear algebra, etc. I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra before taking this course, and it still took me a lot of time to gain an understanding for some of the mathematical concepts such as the Calculus of Variations. However, it's still doable as long as you're willing to invest your time into going to office hours and don't have other demanding courses to take up your time.",
                "What was on the exams wasn't always taught",
                "The content was really fascinating, however I felt the lectures weren't very related to the problem sets and the textbook was far more helpful. The problem sets also varied widely in terms of difficulty and time; I wish they had been more balanced. The exams were fair, and there was opportunity for extra credit.",
                "I honestly can say that this course is organized perfectly. We learned at a great rate and the course was consistently engaging.",
                "Overall this was a well-organized, engaging and interesting course. The content was delivered in an order that made sense and progressively built up ideas while drawing interesting connections and highlighting real-world examples. The homework was well-connected to the lecture content and was helpful in practicing and reinforcing lecture material.",

                "great number of resources in canvas/ great posted notes online. well organized into units. tests were fair",
                "Strengths: good Professor, enthusiastic teaching team, the Lagrangian is a wonderful and convenient way of solving mechanics problems\r\nWeaknesses: People who came in with different backgrounds performed very differently, course topics felt somewhat unfocused",
                "Strengths: this course was very well-taught. The material was challenging but incredibly interesting. There were a large number of office hours with TFs and the professor available to provide help with the problem sets. After this class, I feel that I have a very strong grasp of the material and a good basis for future physics classes that I may take.\r\nWeaknesses: this is not necessarily a weakness, but the problem sets were often quite difficult and time-intensive. I had to attend (multiple) office hours each week in order to complete the problem sets. However, I do feel that the problem sets truly enhanced my understanding of the material.",

                "The course was a little bit slow in the first half. I wish we could have gone over a few more topics, and the pset grading was a little unclear at first. The lectures were engaging though.",
                "Strengths: Absolutely phenomenal course with a high level of engagement and interactive components as evoked by the professor. Extremely interesting material which was taught in an incredible way, one which piqued every individuals curiosity.",
                "Girvin is great, class feels relaxed and cooperative, material is interesting and there are people available to explain it to you.",
                "Although Girvin is an awesome teacher, I think the order was a little confusing. Teaching Lagrangians first and then non-mechanics applications of calculus of variations was maybe not the best way of doing things, but the textbook did help. In general, though, this was a well taught and interesting course.",
                "Strengths: Girvin's lectures. Very engaging. He puts on a show each time. Quite humorous, too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets. They were like essays. I'm not kidding, all of the questions were these lengthy paragraphs that overcomplicated the problems to an unnecessary degree. This was also an issue on the first midterm we took, and most of us had to retake it.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Simplify wordings on problem sets and the class will get better.",
                "Strengths: All the TA's were amazing, the curriculum is great, the textbook is perfect, and of course Steve Girvin is just wonderful\r\nWeaknesses: None"

                "If you took PHYS 260, have a *really* strong understanding of Newtonian mechanics, and/or have already learned a fair amount about Lagrangian mechanics, then yes. Otherwise, no -- this course assumes a very high level of knowledge going in that a lot of us didn't have. PHYS 401 would probably be a safer bet in that case.",
                "YES if Prof. Girvin is teaching it, and if you are interested in taking more upper-level Physics courses. With Prof. Girvin you will learn so much and after countless hours of blood, sweat, and tears you will gain a newfound appreciation for this topic that might have been presented as mundane in your previous Physics classes. Prof. Girvin's lectures can sometimes get difficult to follow if you don't do the assigned chapter readings in the book, which I highly recommend you do because it would probably make lecture a lot more useful. Nevertheless, Prof. Girvin's lecture notes are excellent, the book is also a great resource, and there's a lot of weekly office hours and opportunities to ask questions. Honestly if you're coming from PHYS 180/181 like I was, definitely be prepared for a huge step-up in difficulty, but it's not undoable. I found the Harmonic Oscillators chapter to be the best part of the course.",
                "yes",

                "YES! Especially when Prof. Girvin is teaching it.",
                "I would, but Girvins style definitely doesnt work for everyone. The people who took PHYS 260 with Girvin found themselves far better prepared than those who took 180/200, even though the course is supposed to be accessible to everyone. Girvin did give a makeup exam/extra credit to try to make up for it, but ideally these would not be necessary in the first place. Regardless, hes very kind and his enthusiasm for physics is infectious. Its a hard course with a lot of work (but pretty fair, not insane like CPSC 323), but I felt proud of myself for finishing it. I left feeling like I had learned a lot. Go to office hours, they make the psets possible.",
                "Yes. Although this course is a significant time investment, one truly leaves with a strong understanding of the material.",
                "This course is great for anyone seeking a rigorous background in classical mechanics with significant emphasis on derivation.",
                "Yes, especially with Girvin!",
                "A thousand times yes! Regardless of whether you are taking this course for your major or simply out of pure interest, it is one of the best courses taught at Yale. Professor Girvin's passion for the subject he teaches is apparent in every lecture, and it is that same excitement that is stimulated in every student",
                "Yes, there is conceptually difficult material but people will help you and it's all interesting.",
                "Not in the state that it's in. However, if Girvin simplifies his wording on problem set questions and midterm questions, then the class will be much better.",
