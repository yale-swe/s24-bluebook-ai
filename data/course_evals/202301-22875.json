                "I learned how to structure and write essays more effectively and gained immense knowledge about disability, from history to the present, and the involvement of technology in the lives of disabled people.",
                "I learned from many brilliant insights about various topics related to disability and technology, from Tom Shakespeare's social model of disability to Nick Walker's take on the neurodiversity paradigm to ethical discussions regarding prosthetics in sports. If either disability or technology fascinate you, learning about both topics and especially their connection will be incredibly interesting. Furthermore, this class taught and polished skills for delivering clear, strong arguments on such topics via writing.",
                "This class taught me how to write a structured and cohesive essay as well as some strategies to better Organise the research process for papers.",
                "I learned how to properly format an argumentative essay that properly considers counter-arguments.",
                "Deeper understanding of the intricacies of disability studies, various modern debates in this field, and the role of assistive technologies throughout history and currently.",
                "Through this class I learned about essay writing, critical reading, and Disability Studies with a focus on technology. Though I knew both disability and technology were broad terms, the multiple classes we spent grappling with different definitions of each revealed to me their complexities and the intersection between them. Through this class, Dylan also taught me the importance of Disability Studies. I strongly believe Yale should consider more classes and research in this field.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course lay in the excellent readings and smaller class size, which allowed for deeper and more open discussions of topics. Additionally, the frequency of essay review and availability of resources for essay writing was also helpful. I don't think there were any weaknesses!",
                "This course covers a plethora of fascinating readings and has class discussions which are very open-ended and helpful in understanding some of the tougher parts of these readings. While the class is very helpful in bolstering one's knowledge and application of basic writing fundamentals, if someone already has a strong grasp on these writing concepts, this class may not teach much from a writing aspect. A student who has excelled in a strong AP Language & Composition class will not learn an incredible amount from any English 114 class from a writing aspect, especially as many of these concepts are likely touched upon in previous writing courses.",
                "Kind of easing into the course slowly with shorter pages and then slowly proceed to the longer papers definitely helps!\r\nA weakness is that there is only a limited choice of topics available and not all of them seem equally interesting!",
                "Strengths: The diversity of topics and readings in this class was amazing. We read essays, books by Plato and Helen Keller, news articles, blog posts, and cultural artifacts. Discussions in class were well run, and the whole class was welcome to speak.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings were quite difficult as they were written for an audience of disability studies scholars. As a result, Dylan directed us towards key sections and led class discussions with thoughtful questions so we could succeed with the readings.",
                "Strengths: ENGL 114 is very good for students who are not as confident in their writing abilities. The class provides a supportive and safe environment to nurture and strengthen your writing skills in a very low-risk environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the class conversation got very repetitive or felt forced"

                "Yes, I would recommend ENGL 114 with Dylan! In this class I learned how to transform my high school writing techniques of short five-paragraph essays into developed, college-ready essays. I also learned about fascinating topics in disability and technology. Overall, I think ENGL 114 is a good place to improve reading and writing skills, and I recommend incoming first years to take one of the offered ENGL 114 sections.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in disability studies and how technology and disability interact (prosthetics, cyborgs, Hellen Keller, container technologies) or anyone who simply wants to learn more about how to read and write about disabilities"
