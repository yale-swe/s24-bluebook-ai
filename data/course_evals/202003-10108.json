                "I learned a great deal about a part of the world about which I previously knew almost nothing at all, and about how archaeology can be done in a way which regards those under study as people with distinct cultural and economic lives.",
                "I learned about the history \/ pre-history of the Central Andes (particularly Peru). I learned how Andean societies evolved over time from small roving groups to ceremonial centers to great cities and vast multi-cultural empires. I also gained an appreciate for how archaeologists work and generate hypotheses."

                "I think one strength of this course is the interaction with the teacher and the TA, who both made themselves extremely accessible. Professor Burger and Corey Hermann did an excellent job of showing their appreciation and passion for the material. It shined through and brightened each class! This is the sort of class you come to Yale for: a comprehensive study of a subject you wouldn't think to learn about from some of the top experts in the field, who make sure to tie in the material with bigger questions about the nature of civilization and its development.",
                "The readings, with a few notable exceptions, were very dense, and a great many were assigned for each class, and lectures tended to lack emphasis on concrete details which later became important. However,  I greatly enjoyed learning about the content, and felt it was delivered effectively for a broad understanding, even if it was in a way which was less than ideal for the exams.",
                "The biggest strengths are Professor Burger and the TA Corey. They make the class extremely fun and engaging, and both have an encyclopedic knowledge of the field. Professor Burger has first-hand experience (or is the original source) of a lot of the material.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think of would be to shift a little weight off of the final exam. I really enjoyed the class discussions in the genre of \"what evidence would you look for to prove X\" or \"if you saw Y how could it be explained\", so maybe an exercise with questions like that could be fun.",
                "Despite this being a seminar sized class, this course was almost exclusively a one-sided lecture. As fascinating as the material can be at times, it's difficult to sit on a zoom call for an hour and a half when there is little to no opportunity to interact with the material."

                "N\/A. This was an excellent course well-framed for the times. I particularly appreciated how the professor and his graduate students took advantage of the format to turn a few classes into presentations of ongoing research. It's so fun to hear about stuff that others in the field of research don't even know about!",
                "The virtual lecture format could feel a bit plodding without the dynamic element of an in-person class, and the failure to post the lecture slides mean that the visual component felt almost like a neat extra rather than anything of use."

                "Yes, yes, and yes! Take this course! You are going to learn a lot about how civilization works from a set of examples few other people even know about, let alone learn from some of the leaders of the field. This sounds a little vague, I know, and it's because I don't want to spoil everything. I will say I particularly enjoyed our discussion of Preceramic cultures along the coastline and the Chimu culture!",
                "This class is the ideal Credit\/D\/Fail; very interesting, not a crazy amount of work, very possible to hit 70% and understand the content without absurd amount of work, but very difficult to achieve higher grades without an intense study regimen and a lot of memorization.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I had no experience with the subject prior to taking it, but the environment was very welcoming. I learned a lot of archaeological history of an often ignored region \/ time period. It was really satisfying and honestly changed the way I view the world a little. Professor Burger is also super friendly and fun, and he has done really important research and excavations which is cool. I loved his stories.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you are explicitly interested in Andean and South American Archaeology, otherwise the material becomes a little dull if it's not a specific interest of yours."
