                "I learned SO MUCH in this course. From the mechanics of specific design elements and color to how to create an identity this course really did change the way that I understand education and learning. From the very beginning, this course pushed me out of my comfort zone because of having to participate in critiques. I hadn't had experience talking about art in a classroom setting and it was such a wonderful experience finding my voice in the art classroom. I learned the importance of your own feelings and perception of art when giving critiques and how in the end, not all suggestions should be taken into account for the final product. It was revolutionary to be able to be in a space where the time was given for brainstorming, hearing others' thoughts, and making adjustments to your work. It is one of the first times in my academic career where I was able to dedicate myself to a process without the overwhelming pressure of time.",
                "This course changed my way to visualizing art. It forced my eyes to look at the intentions of the artist and the message being the art rather than the surface level visual we are presented.",

                "Its biggest strength is Henk, he has a lot of great feedback and cares about everyone's work. Time management and communication were definitely major weaknesses. For some reason I really couldn't stand the classes where all we did was hear people sharing their ideas; sitting there doing basically nothing for two hours felt a little excruciating. I felt like our TF, who was really cool, could've been put to better use, I would've liked to hear more feedback from him. It was also frustrating when Henk wouldn't share key information about assignments.",
                "I think that one of the biggest strengths in this course was way in which is brought out the personalities and passions of me and my classmates. All of the work that we were doing was able to be made personal and therefore even more important than your average homework assignment. I loved the progression of the projects and really enjoyed the format of the critiques in class. Although intimidating at first, they were always something that I walked away from feeling really heard and understood by my classmates. I would have appreciated if our final critique followed a similar form as the in-class ones though. It was nice to get a different perspective on our work but after a semester of working with my classmates to improve my work, in the end I really wanted to hear their thoughts and reflections on my growth in the class and within the final project itself. I really appreciated how understanding Professor Van Assen and David were throughout the process and was really glad that I didn't need any previous experience with design software to flourish in the course!",
                "The strength of the course is that it is a much more stress-free course in terms of being able to use your creativity (which should not be mistaken with it being a difficult workload).",
                "I liked the practical aspects of the class but i think the class would have benefited from splitting into groups for discussion/critique so each person could contribute more and receive more feedback, to use our class time more efficiently"

                "I would recommend it if you're ready to devote a lot of time to it. The first two weeks of collages can feel pretty unmanageable, I was up late every night working on them and I hard time balancing what Henk wanted and what I wanted. But overall it's great to have time to make really cool projects, and Henk can be pretty flexible as long as he thinks that what you're making is cool.",
                "MOST DEFINITELY. I think that for especially non-humanities majors, being in an educational space like this is incredibly important to experience before graduation. It was exposure to an entirely different kind of learning that opened my eyes to how I could approach my STEM studies differently. It was so beautiful to be able to use different skills and pursue personal passions in a classroom setting. Wish I could take this course again!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it opens your eyes to how to approach design."
