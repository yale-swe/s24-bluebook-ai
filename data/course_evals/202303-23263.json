You gain so many valuable skills relating to making things, problem solving, and thinking about problems deeper than you ever have before.",
                "Learned how to effectively navigate problem identification, product ideation, make critical and difficult design decisions, prototype in a very productive manner, utilize the bountiful resources provided by the CEID and its teaching staff, properly test prototypes and fundamental design facets, and to properly process the feedback and ideas of fellow engineers, among so much more."

                "The only improvement I can think of would be to have 1 or 2 more explicit deliverables to keep projects moving along, although it's difficult to have consistent assignments that also aren't pointless with a large variety of projects. But maybe one more deliverable in between the initial report and the final presentations. There are too many strengths to this course to list, but I would highlight all the guest speakers and the timeline given for working on our group projects, as well as having weekly check ins.",
                "This course does a great job in nearly every dimension through its fantastic structure. With varied entrepreneurs and engineers coming to speak almost every week you get a plethora of view points, tips, and information regarding the inner workings of start-ups, design and engineering philosophies, career paths, and even personal growth through the path of entrepreneurship. In the other part of the course, you learn to pitch an idea, work with a team to progress from identifying a problem to coming up with a viable and feasible product solution, design and create many prototypes, take constructive engineering feedback, and present a final prototype product, effectively celebrating a high level of accomplishment after 8 weeks of hard work. the only minor improvement that could be made to this course is allowing a little more than 8 weeks to work on the course project and also prioritizing project work time in class."

                "Yes, I recommend this course if you can get in. The first half of the semester is learning about design and hearing from guest lecturers. The guest lecturers are actually pretty good. The second half is working on your final project. The workload is a lot but it's fun and if you don't procrastinate, then it's not stressful. There is a final presentation at the end with pizza.",

Don't wait until your senior year to take this course, take it now! I do not see a scenario in which anyone wouldn't immensely enjoy this course."
