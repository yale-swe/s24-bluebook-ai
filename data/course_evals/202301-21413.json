Most of us admitted that we were taking this course to fulfill a Renaissance credit for the English major, and I never had any experience with any kind of philosophical texts either (I came from a high school that didnt really offer us any kind of directed studies education or something like that). I ended the course with a greater appreciation for philosophy, Neoplatonism, and for Professor Mohamed. Hes a wonderful resource in the class, and he is what MAKES this course so accessible and engaging to students like me who struggle with grasping big philosophical concepts.",

Hes incredibly kind, understanding, intelligent, and I wish I had gone to more office hours with him because the times that I did go, I had great guidance and I was able to engage more with the course than I could before. There really were no weaknesses, except for the fact that there were some readings that were confusing because of their language. But the great thing was that Professor Mohamed admitted that they were confusing. He was very understanding and he often invited us to ask questions during seminar (and sometimes questions were all that we had during discussions).",
                "The syllabus was difficult to keep track of at times  i would have appreciated more guidance on how to read the texts and would perhaps start with a text like the Mundus Imaginalis so that it was easier to understand what made these texts so interesting. I often felt like I was grasping at straws trying to understand the material and would have appreciated more literature and less philosophy  or at least reading the philosophy alongside the literature. This often felt more like a Philosophy than Literature course. The syllabus definitely needs reworking, but the class has potential!",
                "The course was engaging and generally well taught. Class discussions were very productive, but I felt that too much reading was assigned.",
                "I loved the format of the course: beginning class with contextual information on our authors and sessions facilitated by different students each day. I also thought Professor Mohamed was particularly skilled at interjecting when necessary, but also letting the conversation take its own course when needed. It was a wonderful balance!"
