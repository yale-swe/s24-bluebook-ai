It was nice to spend enough time on each poet that I felt I really knew something about each one, while also still fitting in many different voices and times into a single semester. Professor Brisman led very interesting discussions, and, due to the small class size, by the end of the semester I felt everyone our class knew one another. I also appreciated Professor Brisman's openness to reading and providing feedback on essay drafts; I feel like I learn more when I have the opportunity to not only receive feedback on essays, but incorporate that feedback into an improved version of the essay.",

I sometimes wanted to discuss more of the reading in class; class discussions would often only focus on a small section of what we read on our own, and especially for the contemporary poets, I wish we'd had fewer poems to read each night and spent more class time on each individual one."

This was a wonderful class; we spent enough time on each poet that I felt I really took something away about each one, but we still fit a lot of different poets into a single semester. Professor Brisman led interesting discussions with lots of great stories, and, due to the small class size, I felt everyone our class knew one another by the end of the semester. Professor Brisman was also open to reading and providing feedback on essay drafts, which I found very helpful.",
