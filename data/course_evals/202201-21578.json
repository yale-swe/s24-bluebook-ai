But, this class is definitely not for anyone with an advanced math background.",
                "The professor was very accessible, as was the TF, so that was helpful. But the PSETs were often more challenging that anything we'd learned in class. The problems would be variations of what we'd gone over with the professor, but significantly more challenging versions, which created unnecessary stress and made it difficult to prepare for exams because we didn't know what to expect. Also the professor could be a bit disorganized at times; once she forgot her laptop on a day that several students needed to Zoom into class due to Covid isolation, so multiple students simply missed an entire class.",
                "Strengths: lots of support, guided notes, patient instructor.",
                "I found the psets to help me solidify concepts we learned in class. The course material could have been slightly better organized during class (sometimes a little bit hard to follow).",
                "I think occasionally the course relied too heavily on precalculus material.",
                "Strengths: My professor was very kind, and the classes were engaging for the most part. PSETS were also helpful to prepare for exams, as were the review sheets offered to us. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lessons could feel a little disorganized and scattered at times. It could often be difficult to follow lessons in class, and I found myself having to do a great deal of \"outside learning\" (accessing separate resources like khan academy) in order to keep up. It felt impossible to completely comprehend certain concepts without support from out-of-class resources."

Su Ji is very patient and you learn the material very thoroughly. Grading and testing is very fair and she wants you to succeed.",
