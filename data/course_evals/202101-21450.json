                "The class generally followed a good curriculum and list of topics. It was at times disorganized and hard to follow, which made studying for the class harder. I liked the quiz format because it kept me on top of my studies.",
                "Very informative and educational, thought the material was overwhelming at times, with a lot of focus on minute details that were never tested. A better approach would be to present the information in a more logical and holistic manner than spending ten minutes on the proximal vs distal naming.",
                "A strength of the course are that professors were super knowledgable about the materials that they lecture on. I also really appreciate how the professors didn't pressure students to be super interactive with classes being online, but they were always willing to take questions or took pauses during the lectures for students to ask clarifying questions. The quizzes were a great way to ensure that you kept on track with studying the materials every week. A weakness of this course is that the volume of the information that requires memorization can be a bit overwhelming sometimes. I found most of the content to be quite interesting, but very difficult to fully grasp without spending hours mapping out cascade mechanisms or development processes. Also, I felt as if at time there were significant differences in terms of expectations for the quizzes and exams. The quizzes generally focus on ensuring that you understand the major concepts from that week not the nitty gritty of mechanisms, but then on the exams you would need to include very specific details to demonstrate understanding of mechanisms or gene signaling cascades.",
                "The quizzes were well done and strengthened lecture principles, but the exams were stressful and had some hit or miss questions early on in the first midterm.",
                "A strength would be in some of the lectures. Two of the professors were very clear in their instruction and provided lectures that were easy to follow. However, the lectures were also a weakness as there was one professor whose lectures were very hard to follow and understand. Also, I wish the professors provided more feedback on quizzes and exams. They sometimes did, but I would often get questions wrong on quizzes and exams with little to no information on how my answers were wrong.",
                "The professors teaching the course are absolutely a strength, they were all very great but especially Professor Holley who gave a majority of the lectures.",
                "more problem solving questions on exams rather than memorization ones. but overall very interesting material",
                "I think it was good that there were quizzes every other week, because it helped to keep us in check and studying before each exam. I did also like that there was no Final Exam.\r\n\r\nSome of the material felt like it was discussed for too long, but the more difficult concepts were explained well. \r\n\r\nIf there weren't lecture recordings though I don't think I would have done well. It was difficult to learn the material the first time you watched the lecture, and while we did have the textbook I feel like otherwise there was not a lot of support for learning more difficult processes.",
                "I think it goes into extreme detail only when necessary which makes it easy to prioritize certain information. However the nature of the exam questions were a bit unpredictable due to the format.",
                "The weakness of this course were the midterm assessments. They were much more challenging than the practice exams from prior years because the format of the exam changed to accommodate a virtual setting. However, the exams became more fair compared to the first exam as the semester progressed.",
                "strengths - weekly quizzes helped to keep me engaged and reviewing course materials. liked it when professors asked thought-provoking questions to engage with students in lecture. no final exam.\r\nweaknesses - barely any resources provided to help students study for exam except for practice exams, and due to COVID online exams, the practice exams didn't help us prepare at all. TA didn't know how to prepare students for exam despite holding review sessions. teaching team could definitely do a better job to show up for students' needs, but they took the usual silence as though everything was fine. class would be strengthened if professors invested more time to provide students with more study materials such as practice quiz and exam questions"

I think that recorded lectures would be amazing for the future!",

One improvement that could be made is having a Piazza system of communicating with other students about confusing parts of lectures. I felt very isolated from every else, and it also put a lot of pressure to go to office hours to have my questions answered, which wasn't always feasible for me.",

I think that material is very interesting and ties together a lot of different ways of thinking about topics in biology from the genetic factors to molecular processes, and also extrapolating to predicting how abherrent processes in development lead to disease. I think that all of the professors were very knowledgable of the materials and encouraged students to ask clarifying questions to ensure that you get as much as possible out of it. While the weekly quizzes can be overwhelming to prepare for they are a great way to ensure that you keep up to date on the content for the exams. Overall, this class was definitely a great choice to take as an MCDB major and I think that it is possible to do well even if you don't have a particulary strong background in bio yet.",
