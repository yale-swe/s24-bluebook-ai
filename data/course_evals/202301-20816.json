                "Strengths: Ozan has a lot of empathy and understanding, and he was very flexible with us.  TAs were absolutely invaluable and there were plenty of office hours to attend (at least 5 hours a day).  It moves at a pace that is reasonable -- fast enough to cover content, slow enough that you could catch up if you missed a lecture or two.  Also it seems like pretty much everyone is going to get an A in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I will preface this by saying I am sure the class will improve as Ozan teaches it more regularly.  But this class was a mess, especially for the first half.  The workload was very asymmetrical, ranging from weeks with no assignments or exams to a pset crunch the week before spring break that achieved campus-wide notoriety.  The lectures were hard to follow especially with Alan.  The psets are too infrequent for us to really grasp the material -- we literally had only done 1 real pset before the midterm.  Ed is cluttered and honestly unhelpful.  The autograder often didn't work until right up to or even after the due date.  This entire class felt very unprofessional and honestly an embarrassment for a school like Yale.  Then again, I'm sure it will get refined over the years.",
                "This course was very disorganized, which makes sense since it was the first semester Ozan and Alan were teaching it. I have faith that it will improve in the following semesters, and the course seemed to improve as the semester went on, but overall the content and instructions were hard to follow and I frequently had to get outside help to understand course content.",
                "Psets are super fun. Grades were quite generous. ULAs are super helpful. The main weakness was organization, a lot of the class changed around as we were going through it. The course was going through some major changes, so hopefully these are growing pains other students wont have to deal with.",
                "Strength: Ozan is a great professor. He is very encouraging and is very open to making this class better. The slides for the C++ section were very clear. Ben was also a fantastic TA -- his sections (as well as section notes) made the content a lot clearer. His walkthroughs also made the psets a lot more doable. Side note: The professors/teaching staff are super quick with getting psets and midterms graded, which I greatly appreciated!\r\nWeaknesses: This class was a bit disorganized, but I think that is to be expected because it was the professors' first time teaching this course -- and I think they will get better with time. I do think that the psets (especially the initial ones) need to be more clear. I also think that there could be a guide of some sort for all the data structures at the end of the semester (to prepare for the final).",
                "Strengths: grade weights, psets oriented to content, overall practicality of content, active Ed Discussion made it easy to ask questions, quick exam grading, weekly sections/pset walkthroughs by ULA Ben Goldstein\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be much more directed on content and less focused on examples, ULA office hours were inconsistent and sometimes ridiculously overcrowded, pset specs were unclear (but only at the beginning of the semester)",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Not a super difficult course for people who already have CS experience (especially compared to previous iterations of 223)\r\n- Office hours were very abundant\r\n- Review sessions were hosted every Wednesday. These were an extremely useful way to learn course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lack of organization (due to course being redesigned this year)\r\n- Office hours were way too crowded, and students had to wait at least an hour for help\r\n- There were not separate office hours just for debugging. \r\n- Live coding lectures were hard to follow along with and not very engaging.",
                "STRENGTHS:\r\n- Professors were really receptive to student learning and feedback. Alan and Ozan put a lot of work into making the course accessible for everyone and adjusted accordingly when something didn't work. \r\n- I really liked C++. It gave me an introduction into object-oriented programming and I saw how it fit well with learning the data structures after dealing with the intricacies of memory and pointers in base C.\r\n- Plenty of opportunities to earn bonus points, which helped me focus on learning the concepts instead of just worrying about my grade. Students received up to 5% bonus for attending lecture and up to 3% bonus for answering posts on Ed. I thought this was a great way to encourage attendance and community without punishing those who chose not to.\r\n- Shoutout to TA Ben for his weekly sections, which would go over the concepts of each week, live Q&As during lecture, and pset walkthroughs. Should be a model for the rest of the CS department. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n- General lack of organization. Resources were kinda all over the place, and Ed became the unofficial hub for the course which was somewhat strange. \r\n- I think the class could've been a bit more difficult overall. I am a bit worried for 323. With the bonus points in place, I'm hoping that the profs can make things a bit more challenging.  I would've liked maybe more full programs where we start from scratch in order to gain a better handle of C and C++. \r\n- Maybe too much time spent on certain topics. I feel like we spent too long on the very basics of C and dynamic arrays. If you took CS50, the first half of the course is mainly going to be review for you. Meanwhile, we glossed over topics like heaps and aspects of graphs. There were many concepts that I only understood when I was reviewing for the last exam.\r\n- Adding on to the above point, lectures were somewhat unengaging. Alan's lectures mainly involved live coding, but he often spent too much of lecture answering tangential questions. Ozan's lectures felt more applicable since he would often tie it into real world applications, and I preferred his slide-based approach, but he would often spend too much time on a single point.\r\n\r\nMany of the weaknesses improved over the course of the semester, and I think Alan and Ozan are working hard towards improving 223 in the future. This was their first try with the class and they implemented sweeping changes to the way it was taught (including introducing C++), so it was expected for there to be hiccups. I'm confident that future experiences in the course will be better than mine.",
                "The course covered many useful topics for Computer Science majors.",
                "The course is decently well-taught and a lot of thought was put towards making the course rigorous and also accessible to newer students. The course was relatively slow in the start of the semester.",
                "CSPC 223 was my favorite class I took this semester.  Ozan and Alan are both extremely caring and passionate professors.  While the course had a rocky start, by the end of the semester I was having an amazing time.  In the second half of the semester, the lectures were engaging and informative, the homework assignments were clear and manageable, and the grading was a lot more streamlined.  While the professors made some mistakes in the beginning of the year, I am willing to excuse those errors because it's their first time teaching 223, and they had to completely rehaul the curriculum and attempt to rebuild it from scratch with little support.  And as I said, the second half of the semester was extremely smooth, well-organized, and engaging.  I have no doubt that in future semesters, Alan and Ozan will make this course the best in the CS core curriculum.",
                "organization is the main weakness, strength is lectures are good",
                "Strengths: pretty easy, Ozan using slides in the latter half made content and class much easier to follow\r\nWeaknesses: professors didn't seem to really know what they were doing. It was painful to sit through Weide lectures and not understand a thing b/c of how badly things were explained. Same q's would get asked and different bad and confusing answers and explanations would be given. Code also always somehow just so happened to stop working during the lecture (but was always working earlier apparently). They were trying new things but we went through content really slowly and still none of it made any sense especially near beginning of semester",
                "This course teaches good content but in a very bad way. The course was going through a remodeling so it was pretty bad as lectures were disorganized and problem sets had a lot of errors. The content could be taught in a much better, much more efficient way.",
                "This class was not hard and the professors clearly tried to make this course better. However, I feel that I did not learn that much, partially because the course was easy. It felt like being late on assignments was rewarded when deadlines kept getting pushed back. The course improved throughout the semester, so that was good. The TA, Ben Goldstein, was amazing - Thank you, Ben!",
                "One strength is that the teachers are very good at answering questions, and there are lots of ula office hours. They also give a good amount of review material for midterms. Much of the strength was that this course is changing, and the profs are working hard to make it as good as they can make it compared to previous semesters, unfortunately, this had the downside of being disorganized at the beginning of the semester. But as the semester went on, the class started coming together better. Another weakness would be its lack of support for syntax, especially in the transition into C++. Also I feel like we could fit more content in the semester, as in the beginning it felt pretty slow.",
                "Strengths - I liked the Ed discussion forum and policy (bonus points for posting comments) which contributed to a more collaborative environment. \r\nWeaknesses - The pset difficulty varied too much from the start and end, not just in complexity of assignment / code length but also time given. So the course structure felt a bit lopsided towards the end.",
                "I think the content of the course is great. The main issues were lack of clarity on when assignments were due and lack of test scripts. I did not have this problem, but there seemed to be issues with grading work too.",
                "Strengths: EdDiscussion; extra credit; fair exams; manageable psets (for the most part)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very disorganized and feel like MUCH more could have been covered if it had been organized beforehand; expects strong background of C with minimal handholding (class doesn't exactly teach you C).",
                "Alan and Ozan care a lot about their students' wellbeing, so they are quite flexible and understanding. However, the course setup and content is really disorganized, which makes it difficult to make the most of this course.",
                "The strength of the course was that the TEACHING material was well organized and presented to allow the students to easily grasp to concepts, such as resizing arrays, linked lists, and BFS/DFS. Furthermore, the instructors were very responsive and responsible on Ed. They would often answer students' questions and provide updates about the current status of the homework/autograder, which I liked due to the transparency.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main weakness of the course was its lack of organization in the homework. Often, the provided test cases, autograder, or reference implementations (or even, at times, the spec itself) would contain errors that would have to be fixed later on by the instructors, which was very disorganized of them. The autograder also had many errors, especially in the first half of the class, and was very opaque because often, students would have a correct or almost correct makefile, but their code would not compile, and they wouldn't know why due to the opaque error messages from the autograder. It therefore forced students to spend many hours trying to figure out this problem on their own, which I see as a massive weakness to the course.",
                "Strengths include the well structured PSets however there were a few weaknesses too. The course was disorganised with PSet and exam dates overlapping and there were oftentimes errors in the assignments which made it difficult to keep up with.",
                "Cut out ed discussion participation points. Not everyone will have something constructive to say and I think it makes ed a much more disorganized place when people are posting pointless stuff just for points",
                "There needs to be more organization in the course.  Projects would be due in two days and we'd receive a notification that there was an error in one of the test scripts.  I understand there were new professors, but I hope for future students that is remedied.",
                "Very unstructured, too much live coding.",
                "The Strengths were that the PSETS were great, we didn't go too fast. Weaknesses were the lack of organization, missed material due to slow pace, and sometimes confusing presentation of material",
                "Strengths: professors seemed like they cared about the students and set up the course to facilitate that. weaknesses: the organization of the course was lackluster and I often found myself learning the content on my own and completing the psets without the help of any of the teaching staff.",
                "I really enjoyed a lot of the improvements Alan and Ozan made to this class to make it a less intimidating and more accommodating/accessible course. Especially for students who might not have a heavy STEM background coming out of high school, CS can feel overwhelming and I feel that the class this semester seemed to be more understanding that students come from different backgrounds and tried its best to keep this in mind. Overall, while the transitions were not completely smooth, I think with how much the course was changed they were able to make some good improvements with what was available to them.",
                "I actually loved this course. STRENGTHS: Alan's live coding was really exciting. Midterms with no final was good, though I wish we could have gotten to three midterms. WEAKNESSES: I did not find Ozan's slide pedagogy that interesting. Psets could have been more difficult or forced us to practice more material.",
                "Strengths: The ULA, Ben, was great, running sections and review sessions in order to keep us up to speed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Way too easy. Grading was too light. Exams could be finished in literally 1/3 of the allotted time, and the problem sets were not challenging at all -- most of the starter code was often given, leaving us with little to no real practice.",
                "I think that the class is definitely informative and provides some really important introductory material for computer science. I think overall it just really needs to be better organized.",
                "Strengths: material is interesting; sections with Ben were great; Ed was extremely active; some assignments were fun.\r\nWeaknesses: I've never taken a course this disorganized. The assignments weren't particularly difficult (some were actually extremely easy, taking only 2-3 hours max), but the constant change of specs, the lack of an autograder (the last assignments didn't have an autograder at all  we were given an expected output for some basic cases), and the inconsistent difficulty of the material (we spent many weeks on C basics and lists but not much no graphs, hashtables, and the later part of the course).",
                "It cant be taught in this room again. Davies or some place with a projector thats lower to the ground.\r\n\r\nFelt kinda improvised but I enjoyed the transition from C to C++.",
                "Strengths: I do think that the teaching staff (the Professors and the ULA, especially Ben) were kind and caring. The bonus points and late days were an amazing gift. I also really enjoyed the recorded lectures and the partially implemented psets (less stressful and it was interesting to read someone elses code). The ED discussion was the most responsive Ive ever seen. Weaknesses: course materials were somewhat scattered, live coding was difficult to follow, and the psets peaked in difficulty/workload in the middle right before the break. The ED was responsive but redundant at some points.",
                "Strengths: The lectures themselves were pretty good, and I know the professors really cared about making the class as good as possible. \r\n Weaknesses: The problem sets were quite easy, to the extent that I don't think I got better at coding beyond learning some basic new syntax. A lot of the ULAs didn't seem to know what was going on. The course was very disorganized, making most of the struggle adjusting to new information. It was also frustrating when the professors were kinda pushover-y and pushed back deadlines/changed grading/etc so much that it felt like a disadvantage to people who were actually doing the work.",
                "major transformation of the course this semester made it somewhat disorganized but hopefully that gets worked out over time",
                "disorganized most of the time, but the professors seemed caring",
                "It started off with a real learning curve in teaching but ended up on a very strong note. In all, the pace was appropriate, the instructors were accommodating, and the content was challenging. It could be improved with time and some more structure going forward.",
                "The first half of the course felt disorganized and it was hard to keep up with what was being taught in lectures. However, I enjoyed most of the psets, office hours were helpful and so were review sessions/sections.",
                "The course, having been newly developed this semester, was overall good. I liked how the exams were very fair and tested the most important concepts in the class, allowing one to assess if they had learned the fundamental concepts. The PSETs were sometimes a little bit too challenging as they seemed disconnected from what was discussed in the lectures. One way to improve the course is to provide some introductory materials to help students learn the syntax of coding in C. Also, because of the large class size, it was often hard to get clear feedback on coding assignments and the directions in which I could improve.",
                "Strengths: flexible instructors who care about their students, head ULA went above and beyond to prepare weekly discussion section / review sessions, and reasonable problem sets that were relevant to the lecture material. Weaknesses: (dis)organization of class in the first half of the semester and the lack of and/or confusing feedback from Gradescope on our problem sets.",
                "I often felt like I was fighting against the compiler, even when I thought I understood the theoretical concepts in the abstract. I also often felt lost in class.\r\nWhen my code failed a test, especially towards the latter half of the course, it was not clear _why_ it had failed.",
                "This course had few strengths. Perhaps its only strength were the slides that were posted following lecture in the second half of the semester. It was extremely disorganized and the lectures were very hard to follow. I felt completely unprepared for the first midterm, as we were given very few studying materials and no practice questions or sense of what kinds of questions might be asked. Nearly every assignment was posted later than we were told it would be, and edited multiple times due to errors. This resulted in hours and hours of wasted time, especially for those who were not procrastinating and started the assignment early. Throughout the year policy changes were made, including allowing people to drop the lowest pset grade. This was not announced until right before the deadline, making it very unfair for those who had already done the extremely difficult and poorly designed assignment at the expense of work for other classes. There were also regularly errors in grading the psets and the expectations were not clearly communicated or consistent. I nearly always felt unnecessarily stressed out and confused by this class, despite attending every lecture and many office hours.",
                "Instruction was generally good, but coursework was too simplified in my opinion.",
                "Better/more engaging live coding, especially in the first half of the semester.",
                "No strengths, nothing but weaknesses",
                "I really enjoyed this class and the professors really put in a lot of effort to make the class fun. I think it would be great if each class began with an overview of all the topics and ideas in the lecture so that their is a clear picture about where the lesson is going.",
                "The strength was how dedicated Alan and Ozan were to student understanding. That was also the weakness because it ate into class time and it flooded ed discussions.",
                "Structure and schedule not explicit at beginning of year. Live coding in lecture was useless",
                "I respect the ambition to overhaul CPSC 223 from scratch... but if you are going to take such a huge risk, you *must* deliver. Unfortunately, while I am grateful for and respect their hard work, Professor Weide and Erat fell a bit short, and the course was ultimately messy and rushed. I'm sure there were some elements of past CPSC 223 syllabi that they could have reused, and thereby reduced the risk of fiascos like the HookBook Pset, which dragged on for way too long on a topic that is not that complex (array lists a.k.a. vectors).",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures, all the material was posted. Weaknesses: the class felt a bit disorganized, the autograder was never up on Gradescope (which made it hard to test our codes), bad problem grades without understanding why.",
                "strengths: much more student-friendly vs last semester's, psets were slightly easier and more relevant in terms of both practicality and exam content\r\nweaknesses: slightly disorganized at the beginning, deadlines were inconsistent and moved around too often, lectures were not exactly that engaging",
                "Strengths: content, availability of assistance \r\nWeaknesses: organization of materials (towards the beginning - it became better at the end)",
                "strengths were the grading scheme, it allowed for more focus on assignments rather than exams, which relieves a lot of pressure, and lecture format using slides was good; weaknesses were the organization of class in the beginning, but it got much better after spring break, and live coding during lecture was difficult to follow",
                "Very disorganized, syllabus was changed multiple times, lecturers did not seem prepared during most lectures(specially Professor Weide). I think a good way to imprve things is to have all the links and class pages consolidated somewhere from the very beginning.",
                "Strengths: Content is super interesting and there are plenty of office hours to get help in. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At least this version of the course was very, very rough in the sense that many aspects were still being figured out as we went which made it very chaotic and hard to follow. The lectures are also a huge weakness. If Allan is teaching, DO NOT GO TO LECTURE. You will end up more confused than initially. Ozan is better but still hard to follow at times.",
                "Strengths: the material, enthusiasm of the profs, the ULAs\r\nWeakness: at first the profs were very unorganized and the pset deadlines were messy, including what test cases existed or not",
                "The topics and its relevance to computer science at a higher level could be explained better so that we felt like we were learning something important. Office hours were a mess.",
                "Strengths: I got a good basic understanding of data structures. Moreover, the ULA Ben Goldstein was incredibly helpful with his exam review sessions!\r\nWeakness: The class is completely disorganized. Relevant information for problem sets or exams could be found in several different locations and I always had to check all of them to find what I needed, which included the Canvas home page, files, announcement, or Ed Discussion. Ed Discussion had way too many posts and it was hard to find anything. Since Ed Discussion participation was encouraged via bonus points, lots of people really wanted to post as many things as possible, which resulted in repeated questions and several new posts a day near problem-set deadlines. \r\n\r\nProfessors Weide and Erat mentioned several times the struggles teaching the class because it is their first time teaching it and they are changing the course curriculum. However, many CS students that I talked with previously loved the old CS223, so I do not know why it was necessary to change the syllabus in the first place. I can understand the difficulties for the new professors to teach a new class, but at the same time, I do not think that the students should be penalized for it. I am not a Computer Science major, but I am curious to see how CS323 will be next semester given how this course was structured.",
                "i think the structure could be improved - a lot of time was wasted so we definitely got an abridged version of the course. i think the lectures could be more prepared, sometimes the professors seemed to trip over themselves in class.",
                "Strengths: Unique psets that seem to be helpful in applying what is learned during lecture\r\nWeaknesses: Still less defined course due to new faculty",
                "strengths: the professors! Alan and Ozan were extremely understanding and supportive of students throughout the course and during stressful times/psets which was really nice to see in a CS class where stress levels can get high. The ULAs were all very helpful during office hours and Ben's walkthrough sessions/recordings were an added bonus I very much appreciate. Mad respect to the professors for restructuring the course to give every student the ability to truly take the most out of the class and succeed\r\nweakness: while the psets allowed us to sufficiently practice class material and instill good style practice (and were manageable for someone with little CS background prior to Yale like me) , I often heard from other students that the difficulty of the psets were on the lower side which may be a disadvantage when taking high level CS classes in the future",
                "The course, probably because several changes were being made by Ozan and Alan, was quite disorganized. The course material distribution among the first (on pointers) and the second (C++, OOP, data structures, and graphs) halves was quite uneven. This also reflected on the midterms.",
                "Initially, this class was unorganized in that important files and announcements were scattered across multiple different sites, from Canvas to Gradescope to Ed Discussion. Also, the initial lectures involved live coding which was difficult to follow along with. However, the latter half of the course improved - the lectures included engaging slides and announcements became more streamlined. For the future, I would recommend not using Ed Discussion as a place for announcements and instead using it as just a forum for students and professors to communicate. Browsing through several Ed Discussion forums to find important announcements was not ideal. Both Professor Weide and Professor Ozan are passionate about the subject, however, and always willing to make changes for the benefit of their students. They listened to our feedback throughout the course and it was clear that they cared for the students' wellbeing.",
                "I think the problem sets themselves are very helpful with learning each core concept of this class. In particular, understanding how AVL trees are balanced was much easier after coding them myself. However, I did think that the lectures were a bit messy and hard to follow, and would suggest using more slides and visuals.",
                "I thought the course did a decent job given it was very much a tryout of this new format. Both instructors were very enthusiastic and dedicated to the course and its material. However, the course itself was very lacking in many areas. I believe the department tried to make 223 more of an intro course due to the difficulty of the fall semester 223s in the past. In turn, the material and assignments severely lacked rigor and much less content was covered. Furthermore, lectures earlier in the semester were somewhat disorganized and not thought out. I believe 223 should not be designed as an intro course, and doing so didnt really help those who needed an easier experience and also didnt help those who wanted a more challenging experience.",
                "Strengths: PSETs practiced to concepts we learned in class, but a couple weeks behind\r\nWeaknesses: Not well organized course, two professors with different teaching styles, constant errors in PSETs or exams or changes to topics",
                "Main strength was the kindness of the instructors and how much they cared about making it better. Main weakness was that they were building the plane while flying it, which is something that will work itself out with time.",
                "Extremely disorganized",
                "Strengths: Got to learn about two computer science languages and numerous data structures in a short amount of time\r\nWeakness: It would have been great to spend more time on stacks, queues, and heaps rather than so much time on arraylists and linkedlists. Before the midterm, I felt the curriculum was a bit unorganized as I could not understand what material we were even covering.",
                "The lectures were pretty boring and confusing.",
                "It was definitely disorganized at first, although it improved after spring break.",
                "Weaknesses: I think the most important weakness was that the class never found a good balance of pset difficulty. Most were either too hard or (after the hardest took extensive time and frustration for most people) too easy/handhold-y, and I'm hoping that they find a better middle ground for future years.",
                "I feel that having slides with pseudo code or explanation  help, rather than mostly presenting  code without explanation  which was really difficult  to follow when reviewing the lectures in the first half.  Additionally, i didn't like that some exams had major errors, its important to thoroughly  check exams before distributing them. You chose a good set of TA's, they were an amazing and integral part which helped me complete the psets. Certain TA's went above and beyond what was required of them . TA's should be paid for overtime and you should regulate the amount of TA's who can sign up for specific slots baseed on attendance data, so that there is a lot of help, especially the week before a deadline. At t HG e beginning, it was the understanding  that there woukd be 3 midterms, however, due to not making it thru lect materials, they reduced them to 2 which id something  i wrote the first exam unaware(partly my fault but also the instructors fault for not making this known from tge beginning)  of..this is really unfair bcz instead if the sxam being 10% it was now worth 15%.  Releasing exam practice materials a week or more ahead of time like the 2nd exam would also help absolve you of blame when students don't do as well. Lastly, a strength was that the profs realized their shortcomings, our stresses and frustrations as students and did their best to compansate for them in attendance points, bonus points, adjusting the late policy etc  They were more than understanding  of student struggles, God bless their souls for that. If they teach the course again with what they hv learned this semester, they'll do great - look to professor Slade, professor JDRS, for additional  material in organizing large lectures.",
                "Very disorganized, bad problem sets and bad exams and bad lectures",
                "I found the course material quite interesting and lectures were engaging. I do think that the first few problem sets were not as well-organized as the later assignments--perhaps they could be restructured to have slightly clearer expectations.",
                "Strengths: The topics are taught well.\r\nWeaknesses: Organization wasnt very strong and the topics were all simple and straight forward, so we didnt learn very much.",
                "Needs to be more defined lectures. This lecture is pointers. This lecture is arrays. This lecture is linked lists. Just makes the class more concrete and official",
                "psets were interesting, but im sure grading via gradescope is a work in progress (it was impressive how much the instructors developed this as a first time feature in the course)",
                "A little chaotic. Feel like the class had additional stress from this.",
                "Stop live coding, its impossible to follow. The organisation needs to be better as essential information was buried in Ed threads. The course was much better when Ozan taught as his slideshows were much easier to follow.",
                "One of the weaknesses of this course was the management of office hours. I felt like everyone in the class would show up to office hours, and the TF's then wouldn't be able to allocate a lot of time to helping you.",
                "I liked lecture, enjoyed the psets, and thought the professors were incredible. The course was a little disorganized since it took on a new format, but overall I really enjoyed the supportive and caring environment.",
                "Since the course was under redevelopment, it understandably had some issues in the problem sets. I think that the problem sets did do a good job of teaching students how to code. I think that the lectures could be a bit more interactive and the exams could have less stress on them since I don't think exams teach computer science the best.",
                "i think the course was paced well in terms of material and the instructors clearly care and listen to the students. the weakness is just the organization, which I am sure will be ironed out because this is the first time the course is being taught in this format",
                "Strengths - extra possible points, shift to more understanding by principles in the middle of the course facilitated understanding, and ULA and review sessions helped a lot ; Weaknesses - inconsistent grading",
                "Very messy, grading for assignments were wrong most of the time. Professors messed up assignments quite a few times.",
                "The course content was interesting but the class was poorly structured. Given that the curriculum was restructured this was understandable, but it made the class a little frustrating.",
                "Strengths: the problem sets were challenging (especially HookBook), but honestly pretty fun to work on and complete, Ben Goldstein's review sessions and problem set walkthroughs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture instruction was unclear more often than not, example code nearly always seemed to have issues, every problem set had a different method of checking for correctness",
                "Some disjointed lectures, and live coding was unfortunate. Projects and grading also disorganized. I did learn C++ though!",
                "All of the hard data structures were mushed to the end of the semester. I wish they couldve spread it out more.",
                "Very new course - hard to be perfect. Instructors put in great effort to make course work, something I highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAn improvement I believe could majorly improve this course is a higher focus on data structures from the beginning. The early parts focused heavily on programming for my course, something that left lots of students behind.",
                "This course improved as the semester went on, but I think that the first few problem sets were somewhat disorganized, because the course did not have a central website (like CPSC 201), and often I would need to search through the many gradescope posts to find the relevant information. The autograder was also not complete at the time of assignment releases, and for the third pset the autograde was not complete until a day before the deadline, which resulted in a lot of unnecessary stress and scrambling to edit my code.",
                "Strengths: involved professors\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs had flaws in them, lectures ran behind schedule, hit-or-miss ULA hours",
                "Strength s: recorded, professors are lenient and want you to help you do well.",
                "The course did a nice job of not making psets more time consuming than they had to be. I would prefer the course to be more rigorous.",
                "strengths:\r\n- assignment deadline flexibility\r\n- instructors open to feedback and very welcoming to talk to\r\n- new original assignments were good practice\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- course was pretty disorganized in terms of mistakes on assignments and not clear deadlines or not clear expectations\r\n- too much time spent on dynamic arrays; didn't really do that many data structures in the first half. the second half of the course was very rushed and heavy. learned almost a new data structure every week. went really fast when it came to the complicated stuff like trees, hashtables, queues and heaps, etc.\r\n- some of the assignments were 80% implemented and you just had to fill in some of the functions. definitely didn't learn as much on those as i did on the other assignments that i wrote 100% of.",
                "Strengths: The professors were all geniunely TRYING their best to make this class less grueling than it has been for the past few years, which I appreciate so much.\r\nWeaknesses: Information DUMPED, not really that organized and there was always a mistake when a pset was released.",
                "Strengths: Very Understanding professors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very Understanding professors to the extent that they made the class so mistake tolerant that it almost hurt most people's learning.",
                "Strength: good assignments (for the most part) that got me more experience in C and C++\r\nWeakness: lectures could be more engaging",
                "Strengths: the content and information of the course is highly, highly important for CS students and industry interviews\r\nWeaknesses: the course was not well organized and lots of times psets had to be revised after they were released.",
                "Strengths: Ozan and Alan care about the students and want them to succeed. Concepts are interesting, new languages C and C++ are introduced.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity with problem sets, sometimes too slow/repetitive, badly in need of discussion sections",
                "It could be greatly improved by having Ozan teach all the lectures and just having Alan act as a course coordinator. The course was simply too disorganized, and Alan's lectures were incomprehensible. The main strengths were the optional discussion sections, pset walkthroughs, and review sessions led by head ULA Ben.",
                "Better organization and clearer lectures",
                "Strengths- I feel like the course content was taught pretty well, especially during the second half when things became more routine. The professors were super helpful with answering questions and everything during lecture.\r\nWeakness- Since the course got reorganized this semester, the first half of the semester was a mess. Due dates kept changing, and the content we were learning was at a very slow pace. The pset difficult was all over the place. It was either super easy or ungodly difficult (example would be hookbook part 2).",
                "Strength: the community among the students is very strong\r\nWeakness: lectures are not very engaging so it is easy to not feel attached to the class",
                "Strengths: this class was a very low stress environment, and Alan and Ozan and the TAs were always offering assistance. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I worry that we did not cover all the material required to succeed in later CPSC classes. This class was noticeably easier than the previous semester, which had its pros (less work, better learning environment) and cons (less material, fewer challenges). In future semesters I would like documentation on problem sets to be more thorough. It was often the case that the instructors would have to release multiple revisions to problem sets, leaving students with less time to work on them.",
                "Strengths were some of the problem sets, which increased my understanding of working with memory in C and C++. It could be improved by having better organized lectures and problem sets, more of a structured format, faster paced lectures with less time being spent on writing code in lecture and more focus on concepts, and more challenging and rigorous assignments.",
                "Was pretty disorganized but the instructors tried to make it better towards the end",
                "I liked that they were flexible, but it was too easy. The lectures were boring and too slow.",
                "Messy schedules/unclear pset (with errors)/autograder failures. I understand this course is going through some restructuring, but it felt as if we were a \"test trial\" class and thus had to suffer the consequences of the inexperience/newness of the course.",
                "They changed psets after releasing them, didn't provide proper tools for us to test our code and track errors, and the course wasn't paced very well. Office hours alone was the main resource for assistance they provided, which was understaffed.",
                "The weaknesses of this course are the lectures. the professors don't make learning fun.",
                "Because of changes that this course was going through during Spring 2023, the class was a bit unorganized, especially with the psets and the beginning lectures. Live coding during lectures confused students further because we sometimes got sidetracked and couldn't didn't know what the most important concepts to remember were. Later on, slides presentations helped alleviate this issue, but it was still not completely clear (the slides were a bit cluttered). I think there could be more emphasis on which concepts are most important, like the Data structures, their functions, and their respective runtimes. Due to organization issues, we might not have covered as many data structures as we were going to. Also, since this was the debut of many of the psets we did, there were some major issues, but these will likely be fixed for the future.",
                "have assignments completed before uploading",
                "Strengths: cool content, the professors are good guys, seems like its headed in a good direction, positive vision for the future, helpful ULAs, some of the lecture slides are really good\r\nWeaknesses: standard new class challenges with the autograder and class organization, but the profs are genuinely committed to making it better, and I think we ironed out most of the bugs this year",
                "in class coding should be reduced, or more tailored to what will be on the psets. towards the end of the course, the turnaround for psets was really tight and a bit unmanageable at times. professors had to provide multiple class-wide extensions around midterm and finals, which perhaps indicates that we didn't have enough time to complete the amount of work assigned. greater explanation of how these data structures are used in computer science would have also been appreciated, the concepts feel very abstract and I'm not quite sure when I would use them outside of the psets (but I'm also not a cs major so maybe its just me)",
                "This class was one of the most disorganized classes I've been in. The project specs were incredibly vague and some (namely, HookBook Part 2) did not give students appropriate time to write and test their code. The course did not have a functioning auto grader for most assignments, resulting in students getting low scores for minor formatting errors. As a symptom of the vague project specs, office hours were flooded, with some assignments having 150+ students attending (the class is 264 students), even several nights before the pset was due.\r\n\r\nA pset was assigned to be due during reading week, the day after Spring Fling.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the lectures, there was too much \"live coding\" during Alan's lectures which was hard to follow for 75 minutes. \r\n\r\nThis class may have decent course evaluations, but that is because the overwhelming majority of students got an A in class, not because it is a well-taught course. Even as a student who got an A in the class, there were massive headaches throughout.",
                "It was a little unorganized and messy, with lots of random extensions and a seemingly scattered curriculum. The homework assignments were very unpredictable, with some being extremely easy and others taking 20+ hours to complete. However, the teaching style was nice and the disorganization was acknowledged; lots of feedback quizzes were given to us, which makes me optimistic for the future.",
                "Better organization on behalf of the staff I feel. I also think that there were some very difficult and important algorithms and concepts taught at the very end that appeared on our second midterm that you did not necessarily need to know C++ for but were reserved for the end and not flushed out in detail. I think if the class sticks with a twice a week format, that the days should alternate: one day for concept and another day for coding. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness I realized later is when they had a ULA teach a supplement class on Wednesday night, but I had a class then! I should have been able to see this supplement in courses.yale.edu so I could register and prepare space for it! I would have done much better in the class I think if I knew ahead of time of this resource before class selection deadlines. Supplement classes should be visible to students well ahead of time and/or have the option to register for. \r\n\r\nI will say both professors were very receptive to student feedback and gave us extensions, curves, advice, and help in ways that went above and beyond my normal classes. They do care, I just think they got some things wrong that should be improved.",
                "While the course staff were all very helpful and supportive, the overall structure and pacing of the course could be a bit disorienting at times. Assignments would be altered or delayed often, there were hiccups with the overall course structure, as well as other problems. However, even with these hiccups the course staff really put forth the effort to course-correct things when problems came up, as the structure and flow of the course was a learning experience for all that were involved.",
                "This course had really interesting programming projects. At the beginning of the course however this course was a little disorganized which made following along occasionally difficult."

Talk to people that have taken the course more recently and ask them how they feel about it.  Ozan has potential.  Do not take this class if Weide is co-teaching.",
                "I would wait a couple of semesters before taking this course, so that it is better organized.",
                "Yes, fun class with useful CS concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone -- both CS and non-CS majors. I think it is great for deepening your CS knowledge, and I think that the new professors are trying to make it super accessible. There is also a lot of support built-in to the course.",
                "Yes, especially since despite the newness of instructors/rather rough start to the semester organizationally, the improvement in instruction/organization quality has been dramatic.",
                "Yes, since it is a requirement for the CS major",
                "I'm assuming you're taking this course because it's required. If that's not the case, I wouldn't recommend it. However, for those who require 223, I would generally recommend taking it with Alan and Ozan, at least over the alternative. This semester was pretty rough, but I'm confident they'll improve it in the future.",
                "Yes, it is helpful to understand data structures.",
                "Yes - the Professors try to make this course very accessible to newer programmers and not just a class as a prerequisite. A good way to get practice on a field that might become part of the \"Core Curriculum\" in the future.",
                "YES!!!  This course is extremely useful, especially for tech interviews.  I completed a tech interview for a software dev internship (which I got!) while relying heavily on the material I learned in this course.  I would recommend 223 to anyone who potentially wants to go into tech after graduation.",
                "If you're a cs major you kinda have to, it's like death and taxes. However, if you're S&DS or anything other than cs but want to learn data structures, you're better off learning online. This course was extremely disorganized, but I don't really blame the professors since it's their first time running it. PSETS were made on the fly, and test cases were released either late or broken. PSETS almost always have bugs that instructor needs to fix. By the last two psets, instructors didnt even release test cases, covering up with \"well a good programmer should be able to think of their own test cases.\" Exams are hard, no curve.",
                "Would not recommend the class in its current form. Super disorganized. Did not learn all that much. There are definitely better resources online to learn all the same material without the headache.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, you kinda have to take the class if you're a CS major, so best of luck.",
                "Not if the same professors are teaching and they haven't gotten better\r\nFeel like I didn't get much out of it even though it was my first comp sci class at Yale",
                "If it's not a requirement than no, but if you have to take it then it's fine.",
                "I can tell the class is going in a good direction compared to previous years, and I think there is a lot to gain out of this class, so yes.",
                "Yes, eventually you'd need to take it to do serious computer science.",
                "Yes, I would just tell them that the instructions can be a bit unclear at times, that there are a lot of moving, unfinished aspects of the class.",
                "In theory yes; data structures are integral to your future development of CS skills and maturity. However, this course was very poorly organized and left out much potential in learning, etc. I would not recommend the professors. Although Ozan was very enthusiastic, it just seemed like the class was not ready to be taught (frequent pset errors, exam questions improperly made, constantly changing schedule, etc.).",
                "For CS majors, you have to. For non-CS majors, I'd recommend taking it after Alan/Ozan have had more teaching experience.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I've described many of the strengths of this course, which mean that students most definitely will learn a lot. I wholeheartedly have faith in the instructors' ability to patch up the current weaknesses of the course, so those will probably be non-issues in future iterations of the course. Although future students must take care due to the high workload, I believe that they will learn a lot, and that many of the major weaknesses of this iteration will not be present in the future.",

                "In its current format, I would only recommend this course if it is required for your major.",
                "Yea. They were first time prof's so it will probably get better. I had a really good time.",
                "I would recommend it for the content; however, if you take it, take it with a different instructor.",
                "Not really, but if it's a requirement you have to take it. It wasn't well organized.",
                "Take it if you have to, but most of the assignments were fun",
                "I would. I was my first actual CS class, and with literally 0 background in data structures, I found it pretty insightful. People collectively complained a lot, and it sometimes felt hopeless and lacking in support, but overall, with good planning and readiness to actively reach out for help, the course can be enjoyable and not even that much stressful.",
                "If you have to take it, then sure. It wasn't terrible and I'm optimistic that it will be better in the coming iterations; this was the first time the course had C++ and the transition was pretty bumpy. I really appreciate their efforts to change it and I think it will definitely be a lot more worth taking in the future.",
                "i would once the course gets more organized",
                "Yes, it is a fundamental class in CS",

                "Yes, this course teaches c++ and the intricacies of different data structures, both of which are interesting and important topics. The class has recently gone through many changes, so I imagine the course will continue to change as it settles into its new form. Both the professors really care a lot about the students and were very understanding of everything.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it were taught by the same instructors. This class does not prepare all students for a good foundation in DSA because of its lack of organization - it is a strong barrier for those who cannot afford to get past the disorganization and confusion since they have relatively less experience with programming.",

                "Yes, because I like the content and over the course of this course I saw that the issues that occurred were fixed (at least to some degree). For example, they fixed how weird the midterm was. They also fixed the organization (still needs a bit of improvement, it became exponentially better).",
                "yes, good for learning data structures in programming",
                "No, if you don't need it for the major. It will be a great cause of stress. Extremely disorganized. Though, you can tell the professors care, it did not come through in the organization of the class nor lectures.",
                "I would recommend it simply because the content is super interesting and it helps you get more coding reps in. But try to take it with friends. Hopefully, Ozan and Alan will make it more organized for next time but in general their lectures are a disaster.",
                "Necessary for cs",
                "Well if you gotta take it, you gotta take it. But if not, take some other class in CS.",
                "I do not recommend taking this class with Alan Weide and Ozan Erat. Hopefully, the professors that taught this class in the previous years will teach it again, but this was the most disorganized course I have ever taken at Yale. It was the first time that both professors were teaching this class and they also wanted to change the curriculum to add C++. Initially, I was excited about the idea, but even before entering the C++ part of the content, the class started to become a mess. Since Ed Discussion participation was rewarded with bonus points, several posts a day with repeated information were made, especially near problem-set deadlines. Not only that, but it seemed like most problem sets were not properly reviewed by the professors, given that some of them had multiple announcements with changes and updates. For example, one of the psets stated that we should not use dynamically allocated memory when that was the only way to solve it. Professor Erat later sent an announcement correcting it and provided bonus points for students that did the pset using both dynamic and static memory. Furthermore, one of the codes provided in the *exam* gave segmentation fault, showing that they could have done a better job reviewing the exam before giving it to the entire class.\r\n\r\nCompared to students that took the class in previous semesters, I noticed how much more they learned and how much more they were satisfied with the class. I strongly encourage students to wait until someone else is teaching it. I also believe that the Computer Science department should do something about this core cs class. CS223 represents one of the main classes for the department and it was turned into a mess. One of the best things about this course was the ULAs. Many people went to their office hours for assistance and from my experience, they were incredibly helpful. I also wanted to give a huge shoutout to Ben Goldstein. My experience with the course would have been so much worse if it was not for him. Ben held a walkthrough for each problem set and exam review sessions, which were essential for me to better comprehend the contents of the class.",
                "it's required for CS majors, and a pretty big part in coding interviews so yeah. But to anyone that is not required to take this class for their major, no.",
                "Yes, this semester was a lot more engaging and doable than previous semesters, and I could really learn a lot from lectures and sections.",
                "I would recommend this course to students required to take this for their major",
                "In its current state, it is a disorganized and, therefore, frustrating course. But Ozan and Alan are new to the course, and the revisions they make overtime may change the course for the better.",
                "Yes. Understanding data structures is vital to the field of computer science, and getting hands-on learning with coding/using these structures is important.",

                "I would recommend this class to a student in a few years when the class has developed a bit more.",
                "It is pretty easy and low commitment, but if you want to learn some interesting content, just try to skip into algorithms. A good 5th/6th class if you like CS. Workload was pretty low compared to other classes (about 6-10 hours of work) every two weeks.",
                "Yes -- for anyone interested in studying computer science, it's useful in learning a number of important parts of CS. Though it was a bit disorganized this semester, it was the professors' first time teaching the class and I'm confident that it'll improve.",

                "This semester was as an anomaly, a period of change as they restructured the course. I still feel like I learned something though, which bodes well for future semesters of 223 once Alan and Ozan have finalized psets and exams and caught all the errors with them (and th autograder)",
                "probably a prerequisite",

                "No I would not, unless they needed it for their major. The class was very poorly managed from assignments being changed up until the due date to the auto grader never working.

                "Yes! If you're serious about being in Tech, this is a must-take class.",
                "If you have to take it you should. Its useful.",
                "Yes, you need it for the CS major and it's not too difficult after all the bonus points are applied. Additionally, the content is interesting and engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in the hours with the problem sets and start the work ahead of time. If you are not on top of the work and don't want to learn by yourself sometimes by trying and failing on PSETS do not take this course.",
                "No, only take it if you need to. It's not at all a fun class, and although the material is important for an understanding of CS, it's so boring.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it. This course was very interesting to learn about the data structures that everyday software uses. I would take this class if interested in CS since I think it is more useful than so of the other intro CS classes and it gives a better representation of what CS is actually like.",
                "This is a good class for getting coding experience. Although may be tough, the constant practice does make you a better coder",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to CS majors and CS-interested students. Although many students in the class are taking it as a prerequisite for majors or the Certificate in Programming, this class covers key concepts that reveal the beauty of CS to introductory students.",
                "It is required for many CS-related majors, but if it is not, I still think it is a good way to become better at programming.",
                "Yes, its good for improving your problem solving ability and definitely necessary for any tech related field",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely not unless they need it as a major requirement.",
                "Yes, it's necessary to learn C++ for the major, and this course is required",
                "Yes, but hopefully with the class being more organized in the future. The concepts that this class is supposed to teach are very essential to CS.",
                "Yes! The course was fun, and I think itll get much more fun and organized as the professors refine it. It was challenging to be taking the first version of the new format for the course, but Im hopeful that in the future itll be better than the old version.",
                "only if you have to take it for a major or certificate",
                "It's a good class if it's not taught by Professor Weide, and you are planning to major in Computer Science.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course, as learning about these data structures is fundamental to understanding future concepts in computer science.",
                "You need it for the CS Major. I think this class has much promise to be better, I just took it at a time when it was transitioning over. I think with the suggestions multiple students have made throughout the semester, it will become much better.",
                "I would! It was interesting and a good way to learn about C, C++, and data structures.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course as it gives students a solid foundation in programming and in data structures."
