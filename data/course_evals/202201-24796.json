The final essay is weighted quite heavily considering that it is the only piece of writing that we had to submit throughout the duration of the course. If the final essay is to remain as heavily-weighted as it is, I think it would be a good idea to incorporate some smaller writing assignments throughout the semester.",
                "This course could not be improved. 10/10",
                "Strengths: The small class (9 people) was amazing for class discussion! Everyone had the opportunity to say their opinions and perspectives and it always felt very collaborative. I also enjoyed that before discussion began we would all go around and say what we thought about the week's readings and explain what we were confused about, disliked, etc. Doing that especially helped me in weeks where the reading were a bit confusing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly found no strong weakness"

                "Yes absolutely! This is my favorite PLSC course that I've taken so far, partially because there is so much sociology that complements the political science as well. Expertise is in crisis; we see it in climate denial, anti-vaccine rhetoric, and then Lord Chancellor Michael Gove's famous justification of Brexit, \"the people of this country have had enough of experts.\" This course is so relevant in today's political landscape, and the way the seminar is structured really helps to dig deep into the subject. Professor Brandmayr is brilliant and very engaging, and the readings were all captivating.",
