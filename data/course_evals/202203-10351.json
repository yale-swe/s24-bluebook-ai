                "The main strength of this course, frankly, is Prof. Bazell. Coming from a long career in journalism, he's quite knowledgeable about the subject in question, and he has some very impressive connections that saw him invite some prominent guest speakers (given that the class is a small seminar).",
                "strengths: readings and discussions, the speakers were great, projects\r\nweaknesses: nothing really\r\nimproved: maybe add in some debate activities for the topics in class",
                "I would say there are no weaknesses to this course. I enjoyed every meeting as there was something new to learn. One of the strengths I'd have to say is that everyone is from diverse backgrounds. It's not a course full of pre-meds that are very cutthroat.",
                "Strengths -- Amazing professor with a unique background (Chief Science Correspondent at NBC). His unique background really allowed us to understand what the most recent issues in public health/medicine through the lens of his career in journalism. The laidback seminar format was also great as learning was enhanced through open discussion and group work. Many of the discussion topics were super interesting and those I would have never encountered without taking this course. There were also amazing guest speakers throughout the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- At times, the professor did not provide thorough feedback which is understandable considering the number of students, but it would have been great to get more feedback on presentations, and papers. There were also many readings but I would suggest to cut back on some just to allow us to engage with the fewer readings more. But overall, the class was a wonderful experience and I am glad I took the class.",
                "Strengths: it was a really fun class with interesting assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its really hard to gauge what Bazzell wants from you sometimes like in your essays",
                "The strengths of this course are that there was always something to learn and the way in which the material was taught was always catered toward the student's understanding. The course can be improved by having a more structured program for quizzes and not having as much instructor involvement with assessments.",
                "It was a good class since it offered insight on a variety of topics and facilitated discussions within the class. It could be improved by delving deeper in some of the topics and creating a space for more argumentative discussion with students taking sides on the various issues and arguing its pros and cons.",
                "Strengths: prof. Bazell is a super laid-back and nice guy. the readings are fascinating and most of the topics he covers are generally interesting regardless of whether you have a science background.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: prof. bazell claims we have a dicussion-based class, but in reality he frequently lectures and answers his own questions.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Bazell knows a ton about the world of public health and his connections with guest speakers is incredibly useful. The class covers very interesting topics in a way that doesn't presume a ton of prior knowledge which is quite useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think I found that a lot of the discussion occurred on a surface level rather than digging more deeply into the readings we were assigned. I especially didn't enjoy when we had to narrate powerpoints that Prof. Bazell had made; I found that I didn't actually gain much from just re-summarizing the readings;."

                "Yes absolutely! Bob was an amazing professor and his class was a great way to learn about the current issues in health for people with a wide variety of backgrounds. Note that this class is not full of premeds, and in fact, premeds are the minority here. The diversity of perspectives really adds to the fruitful discussions we had in the seminar. I recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in health.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course because I truly enjoyed my time with this course, and I believe another student in my shoes would enjoy the course just as much. However, it is important to note that not only STEM students can enjoy this course, in fact, there were some students in the class who are intending to major in something outside of STEM.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot of interesting topics and different things I had never thought about before. It's a very interesting class taught by a knowledgable professor.",
                "Yes! Super relaxed environment, open-note quizzes, nice professor with very accomplished background, and absolutely fascinating topics/readings.",
                "If you are interested in a lot of reading regarding public healthtake it!! If not, then dont. Some of the topics were interesting but the reading felt extensive and I wasnt too interested in it",
                "Recommend for a certain crowd: looking for a science credit, have some basis in reading scientific papers before, have taken a basic science class (ie took a version of AP Bio/Chem). This is definitely one of the better options for fulfilling a science distribution requirement. It's not super difficult (the biggest time commitment are the two papers which are shorter than you'll write for most classes), the material is interesting, and you'll get out of it what you put in. If you do all the reading, participate in class, and put effort into your paper, you'll gain a lot."
