    "This was a great class. We learned about different types of machines to recognize regular, context-free, recursively enumerable, and decidable languages.",
    "Learned knowledge of basic automata (DFA, NFA, PDA, CFG, Turing Machines) and their relation to the theory of computation. Also covered equivalences between models, closure properties of languages and regular languages, and decidability. Heavy focus on the theoretical aspects behind computation."

    "I absolutely loved this class and don't have any suggestions for how it could be improved. The small class size was so fun, the problem sets were challenging but reasonable, and I honestly enjoyed myself while taking the midterm and final. The class was extremely organized, and Professor Bridy was consistently well-prepared for class. I found his examples to be particularly helpful.",
    "The class was awesome because it was a small group so we could ask the professor questions during lecture. The material was really cool and all tied together by the end of the semester.",
    "The course is overall very theoretical, which I viewed as a plus. Homework was generally very relevant and a solid resource for crystallizing the knowledge from lecture, so, as oddly as it might sound, I actually kind of wish that there were more PSETs. Problems were never tedious and always proved interesting results. The course is a very good introduction to automata and computability theory and very well taught. Professor Bridy is very approachable and always looks forwards to answering questions or clarifying proofs in class."

    "Absolutely! This is the coolest subject if you're interested in the intersection between CS and math. I looked forward to coming to class every single day -- probably my favorite class I've taken in college! The progression of the course was so logical, and it was clear that Professor Bridy was passionate about the material. He did a really fantastic job, and I'm so jealous of the students who get to take CPSC 202 with him next semester.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Definitely. I think one of the advantages of Yale CS is that it does focuses on the theoretical aspect to a larger extent. This course is particularly well suited because it covers such rich theory and teaches how to think and approach problems which straddle the domain of formal math proof and CS algorithm. The material is fascinating, and every now and then touched upon real world applications. For anyone seeking a better understanding of models of computation, or who thought the second half of 201 (turing machines and deterministic finite automata) was at all interesting, this is the class for you. It covers these ideas in much more depth and the facts and theorems that arise are amazing."
