                "Strengths: the material was really interesting, and I loved how Professor Shaw used phonetic studies to connect the concepts we were learning to the way languages work in real life. Phonetics can often seem complicated and a little convoluted, but I felt like Shaw did a good job of finding clear ways of explaining things. I felt like I had a lot of aha moments in class. Weaknesses: so there were like nine people in this class, and it was kind of taught at times as if it was a big lecture. I understand the impetuswe had a lot of material to coverbut at the same time I felt like it was sometimes hard to stay focused, and I wanted more opportunities for group discussion/class participation. Like the day we got to determine whether we produced a bunched or retroflex rhotic using an ultrasound that Professor Shaw had brought in was probably my favorite day of the semester. Also, it seemed a little unnecessary to have a final project and then a final final only four days later.",
                "The material is very interesting and its fun to explore the speech sounds that you might've heard in other languages but not known how to reproduce. The lectures can sometimes be a little boring; the days when there was more participation were much more engaging."

                "I would recommend! Material is really interesting, and the language project is a cool opportunity to apply what you've learned throughout the semester to the creation of a linguistic grammar. Just know what you're getting yourself into. You will be expected to learn to pronounce a large number of the world's consonants and vowels, including, but not limited to: unrounded back vowels, velaric ingressive consonants, pharyngeal fricatives, and bilabial approximants. You will also be expected to work with a speaker of a language you're unfamiliar with and spend several hours recording enough individual words and phrases to create a full inventory of the phonemes of the language. And you will be expected to painstakingly construct illustrative diagrams in Praat. Many times. Many, many times.",
                "Absolutely! Every linguistics major should take Phonetics I. So should anyone who's interested in accents, foreign languages, and even things like choral singing. Phonetics has a lot of applications and it was really cool to learn this material."
