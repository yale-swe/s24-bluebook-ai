                "Learned so much in writing, deviated from a certain type of \"high school\" writing that every student is taught. Developed own voice and tone in writing. Read amazing pieces of work, which helped me hone what I prefer my writing style to be.",
                "This course has irreversibly shifted my approach to the craft of writing. Over the last semester, I've learned that much of what I once held to be true of effective writing was wrong. The consensus pedagogical approach to writing serves to homogenize. This course has taught me to embrace personal observation -- being a Writer is a paradigm of thought. \r\n\r\nMuch the value of writing lies in the decisions made by the writer, down to the sentence-level. It's easy to masquerade pseudo-intellectual thoughts with a flourish of words. Not only does this detract from the content of our writing, but it makes it harder for a broader audience to understand the ideas, emotions, and sentiments we hope to communicate."

                "strengths: the instructor and your classmates make the course; weaknesses: maybe having two drafts could be helpful",
                "There were so many opportunities to improve your writing. I really liked that it was encouraged to try out new techniques and styles and you weren't penalized if you couldn't get it \"right\" the first time around. I enjoyed the prompts and liked that we could choose to not write one essay; this made the workload of the course much more manageable. The readings are also fantastic. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this course.",
                "Strengths: The readings (there is a lot of them but they are great!), the editing workshops, the guest speakers, Rachel's feedback and her enthusiasm for her craft.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much. The grading is a bit of a pain: If you write 5 essays instead of the required 4, you can't throw away the lowest grade you have. The readings are sometimes long, but I've had longer in other humanities classes.",
                "Strengths: good book (required reading) for understanding how to write, feedback is amazing, mini group discussion, prompts, idea of notebook for class\r\nWeaknesses: not much interaction with peers' work, some readings are a bit older and harder to be fully engaged",
                "This course was incredibly valuable under the guidance of Prof. Rachel Kauder Nalebuff. Her unique perspectives were immediately present in the course's prescribed readings. The course introduced a wide range of literary perspectives and approaches. The fundamental questions that motivate the course (i.e. \"What compels us to read what others have written?\") set the foundation for each student's approach. This course's strengths thus lie in what any given student opts to make of it. \r\n\r\nThe course's weaknesses lie in comparatively few opportunities to produce writing and receive comprehensive feedback on it, which is unfortunately somewhat inherent in the structure of the ENGL 120 class."

                "People at Yale will tell you that everybody should take 120 during their time at Yale, even my dean was adamant about getting me to register for the course. Well, they're all right. What you learn about writing in this course applies to every kind of writing you will ever do in your life. It is well worth your time and effort, in addition to just being such a fun class to take.",
                "YES! Take English 120, it's the best writing course Yale offers. If you can, take it with Rachel: She's thoughtful with her feedback and overall an awesome human being. She allows you to experiment and foster your own voice as a writer.",
                "Yes, this course changed my writing, my perception of writing, and really helped me develop and see what I want as a writer. I think Rachel is one of the best, if not the best, Engl 120 professor you can possibly have. Her feedback is amazing and really helps you improve so much. Additionally, the readings are enjoyable.",
                "Yes! Any student, regardless of their background or interests, would benefit from this course. Being able to appreciate contemporary modes of writing while investigating topics of personal relevance is incredibly valuable and engaging."
