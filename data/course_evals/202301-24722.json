Unfortunately, the disappointing presentation of that information sometimes made class tedious. If active engagement became the focus of the seminar as opposed to monotonous lecturing, I think my experience would have been much better."

The American circus is an incredibly fascinating but woefully misunderstood component of turn-of-the-20th-century cultural life, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about it in such detail and depth."
