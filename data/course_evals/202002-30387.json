    "A lot of grammatical tenses and some cultural aspects",
    "I developed my grammatical skills in Spanish as well as expanded on my ability to analyze literature in another language. The stories we read each highlighted a part of Hispanic culture and set up a well-rounded course.",
    "I learned a ton more about the nitty gritty gramatical nuances of Spanish. By the end of this class, you will know all of the major verb tenses \/ conjugations and be able to use them in conversation and writing. Furthermore, my speaking skills developed greatly over the course of this class.",
    "Some grammar skills.",
    "I improved my speaking and learned more grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I gained a greater knowledge of Spanish culture and language. I expanded my ability in Spanish language and grammar.",
    "I developed oral and written knowledge regarding Spanish language and culture.",
    "I learned many of the skills required to make the transition from an intermediate to high-intermediate level of spanish.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - a lot of conversations in spanish which helped strengthen speaking skill\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - course went very fast so not enough time to fully understand grammar making exams hard",
    "The strengths of this class were the ability to practice speaking Spanish on a daily basis in a non-judgmental environment and the availability of both professors to approach confusing topics in new ways. Because of the speed of this course, it was difficult to master each grammatical skill before having to move on to the next one. The workload was high both during and outside of class, but it was occasionally repetitive so the same practices and examples were used.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Tons of conversation practice: in partners and with PhD student. \r\n-Lots of class time combined with homework\/studying makes it feel pretty immersive. I was focused on Spanish for a large chunk of my day.\r\n-Time with professors and students was really enjoyable!\r\n\r\nSuggestions\r\n-Many of the SuperSite activities were very easy and didn't require an understanding of the grammar concept. It would be helpful if all of the activities on VHL tested understanding (some were unnecessary and could be replaced).\r\n-The tests placed a large emphasis on knowing when to use which tense (for example, fill in the blank with 4 possible tenses). This is an important skill to develop and it would be great to have more homework\/review that focused on it.\r\n-I really appreciated the additional review materials for Exam 2. It would have been helpful to have similar materials available throughout the course -- for example, optional review of difficult concepts, Exam 1 extra review, etc.",
    "I thought this course was very well taught and that the teachers were incredibly present. Both were incredibly open to setting up extra times to meet and always responded to email with questions quickly.\r\nOf course, I wish it was not virtual.",
    "You definitely learn grammar but not much else. It's weakness is that you learn absolutely no culture or history. If there is an attempt to teach culture it is often Spain centric or taught problematically.",
    "The class was organized very consistently, and the professors were very helpful in clarifying if one had a question.",
    "The professors were engaging with the course material and helped me learn abstract concepts.",
    "This course effectively highlighted the beauty of Spanish. Despite this being one of many Spanish courses I have taken, never have I possessed such an appreciation and adoration for the language as a whole. The structure of the course fueled my newfound obsession of honing my Spanish speaking, reading and writing skills; beyond the 2-hour sessions we attended every weekday, the course inspired me to adjust my entire lifestyle -- including engaging with Spanish media, Spanish films and Spanish news -- all in an attempt to maximize my exposure and increase my proficiency. I valued the 1-on-1 conversations with Nils, as he was very encouraging and motivated me to continue improving. This course managed to achieve something only the best courses can: it often made me forget that the work I was doing was for a grade. Obviously, this course was unique in that, given the circumstances, the usual trip to Spain had to be cancelled, but I believe that the professors did an excellent job with adapting. If I had to nitpick, I wish there were more than 2 hours of Office Hours every week; we covered a lot of material very fast, and I feel that a daily Office Hour slot would've bolstered the experience. Regardless, I'm so grateful for this summer experience.",
    "The Professors ensured the class was engaging and they provided lots of support. Because it was online, technical difficulties were occasionally encountered.",
    "It was great that all the work that was to be assigned was already planned out and given to us in a schedule at the beginning of the course. Interaction was required and I learned a lot as a result. Although the class is daily, I understand that it's required to become fluent in spanish.",
    "awesome course"

    "If you have to for the language requirement",

    "I think this is the perfect course for a student looking to advance their Spanish abilities before going into an L5 class - it helps cement a foundation of basic grammar and learn a range of new concepts. Definitely increases confidence in spoken\/written Spanish.",
    "Yes, definitely. I think any student who is deeply dedicated to improving their Spanish abilities should definitely take this course.",
    "No I would not. I think the Spanish department needs to do a lot of revision to the curriculum and choose a better, more inclusive textbook.",
    "Yes--this class allows you to improve your speaking and grammar.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student that would like to increase their ability in Spanish in a formal setting.",
    "I would recommend this course; it was a dense five weeks but I truly feel I learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely. This course begins to introduce you to how you can sound like a native spanish speaker and not just someone that has taken some courses. I thoroughly enjoyed my learning experience despite the daily workload.",
