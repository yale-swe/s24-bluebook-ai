                "I learned a lot about the gender, sexuality, and racial implications and themes behind East Asian martial arts cinema. Particularly in the Japanese, Chinese, Hong Kong, and Korean scenes, we definitely covered a lot of ground.",
                "This course is mainly concerned with genre studies, specifically applying that to Martial Arts films. While it is labeled \"East Asian Martial Arts,\" the course stretches into American film as well later in the semester. The course also gives a nice introduction to film and genre studies for those who haven't had experience with it before.",
                "I gained an understanding of formal film analysis, film history, and the history and semantics behind martial arts in East Asia.",
                "This class provided an overview and exploration of the East Asian Martial Arts Film genre. Beginning with films as early as the 1920s, the class (mostly) explored the genres development chronologically and thematically up to the present day. The majority of the films we watched were Chinese-language films (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taiwan) and Japanese films, but there were also some Korean and American films (Kung Fu Panda) that we studied.",
                "I learned about the cinematic history of East Asian martial arts films, from wuxia films in Hong Kong and jidaigeki/samurai films in Japan, to kung fu films in the 1960s/1970s (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, etc.), to even movies inspired by East Asian martial arts cinema like Kung Fu Panda and Kill Bill. I also learned about some of the political and social contexts under which many of these films were produced, and what these films have come to represent about their respective nations/territories.",
                "We learned about film analysis (looking at editing, cinematography), how to think about and define the martial arts genre (and its history), and towards the end of the semester how things like animation and postmodernism can change and shape the genre."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Loved the professor, Aaron Gerow is truly an icon and is one of the most engaging lecturers I know. He's awesome, and for the most part, his readings and analysis of the films we viewed were also great. Weaknesses: The screenings felt a little inconvenient at times. Also, the papers were a lot more time-intensive than expected. Also wish we watched less older, historical films like jidaigeki or footage that felt less engaging.",
                "The course does provide a decent range of films from Japan, China, and later from America, but the Korean film feels like an after thought halfway through the semester. It also felt like engagement in the course declined rapidly as the semester went on, and this could be in part due to the sometimes excessive amounts of reading, and in part due to the quality of lectures. While it's a film class, we were also expected to read two novels in their entirety while also committing several hours a week to watching films on top of other often dense readings. The books just feel unnecessary since you can easily grasp the cross-media influences of the genre without reading two entire novels. The lecture format of the class also is really unfortunate since the course content feels fairly subjective at times and would be better approached in a seminar-style class. There is a weekly section, but it didn't feel super substantial and meaningful in any way. Finally, it also seemed like a lot of people were not satisfied with the way the essays were graded, and some of the TF's comments felt really out of left field, especially some insubstantial nit-picky comments on word choice.",
                "I really enjoyed how the discussion sections and lectures were structured, where both allowed a good combination of \"lecturing learning\" and \"discussion learning\". I enjoyed all of the movies we watched in class but by the end of the class, it was difficult to remember all of them come time for the final paper. It might be nice to have one class at the end of the semester that just reviews all of the films seen throughout the course!",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the content of the classI think there was a good balance of watching film, analyzing it, and broader theory about film and genre studies. The movies themselves were great, and the Tuesday night screening was always a nice way to enjoy a movie on the big screen and set the world aside for a moment. The teaching staff was also greatboth the professor and the TAs were all extremely knowledgeable about the subject. Weaknesses: Nothing glaring. There were times that wed watch a movie on Tuesday or over the weekend and then do an analysis in class that didnt spend much time on the actual film itself.",
                "I really liked the film screenings for this class, and the ways that we would review clips from these films during lectures and discussion sections. I also felt like everyone was excited about what we were learning in class, which made for very fun discussions, including which of two martial artists would win in a battle. One weakness of the course was that the organization of the syllabus was sometimes confusing. I also wish we explored more East Asian films outside of Hong Kong and Japan. At least with the latter, I wish we didn't mainly focus on jidaigeki films.",
                "Strengths: watched a lot of amazing films throughout the semester; Professor Gerow's lectures are really engaging and pose for us a lot of interesting questions to think about\r\nWeaknesses: as someone without previous experience with film analysis, the two papers felt challenging and very time-consuming. However, I still really enjoyed the class"

                "Yes!! Especially if you're into a more beginner's film course or want a lecture with a cool, funny professor, this is it! Also had the greatest time with my TF (although I have heard it's majorly hit or miss). But I had a chill experience, and as someone who just wanted a cinema course that they would enjoy, I think this was it.",
                "this class looks like a chill time, and the papers are chill. i just looked at it as a close reading but of a movie. and instead of say, em-dashes or spacing as something to support your arguments, the way the camera moved or the editing. that mindset really helped in the like two papers. \r\n\r\nBut aside from that, the class takes up A LOT of hours. it'd have us watching anywhere from 3-6 hours of film per week alongside full novels, and a mixed bag of readings that were usually around 30-40 pages. Most times I'd have days were I'd just catch up on movies and watch them at 1.25x speed. \r\n\r\nthe novels were interesting, but it was still a lot. it's also a lecture, which inherently signals to most students that it's not going to be taken as seriously. and that attitude definitely showed from students with attendance, and I eventually followed suit in November. But Gerow seems to expect the same level of dedication and priority from students that a seminar does. So there's a bit of a disconnect there. \r\n\r\nBut through the class I was able to learn a good bit about East Asian history and films that I had never seen before. I also have a new perspective on the genre and film as a whole. I don't regret taking this class at all, I learned a lot. I also had this, alongside ART 114, as my 4th & 5th credits this semester. But I would definitely warn someone who is looking at this course for a 6th credit to not take this course. It eats up a lot of time. But as a fourth credit, sure. and if it's you have four low time investment classes, this is a fine 5th credit.",
                "I would not ever recommend this course, to be honest. It sounds like fun to get to watch and discuss movies and martial arts for class, but the only thing I found interesting at all in the course was maybe the first hand-full of lecture (after that it felt like nothing new really came up), and then the final paper, which was significantly more open-ended, and actually gives you significant opportunity to discuss what you want to. Other than that, most of the reading is okay at best, the professor is okay at best, and section isn't substantial enough to feel like you really get to discuss anything from class.",
                "Yes! I had only taken very general film classes before this one, and it was super fun to dive deeper into what I thought was a \"niche\" subject to discover how much complexity it has.",
                "Yes, it's a fun class with a very passionate and well spoken professor! East Asian martial arts film seems like a super niche topic (which it is, admittedly) but this course uses those films as a venue to discuss much broader issues like identity, gender, national history, etc. And the workload (readings, bi-weekly quizzes, papers) aren't that bad!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class! I took it with my roommate on a whim because I thought a martial arts film class seemed fun, and it ended up being on the most interesting and rewarding classes Ive taken here. The movies are fun to watch (you get to watch Bruce Lee for class credit) and give you a good sense of the genre, the analysis is interesting and far-reaching, and the workload is very reasonable (usually two movies and two readings per week, one of which is a weekly Tuesday screening). My major has nothing to do with film or East Asian Studies and it was still one of the best classes Ive taken here.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in martial arts or martial arts film. Even though my interests weren't exactly aligned with the films we watched in class, I still found myself having a lot of fun.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great class to take even if you have no previous experience with film analysis. I gained new appreciation for film and got to watch and learn about so many great martial arts films throughout the semester.",
                "Overall, this course offers a great opportunity to explore this film genre while also getting to watch a wide range of films and learn more about East Asian history. In this aspect, it is wonderful. If you are not a film major, it can be a bit difficult at times to get clear instruction on what is expected of you on the different papers. The example papers offered are professional film critics' writings and at times the TFs offered conflicting instructions. But Prof Gerow is very responsive via both email and office hours so with any major confusion, so it is definitely worth using either of those methods to address confusion."
