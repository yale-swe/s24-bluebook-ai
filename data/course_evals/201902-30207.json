    "By taking this fast-paced, highly intensive course, I was able to improve my reading and oral skills by eons. I feel this course truly prepared me for communication (mostly spoken) with French natives.",
    "Solidified old French grammar rules and learned new ones; improved my writing and oral ability",

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely adored the books we read for class and felt they all had interesting messages to deliver. The quizzes could have been dialed back a bit and.",
    "Strengths: Very high workload, but the consistency of assignments (test structure and written essays) was helpful in improving oral and written skills\r\nWeaknesses: Constantly having to prepare for the major assignments made it difficult to be prepared for the smaller pop quizzes which tested info we learned just the night before",
    "Sometimes it felt a bit disorganized - as if the course had been taught so many times before that it hadn't grown\/changed\/adapted at all. Some of the files, assignments, etc were outdated. It also wasn't always clear what homework we had to do - the professors, during class, would assign additional pages during class, then either forget about them, or be unclear about them and upset when students didn't complete them.",
    "The books and programming are really out of date, and the course was somewhat unorganized. It once took 3.5 weeks to get a one page essay back. However, this course did a good job of immersing us in the language."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; you get out of the course what you put into it. If you put you all into learning and soaking in new information each and every day, you are sure to walk away with a heightened understanding of French in all its forms: spoken, written, and auditory.",
    "Yes, but only if they are dedicated to improving their French - don't do it if your only looking to fulfill the language requirment",
    "Anybody who's willing to put work in and who's passionate about learning French should take it."
