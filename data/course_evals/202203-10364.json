            "comments": [
                "Engaging lectures, but not super well-organized. I feel like the syllabus and readings were a little misleading as they would often not reflect what was discussed during lecture.",
                "very strong lectures with good textbook choices except for the Herring textbook, not a fan.",
                "This was a great lecture class.",
                "strength: learned a lot Weakness: just a summary of US history not much analysis",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of content in a relatively systematic way. Primary-source research project definitely improved my ability to analyze historical texts.  Lectures are engaging, content-rich, and easy to follow, and aggressively categorize, contextualize, and thematize(?) course content in a highly useful and accessible fashion. An impressively complete and manageable introduction to a large, controversial, and staggeringly complex area of history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Little time spent on the skill of historical analysis itself; students were rarely challenged to create their own historical narratives or critically engage with those presented in lecture, with the important exception of the primary-source research project. Most of lecture time was spent covering material which could be found  though more dryly and with less clear themes, context, and connections  in the secondary textbooks. Similarly, much of discussion-section time was spent simply linking assigned readings to the lectures, instead of historicizing the readings and engaging with their arguments using close-reading or other analytical techniques.\r\nOne last weakness, though I worry I'm making it sound like I liked this class less than I did: Very little coverage of U.S. wars against Native Americans, even in the \"westward expansion\" unit, which seemed well-suited for it.",
                "It is interesting content and the lectures were pretty good. But it's just such a broad class and ends up covering all of US history it seems like (not just foreign policy) -- this makes sense since the domestic and foreign are so intertwined, but I think a bit of focus could help it.",
                "Very easy to follow syllabus; lacked much analysis and depth. Lectures should be more provocative and reading assignments should be more intentional.",
                "Weakness: monotonous and felt like an exercise in memorization\r\n\r\nStrength: covered a very comprehensive history of the US.",
                "The strength of this course is the lecture. The weakness is the section -- there is too much reading for each week so discussion is not very focused.",
                "The course could have used more engagement with the primary sources in lecture, perhaps, rather than only historical context in class time. I felt the Herring could have covered that background, mostly.",
                "Strengths: Interesting discussion section that greatly supplemented the basics of the lectures; it was made very clear what themes/identification would be tested on the midterm/final exam; great lecturer; lectures are greatly organized by theme, to the point that I could guess what the essay questions on exams would be\r\nWeaknesses: The slides didn't have enough information and at times, I couldn't really gauge what to take notes on; the paper assignment was assigned really early on, and I wish it was during the second half of the course so we could have a bigger variety of topics to choose from.",
                "I think the strengths of this course include emphasis on specific dates and exemplifying change and continuity of American history over time. However, I do think that there could have been more emphasis placed on this. I also would have liked to have covered individual topics in more depth; for the most part, we mentioned various historical events briefly and in a surface-level context  it would have been more beneficial to speak about at least a few events for longed than we did. Additionally, the course readings were quite heavy, yet barely touched upon during lecture or in section; perhaps doing so may have enriched class discussions.",
                "A strength of this course is that Prof. Engerman is a very good lecturer. He clearly put a lot of work into his lectures: he is charismatic, covered a lot of ground without the lectures feeling too dense, and included great contemporaneous quotes from players in the different events he discussed. I always felt engaged in class.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course is that provides an interesting/unique take on American history. It analyzes it through the lens of foreign policy, which means that it differed considerably from the American history class I took in high school. One example: The class looks at the American civil rights movement through a Cold War lens, which I found very interesting.\r\n\r\nYet another strength of this course can also be seen as a weakness. I enjoyed that we covered a huge swath of American history, from before the founding to the present day. However, the broad scope of the class also reduced our ability to focus on certain periods. I felt at times like we were 'speedrunning' a concept, like Reagan-era interventions that were part of the Second Cold War. That said, overall, I thought Prof. Engerman did a good job navigating these tradeoffs, and we were able to devote large chunks of time of the Vietnam War, both world wars, the war on terror, and late 19th/early 20th century U.S. imperialism.",
                "I think it would have been really helpful if the lectures were recorded, so students could go back and review the material if needed.",
                "I like how it was able to weave common themes throughout the differences in history, although something about the course felt a little repetitive at times.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were really well written and interesting. I thought the paper assignment was valuable. The readings always felt relevant to what we were learning. Section was great. Weaknesses: Maybe I'm just not used to reading for history classes, but I rarely managed to finish all of the week's reading (may have been helpful to spend some time in class on how to read for history classes). For the paper, I feel like we could have gotten a bit more guidance. Navigating the archives was hard and discouraging at times, and I really struggled to figure out how to make an original argument.",
                "Strengths: Good lectures, interesting textbook\r\nWeaknesses: Slides could use some work. Hard to review.",
                "The lectures (especially at the beginning) definitely dragged a bit and the readings were sometimes a little pointless. But the later lectures were often super interesting and left me feeling excited about the material!!",
                "The slides could have been a bit more thorough and the readings less dense",
                "lecture was at times hard to engage with\r\ndiscussions in section were vibrant, well-facilitated, and enjoyable",
                "This course is a fairly easy overview of American history. I rarely say this, but I think this class should either be more difficult or they should narrow the timeframe they are working with. The class feels too broad with not enough depth.",
                "Interesting course, however high content",
                "Strengths: well-paced, clear assignments, clear due dates, clear expectations, interesting and course-applicable readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This class provides a good overview of US foreign policy while still providing the level of detail necessary to understand the events.",
                "I believe the course was very strong towards the end, but it felt like it took a little bit too long to get there.",
                "The lecture presentation slides were not great, and I think they can be more uniform.",
                "I think this course was interesting, and I enjoyed it. The course provides a broad overview of U.S. history and its impact internationally.",
                "The discussion sections felt a bit unnecessary, and some of the slides could have used a bit more verbiage so that reviewing them would have been more fruitful in preparation for exams and essays.",
                "Strengths: Readings of primary sources were interesting and the strategies and debates regarding American foreign policy since its founding are still relevant today \r\n\r\nWeakness: Lecture could be boring as it is an info dump",
                "Strength: Dante was incredible, Engerman was pretty engaging\r\nWeakness: Reading was a lot and largely a waste of time",
                "Strengths: fascinating content, low workload, only three class assignments throughout the year\r\nWeaknesses: requires section, which (perennially) requires advanced discussion of politics with much more knowledgeable students",
                "Prof. is wonderful and very knowledgeable. I think there could be more communication as to what to expect with major assignments and how those assignments will be graded.",
                "Strengths: sometimes the lectures would be interesting!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDespite doing all of the reading for this course, I found there was slim to no overlap between the readings, lectures, and discussion section. If I could take this course again, I would burn the textbooks so I could at least harness the warmth of those pages, instead of filling my mind with mediocre primary sources that were never discussed in class. In fact, the readings may have even been counterproductive to my grade.",
                "Good scope but as a result lacks depths. A very US central understanding of history.",
                "Strengths - lectures are well structured and to the point\r\nWeaknesses - readings are, honestly, super boring. If there was a way to insert a more modern reading here and there, like perhaps an article, that would be nice.",
                "The exams and the workload were good. Weaknesses - at times the lectures felt overly reductive and vague",
                "I wish there had been a tighter time period focus, and more of a specific foreign policy focus as well, because at times it felt like more of a general overview of all of US history.",
                "It was pretty easy  I think deviating from the standard APUSH curriculum could help.",
                "course material (final, midterm, lectures) largely divorced from the reading which tended to redeincentive doing it-- would have been good to bring it in more since we were assigned so much of it \r\n\r\nstrengths-- i feel like a much more competent American citizen after taking this course!",
                "weak first half- felt like APUSH but taught in a more haphazard way. Second half was much stronger with more cohesive themes.",
                "I think this course provides a general overview about US foreign relations, but doesn't go into many specifics because of the wide expanse of time that it covers. I also think that the exams were a bit difficult to prepare for; in the future, it would be helpful to receive certain study guides regarding the IDs that would show up.",
                "-course was well-organized\r\n-course was wide-ranging\r\n-course allowed us to go into the archives and do our own research",
                "Maybe add another essay or project to engage with the material",
                "The course was very broad and comprehensive, but further time spent on certain specific events would have added to the course.",
                "This course required minimal engagement. I also had a hard time relating the readings to the course until the discussion section.",
                "The discussion sections felt more like reading checks (which makes sense) than deliberate additions to topics covered in class. The fluctuations in week to week reading loads also made it hard to keep up for specific weeks, which resulted in even less productive sections. Given the nature of the slides, which rely heavily on the explanations of the professor instead of text, recordings would be helpful. I had notes for the vast majority of classes, and found myself still struggling frequently to go back and review the slides effectively.",
                "I found the lectures in this course to be underwhelming. The scope of the class means that the lectures just provide a broad overview of each period, so I didn't actually find myself learning that much new given that I've studied U.S. history before. The readings were quite good, however, particularly the secondary source, which provided an excellent overview of U.S. foreign relations. I really enjoyed the assignment where we had to go to the archives because it gave me a reason to explore Yale's collections for the first time.",
                "It moved extremely fast and covered a lot of content. I think it could have covered a shorter time frame rather than trying to cover all of US history."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to those who have limited knowledge of US foreign affairs. This course provided a very clear chronology of events with important implications for both foreign and domestic affairs.",
                "Yes, I think it gives good insight to anyone, especially people who grew up in America about what the country's position in global politics is.",
                "This is a great foundational class for anyone interested in learning more about US foreign policy and the evolution of the US as a player on the world stage.",
                "good class if you are interested in US history, covers a lot of material, readings are manageable.",
                "Yes, if you want to develop basic literacy in America's 20th-century foreign policy  all the major wars, doctrines, and alliances are well accounted for.\r\nNo, if you're really into the \"Origins of\" part of the course name  the underlying factors enabling America's rise to economic, military, and political preeminence in the 20th century are certainly named, but not deeply explored or extensively debated.",
                "Yes, if you want a basic intro to American history/foreign policy history or as a fifth class",
                "Yes! Take this if you are interested foreign policy. It is a great survey course!",
                "If you have taken AP US History, this course will likely be a repeat of much material that you have already seen do with that what you will. The lectures are easy to follow and the material itself is interesting and important, but the course as a whole lacks opportunity for analysis and adds little to your understanding of the US as a global power.",
                "Yes, if you are okay with having to memorize before exams.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a relatively low-workload and interesting course on the shape of U.S. foreign policy from 1776 to 2016. Wonderful course with a talented professor, and very fair assignments. Exams test exactly what you learn in coursethere shouldn't be any surprises.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have never taken US history. Otherwise it is a bit repetitive and you do not get a lot of depth on any one subject.",
                "It wasn't my favorite - I think I could have gotten more out of another class, probably.",
                "Yes! Especially a student interested in the History major.",
                "Yes. The class deeply enriched my understanding of Americas historical interactions with the world, which provided me with greater insight into US foreign policy today. Additionally, the lectures themselves were very enjoyable  I enjoyed how Professor Engerman steered clear of relying too heavily on notes, which made lectures much more engaging.",
                "Yes, good history to know and it doesnt punish you for being inexperienced with US history",
                "Yes! It provides an engaging and unique take on American history and has a very reasonable workload. If youre already familiar with U.S. history, some of the content wont be that new to you, but I still thought this class was great.",
                "Yes, I found the course material interesting",
                "If you're interested in U.S. foreign policy and can handle 100+ pages of reading per week, yes. The class feels a bit like APUSH. There's a lot of information, but there are themes that Professor Engerman carries through the class. You also go into the archives for a paper, which can be frustrating at times, but ultimately is valuable experience. A lot of the events studied involve mass death, so just be prepared for that.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. I feel it is a good course to take, especially if you plan to live in the U.S. Just teaches you a lot of good history about the country in an approachable manner.",
                "Sure! If you are interested in seeing American History through a slightly new angle, go for it!!",
                "Yes even as a credit/d, the content was very interesting and engaging",
                "Yes, while this course may be too basic for history buffs, I enjoyed studying large historical events through the lens of US global power as well as learning about new topics and recurring themes\r\n\r\nmanageable but engaging course and great sections",
                "Yes, if you want a more solid base in US history and US foreign policy",
                "This course is good for students who like American history and want a refresher on the general main events.",
                "Yes! It is similar to what we cover in a US History class but has a very strong focus on foreign policy and affairs. If that is of interest to you, then I strongly recommend this class! Low workload as well, so a good 5th class for a 5 credit semester.",
                "Yes it teaches new skills and is a good humanities credit.",
                "Yes, especially to an American Studies, global affairs, or History student. The course offers an interesting and foundational understanding of the United States role in foreign affairs.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning about American foreign policy or history, this is a great class.",
                "If you are interested in the history of US foreign policy this is a good class to take.",
                "Yes, it is a good foundation for US history. While not super nuanced, it covers a lot of ground like a high school US history course would do but asks more of you in sections or with the paper writing piece of class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If they have an interest in U.S. history, government, and foreign policy.",
                "Yes, if you need a non-intensive writing credit!",
                "Yes, this class ties well with any other history classes from the 18th-20th century",
                "Yes, its a pretty interesting class to have, not a lot of work",
                "Highly recommended. I am a senior major in a heavy quantitative major, and this was my first history class at Yale. Lectures felt like a storybook as Professor Engerman went through each chapter of US history in sufficient detail to be interesting and well contextualized in the grand scheme of history. I especially appreciated that we covered content until the Obama admin in Iraq in 2011; my high-school APUSH class only went to the end of WWII before giving up on rigorous content. I enjoyed seeing how modern politics are a continuation of many policies and governmental predispositions of the past.",
                "I would. It is a good American history course that isnt tailored specifically for history majors.",
                "If a student wants an easy course where they will encounter limited new knowledge, sure why not.",
                "Yes, good for anyone looking to quickly improve their understanding of history.",
                "Sure, if it helps with a history or AMST credit. It's not a bad course, but also not particularly groundbreaking -- think APUSH, with a foreign policy bend. If you're into that, then take it!",
                "Yes - if you want an easy history level and a basic survey of American history.",
                "Yes 100%. Professor Engerman is a great lecturer and ordinary materials about US history in a new and engaging view.",
                "Yes, but only because of my TF Jacob who was incredible.",
                "I would if they were a STEM major or didnt have a strong background in US history.",
                "Yes",
                "i would! for any major. i found it stimulating and interesting and not overbearing",
                "Take this course if you're interested in American history and have limited experience in it. It covers a lot of the information you will find in most US history classes in highschool. Otherwise, if you know American history then lecture is basically optional.",
                "Yes, if you are into US history, or even if not, this is a good class. If you have taken a variety of American history classes, it may be redudant. However, if you are looking to take a broad US history class, this is a great option.",
                "Yes a great overview, not going to go in-depth but a lot of good info",
                "I would recommend this course to a first-year or second-year student looking to get into U.S. history courses at Yale.",
                "Yes, I would. The class was very insightful and interesting, even for someone not in a humanities major.",
                "Yes, this was a fantastic survey course. Very similar to AP US History.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student while cautioning that it is exactly what it says on the tin. If someone wanted to know more about US history, foreign policy, or maybe race in the US, I would say this class is a solid fit. For someone less predisposed to those subjects, the course would probably end up being a slog.",
                "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to someone who's already pretty familiar with the history of U.S. foreign relations because the course rarely goes in-depth enough to teach you that much new. But, if you've never studied U.S. foreign relations before, or just want the chance to write and discuss it in a formal academic setting, then it might be worth taking.",
                "Yes although I think a strong base knowledge of US history would really help."
