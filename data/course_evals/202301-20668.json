Also spectral theorem for self-adjoint, compact linear operators on a real, separable Hilbert space. Some other stuff sprinkled in.\r\n\r\nFourier series",
                "The major concepts in functional analysis, along with some linear algebra review as it generalized to infinite dimensions. Started with isometries and linear operators, proof of spectral theorem in finite dimensions (a very intuitive one using compactness that would later generalize sometimes to infinite dimensions), compactness and continuity, polar decomposition and conceptualizing the unit ball in relation to the norm and how its impacted by continuous linear operators. Moved to study l^p, L^p, C function classes, arzela ascoli, Banach spaces, linear operators and adjoints, some spectral theory in infinite dimensions. Then Hilbert spaces, projection theorem and conceptualizing functions as hyperplanes defining their level sets leading to representation theorem. Then proving fundamental Fourier analysis results, like density of trig polynomials and thinking about uniform convergence and Dini criterion and isometric isomorphism from separable Hilbert spaces into l2. Then a little foray into ergodic theory. Then using dual spaces of Banach spaces to generalize some things specific to Hilbert spaces, and derive more properties. This led us into weak convergence, weak boundedness, Baire category, open mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, principle of uniform boundedness. We then had tools to characterize precompact sets and weak convergence in most l^p and L^p spaces, making analogs to Arzela ascoli. Finally looked at compact operators and proved a generalization of spectral theory to infinite dimensions for compact symmetric operators, with the similar proof outline as beginning of year but replacing compactness with weak compactness that holds in infinite dimensions. We also did some forays into Sobolev spaces and PDEs.\r\n\r\nOverall most importantly Schlag teaches you how to think about math. I never appreciated it the same until I took this class, now everything kind of fits with a certain geometric intuition. If you want to understand math, take classes with Schlag.",

                "Stregths + Weakness depends on perspective:  \r\n1) Schlag , in my opinion, is the best math professor I have had at yale ( beside Charles Smart), however his teaching style is not for everyone. He will often just talk through proofs, or maybe say some things are obvious, so you will have to fill in the gaps, in your notes( unless you are an auditory learner) \r\n2) Problem sets- The problem sets are great but very very challenging. The grader for the course was great, he offered feedback if you got something wrong without killing your grade",

It took over most aspects of my life this semester, but I loved it, so I don't regret it at all. This class helped me find inner peace. Professor Schlag is the best. His lectures are *electric*. He strolls into each class with nothing but some coffee, chalk, and his massive brain. His lectures are like watching a true mathematician at work discovering interesting theorems and proofs. Furthermore, his office hours are wonderful as he makes sure each student has their confusions worked out.",

There is really not one single textbook for this course, Schlag seems to come up with proofs as he lectures and often just talks through them while not writing the proof in full detail, so if you are someone who needs to take good notes and then look over them to understand the material, then this class might be overwhelming.",
                "Yes 100% Schlag is a fantastic lecturer and the problem sets and exams are very manageable",

                "Yes, this class filled in gaps in my understanding from previous courses, and it taught me some new ways to approach problems. The material is very interesting and feels extremely well motivated.",
                "Absolutely. You will learn so much if Prof. Schlag is teaching.",
