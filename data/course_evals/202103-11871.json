The material is also spread out too thinly in my opinion. I feel like I wanted more guidance on the example problems rather than just listing random problems and going through them. I felt that there was little to no overall direction.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to improve it, but I really felt that the structure of the class was designed to \"technically\" touch on all topics and concepts but never really help anybody learn it from the ground up."
