The ability to read long essays about film.\r\n4. The ability to appreciate different types of film, such as abstract \/ avant garde film, animated film, arthouse films.\r\n5. The ability to debate with my peers about films we've watched and essays we've read.",
                "Writing, and analysis of film through a multitude of lenses. Also learned a lot about film history, and how to parse dense philosophical texts relating to film.",
                "I have always loved movies, but this course finally gave me some tools to understand and explain them outside the context of film alone. It also helped me develop an inquisitiveness for the methodology of film. While the effect of a technique in a movie may be clear, the technique itself is often more difficult to discover and communicate. Further, before the course, I had rarely considered film's interactions with other mediums; now, I can't help but search for them. In fact, the course's broad essay format encourages a hunt for interactions between a plethora of different art mediums.",
                "Lots of how to close watch movies, very fun.",
                "This course has showed me all the ways that art forms evolve and interact with each other. I find that I now have a greater appreciation for art because I see all the ways in which artists draw inspiration from each other and then use their ingenuity to develop the field.",
                "I got a sense of how to analyze film as an art form in its component pieces; you get to think about the visual side of film and how it uses motion, but also how it is written and performed separately.  But moreover I got to understand the history of how film was perceived as an art form and the arguments that evolved as film evolved.  Beyond the actual content of the course, I got clear feedback on my writing and where I could improve in styling, argumentations, and more.  Reading the comments of each essay I wrote for the course was very useful feedback."

                "I think that the material that was given was good because I learned a lot. I think the timing between the essay should have been better. I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I have to do at the end of the term while at the beginning we did not have any essays. I also think that compared to other first-year seminars we had a lot of work.",
                "Professor Tadas was incredibly knowledgable about the subject, and the curriculum was put together very masterfully. There was a large diversity of film and other arts that we had to analyze, and I learned a lot from this class that I could not have learned from other classes.\r\n\r\nI also grew close to the students in the class, as we spent six hours together every week.\r\n\r\nTwo of three of our biggest essays were due in the last two weeks of class, the most stressful time because of finals. I wish that our essays were spread out  more across the semester.",
                "The relation to the texts that needs to be gleaned in class every day is super interesting, and keeps the class engaging. Maybe two classes a week, and the need to watch a film before each class would be a better format, however.",
                "The course is exceptionally good at exploring periods and styles of films in a cohesive manner. The readings are always clear in their relation to the film screenings and the discussions are usually engaging. For someone who isn't interested in film or perhaps broadening their interest within film, the course may be excruciating. While many screenings are fun, some are, for lack of a better term, quite exploratory. In fact, some pieces have the express purpose of being painful or boring to the viewer. I think the course was quite good in its content, but would benefit from a change in scheduling. A Thursday night screening coupled with a Friday morning discussion over material that many will probably read the night before encourages less-than-ideal hours of sleep, which only decreases the quality of the discussions.",
                "I think the seminar was sometimes too long to get through while fully engaged, so maybe shorten it a bit.",
                "I generally think the formatting of the course works to its advantage.  Its nice to have a screening followed by a discussion the next day and the whole week to prepare for them by doing the readings and watching whatever other films we have assigned.  Moreover, the in person screenings make sure that I paid attention to the principal films we would be talking about in class; I think sometimes, depending on the film, watching it on your own makes it difficult to concentrate.  I also liked the pieces we read for the most part; they usually were very interesting and provided good context for what we were going to watch in class.  It was also nice that not every discussion section revolved around the readings; sometimes, the content of the films we watched would take precedence and the readings would only get mentioned as they were brought up by students in discussion.  I think the major weaknesses of the course tended to revolve around when the readings were the focus.  I wish sometimes there were more explicit instructions on what to focus on in the readings; sometimes, a single paragraph in a fourteen page paper would be what we discussed for half the class and I'd be frustrated that it might have been overlooked in my notes by all the other content of the essay.  Overall though, I think beyond that the course was very well done."

However, it was a lot of work for a first-year seminar and the time of the class isn't the best (Thursday nights and Friday mornings). The films were also boring, so if the student likes to watch only entertaining films, I would not recommend them.",
                "Yes. I'd definitely recommend this class.",
                "Absolutely. It taught me both an incredible amount of film, but also comparative literature in general, and how to apply comparison in my writing.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone who likes movies, and would like to know a bit more about why, while also exploring what film means in the context of other arts. The language in the readings can get very technical, and the arguments a bit abstract, but they all help achieve the course's stated goals.",
                "Yes, good intro\/taste of film",
                "I would recommend this course because it exposed me to many films and other art forms that I was not previously aware of. I also learned much about the history of film that gives valuable context to everything I watch now. I am very appreciative that I can enjoy art with a much more informed perspective now.",
                "Absolutely! It is a super fun writing credit and just an interesting entry into film analysis in general; it definitely got me interested in taking more film and media studies courses in the future.  Even if you don't have much interest in film, I think the subject matter is really engaging and that its very well taught.  Highly recommend."
