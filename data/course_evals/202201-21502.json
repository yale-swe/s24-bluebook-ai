                "I loved this course into intro fiction. I learned how to analyze fiction for craft and to apply it to my own writing. I learned the importance of constructive feedback, both receiving it and giving it, and thought that the class did a good job exposing us to the story drafting process and what it actually takes to fully form a final product. Choi made fiction-writing really approachable and was incredibly kind and understanding. The syllabus was AMAZING. Some of the pieces we read have become my all time favorites.",
                "Weekly writing exercises were helpful in setting structure and feedback on all of them helped me think about my writing style and what parts of it I wanted to focus on improving the most.",
                "Techniques for short story writing",
                "I developed skills for identifying in my own writing and in other writing sources of tension and conflict, which are the secret sauce that (usually) are responsible for making a story work. Learning Professor Choi's approach to fiction was very helpful given her experience and adept skill. I also honed my reading skills, going beyond reading for pleasure but also for analysis and evaluation of *why* certain parts of a story are so effective, and further discussing *how* an author came to their approach. Professor Choi's feedback was invaluable. What I appreciated most was how she treated her students as her peers, and their writing as if it were being produced for publication (Which, by the end of the course, many students felt encouraged to pursue)! It's a very affirming course for one's self-discipline with regards to writing and revision AND for one to see oneself as \"a writer.\" I came away from the course much more confident and much more satisfied with my relationship to my fiction writing. The peer-to-peer workshop  groups were also a major credit to the course's success and fluidity. I absolutely loved getting to read my peer's work and seeing the different ways they were engaging with the course.",

                "The strength is definitely the frequent writing exercises all students have to do, but I felt that I did not get as much out of discussing the stories in class as I anticipated. I wish that we had more of a chance for peer review/feedback as that was very helpful.",
                "I loved writing weekly assignments based on prompts with the goal of honing particular techniques. I do wish the structure of the course had given us more opportunities to attempt longer short stories, and more time to come up with ideas for the final story draft.",

I absolutely loved getting to read my peer's work and seeing the different ways they were engaging with the course.\r\n\r\nMy only feedback for improvement would be if perhaps Professor Choi could create a centralized, regular way for students to reach out to her for office hours. Something to break down the barrier of approach. Sometimes it takes a lot for a student to email and ask for their professor's time, even as a senior. Another course I took with a heavy workshop format had a requirement where if you presented that week, you *had* to meet with the professor that week. And at the same time, the professor emailed us with their specific hours of availability and always encouraged everyone to sign up.",
                "strengths - all the short stories on the syllabus were amazing! definitely introduced to so many great authors. \r\nweaknesses - wanted Professor Choi to offer more specific, critical feedback about style and form, rather than suggestions for elaboration of content, but perhaps this class is about generating material above all"
