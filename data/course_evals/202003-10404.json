                "None",
                "Strengths: Encourages students to stay ahead of the senior essay schedule",
                "Fabian is very helpful, so I would definitely count him as a strength. He was flexible but kept me on track to meet the deadlines, and he gave good advice.\r\n\r\nHonestly, while I understand the need for deadlines, I didn't find the assignments very helpful for actually propelling me forward in my thesis planning. I hear from a lot of History students, this year and past years, that they can get through the fall semester without doing much work at all on their thesis, and I definitely found that to be true for me as well. I wrote the several short papers, I met the deadlines, but I would have found a different structure more helpful. Perhaps future students could instead have weekly deadlines for which they have to read, say, 1 book and 1 article and write summaries of them for every Sunday at midnight. Papers like the prospectus and annotated bibliography didn't force me to do any considerable reading\/research, but if I had been forced to do assignments all semester like the ones I just described, I would be so much farther along in my thesis process. I have to hold myself accountable too, of course...I could\/should be farther than I am. I just think a different structure could benefit a lot of students like me (and I think there are many, from what I've gathered) who feel overwhelmed by such a huge project and struggle to hold themselves accountable. I think the idea is that we are seniors and should be able to handle this project mostly on our own. But the reality is that we are burnt out, just trying to finish college, and the thesis is so daunting. We are not too old to have some structure imposed on us.\r\n\r\nIf the existing structure doesn't change, a word of advice for other students: Don't meet the bare minimum requirements like I did, just because you can get away with it. Try to push yourself to set your own deadlines for reading every week.",
                "Strengths: There are few requirements and you have significant independence. You have an amazing opportunity to do real history research, working with primary sources and driving your own narrative, with the guidance of your advisor. Weakness: There are few requirements and you have significant independence. It is important to hold yourself accountable; to meet with your advisor, other experts, and librarians regularly; and to exceed the basic requirements of the course, so as to set yourself up well for the second semester.",
                "It couldn't be improved!",
                "This course is required for history majors, so its strengths are that it helps history majors write long pieces of independent research outside the normal class structure. I don't see much room for improvement because this project is so central to the history major's experience. Another strength is that it teaches students to structure their own time with their adviser.",
                "More regular emails or communication would help",
                "I enjoyed the group advising format that my adviser used, because it allowed all students in the group to learn from each other and encounter different research trajectories from their own. I wish that I had received more consistent feedback on the small writing assignments that we were given over the course of the semester.",
                "I think it would be helpful to receive more information about deadlines. This class was helpful in that I did not have to attend sections or anything, but I would have appreciated more emails that told us about upcoming deadlines. I understand students are responsible for following the syllabus and should be aware of upcoming assignments, but I am also taking several other classes with other outside expectations during a global pandemic. I felt like I was struggling to keep up and I think clearer communication would be beneficial for me and my advisor. \r\n\r\nI think the class was helpful for moving the draft deadline back into mid-December. It is extremely during this moment to complete work, even if I want to, and that deadline helped me allocate time to work on my draft.",
                "Because this course didn't have weekly meetings, it depends on your advisor. My advisor has been helpful and readily available to meet and support me. I think balancing working on my thesis with other classes was challenging at times though."
