                "The course expectations were clearly outlined in the syllabus, and there was an appropriate amount of work each week, even including the lab reports. As far as labs go, it was a very reasonable workload and warrants its half credit designation. During the lab period, the professor accurately communicated the amount of time each experiment would take and provided an overview of important information at the beginning of each meeting. One weakness is the lack of general lab practice information (i.e., how to sanitize your work station), which would be useful for students unfamiliar with lab work but hoping to pursue it in the future. However, the course in general had very few weaknesses.",
                "I think Professor Hartman did an excellent job of designing lab experiments that allowed us to practice skills we had learned in microbiology lecture. She was always willing to clarify points of confusion and was very knowledgeable about all the experiments we performed. In the past I have taken some lab courses where the instructor/TF did not have complete understanding of the experiments being performed and couldn't answer questions effectively, so I appreciated having an instructor like Professor Hartman."
