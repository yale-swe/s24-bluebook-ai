    "I learned essential writing skills required for college level writing while acquire a deeper understanding of topics that I am interested in.",
    "This course helped me to develop a lot of the necessary skills that will be useful for writing at Yale in the future, and the research paper assignment specifically taught me how to effectively and thoroughly research a topic. I also developed a better eye for gaps or tensions in academic conversation and learned to put works in conversation with one another as opposed to viewing them as isolated pieces.",
    "Writing academic essays and close reading theoretical texts.",
    "I learned how to properly format many kinds of essays while also how to efficiently read many sources. In terms of the course material, I learned how to close read the entire connection between humans and animals, looking for discrepancies in human thought on this matter."

   "comments": [
    "Having a 7 person class was both a strength and a weakness. Made for individualized learning, but input from more students may have been helpful.",
    "It is well organized and engaged.",
    "Strengths: broad exposure to different sorts of writing, intellectually valuable discussions, lots of peer editing and time for essay revision\r\nWeaknesses: reading load was sometimes a little too heavy and not always directly relevant to what we were working on",
    "This course is very engaging. There were lots of opportunities for me to participate in class and discuss in groups. I also received prompt feedbacks on my writing assignments.",
    "I feel that a large strength was the size of the class at 7 people, as we were able to all have input at discussions so that we could all understand the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, just pick a topic interesting to you and the writing\/reading is fun.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are not very confident in their writing. I took this class to check the box for a writing credit because I knew I didn't like writing, and the topic interested me; however, after taking the class, I feel a lot more comfortable writing in college. The workload is also very manageable, and I liked that I was able to work on my writing while discussing and studying a really interesting topic.",
    "Yes. The course offers tremendous help for students who want to improve their writing skills. All the in-class activities were organized to help students become more efficient writers.",
    "If they are interested in the human and animal relationship and like reading and writing, I would recommend this course to them."
