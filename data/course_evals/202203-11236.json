I come from a relatively small, rural high school so for me this what the first time I was exposed to an environment where I was the one who struggled academically. That said, I like how Seth made the focus of the class on learning rather than difficulty.

I learned how to draw better hexagons.",
                "This course was a very insightful look into college organic chemistry. I found it interesting that Prof Herzon would always try to relate the class concepts to the real world or to his own research so that we could understand the importance of what we were learning."

                "The course was incredibly well taught and covered information thoroughly. I would've liked if it had proceeded at a faster place at the start of the course, but overall I really enjoyed it.",
                "Professor Herzon is amazing and very funny. The TF's for this class were also amazing, especially Alex. Class lectures were engaging, although a bit fast paced at times. The grading system for the class is also very forgiving, which helped my learning and made the class a lot less stressful. I think that one improvement could be for Professor Herzon to upload his notes or some version of his notes to canvas after class. This would be very helpful for students who miss lectures.",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor and the TAs. Everyone involved helped make the classroom environment very inviting and encouraged students to try their best and not be afraid to ask questions. Overall the structure of the course was great and made it a very positive experience for all of the students who were enrolled.",
                "Not exactly my cup of tea but the way it is structured and taught is certainly very good.",
                "The primary strength of this course was the grading scheme, which relieved a lot of pressure on focusing on grades over the material itself. Prof. Herzon is also a wonderful lecturer, and always willing to break things down in his office hours. However, I did feel that this course did not cover as much material as regular sequence organic chemistry, which may affect organic chemistry II.",
                "Overall Seth was an amazing teacher who always made me laugh in lecture. His explanations for fundamental concepts of chemistry such as mechanisms, pH, orbitals, and so on was straightforward and visually clear. That said, the one critique I have is that towards the end of the semester, his teaching style felt more tailored towards the advanced learns and I did feel a little left behind at times. There were times he'd implement a real-world example (which is useful) but these tended to lead to discussions that were very theoretical and advanced.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Herzon's grading this semester was very generous, which enabled us to focus more on the content and less on the stress of getting a good grade. My TA, Alex, was amazing and was the real difference-maker in my success in this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would've been nice if Prof. Herzon had gone over a problem or two with us in lecture. Oftentimes the problems on the psets were much, much more difficult than the basic concepts covered in class.",
                "Lectures and PSETS were very helpful in understanding material. TAs were also a huge asset to the course; be sure to attend section! Course was well organized to facilitate deep understanding of material without adding too much grade pressure.",
                "The strengths of this course are the fantastic professor and TAs, the relaxed learning environment, and the overall content structure. The learning environment was set up to produce a very collaborative class and let the stress of such a difficult course behind. I ended up knowing many of the fellow students course through psets, office hours, section, and lectures. The class seemed to be more interested in our engagement and understanding for the sake of learning. There were not many weaknesses in this course.",
                "I really like the lectures and I love the grading scale because less emphasis on the grades allowed me to focus on the learning.",
                "more practice questions",
                "One of the biggest strengths of the course was its distributed structure. Although having two lectures, one discussion section, and one study hall a week seemed daunting at first, it forced me to engage with the content over a greater time period and through a wider range of perspectives than might have otherwise happened naturally. This simultaneously fostered a sense of community between the students and TFs, which I absolutely adored.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course was probably its assessment scheme. Given the optional nature of the final and pre-released questions on the midterms, it was difficult for me to pinpoint my level of comprehension, especially when the PSETs were so short. I don't think any of us would have complained if less leniency was granted to us.",
                "Course content was consistently clearly explained, and when elements of the content could use clarification, discussion sections and study halls provided the perfect supplement. Course grading was also arranged in such a way that students were motivated to learn, but not overly stressed out by grades. Moreover, the class overall was not just learning the content: we were having fun both in and out of class with the chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe only main weakness that comes to mind at present is that some of the final elements of the course content were covered in what felt like a rushed manner. It was also noted that we had fallen about 0.5 lectures behind by the time the semester was starting to come to a close. Some of the early classes, which involved review of general chemistry, could perhaps be shortened a bit to allow for ample time later on.",
                "I liked how generous the grading system was and study halls were super useful as well. However I think it would have been better to not have such generous grading - after the second midterm a lot of people stopped showing up entirely because they didn't need to anymore. Lectures were really good and I learned the material well from discussion.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Opportunities for Students to learn\r\nWeakness: \r\n- moves very fast",
                "Strengths: clear and detailed feedback on psets, lectures covered pertinent material, lots of support from TAs and professor\r\nWeaknesses: the pace was fast (even though we were still behind at the end of the semester)",
                "A strength of the class was the professor and TAs were all very supportive of our learning and were engaging.",
                "Im not going to lie, this course is too easy. It was hard to stay motivated. The actual exams should be much more different from the practice exams.",
                "I do not know about other professors for the course, but Dr. Herzon was a fantastic lecturer this semester (Fall 2022) and kept me engaged on the lesson despite the class occurring at 9 AM. Course expectations were also very clear, and having the problem sets be completion graded and the course with an additional way to earn extra credit allowed me to learn the material of an infamously difficult class in a relaxed atmosphere. The only issue I found (and joked about in section) is that the homework contains material we shouldn't have been expected to know (it was effort-based though; this would only have been a problem if the homework was based on accuracy). The lecture also got a little behind about halfway through the semester and the handouts were somewhat superfluous and sometimes overcomplicated the material.",
                "The course was paced well and the TAs held study halls in addition to discussion sections that were really helpful. Overall the instructors were really there to help us succeed. The order that we learned topics in was different from most textbooks/courses which made it a bit confusing at times, but the lectures themselves were excellent and the problem sets and exams were representative of lecture material. We did not need to use the textbook at all. Grading was also very transparent and we received thorough feedback on all our work.",
                "This is a great course with the current professor and the TFs are wonderful. Alex, my TA was the best. The professor also does a wonderful job of explaining the concepts. The structure of the exams and the fact that you will see similar questions as practice really helps with understanding in the course. By focusing more on learning as opposed to worrying about your grade and performance, I was really able to put learning above extrinsic worries. I don't see any major weaknesses in the course and Seth was a wonderful professor for this course.",
                "It was relatively stress free but I felt that I could have learned more.",
                "Strengths: I think starting with MO theory really sets a solid basis for the class that makes the rest somewhat easier to understand. The smaller group discussions and study halls were very helpful in learning and going deeper beyond what we covered in lecture. I also liked how the grading structure took much of the pressure off the exams so I could focus simply on learning the material rather than cramming for an exam.\r\nWeaknesses: In some ways, the grading was a little too loose, such as how some of the test problems were exactly the same as practice problems, which made the exams more memory-based.",
                "All assignment required little energy. Fortunately, lectures were very content dense and engaging",
                "This course had many strengths. Professor Herzon was a very strong lecturer, the PSETS were interesting, relevant, and not too long, and the tests felt absolutely fair. I cannot think of any distinct weaknesses of the course, other than the fact that Professor Herzon himself had very limited office hours.",
                "I enjoyed how thorough the course was in teaching us chemistry concepts. It could be improved by providing more hands-on activities to help us understand the concepts better.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures this semester and felt they were very engaging. I maybe would have liked the problem sets to be slightly longer as I felt I wasnt practicing as much as possible.",
                "Strength- discussion sections and study halls were super helpful in understanding the material. It was graded super easily this semester which I liked because it meant that the second half of the semester was just learning based, we could learn and ask questions without worrying about our final grade.\r\nWeakness- sometimes the lectures were really fast paced and difficult to understand",
                "The strengths are the way it keeps students engaged without putting too much pressure on them. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think that for many students, including myself, the option not to take the third exam and the final caused them to naturally take their foot off the gas a bit. I think making the final optional is a great idea, but maybe there is some way to keep students fully engaged after the first couple exams to ensure they know what they need to know for next semester.",
                "The strengths are that the grading is very flexible; it focuses on your learning of the course concepts rather than you worrying about your grade. This was very helpful and allowed me to gain insight into the Organic Chemistry concepts.",
                "It was a very active learning environment and resources were offered.",
                "The amount of support in this course was amazing. The instructor & teaching fellows were extremely supportive of us in our learning journey, providing us with copious amounts of help & feedback.",
                "I loved the Professor and his teaching style, as well as the TA's, was awesome as they explained everything thoroughly. Learning by repetition is truly the best way to retain information, and this course definitely hit on this with the number of study halls, discussion sections, and lectures as well as all instructors being available by email. This definitely helped with understanding the material. I loved this course and the material, ironically as a pre-med, so I would not change anything.",
                "Very good learning environment, low stress, interesting\r\n\r\nLecture can be daunting simply because of the nature of the content sometimes",
                "Strengths: a grading system that immensely relieves the pressure associated with the subject, great TAs that go out of their way to help, a good speed that doesnt leave anyone behind but keeps everyone engaged",
                "I could still work on how to follow reactions and why reagents react the way they do.",
                "I thought this course was well planned and engaging for the students. Although some might not like to generous grading system, I felt like I was more engaged with the content of the course because of it and turned up to lecture more happy to learn. I think the study hall was really useful too just to go over pset questions or to ask about topics in lecture.",
                "Not having to take the third midterm and the final was helpful grade wise, but definitely lowered my engagement in the course. Although it was certainly a personal choice not to learn the material at the end of the course because I didnt necessarily have to, it wasnt really a choice if one compares the consequence of  doing well in another course versus learning extra material in this course. The course did provide a really great introduction to organic chemistry, however, and Professor Herzon along with the TA/discussion section format were really helpful in understanding complex concepts.",
                "I like how lenient and open it was with things like recorded lectures, and I think the TA study halls were very good and helpful.\r\n\r\nI think there could be a little more coverage of core topics, especially on exams/homeworks.",
                "While organic chemistry is known to be challenging for all STEM majors, this organic chemistry course for first years laid a soft foundation for incoming students at Yale. There was not much stress as anticipated. However, I think there is a degree to which how \"kind\" the course should be. While the study hall points and the resourceful exam preparation benefitted by grade, I can't help but wonder if it benefitted in my general knowledge.",
                "I felt a real sense of community in the course whether it was in lecture, discussion section, or study hall. I really appreciated the amount of support that the course provided for its students.",
                "I believe that this was the first time that Prof. Herzon taught first-year orgo, and it should be mentioned that the grading policy was quite generous  the final was opt-in and one exam score was dropped. This made it much easier to get an A but also discouraged students who did well in the first half of the course from continuing to stay engaged. The teaching team was great, and I personally enjoyed Prof. Herzons lectures. The material was challenging at times, but the course moved at a good pace.",
                "Strength was grading allowed less stress during year, problem sets were not overwhelmingly long",
                "This course was designed for first-year students to be able to succeed in, which was helpful. This course could be improved by providing more worked example problems.",
                "Strengths: well taught, well organized, liked the grading system, knew what to expect from the class, a lot of support offered when needed, gave me a really solid base for later chemistry classes\r\nWeaknesses: went a bit fast at times",
                "The strengths of the course really was in its supports system. The amount of resources provided  discussion sections (TAs were superheroes), resources in the Files sections of Canvas (like practice exams), and peer tutors  was incredibly helpful and thorough. The pace was very reasonable, especially for the first semester ever of Yale. The grading was surprisingly forgiving, and I'm grateful for it because it reduced a lot of the stress of just adjusting to the college experience. The only weakness was that the grading structure de-incentivized students who did well in the beginning of the course to keep learning at the end of the course, but most self-motivated students still put in the effort. And if anything, it lightened the load for those who would dedicate that freed up time to other intense courses I guess.",
                "I think that if the grading parameters were a bit more challenging that students would have more incentive to master the material."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in chemistry, who needs it for the major, or for some reason has general interest. If you are on the fence between this and general chemistry, I think you should do it! It is enjoyable and not a bad difficulty.",
                "Yes. Organic chemistry has the reputation of being an insanely challenging \"weed-out\" class, but this class was incredibly interesting and enjoyable.",
                "Yes, Professor Herzon and TF Alex are the best. This is also much more relaxed than I was expecting and it definitely felt manageable. Take this class over 220 as a first year, it is much more forgiving.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to pursue a STEM-based major at Yale. This is a great class for people deeply interested in the subject and who seek to student this as a major and/or in graduate school.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are a premed / interested in chemistry. This course's grading scheme may change, which was its primary benefit in my opinion. Although it is interesting, there is no need to take it if you are not a chem or biochem major and/or premed.",
                "Probably not. The way the grading worked this semester, you basically got an A if you went to lecture and did your work. It created a really low-pressure, low-stakes environment for someone like me who isn't a chemistry expert. That said, the material in the course is very niche and I can't think of any applications for non-STEM majors. This is not a bad course by any means but just not something I would go out of my way to take again freshman year.",
                "Yes, but only if you have to. It's not a class I would take for fun. That being said, if you do have to take this class, it's not at all a bad experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is fantastic as are the TAs and the material is pretty interesting and well-taught. The class also has a very positive work environment, which is very refereshing.",
                "Yes. I think it was a good course even though it was tough.",
                "I would, but I'm quite biased because I love chemistry. I feel like organic chemistry in particular gave me a newfound appreciation for both nature and mankind's capacity for innovation -  the two are not necessarily at odds with one another, at least at the microscopic scale.",
                "Yes, this course is a fun, engaging, and informative course! Even for those who are not looking to pursue chemistry in the future, CHEM 174 will prove to be useful and insightful.",
                "Yes. First-year orgo was actually much more manageable than I anticipated and I made a lot of friends in the class too. The community is really great, the teaching was good, and overall was a great class considering orgo's reputation.",
                "Yes. If you want a chance to study Organic Chemistry without very imminent stress about your grades, this course is perfect.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in a major that requires it or being pre-med. I feel that learning this material without needing it for anything else would be a bit unnecessary because it is quite complicated and niche, but if you need it to move forward, go for it!",
                "Yes, with Herzon.",
                "Yes, if it was taught by prof Herzon",
                "I would definitely take this course if the option is available (with a caveat, to be described). For organic chemistry, this class was incredibly laid-back and enjoyable, and based on discussion with peers and older course reviews, is the best choice of chemistry class for first year students. General chemistry (class and lab) are said to have way more work and are more disjointed than organic class or lab. Additionally, in most cases, the first year organic chemistry class is less strenuous than the regular class. The caveat is that it in some part depends on the instructor, and would steer clear of whichever class is \"flipped classroom\" (despite not taking it at Yale, I had previously attempted a semester of Orgo in this model and would call my experience with it horrendous). TLDR if you need chemistry and have the option to take this class, please take this one. It'll save you so much trouble and you will have so much help.",
                "Yes if you are interested in chemistry or need it for your major. It is a good amount of work but is rewarding.",
                "Yes -- but only with Seth and the current TFs (Alex, Marcus, Andrew). The TFs really do make/break the experience if you are not understanding the material and Seth choose a wonderful group for this course. Also, Seth has made himself graciously accessible for questions/office hours. I think this format, especially with a community of first-years, is the best to learn organic chemistry. Don't worry about past reviews of this course -- if you place into CHEM 174, please please please take it as it is so much better than having to go through general chemistry (which is not only a waste of time, but also won't benefit you significantly in the preparation for this course).",
                "Yes",
                "I think it was definitely a very good class and you will learn a lot of organic chemistry. Seth's lectures are very engaging and the TAs are very helpful in answering questions. However, this semester, I think the course was significantly lighter than it usually is, and I feel I may have learned more in the regular organic class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in the hard sciences at all. It's an extremely engaging class taught very well, and I feel like I came out much more interested in organic chemistry than when I started.",
                "Yes, this helped me tremendously with my understanding of chemistry.",
                "Yes. This course was great to take as a first year as it really provided a great learning environment.",
                "Yes; having only first-years in the class made a great community. Even if the content became challenging at times, everyone was willing to help each other. Additionally, the TAs were incredible at helping students, always offering additional zoom calls or study hours if necessary.",
                "Yes 100% its fascinating material and Seth is super helpful and really cares about his students.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. Its a great way to learn chemistry without as much grading pressure as a standard course.",
                "Yes, over Chem 220",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was perfectly balanced between workload and true knowledge gain, and I really enjoyed the discussion sections and study halls.",
                "Yes i think if you are interested in a non-traditional path as a first year and like chemistry this is a great class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. A lot is learned through this course, and there is a lot of scaffolding & support to help the students along the way as we learn the material.",
                "I would definitely recommend this specific course, even within Organic Chemistry, because of the professor and his way of explaining the material.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone interested. However, one probably should not take this class \"for fun\".",
                "Yes, first year organic chemistry specifically is a great way to learn hard material under less stress.",
                "Yes absolutely  for anyone interested in organic chemistry, this course is a great introduction",
                "Yes, the professor and TAs are very helpful and make learning fun.",
                "Yes!! I think this course was really fun and even thought the content is a little challenging I feel like I have learned a lot. Its also really good for freshmen who are nervous about college level courses since you feel really supported by all the staff.",
                "Yes, I think it's a good introduction to organic chemistry and to Yale, considering the workload and content covered.",
                "Yes, if it is required for their major or they are looking for a distributional credit they want to get rid of in their first year.",
                "Definitely",
                "Yes, if you can place out of gen chem, do it and definitely take this over 220, especially with Newhouse now teaching 220. Its nice to be in a class with all first-years, and the TAs were a great resource.",
                "Yes, instructor taught concepts very well, good course to learn organic chemistry",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student who is interested in chemistry. I think it would be hard to find a better course to learn organic chemistry in.",
                "Yes fantastic way to be introduced to organic chemistry in a way that fosters true learning as opposed to studying for a grade.",
                "Absolutely. Really good way to get an intro to organic chemistry without feeling too daunting, a lot of support from Prof Herzon and the TAs",
                "I would recommend this course. I was definitely pretty scared and intimidated but the course was a very encouraging first experience for us first years. The curriculum was honestly very interesting and it was one of the rare cases where the class structure didn't detract from the inherent joy of learning! Loved this class  shoutout to the TAs and Prof Herzon!!",
                "I would recommend this class because Prof Herzon was a wonderful lecturer and the concepts were fascinating."
