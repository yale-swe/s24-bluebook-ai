                "This course taught me so much about language in general. I learned the nuances of Italian and English language through translating a classic Italian text. I learned a lot about writing in general,  about picking an audience, and how important word choice is. I learned more Italian of course in a very different way than any other Italian course. This was much more about speaking Italian in a way that felt natural to Italian speakers. I learned how different even languages that seem similar on the surface, like Italian and Spanish, have such great differences and each language has things that can only be truly said in that language.",
                "This class was an incredible introduction to the practice of translation as well as deeper exploration of the structure, style, and unique fundamentals of italian as a langauge.",
                "I learned so much about the nuances of Italian writing, both mechanical like grammar-wise and culturallyso many details I dont think I would have ever picked up on if not looking at texts from the eyes of a translator!",

                "Strengths: Class conversations were well-organized and well-designed to facilitate learning and expanding vocabulary. Serena allowed a great amount of freedom for individual projects, and was always available for guidance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was sometimes hard to understand when assignments were due, because the Canvas page and syllabus were confusing.",
                "This class had so many strengths. I think Serena is the best teacher I could possibly have for this course. They are overwhelmingly kind and caring, always making class feel more like a conversation between a group of friends about how cool language and translation is, and not just an L5 Italian class. The onyl weakness is that Serena was not great at keeping deadlines and assignments clear. The syllabus was not followed at all. We only had 2 blogposts, which both were due at a different time than the syllabus said. All assignments and presentations were given to us and assigned a due date in class, which Serena just wrote out on the board before erasing. For someone who needs clear structure in a course, this might be stressful. All the changes that were made were to make our lives easier. Deadlines were pushed back and one of the blogposts was removed as I said.",
                "The course has no weaknesses. The only thing I would have liked is to perhaps spend more time on my translation project through more workshops. This is a minor criticism.",
                "I love the discussions we had in class, and the flexibility with our translation projects! Serena also offered a lot of helpful guidance if we reached out. However, without asking specifically for help, we really did not receive any feedback at all throughout the semester. I think it could have been helpful to get comments on our blogposts and translations! Also, I think that assignment deadlines could have been more clearly stated, and\/or uploaded to Canvas.",

                "I would recommend this course to another students. The freedom and flexibility granted to students allowed them to individualize their work. Serena is an amazing professor who really cares about the students and wants to help them succeed. My Italian improved immensely and I learned so many new words, new theories, and had fun!",
                "Absolutely!! A great course and it counts toward the Italian certificate!",
                "This was one of the best courses I've taken in my life, if not the best course I've ever taken. I took this course because I had some problems getting my language requirement finished the summer before my senior year because of a medical problem, and this was the only class that fit my schedule that would fulfill my requirement before I graduated. I came into it dreading it because I thought I wasn't going to be on the same level as everyone else, but I quickly learned that it would be one of the best classes at this school. I learned so much and was intellectually challenged in the best way, all while being surrounded by amazingly kind people. I tend to be pessimistic about this school, but this class was a wonderful way to end my 4 years.",
                "Absolutely. It is a wonderful way to continue with italian at the L5 level and dramatically improved my relationship with the language.",
                "Yes!! Overall this was a fantastic classSerena made each discussion so dynamic and innovative, and it was so much fun to work on our translations, both on our own and through the class workshops!",
                "Absolutely. If you want to progress in Italian speaking and reading skills this course is fantastic and really throws you into it.",
                "If you want to explore how meaning is formed between different languages and how singular words can have multiple interpretations then this class would be worthwhile. I really enjoyed the process of translating and expressing my creative liberty especially since I initially thought the process would be straightforward but the discussions we had in class made me reassess how to approach deceptively simple sentences and passages."
