                "Learn how to record action potentials on an oscilloscope, dissect a frog thigh muscle, see real brains and see a grasshopper fly. Super interesting lab where you learn the highs (fun and interesting!) and lows (sometimes frustrating) of doing neurobio research with animals.",
                "We did a lot of really cool experiments in this class that demonstrated incredible phenomena I think that as a student we were very lucky to see. \r\nGetting to hear the actual firing of an action potential or seeing a visual stimulus be transduced into an electrical stimulus were super fascinating to watch. \r\n\r\nBut, I think when it comes to skills the things done in this lab were very far out of our reach as students and it meant that the TAs had to do a A LOT of supporting which made our learning seem pretty second hand. I would have gotten the exact same learning from a video which was frustrating. The lab's were not well practiced or prepared and I felt like I was scrambling to complete the necessary work.",
                "I learned a lot about different parts of the nervous system and, in particular, skills used to study them. This course provided a lot of insight into the research methods used to discover the phenomena discussed in the lecture course.",
                "This lab course covered some basic concepts of neurobiology illustrated through lab work - e.g. extra- and intra-cellular recordings of action potentials.",
                "By taking this course, I gained several insights on classical techniques such as dissecting frogs and grasshoppers. I also learned how to use a Digital Oscilloscope and an amplifier for data measurements. Additionally, I learned how to perform extracellular and intracellular recordings on the aforementioned organisms, as well as on fruit flies.",
                "This was a great lab in terms of hands on experience with animals and I learned a lot about dissections",
                "I developed lab skills ranging from using microscopes to dissecting live specimens. I also was able to advance my scientific writing abilities for both lab writeups and lab notebooks.",
                "So great",
                "This was the first course working with live animals and I learned a lot regarding anatomy and how different animals function. I learned how to successfully dissect different animals and was able to learn about the circuitry within the animals that we used.",
                "I learned how much variety there is in neurobiology research and got to do a lot of hands on work. However, I also had to exercise a lot of patience, since many of the experiments did not provide valid results."

                "Many different contents of the classes, like muscles / visual system of different organisms. But assignments were also too difficult, bad setup, such that you could rarely actually get data or get to where you needed to get in the lab. But they were understanding of it. It was more about exposure / learning than getting results.",
                "Strengths: The TAs were really helpful and explained the concepts well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Basically the rest of the course aside from the TAs. \r\n1. The professor would go on these 1-2 hour monologues about random stuff that no one paid attention to. He also stopped us midway through our experiments sometimes to do a demo, but then would talk for so long that no one would actually be able to get their own results \r\n2. For a 0.5 credit, a 4 hour long lab is just too long \r\n3. The grading is super vague. Lab notes are graded out of 3 points each and lab write-ups are graded out of 3 points each (so 6 points for each lab week). However, a 2 is considered to be a \"good\" score. Just wasn't sure how this translated to actual letter grades \r\n4. Some of the experiments didn't work well and no one got any results",
                "Cool ideas and concepts for a class. \r\n\r\nNot the right skill level for an intro neurobio lab. Could be better prepped and practiced. I think the lessons were not well designed for the class period and we very often did not collect the necessary material.",
                "Overall, I felt that the experiments were engaging, relevant, and interesting. Some of them were very technically difficult. I wish the course was slightly better organized, such as more clear directions for lab notebooks and experiments.",
                "I think in principle the course is very interesting and provides a lot of opportunities for students to learn about neurobiology. \r\nHowever, I think in practice the course was a bit disorganized and didn't maximize students' opportunities for engagement and learning. For starters, I think expectations for the lab notebooks should be more clearly outlined at the beginning of the semester  perhaps even providing a sample lab notebook for students to learn from would be helpful. If there could be some clear expectations of what students need (data procedures, etc.) to have in order to score in certain ranges that would be really useful for students to set themselves up for success. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were clearer instructions for the lab analyses as well, with guidelines and perhaps a rubric provided at the beginning of the semester. \r\nLastly, I think it would be helpful if the lab days were structured a little better timing-wise; there were a few days where we didn't actually start doing any lab procedures until at least an hour and a half into the lab time. I understand this was for instructional purposes, but I think that maybe the process could be streamlined a little more so that students can better utilize the four hours that they have rather than running out of time for their experiments.",
                "There was a lot of sitting around doing nothing because we could not get the experiments to work properly or because there was just not enough time or resources to get everything done effectively. The strengths of this course were the TA lectures and the hands on experience we gained",
                "Strengths: very engaging, fun to work with other peers and TAs, discussions were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: writeup requirements was not always clear and sometimes experiment errors were so big that we were unable to complete experiments",
                "Hmm more structure would be nice also prof needs to talk to TAs more often to correlate what goes on in his lab since he he would kind of just do his own thing while we were all confused :)",
                "There was a lot of time spent doing demos and I wasn't able to fully perform the lab every week cause we ran out of time. The TFs were awesome, but I felt like there could've been more help during the tougher labs, in order to ensure the success of the lab.",
                "Professor Haig and the TAs did a very good job of explaining concepts and assisting students with their experiments. I think this is no fault of their own, but there was a lot of faulty equipment that made it difficult to get results or feel motivated to get results."

There are other labs that you can take that will satisfy the major (and give you a full credit for less work). Also, I know people in my section who weren't even neuro majors and I cannot stress enough that you should not take this course.",
                "Honestly, no I would not. This class brought me a great amount of stress for very little reward. I got to do very little of my own hands on work and felt that the entire time we were sitting in complete ignorance waiting for help.",

                "I would say that if you are deeply interesting in learning neurobiological techniques, then this class will provide a good background for you, and it also goes nicely with the neurobiology class. However, if this class is not required for you, you might consider taking another class that has a bit clearer instructions and that, grading-wise, is a little easier.",
                "I would reccomend this course because the TAs were so good and I learned a lot from them",
