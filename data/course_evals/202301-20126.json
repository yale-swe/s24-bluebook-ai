                "this class was very intensive - lots of daily work that you had to do in order to keep up with the class. the book passages are also quite long and you need to know them in detail to participate fully in class. but manageable as long as you don't fall behind with things",
                "This class reviewed a lot of grammar that we learned in previous French courses, which was helpful reinforcement. However, I felt that there could have been greater engagement with the grammar in class beyond simply checking answers to homework. I think that more interactive activities regarding grammar that encourage participation would have been great. Also, the feedback on past assignments, especially exams and essays, wasn't always prompt enough to apply commentary to later assignments.",
