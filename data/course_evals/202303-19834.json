                "The Spanish sequence is a doozy, much like all language courses at Yale. Having a class four/five days a week is challenging. On the one hand, I think the homework and class time are helpful for language learning. On the other hand, as this is required for graduation, it is a huge burden on the student. \r\n\r\nThis class in particular was honestly not too bad, I think the professor was great. The exams and compositions were also good. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the sheer amount of work required every day. Some days, between class and homework, I would have to choose between falling behind in all my other courses or completing a Spanish assignment, reaching this point after already spending hours working on things. It is a good course, but it was almost prohibitively stressful to keep up with at times.",

Beyond class content, she's also super nice, and it's clear she cares about her students. Additionally, her feedback is very good, resulting in even faster progress.",
