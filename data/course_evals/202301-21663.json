                "Small class allowed for a lot of discussions; lectures (rare) were often sped through and difficult to interact with",

                "Good course!",
                "Material was engaging, and class size contributed to a lot of enriching, substantive class discussions.",
                "Strengths were the seminar and size of class allowed for all questions I had to be answered and for me to fully retain the material.",
                "Professor B's lectures were very engaging, and his readings were very carefully selected. He regularly sought feedback from students about his course. Overall, there are not weaknesses of this course.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and the guest speakers and field trips in this course.",
                "This course is very interesting with personal stories and special guests who are very knowledgeable. Some of the readings felt redundant or tiring for what we used in class.",
                "Professor is very nice and knowledgeable about cancer with his career experience, assigned readings for every class are well thought out and very relevant, the format for each class varies and is very student-led. Could use improvement in making sure the total length of the assigned readings is more consistent.",
                "The course readings were incredibly interesting and Professor Bazell had many connections to the authors, which offered us exciting insight and context for the writing. The lecturing and discussions were very helpful. However, I was not super fond of group projects only because I found that it made me focus more on my group's topic and learn less about topics covered by other groups while general lecturing helped me get a better and more even understanding of the entire unit. This may be an unpopular opinion though, I know the other students really liked the group work."

The essays are a bit hard, especially since I had a hard time writing science essays for the first time. But Professor Bazell offers so many office hours, really wants to help you, and cares a lot about you.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, the content was very interesting, and the course wasn't too stressful or demanding.",
                "Yes its a great science credit for non-stem majors. You learn a lot of biology but also discuss important topics that effect everyone.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. Professor Bazell has a very rigorous understanding of cancer history, biology, and policy because he has spoken to many prominent figures in the field as a science journalist for NBC. The course is very fascinating and has inspired me to consider a career in cancer research. Overall, this course was very interesting and is accessible to non-science majors and science-majors\/pre-meds alike.",
                "Yes, definitely. This is a fabulous interdisciplinary science course that teaches you a lot about the biological and genetic basis of cancer while also giving you a critical understanding of the social and historical trends that have shaped the perception and treatment of cancer in America. While in-class discussions can sometimes be a bit dry, the readings are all fascinating and Professor Bazell is amazing.",
                "Yes, this course does a great job at connecting STEM with humanities and exposing students who are not premed or science-inclined to the realities of science and medicine.",
                "Yes, the class overall was very enjoyable. It was great to be able to learn so much about cancer through readings, Bazell's lectures, other peers, field trips, and amazing guest speakers.",
                "Yes! Especially to a student with interest in public health, as well as pre-meds who may not have considered exploring this sort of perspective as it is very important for the field."
