                "This course is very relevant however the instruction was not only very bland but was too focused on an overly detailed and mathematical view of the material covered. I am sure every student who took this class will quickly forget 80% of what was instructed. It is a shame that such a current class is taught in a way that pushes students away from the subject matter rather than inviting them. The class should improve upon its delivery of the material.",
                "The course moved very quickly and it was difficult to engage during the lectures. The exams also did not provide enough time to complete them. There was also little to no instruction on how to use R.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive view of intro stats with relevant statistical package skills through R. Psets put skills into practice well. \r\nWeaknesses: Moves fast, even for me who has taken a few stats classes before this.",
                "This was the best statistics class I have ever taken. The progression was natural, Professor Ryan was engaging, clear, and responded very well to in-class queries to facilitate student learning.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred more R applications over theory, but I suppose that will come in ECON 123. I could also do with fewer questions about consistent estimators!! I get them wrong every time.",
                "Professor Ryan is a very clear lecturer and the content generally makes a lot of sense. R can be daunting for people who don't have any programming experience, but the problem sets usually don't ask you to do too much difficult coding. The sections can be boring and don't feel very necessary, especially since section participation doesn't count towards our final grade. It would be more helpful for sections to focus on problem solving and going through the problem sets.",
                "Not engaging.",
                "A strength of the course is the fact that there are discussion sections. However, I personally found my discussion section very unhelpful, as there was little to no discussion/collaboration, and was mostly like a small lecture. I also found that it was hard to find external materials online that followed the curriculum of this course. It would be very helpful to have a document of codes that would be relevant to the course available to students (rather than having the students spend hours on Google trying to look up code). I would also advise making the course more collaborative.",
                "Very helpful to know R to code the psets.",
                "This class was very informative.",
                "Not a bad intro, but lecture slides can be a bit hard to follow and would like practice problems to be a bit more clear",
                "Course is very well organised. It could be improved by focusing more on the logic behind some of the methods in the psets",
                "I really like the week-by-week breakdown of the syllabus on canvas with links to relevant documents, and I appreciate that the R code from each lecture is posted.  I personally felt that the first half of the course was much easier than the second half, so it might be worth considering condensing the early sections on probability to make more time for more complicated concepts.  On the other hand, I do understand that the probability lays the groundwork for later sections, so perhaps the current timeline is the best option.  I also think it might be worth considering having smaller psets due closer together, as it would help them build on each other; the current spacing sometimes means I have to go back and remember how to do things after a few weeks, particularly with R.",
                "Theoretical part well taught and the material is interesting, but a lot of the R part was left for students to figure out on their own.",
                "Strengths: My TA\r\nWeaknesses: The class",
                "The course did a really great job of engaging with theoretical statistics and how these different methods have been developed. I think this has solidified my ability to engage with statistical methods in a way that is very advanced and thorough. However, this course does not have a robust understanding of the many different components of teaching a coding language and there was a lack of consistency between what was taught in section and what was covered in lecture. A greater emphasis on the the relationship of the coding to the class topic would help to make the course feel more structured and engaging.",
                "It's just a hard class...",
                "Strength: the case studies we covered in class during the R Breaks were fascinating real-life examples.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the theory part of the lectures wasnt covered in depth, and I felt unprepared for some of the PSet questions even with section.",
                "Probably the most boring lecturer I have ever had to listen to. Additionally, there were times when problems or R code would be done incorrectly in lecture and students who did not recognize it were probably disadvantaged as a result. There is not enough time devoted to actually teaching the topics to students who have not already taken stats classes or have not used R before.",
                "the lectures should be structured better to encourage learning the r program and basic statistical analysis. the current lectures were very hard to follow and the examples were not helpful",
                "Concepts often made more confusing than need be. But the lectures were good and the lecture slides helped a lot when studying and looking back on notes.",
                "Strengths: very good lectures.",
                "Strengths: good professor (Nicholas Ryan)\r\nWeaknesses: assessments too difficult",
                "Strengths: relevant case studies, applications \r\nWeaknesses: didn't learn enough about R in class, lectures were a bit rushed",
                "Pros: Practical applications, learn more about how to use R. Cons: Could be a bit more engaging",
                "Section was a must. Reviews the key topics of the week in a concise and clear manner.",
                "Strengths: well organized Weaknesses: not personal at all, very monotonous",
                "Strengths: I learnt more about statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was very fast paced for someone who did not have prior experience in coding or statistics.",
                "Learning R and statistics in a lecture format is difficult. You have to learn a lot of the material on your own through problem sets. Section would be very helpful if you have a clear and communicative TA, but unfortunately, I did not. I think ensuring that TAs are chosen not based on their knowledge but on their capacity for teaching is very important for this course. Office Hours are very important!",
                "The strengths of the course were that it was incredibly well-organized (likely owing primarily to Professor Ryan) and extensively covered all the material that the course syllabus promised to cover. The course felt challenging at times yet definitely manageable. The material from the first half was definitely a bit dry but still necessary to learn. The second half of the course was super interesting, and the real-world examples presented in class were very cool. The course had no serious weaknesses, besides the fact that sometimes it felt as though problem set material went somewhat beyond the material presented in lecture.",
                "Strengths: great use of examples in lecture, course was well-structured and easy to follow.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course could benefit from some additional focus on how to apply concepts in R.",
                "Strengths are how organized lectures are with high level knowledge. and a weakness would be to go over more r studio at the beginning of the semester during class.",
                "Professor Ryan went over R code WAY TOO QUICKLY. As someone who's never worked with R code before, I had a really difficult time keeping up. In fact, a lot of the course moved way too quickly.  Statistics concepts were explained with very difficult and cryptic data sets that were too complicated to demonstrate beginner concepts to BEGINNERS. This should not have been an intro level course.",
                "Strengths - lectures were well organized and straightforward, problem sets and practice exams were relevant and helped prepare you for the tests. Weaknesses - section was not very helpful (very few people even showed up to my TA's section)",
                "I thought the class was effectively and clearly organized and that the course outcomes and objectives were clear and manageable. The sections were helpful in clarifying the key concepts and setting us up to solve most problem set questions. The office hours for the most part were good  I thought Vladimir really patient and really helpful in guiding us through the problem sets, and super clear and organized during sections as well. \r\n\r\nI found one of the other TAs a little impatient and condescending during a single office hours session that I attended, but I do recognize that it was once-off and may have just been a bad day. Other than that I think the course was generally manageable and well-organized, although I did feel that the quizzes were by far the hardest assignment (and also difficult to prepare for, being a little more theoretical, in my opinion).",
                "The lectures were well-organized and helped to communicate the core ideas. Additioanlly, I appreciated the application of concepts and research methods to contemporary debates and topics, as it helped to make the material more engaging. The chief weakness of the course was that the questions asked on the problem sets differed greatly from the material in the lectures, such that I had to regularly attend office hours just to get a sense of how I should go about completing assignments.",
                "Uninteresting and uninspiring class. Would only take if you need to. Problem sets are incredibly long. Lectures are not interesting at all, by the end of the semester the hall was a ghost town because people stopped showing up.",
                "The lecture materials could resemble the materials on the problem sets more",
                "The strengths of this course are the huge amount of concepts that are covered over the course of one semester and Nicholas Ryan. The material taught is very interesting but what makes it more interesting is Professor Ryan's engaging teaching and gradual explanation of the topics. It is a huge strength that students get familiarized with so many concepts and tools that they might use in research in the future in only one semester. The weaknesses of this course is that it is very fast-paced and the TAs were not particularly helpful. Of course to learn all this material in one semester, a fast -pace is necessary. However, when most theories are entirely new to someone (like they were to me) the fast-pace seriously does not help. As you try to digest and process new information, professor Ryan has already started adding more variables to the equation and explaining the next concept. I think this is a weakness that could be encountered if the course was taught in two semesters instead of one in a slower pace. What would also help in the understanding of the concepts would be being assigned more exercises on the theory taught during the lecture before moving on with the problem set, similar to the ones Professor Ryan had on his slides. The level of difficulty of the problem sets is similar to the exams, which is helpful. However, exercises that help students understand and practice the newly learnt concepts on an introductory level would be instrumental. Regarding the TAs, the one I was assigned to did not provide clear explanations and answers to the questions we had and his way of teaching was not engaging.",
                "Strength: going into this course with an understanding of statistics and R and economics. \r\n\r\nWeakness: actually lowered my understanding of the aforementioned topics",
                "Strengths: Few, the course material is incredibly important for economics and thus imperative to learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many, the material is very important and yet poorly taught. There is little to no teaching of R meaning those with no prior experience struggle to understand and get through it. The problems on midterms and finals are entirely different than what is taught in class so the only way to learn is by going through practice problems.",
                "Strengths - learn basic econometric skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - how the subject material is presented is horrible. Simple topics are presented in a very circuitous, non-intuitive fashion; If you are looking to learn the basic statistics you need for economics, I would highly recommend taking a course taught by the stats department instead",
                "The course is good at explaining some probability but is extremely over complicated, too arduous, and the workload is immense.",
                "Strengths: Accessible professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs and peer tutors would sometimes provided vague or difficult to understand answers when reached out to for help"

I think overall, the course is an essential introduction to these areas and builds a very solid theoretical foundation. I would temper my recommendation by adding that a lot of the work is self-guided and learning the concepts will not easily translate into working on the problem sets, especially with the understanding that the problem sets will engage with R in a way that is not directly taught in lecture or in section. There is very little one-on-one help that is in a structured class setting, and that means a lot of how this course functions relies on a lot of self-teaching from the student.",

                "If youre an Econ major you have to take this anyway, so nothing I say here can sway you from not taking this class.",
                "Don't take Econometrics if you do not have to (sorry econ majors). If you're going to take it, however, take it with John Eric Humphries. You will not enjoy this course with Nick Ryan.",
                "no, i did not enjoy this class as it was uninteresting and very difficult",
                "I would not recommend this course if it is not a requirement. Generally it seemed very disorganised  with unexpected assignments showing up towards the end of the semester, and the support provided was inadequate. If this is your area, you'll be fine, but if this is actually an introduction, I highly recommend taking another statistics class before this because, in my experience, you will not receive the support you need here. Definitely did not seem like the professor had our best interest in mind, and this is my first time experiencing this at Yale.",
                "disgusting but needed to be done as an econ major",
                "If required for major.",
                "Yes, very interesting.",
                "No,  but you will have to take it anyway. It's unfortunate because the material is interesting enough that most could enough the class if the assessments weren't as difficult as they are.",
                "If they're an econ major or want to learn about applying statistics to economics",
                "Yep, good course to take for the major or for CSEC.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to someone who is interested in basic data analysis. There are lots of skills to be gained in this class.",
                "Only if its absolutely necessary for your major. And I wouldnt recommend taking it unless you have done intro stats and SDS 230 before.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed it but I think most people did not. Although I think it is worth taking it is quite possible there are a number of other courses in which you would have an easier and more enjoyable time developing the same skills.",
                "Yes, the course is very well-organized and engaging. Of course, if you are interested in econometrics you will find the course much more useful and interesting (particularly the second half).",
                "This an essential class to gain another level of understanding for the subject of economics.",
                "If you're looking for an intro to statistics, do not take this course!! I went into this course with no statistics experience and found it very difficult, moving way too quickly.",
                "Yes, but if you do not have a background in statistics anticipate that you will need to put in work outside of class to understand the material.",
                "I would recommend this course, but they probably have to take it anyway for their major. I think this course just gets the job done; it's nothing spectacular and probably won't transform or life but it's not meant to do that. I think it does an effective and efficient job at teaching you the basics of data analysis and econometrics and setting you up to gain more knowledge in future. I would suggest making sure that you do all the practice questions and practice all of the old problem sets before the midterms and finals (this over reading and making notes from the slides -- which you can reference as you do the practice problems if needs must). I think drilling the questions and treating this like a math class where practice helps you develop intuition was the best approach personally, and if you put in the hours to (1) do past papers and (2) redo questions that you got wrong, you can't go too wrong in terms of grading.",
                "I would recommend the course if you need an econometrics credit.",
                "No. Only if you have to for Econ. Otherwise it is not easy, not interesting, and not worth it at all. You dont learn Econ, and barely learn stat. Take intro stat instead",
                "Only if you have to take it. The lectures were just the professor reading from the lecture slides. Not only that the R used in lecture was not explained just shown and as a student who has had R experience, I even found it difficult sometimes to understand the basic code and functions being used",
                "I took intro to econometrics in my first semester at Yale and was definitely my hardest course. Unless a student is 100% sure they want to major in Economics or any other field ECON 117 is a requirement for and they have placed out of all the introduction to economics classes, I would not recommend taking it in freshman year. If this class is not a major requirement I would not recommend taking it at all. A good idea would be to take other probability and statistics classes first, that cover similar topics as ECON 117 and then take it. In this was students would be familiarized with most of the concepts introduced in the class and the fast-pace would not overwhelm them that much.",
                "NO. Unless absolutely required, do NOT take this course. Take S&DS 230 instead, it is far better and taught me much more than ECON 117. I went into this course with a strong understanding of statistics, R, and economics from various other courses, and Professor Ryan succeeded in leaving me more confused on topics I had understood since AP Statistics in high school. Even if it is easy to do well in this course, it is extremely poorly organized and should not be required for the economics major.",
                "This course teaches you about econometrics in a disorganized manner. Take this course if you have to but if you just want to learn about econometrics there are far better ways to do that, including but not limited to, other courses, independent study, books, online classes, basically anything else.",
                "Take this course only if you need to fulfill a major requirement. There are better statistics alternatives out there than Econ 117. The teaching is poor and psets not well designed to prepare you for the midterm/final.",
                "No, I would not. I dont think this course facilitates a positive learning experience as it saddles the students with far too much work.",
                "no, only if econ major and you need the requirement",
