                "I got so much better at reading, writing, and speaking Chinese through this class. I learned more about Chinese culture, and overall got a lot more comfortable with the language than I expected in just a few months."

                "Strengths: Required vocabulary and Chinese characters each day help me to solidify the learning of these terms. In class review of the textbook materials each day provides opportunities to ask questions and discuss the topic further.\r\nWeaknesses: Not lots of opportunity for discussion in class, I would've liked to practice the grammar topics and have constructive feedback by the teacher a bit more since my fluency in speaking is not as good.",
                "could involve more peer discussion/casual and real life conversation prompts",
                "The group discussions and reading/grammar repetition helped me fully understand how to speak fluently and put the skills I learned into practice. One minor weakness is that I was a bit confused at the beginning of the course about grammar structure, as we only practiced speaking and did not write down the different structures. However, this improved as the course progressed.",
                "Course is really good as is.",
                "The strength of the class is that it is super engaging. Even though the class met 5 days a week, I did not once feel like it was too much. Liu Laoshi is also a strength, as she is a very patient, caring, and understanding professor. She was definitely one of the highlights of the class! The students were also very nice and our whole class got very close together because of the small setting. No weaknesses off the top of my mind!",
                "The strengths are that the class is very well structured with clear expectations of what is expected of students in regards to homework and workload. However the weakness is that the workload can be lot at times.",
                "Strengths: Fast-paced but absorbable, great professors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think more time could have been put into drilling different grammar structures to get more comfortable with them"

It is a great opportunity to strengthen your Chinese fluency by increasing the number of words you can use, read, and write as well as bettering your fluency in speaking Chinese. It also helped me make a lot of Chinese friends as we studied for class, got meals after class, and in general, saw each other every day.",

However, I would say that if you absolutely dislike Chinese, then the workload and daily quizzes might not be worth it for you. However, if you're just trying to finish the Chinese credit, then this course might change your opinion otherwise.",
                "Definitely!",
