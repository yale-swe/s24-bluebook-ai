We often had guests who shared their personal insights into the field of medicine, which was such a unique opportunity.",

                "No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: The professor! It is very clear how passionate he is about the topic. I also enjoyed how we got to hear from his mentors; it was inspiring hearing how they made a difference in his medical career. He also always makes the effort to draw out larger ideas from the points we make in class so that the conversation doesn't fall flat.\r\nWeaknesses: Small changeI wish we had done all of our writing workshops before we would have to submit drafts and final papers.",
                "I would always receive helpful and in-depth feedback for each paper that I wrote and I was able to use that feedback on the next paper. The readings and occasional guest lecturers were always very interesting and engaging as well. Overall a great introduction to college level writing.",
                "Strengths: the professor is so caring and invested in the material he teaches; he provided phenomenal feedback on essays; the medical narratives were fantastic readings; the guest speakers were  amazing. Weaknesses: the philosophy material was interesting, but hard to digest.",
                "I really appreciated Professor Morrison's enthusiasm for the topics we discussed, and his thoughtful responses to each and every student. It was clear that he was extremely knowledgeable on everything from Russian literature to the inner workings of the medical field. I think the virtual format made many guest speakers more accessible, and we were fortunate enough to have wonderful authors, doctors, and professors join us almost every week. Doing workshops on each other's papers allowed me to learn from my peers' writing, as well as get feedback on my own. I felt that all the ideas I shared were truly heard and evaluated, both by Dr. Morrison and my classmates. The only thing I think could have been improved is slightly more challenging interactions during live class; for example, more guided questions posed to the class, in addition to open time for discussion. In exchange, there could have been a less long lectures, which tended to be less engaging to students.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison! Dr. Morrison is a fantastic professor who truly cares for his students and their growth. His lectures and responses during discussions are always incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. I am amazed at how brilliant and well-read he is. Given that he is an emergency physician, he brings another perspective to the class and truly exhibits the interdisciplinary nature of the course, branding together medicine and the humanities. He is clearly knowledgeable and his constructive criticism and feedback on papers are very specific. Another strength was the immense amount of opportunities we had to hear from truly amazing guest speakers, including world-class neurosurgeons, best-selling authors, and Dr. Morrison's mentors. Dr. Morrison and the guest speakers he brought in along with the excellent discussion about the readings truly made the class great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As we got further into the course, the readings began to get somewhat denser as it delved into the abstract more, which could get harder to follow and connect back to previous readings.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison is incredibly passionate for both medicine and English, and he is a wonderful teacher that deeply cares about his students. He often invites fascinating guest speakers that offer intriguing perspectives into writing, philosophy, and medicine.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some more time dedicated to improving our writing skills would be helpful."

                "The Zoom format facilitated discussion and allowed us to have many guest speakers join and talk to the class.",
                "The Zoom format, I believe, allowed for more access to a wide range of speakers from across the world. I loved being able to directly ask questions to the authors we read. But I do think the virtual format inherently makes it more difficult to speak freely, as each comment required minutes of waiting and thinking before it could be shared. I appreciated that. during lectures, Dr. Morrison tried to keep us engaged by having each student read a quote on the slides. However, I think there could be ways to engage students more on the information from the lecture, perhaps connecting it to the assigned readings more. Finally, I think keeping videos on during class encouraged students to stay focused and participate."

You will get to read a lot of cool excerpts of philosophy and literature and learn so much about what it is actually like to be a doctor. That being said, grading is a little harsh so be prepared to bring your best effort.",
                "Yes! Dr. Morrison was one of the most dedicated and thoughtful teachers I've had. His thorough comments on my writing really helped me improve; he combed through each line and gave pointers on claims\/evidence. Because there were so many pre-med students in the class, it was interesting to get to hear an insider's experience, and Dr. Morrison really brought a sense of humanity to his work. As an undecided undergrad, I liked that we considered medicine from a different point of view--more historical and philosophical. There was a wide range of literature, from firsthand surgical accounts to theories about reason and certainty. I would say it was more geared to pre-med or pre-med curious students, but I'm sure anyone could gain a lot of new knowledge and writing skills from this class. Students get the unique opportunity to meet guests from a variety or professions and experiences, woh genuinely are excited to share their knowledge.",
                "Yes, especially if they are considering pre-med! Dr. Morrison truly cares for his students and is so genuine. The opportunities to learn from him and the guest speakers that he brings in are unbeatable.",
                "Definitely: as a prospective pre-med, Narrative and Medicine has allowed me to both become a better writer and better understand the work of physicians."
