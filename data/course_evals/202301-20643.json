                "Strengths would be the flexibility of peer tutors, while a weakness would be the way in which the course is taught.",

Some weaknesses are that certain units are particularly harder than others and problem sets cannot be redone.",
                "Strengths- Meghan is a huge strength! Also, the way the class is structured is very conducive to learning, and I enjoyed it very much.\r\nWeaknesses- everything we covered was either in class or on the weekly quizzes so the book was a waste of money. I wish the problem sets were posted on a PDF because that was all the book was used for."

I took this class because I am a humanities major and was looking for a lowkey math class. While this class was lowkey, everything we covered I had already learned about in my middle and high school math classes. I think it is possible for easy/gut classes to still be educational, but I don't feel like I learned anything new in this class. This contributed to me not feeling excited about learning.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a QR credit to fill.",

                "If you need a QR credit, yes. Honestly, you won't learn much from this class, but it's mostly easy. I will warn you, Professor Anderson (who is great) tells everyone that the final \"isn't required\" when it absolutely is. Even if you get a perfect score otherwise, you need like an 85 on the final to get an A. Luckily, the final was only 6 questions and mostly easy. Good class, just beware!",
                "Yes 100% I would recommend this course especially if you are someone who isn't very good at math. The professor makes sure that everyone is able to learn the concepts and do well in the class no matter their math background. Low workload and low stress class.",
                "Yes. Especially if they have no background in mathematics.",
                "I highly recommend this course to other students. It was a lot of fun, and the workload was manageable. The content is super interesting, and I learned many new concepts not covered in my high school math classes.",
                "Absolutely!\r\nThis course is so fun and you will learn a lot (unless you already took calculus in college!)\r\nIt's a great QR credit for ANYONE interested in math (I promise it's not that bad! You get to apply it to real-world problems which makes it WAY more interesting and engaging)\r\nI highly recommend you take this class! And take it with Meghan!"
