   "comments": [
    "I learned more about corruption and how it manifests in different places.",
    "I developed my knowledge of corruption, its broader impact not only on economies but its social consequences, a familiarity with the literature on such subjects, and my understanding of how corruption can be prevented.",
    "Learned about the basic concepts of corruption, how it's measured, the economic impact of corruption, viewing corruption as a cultural problem (gender, religion, etc), understanding corruption as a political problem (organized crime and money laundering), and anti-corruption reform.",
    "Thorough understanding of corruption, team working skills, and group discussion.",
    "I learned more about what corruption means , and its prevalence around the world.",
    "The course allowed me to see corruption beyond the realm of morality I had assigned it to. I now understand that the causes of corruption are many and can be deeply rooted in a government or private firm and that reforms aimed at ending corruption must first deal with the institutions that allow corruption to thrive. It was very interesting to learn about the externalities of corruption and how it people in any society where there is corruption are affected more than they often realize.",
    "You learn about the causes and consequences of corruption. You mostly learn about public corruption like bribing government officials but you also learn a little about private corruption.",
    "I gained so much knowledge about corruption. I also really enjoyed the final research project. It was a great lesson on teamwork and probably one of the pieces I am most proud of that I have written at Yale.",
    "I was able to get a deeper understanding of what corruption is, and how it is able to be so pervasive all over the world. I was also able to dive deep into understanding what noble cause corruption is and how it, too, is pervasive and can be very damaging despite its label.",
    "I learned a lot about corruption, its causes, consequences, and the way it manifests itself across the globe. Over the five short weeks, we covered a variety of topics in depth and I walked out knowing a lot more than I did walking into it.",
    "I learned a lot about the variety of impacts that corruption can have on the world and some of the ways that people can combat corruption."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor should have been more organized, but her videos were good. I wish sections had been planned and executed better.",
    "Less readings, more analysis\/discussions via discussion boards.",
    "Strength: very broad, survey class of how corruption stems beyond just a a moral or ethical issue. The video blogs were a fun reflective platform that solidified information in class.\r\nWeakness: the research paper accounts for approximately 50% of the final grade, so it's a game of luck whether you'll get member(s) committed to the paper. But, Professor Palifka was very accommodating and helped us get through the process. Also, I think it would be beneficial if the critique wasn't optional. It would be great every time we meet if one or two people present for 5 minutes on an assigned article for that week. Just a great refresher of the reading and allow us to jump into discussion.",
    "Bonnie is wonderful. Her leadership makes the class. Perhaps the syllabus could be more clear. I lost a few points by simply not knowing the expectations for assignments.",
    "There was a lot of work and a ton of reading. Your average was not concentrated in one grade.",
    "The course addressed various causes and consequences of corruption and, more importantly, offered possible anti-corruption reforms.",
    "Some of the assignments are different than other courses. For example, we had to complete weekly 5-minute video blogs and had to complete a 20+ page group research paper.",
    "Strengths: The video lectures are well-done, the textbook is accessible and has lots of examples to cement the topics. Weaknesses: Sometimes, too many readings were assigned and some weeks had one or two chapters in the textbook while some had six chapters, leading to some weeks having a noticeably lower level of engagement in discussions.",
    "I thought that the course was strong because we went over many very relevant topics, and the course also made an effort to incorporate corruption in the news that made class that much more engaging. It was weak in only one sense, and that was that some of readings could sometimes be quite convoluted and very difficult to get through while also understanding what the thesis of the reading really was.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses of the class. The class was incredibly organized to make the students lives as easy as possible. It allowed us to enjoy learning rather than be stressed."

   "comments": [
    "If you want an econ credit might as well take it. I thought that the workload itself was way too much, some felt like busy work.",
    "Would definitely recommend as an ECON elective. I'm not an ECON major, but this class wasn't overwhelming nor finance heavy. Grading was pretty lenient, and you just need an initiative to learn to do well in this class.",
    "Yes. A lot of work for sure. However course material is interesting and the course is well organized.",
    "Yes, this class goes into great depth about the corruption in all senses. This class has been very informative for me and has made me much more aware of the ways corruption has affected America.",
    "Yes but there are things expected of you that you may not be used to like the format of the final paper",
    "Yes, because I think that the cause addressed important issues that people overlook regularly. The abuse of entrusted power should not be accepted as normal, but that is often the case when people do not understand what corruption is.",
    "Yes! Professor Palifka is great and the topic is relevant and interesting. The readings could be streamlined or the expectations for them could be more direct, pointing people to summaries or specific points of emphasis. But otherwise, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Yes, it's a great way to understand corruption better, however, make sure you are willing to do a lot of in-depth research and lots of academic writing.",
    "This class was very interesting and not very stressful as a result of the class organization."
