I appreciated the structure and support in beginning and fleshing out our theses but some classes we only spent giving one another updates on rather than reading and engaging our projects. I think we would be more accountable to our projects and ourselves if we prioritized peer workshopping in our class (we only had one class session where we did this).",
                "Strengths: it was helpful to have a community to share challenges and updates regarding the thesis research and writing process, Prof Tran and Taty were always very kind and understanding instructors; Weaknesses: the readings on how to write a thesis would have been much more relevant second semester, when most of the writing process actually happens. More time could have been spent on the initial research question formulation process. A tutorial on how to use Zotero/citation management applications could have also been helpful. Furthermore, I would have preferred meeting every two weeks as a group and instead having more 1:1 meetings with Professor Tran and Taty."
