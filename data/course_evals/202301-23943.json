                "We learned German phrases and grammar to fulfill the A1 standards. We practiced our skills 4 out of 5 days of the school week, which was very helpful.",
                "I learned a lot about basic German grammar and vocabulary, and also about language pedagogy, something I had not really consciously known about since learning a second language as a child. I mostly developed my skills in German listening, speaking, and writing through the various activities and exercises.",
                "Course is taught to achieve A1 level proficiency in German by the end of one semester, which many of us were easily able to attain just by keeping up with the classwork and participating. The course is designed to provide ample practice with reading, writing, speaking and reading comprehension, as well as to provide an introduction to German culture.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were the instructor, Zoe. She really made it great and facilitated learning. The weaknesses are the structure. I wish I was able to learn more concrete grammar and not just go through it really quickly.",
                "I love that this course was equally, or at least somewhat equally, split between grammar and conversation. While learning different tenses and vocabulary, we'd be forced to put them into practice with our partners. I also enjoyed the video elements as well of this class. Hearing German from other people was good, not just one great speaker and fifteen or so beginners. \r\nI did not enjoy the amount of work necessary for this class outside of the classroom.",
                "I love the partner speaking session during the class although sometimes it is stressful. I wish there would be more of these since oral is the hardest part for all language. I also wish there would be more vocab session or vocab test. One main obstacle that hinders my understanding of German is the vocab.",
                "The structure of the course was very good, if not a bit fast-paced. Although the fast-paced nature of the course is common in most language courses at Yale. The strengths were the greatest learning environment and the assignments that genuinely aided my understanding of the course material.",
                "The strengths of the course were the in class activities as well as the instructor's guidance and facilitation.While learning a new language is scary, I feel that her presence did a lot to put me at ease and to feel very willing to participate. A weakness of the course is perhaps that the amount of content covered was too high for such a short period of time. Because of this, it seemed to start pretty easy, but quickly ramped up and became much more difficult a few weeks in.",
                "I found one of the biggest strengths of the class to be its highly organized structure, small class size, and ample feedback. I also enjoyed how there were several assignments which were not strictly graded on the correctness of grammar or vocab used, such as the weekly journal entries. I found these assignments to be very helpful in exploring and getting feedback for new/difficult grammar structures, which I probably wouldn't have attempt in a closely graded writing assignment. The course also provided many opportunities to practice speaking with classmates and engaging with written material. I also found a lot of the projects and speaking assignments to be a very fun and creative way to engage with the material. \r\n\r\nThe only way I felt this class could have been improved would be with a more formal/extensive introduction to some of the grammar rules, but other than that it was a very effective class!",
                "This course does a really good job of easing you into an unfamiliar language. I think it struggled with have a) too much busy work and b) somewhat confusing explanations of difficult grammar concepts. The whole course was taught in German (other than the first day or two), which makes sense from an exposure perspective, but makes it really difficult to be learning tricky grammatical constructions when this is your first class learning the language. I think teaching some of the harder concepts in English, while still conducting most of class in German, would have overall increased learning."

                "Definitely. I took this class for fun my senior spring and really enjoyed it. It was fun and I learned a lot.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in learning German and willing to put the work in. The class is standard and I don't know how unique it is relative to other German courses but I left feeling a lot more comfortable in the language than I ever thought I could be.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if Zoe is teaching it! The most kind instructor I have had the pleasure of taking a class with. She really cares about your learning -- down to the smallest, but also important, details. Grading was very fast and feedback was even faster. The variety of assignments was refreshing compared to most other classes, and most everyone got to show off their academic strengths throughout the semester. The course isn't as easy as one might assume, even though German and English share many words and grammar rules, but is 100% worthwhile nonetheless. If I was a first-year student again, I would absolutely consider taking German to fulfill the language requirement.",
                "To someone who is interested in German and Germanistic culture, I would recommend. Because not only does this class teach the language itself, it also introduces the Germanistic culture to quite a depth.",
                "Yes, it was great way to learn German without feeling overwhelmed yet also learning a lot.",
                "Yes. German is not only an extremely fun language, but learning it in a classroom setting makes it so much better. Practicing with classmates and stumbling through the grammar with friends makes it a very enjoyable experience that I would recommend to all students. I would probably let them know that the workload is quite heavy though.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in gaining a strong foundation in German.",
                "If you want to learn German or get a tough but fair language credit, this class is a good option. It's definitely not a gut, but not nearly as bad as some other L1 languages."
