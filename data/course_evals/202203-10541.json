                "I learned so much from this course. I always loved musicals, but this course taught me how to talk about them and why they work. I also learned a lot about how to listen to musical theater and understand it in context of its development over the 20th century. I also got a lot better at writing about theater and music, and got to listen to many musicals I hadn't been exposed to before.",
                "Different methods of writing and analyzing musical theater. Learned the important landmark shows spanning the 20-21st century and their importance.",
                "I gained a much broader understanding of the history of musical theater and its impacts on present day musical theater and the broader theater industry.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Lectures were well-organized, always keeping class at a captivating pace. Cold-calling encouraged students to come to class prepared. We analyzed theater from a variety of perspectives (cultural, musical, technical, etc.), all of which were respected and valued. Egan paid attention to the students as individuals, keeping track of engagement and providing feedback during one-on-one meetings. The class field trip to see a Broadway show and the guest speakers enhanced my learning. \r\nWeaknesses: Final paper prompt was vague; I wasn't sure what the expectations were.",
                "This course's main strength was the organization and format. I loved that we focused on a couple musicals each week in order to tackle wider themes. The only weakness is that sometimes Prof. Egan asks very clearly leading questions since he wants to steer the conversation a certain way. I otherwise really liked the way he managed seminars and I felt like my voice was heard.",
                "Although theres a good amount of reading, the class is very engaging and can be interesting to all types of people with diverse interests. The conversations, readings, and writings were fun and thought-provoking.",
                "I think considering the sheer amount of history, Professor Egan did a great job of organizing the most important works and time periods and giving them attention. Professor Egan is a very thoughtful professor who puts in great amounts of effort to ensure his students are not only participating and retaining information, but that are also enjoying the material and experience.",
                "There were many strengths, such  as the attention to detail, class discussion portion and reading materials selected. More balanced syllabus, it felt like we rushed through certain shows/ era",
                "Dan is a huge strength of the course; you can really tell that he cares about his students as well as the content itself. He created an atmosphere that I always loved coming to."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who cares about musical theater. I learned so much and also it was really fun. I am not a music or theater major but I'm passionate about musicals and that was all I needed to enjoy the class.",
                "Definitely. Great history course under the theater major and great course in general. Also great in identifying whats wrong with the industry and how we can change it. Whether or not you think youre interested in musical theater, take this course to influence that or inspire you to take action in it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, specifically those interested in theater and musical theater history. It is incredibly valuable particularly for those interested in the industry currently, because everything that exists today in theater is derived from its history (especially throughout musical theater).",
                "Yes 100%",
                "YES, if you get in take the class!"
