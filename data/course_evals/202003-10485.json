                "Fascinating and engaging content. Well-taught.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures and reasonable assignments. Engaging and fun lectures",
                "Strengths - modules were organized, topics were interesting \r\nweaknesses - many long readings that weren't really necessary for understanding material",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, interesting lectures, small discussion sections, great TAs\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "I enjoyed how this course was designed. Having recorded lectures were very helpful as it allowed me to learn the content at my own pace. Furthermore,  it let me review material I found confusing at first and refresh my memory on certain topics when needed.",
                "Having the lectures prerecorded allowed the freedom of choosing when to watch them and devote time to the course. The virtual format of the discussion sections had its difficulties and limitations, but other innovations like the virtual escape room that we completed also made up for what we missed by not being in person.",
                "The rigor of the course will depend on your TA. Some TA's were very kind and lenient, while others were quite strict with grading.",
                "This course has many strengths. It offers a very solid foundation for anyone interested in the disciplines of art history and classical civilization. The writing prompts were always interesting and engaging, and offered a lot of room for choice. My only comment is that I wish we had been able to spend more time with some of the more complex readings (Bacchae, Oresteia, etc.)",
                "Strengths: amazing and engaging professor, my TA was wonderful and always sympathetic, lectures were interesting and looked at various art forms\/ media\/ written sources for each topic. Relaxed on the assignment side - I took the class non-WR and wrote a paper at the end of September, a final paper in December and did a take-home final exam during finals period. I cannot think of a single weakness in this class.",
                "I think section is really nice and engaging, but there was definitely more work than I anticipated. There's a lot of readings every week and the papers can be a bit difficult if you aren't familiar with writing these types of papers. I think the module lessons and the mini questions every week were fine and pretty thought provoking.",
                "Strengths: the content of the course is fascinating, it changes the way you think about art. It is also very friendly to non-art majors who have never taken an art course before. The grading was also pretty chill and easy. I also liked how the length of the lectures each week only amounted to about an hour a week, making it manageable. Weaknesses: I would have preferred if the lectures were live. I know this is not a normal year, and in normal times we would have been live. But, if she must teach this course again online, I think it would be more engaging to teach live and then record the lecture and post for students to see.",
                "I think the class was very engaging in sections and the professor had a lot of energy in lectures. A normal strength of the course is that many of the pieces we discuss are in the YUAG, so we were unfortunately not able to go as a class to see them. The YUAG did a great job of taking pictures and videos of the art so we could still get good views of it and write about it effectively!",
                "loved the recorded lectures, no improvements",

                "I feel as if the class was structured well to facilitate a smooth transition to online learning. I liked the module quizzes as a re-enforcement of learning. However, I felt as if by module 13 it was redundant.",
                "The strengths of the course was the organization of the mini lectures; the information discussed was clear and thorough on the slides and Professor Gaifman was animated and energized as she discussed the material. The weakness was the specificity of some of the response questions -- in some cases, I would have liked the opportunity to respond on some of the most interesting things that I found within any given mini lecture, rather than responding to a niche and pointed question.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and engaging. The assignments were progressively more demanding, in line with what we were learning.",
                "Lectures would have been more fun in person, but overall this class was very good.",
                "Strengths: great teaching fellows, spirited professor, and pretty chill for a WR credit\r\nCons: Final exam was incredibly long and difficult given we only had 48 hours to write 16 pages (double-spaced)",
                "I really enjoyed the mii lectures and the creative activities we did in section. It would have been nice to go over the readings a bit more in session as sometimes I felt like they were hard to digest. I did find that the end of term essay and exam came way too close to each other and the finals for this course were the heaviest of all of my courses.",

                "I really liked the course and thought the content\/material was really interesting.",
                "Strengths: topics are very passionately and clearly taught. TF was helpful and timely with feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload of each week can vary by a LOT which can be somewhat jarring especially when heavy weeks fall on weeks that are already heavy from other classes",
                "I think that this course did a very good job of engaging students given the restrictions of COVID. The pre-recorded lectures were very manageable to watch before section, and section did a great job of synthesizing the information that we learned from the recordings.",
                "I think the workload could have been more evenly distributed- the workload was quite low until the end of the course where we had a final paper and a final exam which were both very time-consuming.",
                "Professor Gaifman is super high energy and made the mini-lectures really interesting. Section was very engaging as the TFs put together unique and fun activities for each week.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are very clear and interesting. I like that lectures are broken up into smaller, more manageable parts. Prof Gaifman is passionate about the material and makes each lecture super engaging. The workload is also very manageable. The final essay was genuinely fun to write because you can choose any topic you want. Weaknesses: The progression in material from week to week sometimes felt a bit random and disorganized -- I would love to have a more clear connection between each module. In the first few lectures, I would also liked to have learned more Greek art terminology (ie names of common decorative patterns, names of different types of vases), instead of learning these terms sporadically throughout all the lectures.",
                "It was very well planned.",
                "Very good class.",
                "Strengths: Such a fun and engaging class! I learned so much about Greek art and history. \r\nWeaknesses: I mini-lectures and the questions which followed took a while to complete and submit. The lectures were normally longer than 20 minutes, but the benefit through Zoom is that you can easily change to 2x speed.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting course, LOVE professor Gaifman\r\nWeaknesses: Grading system was wack, some things count for way more than they should. Final exam was SO LONG and only worth 10%",
                "Very engaging and interesting",
                "I thought it was really well organized. I loved the little mini escape room they made for us in the middle of the semester. I also think discussion sections were always really enjoyable and were good companions to the lecture. The sections didn't feel like a drag at all and allowed us to visually interact with art pieces related to the myths we had learned that week.",
                "Although having pre recorded mini lectures was a major positive in terms of timing, it did not make the class feel like a Yale class. It was just a series of prerecorded lectures.",
                "Strengths: you get a lot of out of this course without too much workload. It's pretty easy to get good grades. You cover a lot of ground in Greek mythology and have the potential to learn a lot. The content is really fun and Prof. Gaifman is super dedicated and a wonderful lecturer. Also, the class is really well-organized. I could tell that Prof. Gaifman and all the TAs put a TON of work into it! Weaknesses: This class was almost too easy. We moved pretty slowly in section sometimes, especially when going over the basics of writing. E.g. we asked, what is a thesis statement? But overall it was a good class.",
                "The strength of the course was how accomodating it was. Each week there was a module that contained 4 twenty minute mini-lectures. We just had to watch the lecture before the weekly section, and there was one question relating to each lecture that was very simple to do. The course material was all centered around mythology, and it was great seeing the connections between the modules. However, the course was not very stimulating. If you already possess a thorough knowledge of Greek mythology, there is nothing new that you will learn from this course. It was a great fifth credit.",
                "strengths: clear course format and expectations, TA's always available for help",
                "Strengths: Amazing TF's who were very involved and engaging. Course material was interesting and Professor Gaifman made each recorded lecture enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More synchronous lectures - felt like I did not get to know Professor Gaifman that well.",
                "Overall, this course was incredible! It was so thoughtfully adapted for Zoom and extremely organized. The workload was manageable, and our discussions in section were always so rich and engaging. No weaknesses in my opinion!!",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed getting to see the actual historical art pieces and classic readings. The lectures were really well done too, and consistently interesting. They were really welcome amidst an otherwise very tough semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: man so much busy work with answering module questions each week. I don't know how this happened, but they would always somehow take me much longer than I anticipated, even watching the lectures on 2x speed. It was also tough having both a final exam and final paper.",
                "Professor Gaifman has this course down to a science - she really knows how best to organize it to facilitate student learning and excitement. Each week, the topics were exciting and the lectures packed in a lot of information in an easily consumable way.",
                "It was a really fun course; however, I do wish that for the final paper we had workshops on how to choose a topic instead of letting us go out and choose any and all topics.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures was good because the concepts were fairly straightforward and nice to do on our own time. \r\nThen if we had any questions we could go over them with our TAs in section.",
                "The course adapted to online learning amazingly. There were 4 mini lectures a week around 15-20 each this made it easy to watch, and they were uploaded a week prior to the deadline giving plenty of time to watch.",
                "Absolutely loved this course!\r\nThe option to have it WR or non WR is fantastic",
                "Take the course!",
                "The final was only 10% of the grade but the total amount of writing required to answer the question was greater than the final paper that was weighted much more heavily. This made the final not as important and took a substantial amount of time in finals period even though we had written a final paper as well.",
                "section could be improved to discuss what we read more instead of doing random activities",
                "I thought it was taught really well!",
                "I thought the mini lecture setting was great and I loved how I could watch the videos on my own time",
                "Strengths: professor and TFs were awesome, content was super interesting, papers werent too work-intensive so I still found them really enjoyable to write (non WR credit)\r\nWeaknesses: the final is pretty overwhelming if you dont prepare well (expectations were to aim for 1000 words per prompt for 4 prompts in 48 hrs) but it was open-note so it wasnt horribleyou just need to know your sources pretty well",
                "The pre recorded lectures allowed the students to move at their own pace",
                "I loved the module style as well as the final essay instructions. It made a terrible semester not as terrible because I was able to include something I loved in my final essay.",
                "Professor Gaifman is a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic lecturer, which was clear even through the recorded lectures. She is easy to understand. Additionally, there were only 1hr20 minutes of lectures a week, as she recorded them in four 20-minute videos. The course is excellent as it already is.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaifman was super enthusiastic and taught really well, pretty chill course structure, interesting material, lenient grading, not too hard so I feel like that incentivized me to learn more \r\nWeaknesses: lectures felt like a chore at times which was my fault since I put it all to the last day. Would be nice to incentivize doing them before the last day (maybe have them due on Tuesday and Thursday or something)",
                "The strengths of the course were its modules every week and the participation we would get from answering questions. I also liked the section because it was heavily discussion based.",
                "Seeing art in person and more discussion would be great!",
                "This course was formatted well for virtual learning, with weekly video modules and weekly discussion sections.",
                "Major gut, easy grading, and our TA was amazing.",
                "Strengths: The teaching staff.  From my own experience and what I'd heard from friends in the class, the TAs were really strong all around, plus Professor Gaifman's mini lectures were always high-energy, never boring. The YUAG designed special materials for the class, so even though it wasn't the experience of going there to look at the objects, we still got to see the impressive range of artwork from this time that Yale has to offer. The open-book, two-day window final with a choice of prompts allowed us to focus on the themes that'd made the biggest impact on us throughout the semester in a pretty low-stress way, where you could be absolutely fine by just watching the lectures and doing the most central readings without feeling the need to be taking extensive notes during the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a weakness, but something potentially to consider for future versions of the class: we spent a lot of time talking in broad strokes about the \"heroic\" type of man that recurs in pottery and friezes, but we never considered on the whole how Greek antiquity thought of\/illustrated women on the whole even though we discussed several of them as one-offs.",
                "Very well organized, interactive, interesting and in general I loved it.",
                "Overall this course was fun and engaging, and geared towards improving our writing skills!",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaifman is engaging, and her lectures are super informative. The content presented is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many. I did not enjoy this class for the sheer amount of work that you have to do just for a humanities credit. The Hu credit is only different from the WR credit by one paper, so this was definitely more work than your average Hu class. The mini-lectures were engaging, but the mini-lecture quizzes were very annoying and often required a lot of work and writing. I also disliked how Hu papers were treated to a similar level to the WR papers which only made scoring a good grade harder. The final exam was completely unnecessary with the amount of work that we had to put throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nYour experience will heavily depend on your TF, as the only interaction with Professor Gaifman was through the mini-lectures and the office hours. I just wish that Professor Gaifman gave us personal feedback which I would have found much more valuable and fair to be honest. Some TFs (like mine) are very strict, and had made this class terrible.",
                "strenghts: pre-recorded mini lectures",
                "The course was great. More input on how to get an A on a paper would be nice. Also no final would be gret as well because there is a final paper.",
                "I loved the module format. Sometimes the questions or assignments during sections felt superfluous.",
                "The multimedia use and the enthusiasm of all instructors was refreshing and helped me see the multifaceted nature of the relevance of this course to everything from literature allusions to medical terms.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaifmans lectures were absolutely fascinating. The content of the course was fun and accessible and yet also complex and intellectually stimulating. The exam was representative of our learning and we were given a good amount of time to prepare our papers. Mitchell gave me immensely helpful and clear feedback on my writing, facilitating my growth throughout the semester. Section discussions and presentations were always engaging and deepened my understanding of the course material. \r\nWeaknesses: Some weeks, the volume of readings was difficult to complete in addition to the lectures. Even so, it was still doable with careful planning."

                "Recorded lectures were not too effective. It was difficult to conceptualize the art without seeing it firsthand. However, given the circumstances, there's not much else one could do.",
                "The mini-lecture format was well-designed. It was really great to actively engage with the material after each lecture and conduct your own investigation\/analysis of the ideas covered. Each module split the time well between lecture, reading, and responses. The synchronous discussion section then reinforced and furthered the thinking that I had done on my own.",
                "I think the recorded lectures worked extremely well. It allowed me a lot of flexibility, especially in a different time zone, and gave me the freedom to manage my workload for the week and rearrange it as necessary. The lectures were broken into four 20-minute videos each week which was highly effective in promoting concentration for those spaces of time, with opportunities to break in between. The short response questions to each mini-lecture were really helpful for synthesising the content of the lecture and practising visual analysis, and were essentially graded complete\/not-complete. This said, the weekly live discussion sections were a great chance to discuss as a group the themes of the module, and my TA did a wonderful job of guiding us through the activities and answering any questions we had about the material.",
                "I liked how the course was asynchronous so that I could really spend time on learning when I had free time. I think again, there was a ton of reading each week.",

                "I thought that for any class being taught asynchronously, the mini lecture format was great -- it allowed me to take breaks if needed and increased the likelihood that I would stay actively engaged throughout the entire unit. I could watch the mini lectures and response to the questions at different times if needed and could go at my own pace. I think that some of the practices that could be improved for future semesters is being more intentional with the readings that were assigned. Being very intentional about which readings are assigned and how long they are (finding the most important parts that relate to what we are talking about) is key for student engagement and there were often times that we would not even discuss some of the readings that were assigned to us in section.",
                "I liked everything!",

                "The recorded lectures, the Module format, the interactive activities--all of it was perfect for learning virtually. This was by far one of the best virtual courses I took this semester.",
                "The format was great - the balance between the recorded lectures and the live discussion sections worked really well. I do believe that the discussion sections sometimes felt too short to actually be useful - by the time we really got going on something, the section was already coming to a close. The major issue was the final exam. The format of the final exam was not good. I don't know how it worked before COVID times, but I (and two of my other friends who took the course, I found out after) ended up taking over six hours on this exam that was meant to be three and a half at the most. There weren't that many prompts, but each was meant to be 1000 words each (which is four pages double spaced), and we were meant to go through the lectures and our notes to find specific examples to reference as the basis of our answers. This is a great concept in theory but in order to organize an outline (because we had no idea what examples we would actually need beforehand), we had to first choose our prompts and spend a significant amount of time finding relevant examples that we didn't necessarily have planned out before, and then write about twelve pages of total content. Not only did this feel like way too much time and effort for an introductory art history course final, but it also didn't help me make new connections within the content - I only spent hours researching and writing to explain concepts I either already talked about in section, or I already learned in the course of the class. The final felt a bit pointless for the exorbitant amount of work it required and it expected too much in order to sufficiently complete it according to the rubric and explanations of the exam requirements in class. Answering two of those prompts would have been sufficient and still allowed me to finish in the expected time period. But to expect the equivalent of a twelve-page essay, well-researched and with specific visual and textual examples, was way too much for a three and a half hour exam.",
                "pre-recorded lectures were good in conjunction with the sections",
                "The course adapted to online learning amazingly. There were 4 mini lectures a week around 15-20 each this made it easy to watch, and they were uploaded a week prior to the deadline giving plenty of time to watch.",
                "They all succeeded! The mini lectures were perfect in combination with section\r\nLoved the interactive activities!\r\n\r\nHowever, changing the syllabus midsemester from quizzes in section to miniessays wasnt great",
                "Recorded lectures were good, sections could be improved as they often felt unnecessary",
                "The recorded mini-lectures are very structured and organized",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were great and very engaging and the activities in the section allowed the course material to be thoroughly discussed.",
                "I think the recorded lectures were excellent and were very engaging. Thank you Prof. Gaifman!",
                "none",
                "The efforts that the professor and TFs put in to make this class possible this year was phenomenal! Although we couldnt go to the art gallery this year, it was honestly refreshing how much they tried to recreate the experience online to make it as close to an in-person experience as possible. Lectures were all recorded, which allowed us to watch the lectures at a time that was more convenient (they did have to be completed by a certain deadline though, variable by TF). The professor and TFs also coordinated a democratic election and a virtual scavenger hunt, so that made things kind of interesting. I think my only complaint was the final exam. Its not that I had to write four 1000-word essays because the exam was open-note. Its that somehow they thought I could complete four 1000-word essays in 3 hours. LMFAOOOOOO I cant think and type that fast and still expect a decent grade. At least they gave us 48 hours though, and as said before, it was open-note\/open-book, so I guess that kind of made up for it.",
                "With each pre recorded lecture, there was a canvas question to keep the students engaged with the material",
                "I think this class as a whole succeeded, despite my own problems this semester which made my own time a bit difficult. The instructor did everything to make this as fun and easy as possible.",
                "The recorded lectures were very useful in the COVID-19 pandemic, as students can watch and rewatch at any time that they please. However, in the future, I highly recommend live lectures that are recorded. This may take longer (as the professor cannot cut\/squeeze the video) but it is a huge incentive for students to actually watch the lectures on time (which was a struggle with recorded lectures) as well as have an opportunity for students to ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe weekly Zoom discussion sections with a few students per section was very useful.\r\n\r\nThe biggest downside was the final exam, which was writing four 1000-word essays. Though it was offered in a 48-hr window, the professor designed it to be able to completed in a standard 3 hours, but I took MUCH longer than 3 hours. 4000 good-quality words is impossible in just 3 hours--I took nearly 8 hours to write the whole thing.",
                "Everything here was good",
                "I felt like the weekly recorded modules with questions were a success. I felt like we needed more time for the final paper however.",
                "Knowing more of Yales collections even if you cant go in person would have been cool",
                "It was perfect!!",
                "Pre-recorded lectures allowed for better time management.",
                "Professor Gaifman's recorded lectures were interesting and engaging. Section was helpful in recalling key concepts from the lectures and an additional chance to dive deeper into topics and ask questions.",
                "Recorded lectures and virtual sections is the best combination.",
                "I think this was set up really well. The module format plus live sections helped me get the most out of this class. It facilitated my interest and engagement.",
                "The recorded lectures and specifically the \"mini-lecture\" format was a godsend. Although it was very tedious at times to click my way through it, I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the instructor to segment them.",
                "I really loved the format of the course. The asynchronous lectures really accommodated me as a student with accommodations because of the captions and the ability to replay any part\/ access the lectures at any times. Professor Gaifman made every single lesson SO engaging and memorable. I felt the modules were extremely well organized and so the flow through the content in the semester was seamless and made complete sense. The readings enriched my learning and helped me prepare for the exams, so it was great that we could access the virtual modules all semester long. The synchronous discussions were fabulous because they gave us the more personal element, as did the two synchronous sessions with Professor Gaifman. These each helped me to answer questions and think even deeper about the material. Mitchell was very accommodating, kind, and knowledgeable, and it was a real privilege to learn from him, particularly about the art; he was so interesting to learn from!",

                "Yes! Great class",
                "Yes! I highly recommend this course. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the material!",
                "Absolutely would recommend to anyone with an interest in ancient Greek myth\/literature\/art.",
                "Necessary class for understanding the world.",
                "Yes! Phenomenal class that I would recommend to anyone at Yale. If you have any interest in Greek Mythology, I couldn't recommend this course enough.",
                "Yes! The class was very interesting and the workload was very reasonable. I feel like I learned a lot and would recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject.",
                "I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in greek myths and gods. The lectures were entertaining and the work was super manageable.",
                "yes, Prof Gaifman is very passionate and a great teacher.",
                "Yes, it's a really interesting course that doesn't drain you mentally. It was a great break from my STEM courses and allowed me to think freely about new and exciting topics",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course, even if it is not required for your major. I really enjoyed learning about ancient Greece, the myths associated with it, and analyzing ancient objects. Since many things in today's society are influenced by the works of ancient Greece, it was interesting to learn more about the past, and their beliefs and culture.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Greek mythology and would like an insight into the humanities. This was the first course where I had to use the Chicago Style in the papers, so it was great exposure and a great learning experience.",
                "Yes, if you want a relatively manageable workload with a writing credit.",
                "yes, so fun and learned a ton",
                "I would recommend this course. The material is very accessible and students need not worry about having any previous background in Classics or art history. The assignments are engaging and the workload is very manageable. You will come away with a solid foundation in the visual and literary traditions of Ancient Greece.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major or academic background. I took this class as an art history major and loved every second of it, and non-majors in the class also found it phenomenal. It delves into an area of art that is often touched upon in survey courses but doesn't usually get its own class, particularly regarding the emphasis upon myth. It does a great job of introducing art history as an academic discipline, teaching visual analysis, and making the content of the class relevant to everyday life and other academic disciplines by highlighting the similarities in the later western literary and artistic traditions, and in modern pop culture. Yale's art history department is incredible, and I think this class gives a beautiful and hugely accessible insight into art history as a whole and into an excellent department within the university.",
                "Yes, I think overall the course was super interesting. If anyone has any slight interest in Greek mythology, this would be a great course. Although I would proceed with caution because there's a lot of discussion about art and not just mythology.",
                "Yes I would recommend. I have to say that it is not a complete gut, however, if that is what you are looking for. I find that there is a medium amount of work to do, but that work is laid back, fun, and interesting. This class changes the way you think about art, and for that I love it. I could tell that this course would have been even more amazing in person because you could interact with the art in the YUAG for sections. But, even with the remote nature of the course, the Professor and the TFs did a wonderful job of showing us the artwork and making the course as engaging as they could.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Greek art or Greek mythology or who needs an interesting writing credit.",
                "YES!!!! Definitely take it you learn so much and will not regret it",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! I loved the content that we discussed and as a non-art major it was definitely great dipping my toes into the subject. Great professor and TFs too!",
                "I don't know if I would recommend this course to another student. Although I enjoyed it, it was a bit too intensive and I would recommend another student to take it only if they were especially interested in Ancient Greek art and mythology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is learning to learn about greek mythology in the context of art. Anyone who is interested in evaluating and analyzing art should take this class as each myth\/story\/god is discussed in the context of an artifact that depicts it.",
                "Yes! It is a great class for students who do not have a strong background in art history, but are interested in Greek mythology and want to learn how to conduct visual analysis. Because the artwork is connected to so many myths, it makes them even more enticing.",
                "Yes, I would, but only if they are really interested in the topic.",
                "Totally. It was fun and interesting. It was a joy to read myths that read like dramatic stories and then think about how they impacted Greek culture. I also think that the asks in terms of workload were very reasonable (save the heavy final load).",
                "Yes. This was a great course to take. Even as a writing credit the essays were interesting and fun to write.",
                "This was one of the most interesting courses I've taken",
                "Yes!  Fantastic course with lots of interesting mythology and beautiful artwork",
                "I loved this course, would highly recommend! I took it as a fourth credit in a difficult semester, but you could definitely take it as a reasonable fifth credit. I've been able to use what I've learned in this course in readings for other class and for leisure, as well as when visiting museums. It's cool to look at the ancient art and actually understand the context of the images! One of my favorite classes for sure.",
                "Yes, definitely! The material is really interesting",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! The amount of reading is overall pretty manageable, it can get rough for certain weeks but this can be planned ahead for. For a writing class, this class has 2 papers and a final paper (and a pretty easy final exam) so it's pretty easy as they go. Above all, this course is an excellent introduction into Greek mythology and art depicting Greek mythology that is engaging and fun!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in exploring Greek myth and Greek art in antiquity. The professor and teaching fellows were all very welcoming! Also, this course required no previous knowledge of Greek myth and art, and so students of all backgrounds can feel ready for the course.",
                "Yes, I think it's a very fun and interesting course!",
                "Yes, I think this was a great class for anyone looking for an accessible way to learn more about both art history and art analysis, as well as the ancient Greek world of myth.",
                "Yes, definitely! The material you learn is interesting, and the workload is reasonable. The class is also very accessible to all majors, and you genuinely learn a lot about Greek art and visual analysis. A great 5th class.",
                "If you need a humanities credit, highly recommend this class. It's fun and very informational.",
                "Yes. This is a fun and educational gut.",
                "YES! If you read Percy Jackson as a kid this IS the class for you. Midway through the course I went to my local museum and found myself spending so much time looking at the Greek art section. Before I would just walk past Greek vessels, but now I can mostly identify the figures on the vessels and can better appreciate the context in which they were once used. Try to get Soffia as your TF! She made the class so fun and enjoyable.",
                "Yes!  Professor Gaifman is great!  I think it would be even better if there had been in-person sections, but the professor and TFs really made a great effort trying to make the class good.  It wasn't much workyou really get out of it what you put inand I guess one con was that there were a lot of people who didn't really care.  But if you want a gut, as long as you're willing to do all the assignments and talk a bit in section, it didn't feel very hard.  That said, if you actually do the readings and engage with the material, it's very interesting.",
                "Yes, good humanities\/WR gut. Topics are also very interesting.",
                "Yes. Very interesting and fun.",
                "Yes! One of my favorite ones this semester. It was a great form of escapism. Professor Gaifman is a fantastic lecturer.",
                "Yes I think so! This class makes it really fun and easy to engage with Greek mythology. It's very accessible, and it connects the material to the present really well. For example, we often talked about movie adaptations of Greek myths, like Disney's Hercules. That made it fun. But I'm not sure I would recommend it if you know a lot about Greek mythology or art history already. It's definitely geared to non-Classics majors. But it's really fun, so all in all, yes I would recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course! Professor Gaifman was a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor. The course wasn't much work, and each week I enjoyed studying mythology and participating in weekly discussions!",
                "yes: clear expectations, interesting lectures, nice teaching assistants",
                "Absolutely - this class is a great way to explore outside your comfort zone without having a burdensome workload. The papers we write in this class are pretty open-ended which welcome a great degree of creativity. The TFs are amazing and everyone seems to genuinely enjoy teaching the subject.",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to any student from any background. Even if you don't have a particular interest in Greek myth, I guarantee this course will spark one in you!",
                "I would definitely recommend, especially if you have any interest in Greek mythology.",
                "Yes definitely!",
                "Yes especially if you have some knowledge in greek myths. Very engaging course",
                "Yes I absolutely recommend this course to other students! Great knowledge to learn and fascinating material covered.",
                "YES! A great course. Professor Giafman is great and made the online classes fun. My TF was also amazing and the course was really interesting.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a fantastic way to get a writing credit, as the material is very interesting and engaging. Professor Gaifman is an incredibly enthusiastic lecturer, and I looked forward to watching the new set of lectures each week. This class made me want to visit Greece one day, just to see all the great art and history there.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Very very interesting and fun!",
                "Yes, Greek mythology is an interesting topic and this course covers that. If not that interested in art then maybe look elsewhere because the papers are quite restricting in what you can write about since the focus has to be entirely about the visual analysis",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes, the material is very interesting an is a great course to get your writing credit in as the TAs are very helpful and willing to help.",
                "most definitely whether youre looking for a Hu, Wr, or interesting class. I'm a stem major and this class was really different for me but i enjoyed it a lot. Be prepared to write though!",
                "Absolutely, pretty easy credit but still super interesting. Learned a lot.",
                "yes, very interesting",
                "definitely",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I world recommend it to any student at Yale. Its not too much pressure, the content is super interesting, and the professor and TF (Philippe) were the best!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is an interesting course with a writing credit option. Since I do not like writing that much, it was not that bad to write about something that I found interesting.",
                "YES! I only had issue due to COVID and personal troubles, but this course is an escape from all that, please take this course. Professor Gaifman is lovely and so clearly passionate and knowledgeable of the ancient world.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Especially if you are interested in clarifying your childhood knowledge of Greek Mythology, or if you have an inkling of interest in art history. Note that it is not a gut--you will need to watch the lectures and do most of the readings to thoroughly learn the material to do well on the final exam, as well as put effort into your writing and analysis in the 3 essays you will write. However, you will receive clear feedback from the TA on how to improve. The final exam is four 1000-word essays, which is doable. Probably a great course to Credit\/D\/F",
                "Yes. Super interesting and not too tough so you walk away learning a lot and not being bitter about it",
                "Yes, its a lower workload and super engaging and the information taught is interesting.",
                "YES, it is a brilliant course !!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Though the material taught in this course is not particularly hard to grasp, you still need to spend time working on the weekly modules and participating in class to do well. You may fall behind if you dont dedicate your time to it. You should also know this class is primarily about analyzing Greek pottery and sculptures based on what you learn regarding mythology - which I was unclear about when entering the course.",
                "Yes!!! Amazing HU - interesting content to spiel about at parties, and if your TA is good you might get into some more philosophical discussions to understand the role art plays in society. It's not just for old rich folks.",
                "Yes",
                "Definitely. I know a lot of people took this as a chill writing or humanities credit, which it definitely is, but everyone could find this class rewarding since the texts we read and characters we talk about come up all the time as references in modern books\/movies\/etc and the experience of the course itself was pretty enjoyable.",
                "Yes please take it! Super engaging",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think they will enjoy it very much. Also, Greek art and myth is something that people should be familiar with because it represents early human creativity, and the advancement and the presence of the complexity of human thought from long ago to this day.",
                "Yes, excellent course, not that hard and very interesting!",
                "Yes! Good course for both majors and non-majors. Topics are fun and interesting, professors and TFs are enthusiastic, and TFs give thorough feedback on all assignments to improve your writing.",
                "No. Do not take this class as an Hu credit. Only take this class as a CR\/D\/F. This is not a gut class as I have initially thought (and this is coming from a STEM student like you).",
                "Yes! I thought the course was great because we could learn really interesting material, but in a friendly and low-stress environemnt.",
                "Yes! The TAs and faculty were great. Love Professor Gaifman.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and Professor Gaifman is very good at explaining.",
                "Sure! It is refreshing and interesting for anyone who has any interest in Greek myth and\/or art. I learned some cool things that will be fun to reference, think, and talk about in the future even though I am no art historian.",
                "Yes, for anyone who wants a good survey of Greek mythology and its historical presence in Ancient Greece, this is a great course to take.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this course and it answered so many questions I've had about childhood stories while also giving me a background in art and architecture styles.  It helped me become a more well-versed human.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone who wants to better understand our modern civilization can greatly benefit from a richer knowledge of Ancient Greece and this is the best course for that. The course nurtured my passions for Greek mythology and art, pushing me to connect the two and see how they continue to interact today in contemporary art, movie, literature, and television. It was the most interesting course I took this semester and the Professor\/section leaders were so dynamic and helpful.",
                "Yes very interesting, especially if you like any kind of mythology or like ancient religions",
                "Yes, it was an extremely fun class!"
