                "I learned about the practice of moving and being present in the moment. Before this class, I understood dance mostly as a display  albeit a joyful one  but was not aware of the theoretical and research-heavy potential. Through this class, I learned about the body's importance in bridging the divide between theoretical and practical matters.",
                "I learned a lot about postmodern dance, including the history of it and how to perform it.",
                "Having not had any dance background, I feel like I have learnt a great deal. The selected readings were really really great (And I am someone who doesn't like reading). Movement exercises in class were super experimental and I loved every minute of it. They pushed you out of your comfort zone, and each experimentation from different artists made you think differently.",
                "This course was an absolute wonderful exploration of a seminal body of movement/performance work, whilst also maintaining a critical eye towards the shortcomings on the work, which was really refreshing and liberating as a queer/BIPOC student. It was also just a really enlightening dive into embodied learning in general.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of my own body within itself and in relation to the spaces we live in. This knowledge will follow me throughout the rest of my life.",
                "Knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of postmodern dance, including some of the key figures and choreographic pieces. Was an opportunity to get in touch with my body."

                "The ability to experience this course in person is its primary strength. The structure of the class wherein we built up to the set exercise of that session through a series of warmups  from the body checks to the Cunningham moves  was very useful in tuning into movement research. It opened up the possibility of research in each class.",
                "This course was excellently organized. The readings built upon each other well and the classes reflected the week's readings. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course, I really enjoyed it.",
                "There is a great range of approaches that are explored in this class. Movement exercises are great. I loved hearing from dancer's themselves, something felt very organic about the class, especially when we saw academics and dancers discuss work amongst themselves in one class. It felt like you were watching professionals delve about topics that were clearly so deeply personal to them.",
                "I really cannot think of any weakness of this course, beyond maybe I would have liked more solo choreographic assignments, to then be performed and discussed live in class, as I would have loved to zoom further into each student's experience and artistry as a dancer.",
                "This class was the highlight of my week. During class you get to dance and explore movement for the first hour and a half, then come back together and make sense of what you just experienced. I absolutely loved every minute of it.",
                "I love love loved this class!!! Really interesting, generative readings. I don't consider myself a dancer but the exercises and readings we did helped to influence and inspire my art practice."

                "Yes. This is a fantastic course taught by an excellent and invested Professor. She cares deeply about students, and is invested in their personal development and understanding of dance. It is hard to come by at Yale, I am very appreciative of Emily's time and efforts, and as a result have learnt a great deal. The course is very experimental - there are no wrong means or methods. It is truly a canvas, a testbed, for experimentation.\r\n\r\nGreat Course. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes yes yes with every fibre of my being! Professor Coates is incredible, and I have both learned so much and had so much fun with this course :)",
                "Yes yes yes yes yes! Absolutely take this course if you can. It's an amazing experience that brings you closer to yourself/your own body through movement exploration. It was the highlight of my week every week.",
                "Highly recommend. Emily Coates is a kind, generous, attentive, and a super devoted professor. Her classroom environment made me feel very welcome and ready to stretch myself and take risks. I'd especially encourage people who'd like to dance but have little experience, or are a bit nervous, to take this course. Postmodern dance is for everyone <3"
