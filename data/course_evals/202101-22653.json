This course also taught me how to critically engage with long readings.",

Not only have I learned a lot about women in the area, but about the culture, politics, and economy of places I had never had the opportunity to learn much about. I learned a lot from my classmates and from Professor Khan, and I think I've gained a good grasp on the status of women in South Asia, and the reasonings for that. I honestly feel very enlightened by this class, and have really enjoyed my experience.",

We talked about labor force participation, sexual violence, education, property rights  and the intersectionality of different parts of identity.

                "Strengths: The course syllabus was thoughtfully crafted to allow us to make connections between readings week-to-week and build on the knowledge we had already gained. The course format was similarly well-crafted to allow for time for learning, discussion, and student-led reflections. Professor Khan also fostered such an empowering, kind, and inclusive teaching environment that made coming to class each week an absolute pleasure. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: Professor Khan is a phenomenal professor; she is incredibly knowledgable on and passionate about this topic and genuinely cares about her students--without a doubt, she is the greatest strength of this course. The readings are all incredibly fascinating and I think the course is well organized. I really enjoyed how all the readings connected to and built upon one another. Another important strength is that this course truly highlights how complex and interwoven this issue is.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no real weaknesses. There are sometimes a lot of readings in a given week but there was never an overwhelming or undoable amount. (I also think this is true of all seminar courses, it's really just a matter of personal time management.)",
                "Strengths: The readings were all very manageable, and very enlightening too. Most of the time, they were the readings I looked most forward to in my work week. The discussion posts were also a good way of getting my thoughts together for the class. \r\nWeaknesses: I think two rather than three reading responses would have been better suited for this course, and a bit more spread out.",
                "I think the main strength of this course is Professor Khan's passion for the subject, and her extensive knowledge of it. All of the readings she picked were super interesting and relevant, and always left me thinking. I think one weakness is the design of the weekly student presentations. A lot of times, these discussions were mainly a summary of the readings we all did I think a focus on discussion, or talking about how readings might fit together, might be more productive.",
                "strengths: Professor Khan is amazing, content is really interesting, expectations are clear, course is well organized\r\nweaknesses: pretty heavy reading and writing workload",
                "Strengths: the readings were incredibly interesting, the discussion structure was really well facilitated, the response papers were fun to write and overall I think this was a great class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes starting the class with a presentation slowed down discussion a little bit. I would also have loved to gotten more feedback on my paper.",

                "Strength: the readings, discussions, professors willingness to engage \r\nWeakness: sometimes discussions went on for too long and became redundant, I think it might be worth it for Professor Khan to put a pin on conversations once the flow stops.\r\n\r\nMaybe change some of the readings?",

While political economy of gender in South Asia is a strong focus of the course (and is an absolutely fascinating region to focus on if you are interested in gender), it also teaches gender and political theory that are applicable to other regions and promote a broad understanding of gender. I can't say enough positive things about Professor Khan or this course!",
                "Yes! If you're even semi-interested in learning more about this issue, I definitely recommend taking this course. You learn a lot about gender inequality in South Asia and the many forms it takes. Class discussions are always interesting and the class environment is comfortable and welcoming so you're never afraid to speak up or ask a question. Professor Khan is super understanding and passionate about this issue; she's an amazing professor and is super knowledgable. There is no right or wrong answer to a lot of the questions we discuss in this course and our discussions always felt super productive.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Not only is the content enriching and interesting, but Professor Khan's teaching style and thoughtful contributions make the class even better.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interested in gender and in the South Asian region. Although the course focuses on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the gender issues these countries face are similar to ones around the world. Additionally, while the South Asian lens definitely adds another nuance to the discussion, a lot of issues we discuss equality and the labor force, property rights, empowerment, etc.are parts of the general dialogue on gender equality as well.",
                "yes! the professor is great, content is interesting, and I felt like the course gave me a really deep understanding of gender inequality in South Asia",
                "I would! This class was really interesting and the theories we learnt expanded out of the South Asian context. It is very reading heavy so be prepared to put in the work but the readings are always relevant and not too theoretical. Professor Khan is also really wonderful and directs conversation very well.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, especially if you are a woman from South Asia/want to learn more about gender in South Asia. You will learn so much!!!",
