I would feel more comfortable rotating in a synthetic lab after taking this course.  I feel I developed much better intuition about how reactions will go given the starting materials and reagents. I became more comfortable designing syntheses.",

Although the topics covered were few, the depth and specificity of the covered reactions will be extremely helpful and insightful for anyone interested in a career in chemistry. I only wish that this class was longer and that there was more time to cover more content.",

It will give you lots of detailed information about specific reactions, but general principles (importance of stereoselectivity, thermodynamic vs. kinetic conditions, C-C bond formation, etc.) can be carried over to other reactions.",

The reactions learned as well as the broader knowledge of chemistry gained through this class are invaluable and incomparable, especially given that Professor Ellman is a phenomenal lecturer who has extensive experience in the topics he covers.",

I appreciated the way Professor Ellman got us to think about the synthetic problems and challenged us in a way that felt encouraging.",
