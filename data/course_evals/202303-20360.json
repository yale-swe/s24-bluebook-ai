I would feel more comfortable rotating in a synthetic lab after taking this course.  I feel I developed much better intuition about how reactions will go given the starting materials and reagents. I became more comfortable designing syntheses.",

We learned and compared many techniques based on literature data and lab experience.",

Having read some literature and familiarity with basics of protecting groups, common oxidants and reductants, a sprinkling of named reactions is helpful but not at all necessary. If you're interested at all by natural products, methodology, or even medicinal chemistry, this course is a must.",

                "Extremely well organized -- notes on board very clear. Professor did a great job explaining concepts during class. Office hours very helpful. Assignments very fair and reflective of course material.",
                "The course is entirely research-focused, with connections to industrial applications. Although the topics covered were few, the depth and specificity of the covered reactions will be extremely helpful and insightful for anyone interested in a career in chemistry. I only wish that this class was longer and that there was more time to cover more content.",

It will give you lots of detailed information about specific reactions, but general principles (importance of stereoselectivity, thermodynamic vs. kinetic conditions, C-C bond formation, etc.) can be carried over to other reactions.",

The reactions learned as well as the broader knowledge of chemistry gained through this class are invaluable and incomparable, especially given that Professor Ellman is a phenomenal lecturer who has extensive experience in the topics he covers.",

I appreciated the way Professor Ellman got us to think about the synthetic problems and challenged us in a way that felt encouraging.",
