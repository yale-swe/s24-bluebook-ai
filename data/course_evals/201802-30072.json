    "how to analyze a painting and how has the canon of western art changed since Renaissance",
    "The ability to understand the history of art through a series of quintessential works.",
    "As my first art class, I learnt how to appreciate a painting by this class. And it is really helpful for me to deeply contact with art for the first time.",
    "I learned the visual analysis skills in the field of art history and the general outline of western art masterpieces.",
    "I got much more knowledge about the historical background and the related art themes of the ten works in Professor Armstrongs Canon. I got to read a lot of interesting books.",
    "As an economics student, I really do not understand how to make the close looking and analysis of a picture at the beginning. Dr Armstrong taught every detailed aspect of the approaches for analysing the artwork. She assessed every single mistake of my essay, that really helped me to construct a better essay in the end.",
    "I've learned some skills to appreciate an art work through this class, which I have learned from other classes before. Carol is a very selfless and strict teacher, through her paper assignments and comments, my writing skills have improved a lot.",
    "Taking this course has made me a person who has a much more comprehensive knowledge of western art. I began to view art works from deeper aspects apart from visual enjoyment.",
    "I learned to analyse a piece of artwork from many different angles, including composition, light and dark, colors, facture, treatment of distant space, scale, size, and also know how to find judge it from its self-reflectivity, narrative elements, and so on. What's more, through writing many essay and reading many dense books, my ability of writing and reading was improved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The arrangement of the course is rich in information on the related works and historical background, but less attention is paid to the original work and how can we appreciate it. Also, the reading assignment after the class made the last week a little bit overwhelmed.",
    "The course was very accessible for those unfamiliar with art history and the visits to the Paul Melon centre and the Yale University Art Gallery brought the texts studied in class to life.",
    "Since I did not know this is not a intro class, it is a little hard for me to catch up. But the good thing is I got better after several classes. I really appreciate this.",
    "What I like about this course is that we get a lot of chances to go to art galleries, both on Yale campus and in New York, to look at paintings and discuss on site.",
    "I think the way of participation is quite limited. In the discussion of books we have read, only a few students will speak. I think it may due to the distribution of presentation work. So I suggest that maybe next time the professor should ask students to speak randomly, so that a better participation will occur. Other things about this course are just amazing.",
    "History of arts requires the textual understand and the actual observation, this helped students to gain a better understanding of the artwork and historical background.",
    "Maybe it would be better if there are more chances for those who are not very good at expressing their own ideas to say something in class.",
    "First of all, Professor Armstrong is quite concerned with students even if there are some communication problems between her and us Chinese students. However, some technical terms are still quite difficult for us to understand and they are not clearly explained in the course.",
    "I think one of the greatest strengths of this course is that we had many chances to visit the gallery with our professor, which really help me to understand how to analyse artwork. I have a small personal advice here. I was always sleepy in the morning. And I found many of my classmates also did. I think if we have a break one hour after the class's begining, instead of after one and a half hour or two hours, we would probably be more concentrated on the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to students who have background information about art and art history.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student primarily because it struck a balance between being an overview of art history and going into specific detail about works. The assignments allowed us to become familiar with works of art in the Yale collection.",
    "Yes, because this is a good course to know about art and to improve oneself.",
    "Yes. Whether s\/he is an art history student or not, the questions posed out in classes are well worth meditating.",
    "Yes, it is the only great Art History course in Yale Summer Session.",
    "Yes. This course gives the broad perspective of understanding the history of arts from the 14th century to the modern period. It helped the students to get a systematical cognition of the western arts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others, because it can improve one's sense of aesthetic a lot!",
    "Of course I will, but actually I will recommend to students who are keen on art because Professor Armstrong is quite patient with students and the tours to different museums are quite helpful.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend it to another student. I am very interested in Art History and really had a great experience on this course, since the resource is affluent and the professor is very responsible and also approachable."
