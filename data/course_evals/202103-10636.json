                "I LOVED this class. It was absolutely fascinating. It was an introduction to landmark/foundational philosophy of language works followed by direct applications of those concepts to oppressive and hate speech. I learned so much about how language shapes everyday interactions and upholds&enacts systems of oppression. It was really cool to be able to parse my everyday conversations with people through the lens of what I learned in this class. Definitely has valuable knowledge for everyone because we use language every day.",

                "It is all good, but I think the course skips too fast from the early philosophers of language to contemporary issues. Maybe shedding more light on how the tradition of phil of lang took shape in historical development would be beneficial.",
                "Strength: Interesting material that is applicable to a lot of current events. 2 papers and 1 midterm. \r\nWeakness: Very disorganized. Challenging for those who have not taken a philosophy class. Grade is determined by only 3 aspects, which makes it tough to raise up grade if there are issues",
                "Strengths: very engaging, very collaborative and challenging environment, my peers asked amazing questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a lot of reading, which would have been fine if we talked about it all--some of the things we were assigned we barely talked about, so I think there should've either been more time dedicated to them or they should've been cut from the syllabus. Also, in the last few classes we sat in a circle which I really enjoyed, so I wish the circle formation could've happened more often throughout the year for discussions that were less lecture-y.",
                "This course is awesome, very well structured. Some of the work we read was super challenging, but prof Stanley did a good job of making sure we understood core concepts.",
                "This course is very strong as it is and it's difficult to suggest ways of improving it seeing as the realm of philosophy of language is very particular and very complex. I would suggest that the professor maybe incorporate more students conversations so class can feel a bit more engaging, but that makes sense for certain philosophers over others.",
                "This course was very interesting, and talking about the philosophy of language in terms of modern day issues was so eye opening. However, I wish we could've dedicated more time to each text.",
                "Prof. Stanley was particularly strong in Frege-Austin. However, the latter section of the course which focused on contemporary work could have been better organized.",
                "This was by far one of the most engaging and thought-provoking classes I've taken at Yale.  The discussions were always incredibly applicable to current events and I learned a lot.  The organization of this course could be improved a bit, but overall it was absolutely amazing!",
                "Strengths: As a whole, the flow of the course was very comprehensive and each new text we read successfully built upon the previous ones. The content itself was fascinating, and I enjoyed Professor Stanley's nontraditional focus. He was very good at balancing the lecture and discussion sections of each class so we left with both a solid understanding of the text and the chance to ask questions and talk with each other about it. He was also very good at intermixing our discussion of texts with present-day examples of the topics we were reading about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We would sometimes spend more time discussing the same content than was necessary, and too little on other sections of the texts that merited more attention. The scheduling of the three major assessments was odd: it didn't make much sense to have an essay and a midterm due the same week and then only one final essay after that.",
                "Strengths: Covered a lot of interesting material, learned about the power of speech and how it shapes the world\r\nWeaknesses: Lot of reading, cold calling on students was intimidating sometimes (but challenged us)",

                "Only if you like philosophy or have a background in political science. It was tough for someone who has never taken a philosophy class and was taking this for their major. Felt really behind for a lot of the course, and there was no attempts in the class to actually talk about explaining the readings instead of esoteric questions raised by students in the class who had vast experience in these topics. The professor kept calling it an \"introduction\" class, but it did not feel like an introductory course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student.  Readings and classes were both very engaging and Professor Stanley is great; he puts a lot of effort into teaching and made the content more clear and more interesting.  The class covered a pretty wide range of topics within philosophy of language, but I thought we still went into depth with almost everything we read.  Classes were pretty unstructured, which sometimes made it a bit harder to follow, but also led to great discussion and allowed for Professor Stanley to share entertaining anecdotes.  Overall, I felt like I learned a lot, and I'm left wanting to explore the field of philosophy of language more.  Great class.",
                "Yes, but I would warn them that there's a lot of reading and the pace is fast.",
                "Yes absolutely. Anyone could take this course and learn a ton about language and its mechanisms in shaping reality.",
                "I would recommend this course specifically if a student wishes to see how easily different ideologies and concepts flow into each other, forming a complex web of human thought and epistemology that is not obviously interchangeable or explainable. I think that this course has really developed my understanding of the constant problems one faces in making consistent philosophical choices and logical arguments.",
                "I would recommend this course, because it was very interesting and I learned a lot about the functionality of everyday language. However, I would probably also add in that the course was difficult because of so much difficult material packed into a short amount of time.",
                "YES! Prof. Stanley is great. Phil of lang also gives you a lot of tools for political analysis, as well as other kinds of analyses, linguistic, literary, etc.",
                "Yes! I think every student regardless of their major should take this course, especially during this time of media and misinformation.  I've found the concepts that I learned in philosophy of language to be incredibly useful outside of the classroom as well.",
                "Yes! I had both an enjoyable and interesting time. (With the caveat that people who are interested in taking this class should be aware that Professor Stanley's focus diverges from the texts that are traditionally seen as fundamental in philosophy of language to focus on harmful speech. I personally thought it worked very well for this class, but someone interested in a more traditional introduction might feel differently.)",
                "I would: Professor Stanley is engaging and fun to be around. You will learn a lot of interesting ways to think about how language shapes our world. Be ready to be challenged.",
                "Yes!!! Absolutely -- such an interesting philosophy class to take, language underscores everything in our lives, and whether or not a friend was a philosophy major -- i would recommend this class to them (and already have done so!)"
