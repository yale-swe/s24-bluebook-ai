                "really great format, no improvements!!",
                "This course was fast paced- sometimes the concepts weren't explained clearly.",
                "Strength: I think Professor Kitamura is really clear on everything. This definitely helps my learning.\r\nWeakness: N/A",
                "Strengths: Prof Yuichi is EXCELLENT! He explains things so well, even boring econometrics concepts can be made simple, easy to understand, and even interesting by him. He uses mental shortcuts and abbreviations to make things intuitive and second-nature for students. Although the concepts can seem challenging at first, everything made sense as the semester progressed and all the concepts fit in so nicely with one another! He also focuses on the conceptual aspect of things rather than the quantitative stuff. Thus, problem sets and exams ask more conceptual/qualitative questions that test your understanding, rather than mathematical questions that one will forget shortly after taking the course. Problem sets are quick to do and usually quite straightforward. Exams are also easy if you study and follow the lectures. Sufficient practices are given and solutions are uploaded in a timely manner. This course also teaches you programming with R and Stata without throwing you into the deep end. The required commands are given so you don't have to waste time searching. Rather, you learn and naturally remember them over time.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be the curve. Everyone gets perfect scores (mid-90s and above) on all exams and problem sets, which is so stressful. And the final is 50%, so one mistake can really affect your entire grade, even a simple minor error by accident. I really hope the professor looks into ways of addressing this so that the curve is not strictly imposed, especially when everyone is getting such high grades. If he wants to impose a curve, exams should be harder so that students can be differentiated. If not, students who get low grades aren't the ones that don't understand, but rather those that make accidental mistakes.",
                "Strengths: clear lectures, straightforward problem sets\r\nRoom for improvement: use more examples from real papers to illustrate concepts.",
                "I really enjoyed the course because we learned not only about econometric concepts, but also went through applications in the course. Prof Kitamura makes a subject that I personally didn't enjoy before enjoyable!",
                "amazing course",
                "The course was extremely well designed in that each module was carefully thought out. The pace was extremely fast.",
                "strengths: well organized, nice instructor, interesting example studies\r\nweaknesses: exams are too easy (everyone does well, and the curve becomes tight and grades become more about who doesn't make careless mistakes than about who understands the material best)",
                "Strengths: The notes were mostly well-organized, which facilitated learning. Discussions about the paper's ideas and how their methods related to what we were learning (IV instrumentation) was also interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The Mathematics was not very rigorous. There was little exposure to the papers themselves.\r\n\r\nI heard Econ 123 had a final group project. Although this would probably make more stressed during finals than I already was, I think something like that could be nice in terms of getting us to train and apply the skills we developed in the course, especially in STATA and R. The applications in the PSETs sometimes felt very isolated.",
                "Overall, I was thrilled with this class. I felt that it set me up very well for economics research and provided wonderful intuition. Yuichi is also hilarious and a lot of fun.",
                "Excellent course--one of the best courses that I've taken in the economics department. While the first few weeks of class were challenging as we started out with conceptual discussions on BLP/CEF and mathematically rigorous content like asymptotic theory, everything started clicking thereafter and the rest (OLS and beyond) was more applied and easier to follow given due to the previous groundwork. Exams were open-note and very fair in terms of content and difficulty. This is a wonderful econometrics course and I anticipate it will be very useful for anyone interested in working in data in the future. \r\n\r\nProfessor Kitamura is also a great professor. He's very patient in office hours and very kind. The TA, Fernando, provided great support as well. \r\n\r\nThis isn't a huge weakness of the course, but because it is curved and the exams are of moderate difficulty, it is difficult to gauge how you will fare in the class relative to other students in the end. However, again, you will learn a lot in this course and that alone is good reason to take it.",
                "This course was very well taught. Assignments and exams were fair.",
                "Great systematic buildup to the meat of the course (endogeneity and how to treat it). Very doable psets and exams.",
                "Professor Kitamura's lectures were great and really explained concepts well. I thought that while the live lectures moved a little fast, the recorded format meant I could re-watch them and learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: The instructor (Yuichi Kitamura) and TF (Fernando) were the strengths of the course. Yuichis explanations are clear and intuitive, which vastly improved my understanding of the material. Fernando was extremely helpful in sections and office hours, explaining concepts in a simple and easily understandable manner.\r\nWeaknesses: There isnt really a textbook that one can rely on for this course. While the required texts are helpful, the most important resources for studying are notes from class. That being said, the course was well organized and the supplemental texts were not necessary, although helpful, in aiding learning. Also, the economics department curve is not really helpful in this class because students score highly on problem sets and exams.",
                "The strength of this class is Prof. Kitamura. He is wonderful. He teaches the material in a great order and gives it life. He teaches the details perfectly. My only critique is that, although at some points, mostly towards the beginning, I think the detail was necessary so I would understand everything, later in the course however, sometimes lecture could cover more. I would have liked to see more mathematical proofs. Seeing more proofs is tough given the nature of the material because proofs about finding the asymptotic variance matrix of a given estimator does not teach much. Perhaps spending more on TSLS and its equivalence to the method of moments in certain cases or the double regression that is equivalent to OLS (I cant remember the name of this one)."

You're probably taking this for your major but it is a great rigorous course in econometrics that goes further in depth than 117",

                "Yes, especially for those who need to take econometrics and are comfortable with linear algebra. Even though the material can get somewhat math-heavy, Prof Kitamura does a great job explaining enough of the theory to understand the results, but not too much to get bogged down in notation and minute details in proofs. The expectations for what we needed to know for problem sets and exams were very clear. This class teaches a lot about how to deal with issues that arise in data that isn't so perfect (which happens a lot in real-world data), which is helpful for anyone who is thinking about doing economics research.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a one-of-a-kind econometrics course, and by far the best course in econometrics at Yale. It emphasizes the important things without getting into the nitty-gritty unnecessarily. Lectures are easy to follow, and assignments are all very fair. Prof Yuichi is an excellent explainer and is approachable. The TF Fernando responds to Piazza very quickly, and he provides great overview of lecture material in his weekly discussion sections. This is one of my favorite econ classes at Yale, and also one that I learnt the most!",

                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely, I thought 135 was one of the worst classes I ever took, strangely difficult, and a total waste of time. This class is so so much better. It's enjoyable and interesting. It's interesting while still be so much easier than 135. Yuichi is also truly a blast.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to students looking for not just an applied approach to econometrics, but also a mathematical one. I would caution that this course does require a significant time commitment (especially in the first few weeks). Reading the textbook will be very helpful. While I'm not sure how generous the curve will be, the exams are fair in difficulty and content. Overall, the class is organized well, the textbook is read-able, and the material is rewarding--highly recommend!",

                "Absolutely! The material this course covers is super interesting. It can feel technical at times, but econometrics is super cool. Learning about endogeneity and how to treat it is both useful and fun. The course itself is very manageable in a 5-credit schedule.",
                "Yes - the other metrics classes are bad, and you learn a lot in this one at least. Also Prof. Kitamura is great.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This is a much more enjoyable continuation to ECON 135 and will help solidify concepts introduced in prior metrics and statistics classes.",

Definitely would recommend if the students is interested in economics, economic research, policy research, etc. This course really gives you the foundation for economic analysis and will really make you feel like you understand the theory behind many of the techniques. The professor, Yuichi Kitamura, is great! I felt like I learned so much in this class, and is the first time I really felt I was able to master a subject.",
