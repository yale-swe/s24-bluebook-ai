            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Class matches up with textbook very well. Also the author of the book has all of his lectures online through MIT OCW. Weaknesses: Actually going to class gets pretty boring. Professor was a bit dry.",
                "This likely was the worst-taught class I have taken at Yale. Going to class was essentially useless. BUT, luckily, linear algebra is not a niche topic and there are incredible online resources to help (notably, Gilbert Strang's MIT lectures, which teach far more in 45min than our lectures do in 75min). You can honestly take this class asynchronously.",
                "The class does not actually cover applications, despite the presence of applications in the name, and covers such little content in such an unnecessary level of depth that very few applicable skills are actually learned. It should be sped up by requiring less long-form computation early on in the course and discuss more application problems instead of touching on the first application problem in the second half of the last class.",
                "Uses a great textbook, but the instruction did not align completely with the homeworks.",
                "Great instruction. Would love to have had practice exams before exams.",
                "Midterm exams covered topics we had learned the previous week, long before we had gotten graded work on the material returned to us. The exams were also too long.",
                "strengths: material was interesting and professor moved at a good pace\r\nweaknesses: psets became much more difficult halfway through the semester because less examples of applications of theories were being done in class",
                "I found that this course was far too focused on computation, and the PSETS were far too much work on average, in my opinion.",
                "Lectures were sometimes hard to follow because they went quickly and I would have liked to do more examples in class. We did not receive much feedback on the problem sets since they were graded very late (usually after exams had happened). The exams were also a big time crunch. However, the peer tutors were very helpful with psets and concept review.",
                "Strengths: the course provides lots of opportunities to practice the skills taught in class, and the professor is always willing to explain concepts in detail during office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved it if the course covered a bit more applications of linear algebra as its title implies.",
                "strengths: problem sets and exams were very reasonable; Peer tutoring was very helpful; Course was reasonably well organized and followed the textbook pretty consistently; Instructor responded efficiently on Ed discussion posts\r\n\r\nweakness:  despite the title of the course, I feel that sometimes the professor focused more on the theoretical basis of concepts rather than their practical applications in lecture. Also, if it would be possible to grade the problem sets on a more consistent basis rather than sending them out in spurts, that might help students who want to space after studying over a longer period of time.",
                "weaknesses: very few applications, we really only BRIEFLY discussed markov chains and i guess OLS was another but...yeah i was very disappointed with the lack of applications given the name of the class. also, this professor REFUSED to provide answer keys to the PSETs or even practice problems for the midterms. shocked to see the sheer laziness of this professor in teaching",
                "I think the course, up to a certain point, is very digestible. However, beyond that point  maybe around subspaces  at least for me, it became very difficult (and, I think, unnecessarily difficult) to understand. I know that the concepts can be taught in clearer ways because I watched the Gilbert Strang videos on YouTube.",
                "There was one strength and it was that the material was straightforward and not theoretical. \r\n\r\nThere are many cons. The course is horribly unorganized and the material you learn in class is useless for the psets.",
                "I relied heavily on office hours during this course, which were very helpful. I think that the lectures could have been more organized."

Psets are structured well, but honestly it's literally just linear algebra. Learn it from a million sources online if you're interested, or take this if you need the credit.",

                "No, unless it is a requirement. I got pretty much no useful skills from this class; everything I learned how to manually compute I could do with a calculator, and little intuition was developed as not very much content was covered.",
                "Sure. The class was fine, but linear algebra in itself is a really cool field of math, so yes.",
                "Yes. Great course",

                "Yes, linear algebra is very useful to know regardless of major, and this class covered a good amount of material without the proofs.",
                "I would recommend this course to any Non-math major who wants to gain a Computational understanding of linear algebra. If you want a class that is more theoretical and proof based, I would suggest taking math 225 instead of math 222.",
                "yes for the material, though i'd really scrutinize the professor teaching the course\/section because this professor was simply not good.",
                "Not really. I guess if people want to take linear algebra, they dont have many other options. That being said, I dont think I really learned linear algebra from this class. I think I taught it to myself\/learned it from Gilbert Strang. That may be part of my fault for not going to office hours though.",
                "No. Theres no grade feedback and the instruction is poor. Theres no point of even going to lecture. Its extremely boring and I would recommend learning the material on your own from free online resources."
