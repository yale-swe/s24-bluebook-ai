                "I developed a strong and detailed view of the criminal justice system. Thanks to this class and Judge Goodrows guidance, I am now aware of the injustices that occur in our so called justice system. Prior to this class, I was generally unaware of the often frequent wrong that has taken over our great nation. I took this class to learn more about our government and law that has largely been preached to me as being a great protector. This class has taught me the truth that the system is flawed and has helped me to gain a new perspective of the world around me.",
                "I learned the main ethical issues that plague the criminal justice systemsuch as infringement of the fifth and sixth amendments, the administration of the death penalty, wrongful convictions, racial\/socioeconomic biases, and effective counsel.",
                "This course enriched my knowledge about aspects such as the inequalities of the law, rightful procedure in criminal trials, and how to apply the legal ethics to law. I entered this class with little knowledge about the United States Criminal Justice System, and throughout the course I became well informed of all legal processes that must be done, how the jury functions, and the processes overall of sentencing someone. The diverse opinions of the course and the fascinating articles and videos we viewed provided me with different opinions and arguments which helped me understand both sides of the wrongful convictions, sentences and more, and develop my own approach towards it. Having the experience to ask questions to a judge was a marvelous experience since I got to have an insight of what this is from the inside, and got to listen to many stories of cases and real life situations which were incredible. I leave this course with an even bigger incentive to study law, than I did before, I got to read extremely interesting cases, study situations from different perspectives and fully understand the problems and ways in which our system works.",
                "I learned so much more about various structures and laws related to the US justice system, such as suspects' rights during an interrogation, one's right to an attorney, and the impacts of implicit bias. I feel much more prepared to discuss the inequities of the US justice system and am excited to study criminal justice even more.",
                "I learned a useful framework of how the criminal justice system functions, including certain key cases involving the bill of rights. I also read about modern criticism of the constitutions and the justice system.",
                "By taking this course I learned a lot more about the structure of the criminal justice system and the many impacts it has on the individuals who are harmed by its faults.",
                "General survey of important issues in criminal justice, including the trial process, constitutional rights, victims' rights, the death penalty, innocence, exonerations, and bias in tribunals.",
                "This course taught me the value of recognizing one's own biases and how these biases can have large impacts within the field of criminal justice",
                "I learned so much about the American criminal justice system. This course went through many different dimensions of criminal law, ranging from the morality and ethicality of certain practice and statutes to exonerations to our incarceration system. I am able to comfortably discuss our justice system and its shortcomings.",
                "To understand better what is really happening in our legal system",
                "Through engaging with the class, I believe my public speaking skills improved. I also believe my knowledge of the American criminal justice system and criminal law in general has expanded. Im starting to develop an opinion of the death penalty and the ethics surrounding law."

                "The strength of this class is its ability to give participants a new perspective on subjects and injustices that they may not have been previously aware of. It is a rigorous course that I believe is worth every effort and amount of time put into it. The only weakness I can think of is this class could have had more interactive activities. For example, I personally enjoyed the debate we had and would have loved to have more of those types of engaging activities.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, knowledgeable and caring professor, interesting discussions\r\nWeaknesses: workload was pretty intense, but because this was a summer class that was expected",
                "The strengths of this course are many of which made it such a marvelous experience. Firstly, the teacher, Ms. Goodrow was a wonderful discussion facilitator, bringing new questions and scenarios to the table, and asking questions to wake our thoughts and listen to different perspectives. She made the class feel as a safe space where anyone had a voice and no question or idea was irrelevant or dumb, and was always willing to answer any questions or doubts we had. Secondly, the articles were very rich and included cases and videos where we were able to learn different and important things from each of them, they were all extremely interesting. In general, the course was fascinating and enriching and has no weakness to my opinion.",
                "The course has an incredibly strong structure that easily facilitates engaging discussions and conversations about the assigned materials.",
                "I really liked the discussions we had each class -- they helped me to better understand the material. However, I felt that the reading list could be long and complex at times -- I didn't know how to read court cases -- and the classes themselves would have been better in shorter sessions (maybe 3x per week instead of twice).",
                "Strengths: Professor Goodrow is without question the best part about this course. She is incredibly kind and is incredibly passionate and knowledgable about the subject. The course is organized wonderfully and it is truly built to be an inclusive, discussion-based course. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I truly mean it when I say there are no weaknesses with this course.",
                "The course gives me a lot of practical insight when considering the rule of law, ethics, and human rights protection.",
                "Professor Goodrow provides a lack of instructions when it comes to assignments, however, I think there are pros to this allows as it doesnt limit us when completing assignments. I think the readings also helped improve my reading and analysis skills and it was good practice for future assignments."

                "Yes! I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I would of course remind them that the class is not for the light hearted or people afraid of a heavy workload. But I think that the time and effort put into this class are well spent. You go into it often with certain beliefs and come out maybe with more questions but with a new perspective than before. Overall this class was excellent so I would be happy to recommend this class in the future.",
                "Yes! This course was very interesting! Even if you're not interested in law, the conversations we had were still very engaging. Because the criminal justice system plays such a big role in the US, everyone should consider the issues that we talked about in class. At the end of the class, I was left with more questions than answers, but that's the nature of the course and is what made it so interesting.",
                "Of course, this course was hands-down the best experience I have had in taking a course, it provided me with knowledge about an aspect I have a deep passion about and brought up topics which everyone must be informed about. The topics discussed in class are topics which I had learned little to none about, and are topics that in my opinion everyone must know, so I would highly recommend this course to my peers and friends. Additionally, it included many texts and writing which helps high school students prepare for what college holds for us, and encouraged everyone to form an opinion and be able to defend it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about the US criminal justice system, and even though I went in as a prison abolitionist, the class discussions pushed me to imagine a separate justice system that supports rather than exploits. The readings were not overly technical, and Prof. Goodrow was extremely willing to explain any cases students did not understand. I feel much more qualified to speak about the US justice system now that I have taken this course, and it brought up many issues I had never before considered.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in the foundations and nuanced problems (particularly racial) with the justice system, this is good.",
                "Yes! This course was extremely interesting and certainly relevant to todays justice system. Even throughout the three hour class, I was never bored and was always engaged with class discussions.",
                "Probably not unless you've had a previous law\/politics\/EP&E class and can understand legalese to a reasonable degree.",
                "I would reccomend this to any student within interest in criminal justice and law. Note that this course requires one reads a plethora of legal texts so a student should be made aware of this before actually enrolling in the course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Do NOT let the 3 hour course slot prevent you from taking the class. I actually really enjoyed having a longer course because it gave all of us a chance to discuss and debate in depth, and it let us all have the opportunity to share our opinions without feeling the need to rush. If you are even remotely interested in the law or the morality of our criminal justice system, this class is wonderful. Professor Goodrow is such a wonderful professor.",
                "Yes, this course gives the insight to know the real situation in the US legal system, which is usually considered difficult to know at the campus",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This course was personally my favourite in all the Yale summer sessions Im currently enrolled in. My classmates were extremely inclusive and it created an encouraging and thought-provoking environment for everybody. You dont really get bored as the conversation is really stimulating and Prof. Goodrow also welcomed all discussions.",
                "Absolutely. This is my favorite class Ive taken at Yale and I love Professor Goodrow."
