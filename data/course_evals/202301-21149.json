                "This course is very well paced. The content is well distributed, so lectures never feel overwhelming. The exams are fair, and the homework is reasonable.",
                "Strength is the organization of the course. It was never a question of what was being taught. The professor begins each class with a review of last class which is extremely helpful. However, the Psets often did not really follow what was taught in the class and the professor himself was not very helpful or kind.",
                "Strengths include the recitations and clear expectations. Weaknesses include some lectures and the psets that are vastly more difficult than tested material.",
                "This course was excellent. Dr. Zhong is an outstanding lecturer, and he was very clear about what you will be assessed on in the course. The six problem sets are spaced out, so that the course is never overly burdensome in terms on workload. The material itself is also quite interesting, especially coming from a background different from chemical engineering. I learned a great deal in this course. There were no weaknesses.",
                "Professor Zhong is a very good teacher.",
                "I think the pace of this course was very good. I found it helpful how Prof. Zhong recapped the last lecture for 5-7 minutes at the beginning of each class, and I never felt like I was really getting lost in the lectures because we heard most things a couple times. The problem sets were very similar to exam problems, and Prof. Zhong did a great job of laying out the expectations for what we should know for exams, so the exams were usually pretty straightforward. We had over a week for each problem set, which really minimized the stress of the course and helped me to actually take the time to learn the content as I did the homework.",
                "The material was very digestible and the reactions/reactors studied were generalized as more of an overview to the subject. I would have liked to see some of the differences between ideal and real reactor design considerations, but this would probably would be difficult to cover in a single semester course.",
                "The workload for this course was on the lower side, which I appreciated. The professor was also evidently knowledgable about the material and would always give in-depth explanations, which was very helpful for me to understand the material in a broader, industrial sense",
                "I think lectures could be justified a little more as we go to make the course more engaging, for example explaining more clearly what we are trying to prove before embarking upon the derivation."

                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in math. There is not too much chemistry involved. I took this class as a non-chemical engineering major. I did not need to know organic chemistry, physical chemistry, nor transport phenomena. The math is not too intense either. This class is a great option as an elective for other engineering/applied science majors.",
                "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course but I also wouldn't tell others to stay away. Its a fine course that is pretty well taught. The homeworks are pretty difficult but theres not too many of them so it evens out. Overall the course is a pretty standard ChemE requirement, so if you're not in ChemE I probably wouldn't recommend this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor and TF are excellent, and the course material is very interesting. The textbook is also very comprehensive and allows you to clear up anything you do not understand.  The workload is fairly low, and the tests are some of the fairest I have had at Yale. This course was awesome.",
                "If you're looking at this course, you probably have to take it, but as far as ChemE classes go, this has been one of my favorites!! I think it's easy to learn the material, and the tests can be straightforward if you put effort into the problem sets and attend the lectures! We also learned some interesting material, especially toward the end of the course, that I can definitely see how it would be useful for different fields and industries.",
                "If you are in chemical engineering, this course is obviously mandatory, but that should not be a concern. The topics covered are fundamental have connections to other courses in the major like transport and interfacial phenomena.",
                "Yes, definitely! Even for non-chemE majors, this is a great elective to take."
