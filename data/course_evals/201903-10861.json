   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to implement analytic skills to investigate and judge varying investment strategies.",
    "Fundamental Investment philosophy, an overview of different asset classes and nuances of each one, aided by listening to managers brought in by David and Dean",
    "You learn how the endowment works and how a couple of different funds operate",
    "I learned a lot about the ways to assess potential investment managers and the different assets classes. I also improve my abilities to persuasively argue for something in writing through the investment memos.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I thought I knew a lot about finance before taking this class, but this really teaches you about the industry. You learn about short-selling, PE, VC, asset management, value investing--wow! I loved it. \r\n If you are considering a career in finance but don't know which field exactly, this is the best class!",
    "An understanding of best practices for institutional investing and insight from some of the best investors in the world!",
    "I learned from some of the greatest investors in the world - from their investment philosophies to their work ethics to their journeys to their positions now. I also learned more about how endowments are structured and how David and Dean invented the \"Yale model\"",
    "This class is ideal for anyone interested in investment management - be it across any asset class or industry. You will learn a lot from some of the top portfolio managers in the business today about how they structure their portfolios, how they think about risk vs reward, what sets them apart, etc...",
    "The course helped me better understand how to find good fiduciaries for financial assets, how to asses investment strategies and find good managers. It also showed me what it means to have an alignment of interests between principal and agent.",
    "This course was definitely the best class I have taken at Yale. Needless to say, Swenson and Dean are incredible leaders in the field of investment management, and learning from them was an unparalleled experience.",
    "Manager selection and endowment management"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great use of guest lecturers made for a super engaging class.  I looked forward to this seminar every week and felt like I greatly benefitted from both the engaging discussions led by industry experts and my knowledgable classmates.",
    "Strengths: Managers are really cool, and it is amazing that we get to interact for an entire class with those who are very successful.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the manager write ups were very repetitive, or there was not a lot of information to go off of. I wish assignments were geared more towards direct investing, and leveraging manager appearances to learn more about how they directly invest. For example, the assignment on coming up with a start up, or ranking companies in a manager's portfolio were much more interesting than the write ups.",
    "Strengths: Swensen and Takahashis expertise and experience is by far the best part of the course. Could listen to them tell stories for hours. The funds that came in were also interesting to hear from.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Aside from the endowment structure, you dont learn much in the course. The assignments are in no way designed to help distill concepts covered in the readings or in class, and are, for the most part, a total waste of time (in my opinion). Adding a quantitative\/valuation assignment may help this but personally if I taught the course I would completely overhaul the assignment structure and make it more about distilling concepts and applying investment principles than summarizing factual information about the funds that visited.",
    "David and Dean are two of the most knowledgeable people in the investment world and learning from them was an absolute blast.",
    "I think that the strengths were in the guest lectures - there was so much variety in the types of investors and investment philosophies. The class offered a good understanding of just what is out there. I think that the lack of insight into the workload week to week was a big weakness. For instance, we had a group presentation the Monday after October break that was assigned to us the Monday before. It was a hefty assignment and very difficult to do over Google drive.",
    "Amazing course that brings in the best speakers. You learn so much and they are all the best investors in their respective fields. If you are considering a career in finance but don't know which field exactly, this is the best class!",
    "Strengths were amazing instructors and guest speakers, major weakness was lack of guidance\/prompt\/examples for the paper",
    "Strengths: the guest speakers, the memos (I think they really pushed you to understand what each guest speaker offered, which was appreciated), the debates\/presentations were also really well structured for students to learn. The timing of the assignment grading was also super helpful in ensuring I could improve from memo to memo, which I know was noted in previous course reviews as an issue, but wasn't an issue this year. \r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved more time for just Q&A with David and Dean, especially to learn more about their efforts to build the endowment from the bottom up.",
    "The strengths are the absolute quality of instruction - both from Profs. Swensen and Takahashi as well as the superb guest lecturers. I think one area of improvement is emphasizing individual student participation more during the lectures. I definitely learned the most when I was forced to speak out in front of the whole group and defend my theses.",
    "The guest lecturers were the best part of the course and I appreciate how they were balanced with typical seminar style teaching.",
    "The strengths of this course were the prominent guest speakers  they were all managers that had different investment strategies. They were all engaging and interesting, and cared about the learning of students"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you are able to get in, you must take this class.",
    "If you're passionate about investing, or want to poke the brains of some very financially successful people, I would take this course. David and Dean are also amazing and are great examples of high character, ethical, and easy going people which seem to be difficult to find in the financial industry. However, I don't really believe this course is the typical undergraduate liberal arts course. It seems more like a professional course, so take that as you will. Of course, it is important to have some practical knowledge about how our financial system works and so deeply affects many parts of our society, for better or worse.",
    "If you get in, you kinda have to take this class. Swensen has some of the most interesting opinions\/stories\/ways of thinking about finance that Ive encountered and learning from him through this course is truly all it was hyped up to be and so much more. That being said, the assignments are really not structured well. Youll hear from a couple different funds and you write summaries of them. You dont actually apply any of the investment principles you learn in class aside from one presentation on asset allocation. Additionally, the grading is pretty random and expectations are rarely made clear. Extremely high workload for not having felt like i learned much of anything. Really sucks that the course isnt structured better but like I said, if you get in, you kinda gotta take it anyway. Swensen is Mr Miyagi and hell make you do a little wax on wax off and it may feel like its pointless a lot of the time, but overall probably worth it and definitely see me in the future being glad I took this class even if Im a little indifferent about it now",
    "Strongly recommend this course to anyone who can get it!! Honestly my favorite class at Yale because of the guest speakers, class discussion and interesting group projects.",
    "I think that this is a great course for anyone interested in investing, but I would let anyone to whom I was recommending this class know that they had to be willing to devote their entire semester to this one course. That is how much work there is. Additionally, this class is such that each assignment must be your very best work because of who sees it (David, Dean, other professional investors).",
    "A lot of work (5 short papers, other assignments, 2 presentations and a final paper) but it is all worth it. The speakers that they bring in are amazing. Swensen and Takahashi are so wise and nice. COuld not recommend more strongly!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in investing!",
    "Yes. This course exposes you to legends in the field and you get a better sense of what it takes to be successful in investing. Also, learning from David and Dean is a rare gift that all students should seize if they get the opportunity!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a student provided they have an interest in investment\/endowment management. This is truly an unparalleled opportunity to have access to the best minds in this field.",
    "Great speakers and awesome introduction to the entire investment world.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have the chance!!!",
    "If you can get in, by all means take it. It is safe to say there is no other way (besides working at the investment office) to get so much exposure to Dave and Dean."
