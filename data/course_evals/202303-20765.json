The course pushed me to think deeply about the interactions between these places and exposed me to theoretical constructs to understand the Atlantic as a interconnected region. We also visited the archives in many classes, giving us experience with looking at primary sources.",

                "This is an excellent course overall! The strength of the course is that it thinks deeply about the interconnections between the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. Many of my previous history classes have focused only on one region (such as Latin America), so I had never deeply explored the connections between the regions. The discussions are always engaging and I have learned a lot through the readings as well. The one small weakness of the course is that a few of the readings were a bit dense, especially the more theoretical readings from the beginning of the course. However, discussion really helped in clarifying the concepts from those readings and most of the readings were very approachable.",
                "I think the real strength of this course is the kind of deep, intellectual conversations that were able to develop in large part due to the seminar setting. The two plus hours felt quite long at times, but I think the longer class period ultimately was to our benefit. In terms of improvement, I would have hoped for more guidance / specifics as to the expectations for assignmentsa simple document for each major course requirement would have been useful."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the history of the Middle East and North Africa, and/or the Americas! As someone who had not taken a course on the Atlantic World as a whole before, I learned a lot by thinking about the connections between the different regions that we covered. The course is also especially good for people who are interested in looking at religion and religious difference, since many of our readings and discussions touched on that theme.",
