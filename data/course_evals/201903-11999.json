   "comments": [
    "Learned not only about Asian American women's history, but also about how to look at history as a subject and how to think about gender in relation to history. Looked at a wide varieties of genres and thought about how genre influences how we see history. Also learned a lot about writing and how to develop a long research paper.",
    "This was my first history course, and I absolutely loved it! Prof. Lui is so supportive of each of her students and builds a very collegial environment. Readings are carefully curated to highlight key concepts and time frames of the course. I got a full understanding of the creation of historical narratives and as well as their analysis. Ive learned so much about analyzing history through gender and sexuality, especially Asian American history. Even the final paper felt painless and rewarding.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of Asian American history through the lens of women. Prof. Lui also helped us to think critically about historical sources and consider possible gaps in the historiography.",
    "We first start off by talking about women's\/gender history more broadly, then each week is split up into a different time period or topic. For example, World War II, gendered labor migration, refugees, etc. We also spent one week looking at different types of sources for finding Asian American women's voices.",
    "Big improvement in historical writing and thinking about how and when to use different kinds of primary sources. Different perspectives on how to write and study gendered histories.",
    "The readings in this class were amazing  either shorter chapters about Asian American women and gender history or full novels that all seemed handpicked with so much care (there's no doubt they were). In seminar we covered topics of identity, belonging, exclusion, analysis through the lens of gender, and so much more. I came out feeling much more confident about how I was able to use history and use gender as a tool for analysis. Please take this class!",
    "I learned a more in-depth history of Asian American women, and the Asian American community more generally, along with some important tools of gender and racial history.",
    "I've never been challenged to think historically and particularly through the lens of gender, so this course was a great introduction to that!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall an amazing course! I felt like I learned so much about how to think like a historian and about Asian American history. The readings are demanding, but all super interesting and valuable. I never felt like any reading was just thrown in there for no reason. Professor Liu was great at facilitating discussions during class and really fostered a great learning environment. And it was great to be able to write about a research topic of your own choosing for the final paper and dive into your own interests. The only thing I would say to improve is maybe providing more support and class support on the final paper since it is so long and some students may not have written a paper like that before.",
    "The course is superbly designed and paced. Readings are rewarding, relevant and well-curated. The community is congenial and collaborative. Prof. Lui is engaged and caring; in all, there are no weaknesses!",
    "Professor Lui did a great job of facilitating class discussions and responding to students' comments constructively. The readings, though long, were always fascinating and I appreciated Professor Lui's emphasis on placing each text in its historical context. Moving seminar to the HoC house midway through the semester also helped created a warmer, more family-like atmosphere in the class, which I loved! One small suggestion would be discussing the writing process for the research paper earlier in the semester, so students have more guidance when planning their outlines.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lui. She is brilliant - creates an amazing class environment, leads engaging discussions, and is super accessible to meet with students about anything. The readings are wonderful and such a diverse range of material, and the class is very well thought-out and well-structured - we read short stories, oral histories, novels, scholarly articles. Another strength is the students - there were a lot of students trying to get into the class (preregister if you're a history major and you know you want to take this class!!!), and the ones that Professor Lui ended up picking to take the course really made the class worthwhile. Something that was a little challenging was the grading on the review essays (basically reading responses) - I feel like I often read over her comments on my previous essays many times but saw minimal improvement over the course of the semester. Maybe the expectations for these could be more clearly laid out on the syllabus because analyzing an author's arguments and use of evidence can be quite a daunting task the first time you attempt one of these (especially for a longer work like a book). But Professor Lui was very open to meet with these if you felt like you needed more help - it was just something that I felt personally I never really got the hang of.",
    "Great selection of readings and insightful discussions every class. We looked at a broad range of sources and what they could do for women's history. The reading load was heavy but still manageable, and I definitely learned a lot. I think a few more opportunities to get feedback on writing before the final essay would be helpful.",
    "Overall, only strengths. Completely in love with this class and I will carry it with me for a long time!",
    "The strengths are the readings and the comfortable yet challenging seminar environment Professor Lui creates. The readings are always useful, never dull, and push you to broaden your understanding of what history can look like. \r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that seminar discussion could sometimes become unfocused with the number of contributions and because Professor Lui likes to take a more hands-off approach so that we can all have a chance to talk.",
    "The structure\/length of the course is conducive to deeper discussions! After contextualizing our texts with a timeline, the discussion opened to all student's interests and questions. We often were able to cover all topics brought up! Although the readings were heavy, the writing workload was pretty evenly paced and could be accommodating to students. This course also made use of library resources, so if you haven't been exposed to that aspect in writing papers, take this course!",
    "strengths: PROFESSOR LUI--she was so knowledgable and generous with her time despite her crazy busy schedule as Head of TD, her AMAZINGLY diverse and comprehensive reading list (long but worthwhile), wonderfully productive discussion with invested classmates\r\nweaknesses: a consideration of non-cisgender, non-heterosexual Asian American gender history (as this is a class called Asian American Women AND GENDER, 1830 to the Present), more guidance\/instruction earlier on about how to write a large 20-25 page history paper as many students in the class are WGSS, AMST, ER&M, and other non-history majors, having examples of past history papers as models, more representation of South and Southeast Asian Americans"

   "comments": [
    "yes! Lui is amazing and works hard to make sure you're doing well and developing your writing and analyzation skills. if you're interested in the topic, it will expand your mind well. however, I have a feeling it really depends on who is in your class. My class was extremely engaged, so I hope the same for you. I do have faith that Lui would create a cohesive and engaged class though, so it should be good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in learning about history as a field and about Asian American history. Be prepared to do the work (which is hefty), but it is definitely worth it!",
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you have any interest in history, Asian American narratives, womens narratives, or analysis.",
    "It is definitely a very historical course; we open every session by doing a timeline with dates together. If youre looking to sharpen those skills, then yes, but if youre less interested in that type of history, maybe not. Professor Lui also gives very strong feedback, so even if you dont have a strong history background, I dont think that would be a big issue.",
    "Definitely! Asian American history courses are so hard to come by at Yale, and this class was one of the best I've taken at Yale. The readings were thought-provoking and fascinating, covering a broad range of narratives and styles (film, memoir, oral histories, secondary sources. etc), and this course equipped us with the scholarly tools to write our own research papers on a topic of our choosing. Professor Lui is also just an incredible professor who cares so much about her students!",
    "YES! This course should be offered everywhere. Asian American women should be an integral part of every U.S. history curriculum yet are sadly neglected as historical actors. Professor Lui is not only a great educator but also a wonderful person and someone that you would be lucky to get to know during your time at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! I think this is one of those courses that everyone should take but usually don't get the opportunity to. The topics are important and the course is definitely challenging but you don't need to have taken Asian American History or be a history student to get a lot out of it.",
    "I already knew coming into this class that it would be one of my favorites at Yale and it totally was. Professor Lui is the best professor, and she facilitates each discussion in a way that allows for the best possible environment and deepest level of understanding. To help, the students in the class were all so passionate, caring and so thoughtful with what they brought to the class.  I was so amazed ever class how she was able to facilitate discussion to allow for the best possible environment  asking questions that made us think deeper than we originally did, bringing up counterpoints, and adding onto our analysis. She would add to the conversation with really thoughtful background or analysis  and I wish I could just write every single word she said so I could remember it.",
    "Yes! To anyone interested in any type of history, this is a valuable course.",
    "Yes, Mary Lui is such a wonderful and kind professor, and the classroom environment is encouraging to students from all backgrounds!",
    "YES!! TAKE THIS SEMINAR IF YOU CAN GET IN! This has been the most meaningful course I have taken during my time at Yale. Just the reading list alone is enough of a motivation to take this course; even digesting the diverse readings (memoirs, film, fiction, oral histories, fascinating scholarly work, etc) on my own taught me so incredibly much and elucidated not only aspects of history I have little exposure to but also thoughtful questions that stuck with me for long after. The discussions with my dedicated seminar mates and Professor Lui further helped me process the readings and the questions they brought up. Professor Lui is also SO knowledgeable, providing helpful insight during class discussions, and generous with her time, making time for students to meet with her about our paper throughout the semester despite all her many commitments as Head of TD. Finally, as an Asian American woman, much of what I learned and discussed in this course helped recontextualize the experiences of my own family and my life."
