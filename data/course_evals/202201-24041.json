                "Strengths: Professor van Tassel is amazing, always very willing to stay back to help answer questions or concerns. He is also very accommodating and has flexible office hours. The psets weren't too long and very doable, if you needed any help, there was plentiful office hours. Weaknesses: None at all.",
                "weakness: the homework was UNNECESSARILY and outrageously long, often because you had to look up random constants. facts, or equations (and had to figure out that this info must be looked up and is not expected to be known), not because the problem itself was difficult\/time consuming to answer",
                "I really enjoyed the course because it was based on the book so I always felt able to go back to each chapter if I ever had questions which is not possible for every class.",
                "Honestly, I thought it was a really well taught course. The only potential weakness I could think of was that office hours with the professor were on Mondays, which was not ideal for me mostly because I had not started the problem sets by Monday. However, I feel this is more of a personal problem than a critique of the course.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it was a good introduction to engineering concepts and we got a lot of individual attention because the class size was very small. The weaknesses of this course were that the lectures were really long and somewhat boring so it was hard to stay engaged for the full duration. Also each practice problem took a really long time so we didnt get to see as many examples during class. It was at times frustrating when homework and test problems didnt seem like anything we had seen in class.",
                "I think the material that we learned was taught well, but most of the class time was used for going over example problems, and it feels like the pacing of the class was on the slower side."

I believe the class teaches things that are not always viewed as chemical engineering though they fall into the field, so taking this class would help have a better understanding of all of the engineering branches",
