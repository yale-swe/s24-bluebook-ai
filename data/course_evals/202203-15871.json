We got to cover ideas of sex, drugs, consciousness, and gender that you rarely get to approach in school. There is a manageable workload. A weakness can be the looseness of discussion, where it often gets offtrack. It can be hard to make your voice heard or get things back on topic. I wish there had been more clarity of the midterm, which wasn't part of our grade breakdown originally."
