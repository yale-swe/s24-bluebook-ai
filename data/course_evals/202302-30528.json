Firstly, I learned Yale has many resources for research such as librarians, GIS, EndNote, etc., and that I should definitely consult librarians when it comes to future research topics. I also learned how to properly write scientific papers, including implementing citations. Overall, you learn how to present information effectively and coherently through visuals and speaking. With that in mind, you learn skills outside the classroom, such as interacting with professionals inside the lab and applying the criticism that is given to your work in order to improve.",

                "I believe the frequent oral presentations and the frank feedback was a strength of this course. Because students are not required to present everyday, there was the tendency for students to do other work while their peers presented. Eventually, some students began not coming to class on the days they were not presenting. Unless students are giving direct feedback to their peers, they likely won't want to rewatch the same presentation week after week.",
                "Strengths: Many skills learned. Weaknesses: Because the program is so short, everyone in the class is at different points of research and data collection. At the 5 and 6-week mark, the organization of the class starts to get a little messy because many of us do not have data yet. Without data, it gets difficult writing our papers and creating our presentations-- thus making our work less coherent and resulting in point deductions . When we end up collecting data at the 7 week mark, it gets hectic because we would need to rewrite our papers and reorganize our presentations.",
                "Overall the course is taught very well. However, adding scientific lab skills such as pipetting, making gels, etc could be useful.",
                "loved how close knit it was. can always find help if you need it. was a little disorganized but it did not bother me",
                "Needs to be organized better in terms of assignments.",
                "strengths: a lot of good feedback.\r\nweakness: sometimes the tas and the profs are not in accordance.",
                "Class didnt help very much outside of the presentations. Paper felt like we had to do it a lot by ourselves with little guidance.",
                "Lectures were sometimes a little forced and not planned, but overall helped us with structuring a scientific paper and presenting scientific information in the best way possible",
                "I enjoyed how the presentations and paper were broken up into chunks so that the workload felt more manageable. I also enjoyed how we were broken up into sections for the presentations.",
                "N\/A",
                "It was very intense and I felt that even though it said results were not required, I felt pressure from my professors to have them.",
                "Strengths were that it really dove deep into presentations and how to have good flow within your presentations.  However, the main weakness was the fast-paced nature of the class and the excessive amount of presentations we had to give.",
                "The strength of the course lies in effective feedback of presentation from formulating slides to presenting with body and voice. The gradual buildup of the paper was also a high strength of the course as it allowed me to build upon the sections of the paper. However, I felt the assignments could be explained better as I was confused about a lot of the assignments."

If you haven't done research before, you learn how to speak and present information to an audience, you learn how to organize information in essays in an effective and coherent manner, and you learn how to critically think in the lab (along with professionally interact with your mentor and PI). The presentation at the end is a sweet way of seeing the fruition of your efforts over the past 8 weeks, no matter how heavy the workload may have been. It's also a good bridge because a lot of our peers at Yale already had this experience coming in, and we (who don't have the experience) finally get the chance to catch on.",
