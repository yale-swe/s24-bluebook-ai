                "strengths: this course was incredibly intellectually rigorous and the discussion quality was very high. it teaches you how to think, and the course material is also extremely applicable to the point where I was surprised I had not thought deeply about it before in other courses. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the reading load was sometimes overwhelming, however it varied week to week.",
                "Amazing syllabus, good discussion, and the weekly reading/discussion responses are helpful. Some of the readings are long and dense, and Im not sure that its worth the time to go through them in their entireties in a thorough manner, so suggestions about which parts to focus on for the discussion would be nice.",
                "Strengths: great class discussions and Canvas posts, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Small seminar of 15-18 students, about half of which are graduate students (generally in philosophy or political science). Professor Shapiro is one of Yale's most renowned social scientists and that is reflected in his teaching and engagement with student class participation. Other than one page weekly reflections, which are nothing to stress about, the course only requires 16 pages of writing, which is a far cry from other philosophy courses that require anywhere from 25 to 50+ pages. This allows you to focus much more on doing the readings, asking questions, and contemplating the course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some weeks have over 150 pages of reading, and given the depth and intensity of class discussion, this is *not* the class for which it is advisable to skip or \"SparkNotes\" the readings. This is no big deal for former DS students and others in upper-level humanities courses, but was a challenge for me since this was my first Yale philosophy course.",
                "It was a really interesting class but some of the readings were pretty theoretical and we really relied on being able to ask questions about them in class to understand them. Class time was therefore a lot of just Professor Shapiro explaining things which was interesting but not as engaging as some other seminars have been.",
                "This was meant to be a class for graduate students; it ended up having a fair amount of undergrads. I am one of them so Im in no position to critique this  but I will say these readings were fairly difficult. I would have appreciated maybe some context or explanations  maybe before class so we wouldnt lose precious discussion time."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, definitely, if you're looking for a course on philosophy of science. Even though this course is cross-listed with poli sci, EP&E, and global affairs, it's primarily a rigorous philosophy course. You don't really need to have any background with the subject material, but I think if I had not taken other upper-level philosophy courses before I would feel a little lost.",
                "This is a fantastic course and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in political science as an academic field. I have a sense that whether one is interested in the empirical side or the philosophical side of politics, this course can be really helpful. In particular, if you have ever been bothered by the thought whats the value of all this after you read a political science paper, went to a colloquium, or took another course in the department, then this course may help you figure out some answers.",
                "Yes. Initially I felt very much outside my comfort zone, but I started to get the hang of things after the first few sessions. Professor Shapiro is extremely knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions outside of class. The class vibe was also very friendly and collaborative.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend Philosophy of Science for the Study of Politics to anyone interested in philosophy, economics, political science, or any combination of the above. It opens your eyes vis-a-vis the enormous structural problems that political science in particular faces as a discipline and how they can be resolved through philosophical debates. This course self-selects for highly motivated students who meaningfully contribute in class, and Professor Shapiro is excellent and always available in office hours.\r\n\r\nThis is a great example of a course where you learn from a professor teaching his own ideas.",
                "I'd recommend it to someone who likes philosophy and has done a bit of political philosophy before. If someone was interested without a philosophy background they could definitely do it but would probably have a steeper learning curve.",
                "Definitely worth it; I expected the course to feel mostly theoretical but I was pleasantly surprised by how many real world examples Professor Shapiro brought into the course. So much of political science research trying to answer important questions is based on these theoretical texts and approaches. Understanding them is important. I would say if you are interested in a political science PhD this is probably useful to see how you like such courses."
