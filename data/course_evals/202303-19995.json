I developed my critical/analytical skills, math skills, graphing skills, etc. This course has provided me with the skills to read articles in The Economist, the WSJ, the Financial Times, etc. Now I actually understand the terms so I can understand what they're talking about!!",

                "Through this course, I gained a solid foundation in Macroeconomics that allowed me to become more aware of how the economy operates. This course gives a very well-rounded yet nuanced view of economics, so I was able to learn both foundational knowledge and its applications. For example, we started the course by learning how to construct models of GDP, but by the end of the course, we learned how to interpret and apply those models to explain the behavior of specific economies.",

Key areas such as GDP analysis, international trade, business cycles, and monetary policy were covered in depth. Additionally, the course effectively addressed crucial issues like economic inequality. One of the strengths of this course was how it linked theoretical concepts to current economic discussions and topics. This real-world relevance not only aided in understanding but also increased the practical utility of the knowledge gained. The balance between theoretical frameworks and their practical applications was particularly appreciated."

                "I liked the worksheets/pset pairs. Good resources. Prof Peters is a great lecturer and the course is super well structured. Prof Hawkins was great too!! No complaints!",
                "This course was organized VERY well. We had access to lecture slides, previous exams, section slides, lecture summaries, and literally anything else we could've needed! All of the logistical information was easily accessible, all deadlines were made extremely clear. I was never confused about the expectations in this course. The Psets and workshets were challenging, but manageable and helpful for my understanding of the content. There isn't much that I'd do to improve the course!",
                "It's a class where you know exactly what it will look like.",
                "I liked the worksheets, they were a good learning tool.",
                "Strengths: it was well organized and the lectures were posted online in a timely manner. Weaknesses: it's not a very interactive course, which is to be expected, as it's a large lecture (although Prof. Peters tried to encouraged participation in the lecture).",
                "The strengths was the office hours. The weakness was the pace of the lectures.",
                "I think a strength of this course is how a lot of the concepts can be reinforced by math\r\nA weakness is how specific certain questions on the exam are regarding things such as the exact savings rate of the US or the exact percentage of labor share of income",
                "Very well organized and well-taught. So many materials and resources available for you all the time.",
                "I thought this course was taught very well. The slides were clear. I wish we had done a little more practice with the concepts in class, instead of just in section and on the PSets.",
                "I think that there are a lot of conversations in class when it should be more lecture style.",
                "A strength of the course is the various supplementary materials that are concise and easily accessible. The lecture slides, textbook, and TF support were monumental in making the course more engaging.",
                "I greatly appreciated the worksheets, they were a great, risk-free way of ensuring understanding of course content.",
                "One of the strengths was that the course was very well organized.",
                "I thought it was really good and I don't really have many suggestions for improvement.",
                "Strengths: This course comprehensively covers topics that I think everyone should have some baseline amount of knowledge around, even if you're not an economics major. I also think that this course is pretty applicable and relevant to the real world in ways that other introductory classes may not be. For instance, in almost every lecture, our professor connected what we were learning back to some historical or contemporary relevance. Sections covered confusing points from lecture and were largely guided by what students felt needed to be covered, which was helpful. The Ed Discussion thread also was immensely helpful for quick questions and we received responses very shortly after posting questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt as though the styles of our exams, particularly the final, were more a test of our test-taking skills as opposed to our knowledge of macroeconomics. While tests should be a combination of both, a lot of questions felt as though they were skewed toward the former. Something that I struggled with was that a lot of lectures were conducted in a way that assumed everyone had the same base-level fluency and understanding of economics concepts that not everyone has. For instance, the lecture on the financial crisis was particularly hard to grasp.",
                "Tough exams!",
                "Really well delivered lectures, organized, very quick turnaround for grades, lots of opportunities to get help (great office hours, quick responses on Ed Discussion). \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "I found it difficult to be fully present and giving my full attention to the lecture for the whole 75 minutes. However, the lecture itself was fantastic and I also really enjoyed the discussion section as well.",
                "Good sections",
                "The course was very well organized.",
                "The course's lectures were very engaging and integrated current/recent events in order to allow us to connect theoretical concepts to real-life trends. The course also had excellent TAs and support for exams/problem sets, including review materials, worksheet assignments, and review sessions.",
                "The weaknesses were definitely the exams. All exams were very hard, and, most importantly, very vague and long. In my opinion, they were very hard to complete within the given time and we needed extra time for all of them. Also, some of the questions were very ambiguous. The correct answer was not straightforward. In both exams and problem sets, the true-false questions were not clear at all, some were not even covered in class, and all answers seemed plausible. In general, they were very vague, which means that all answers and explanations seemed correct. This is confirmed by the fact that at the solutions of exams and problem sets, the course team accepted multiple answers as correct. This means that in some cases people who had answered true and people who had answered false in a true false question, received the same amount of credit, which means that the question was not covered in class, not clear and vague enough to just give credit to everybody.\r\n\r\nI also think that doing the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model would be more effective and useful than the I S/MP Phillips model. Not seeing the aggregate demand aggregate supply model in an introductory macro class confused me a bit.\r\n\r\nBUT, I think the strengths of this class outweigh the weaknesses. The biggest strength was definitely organisation and help from the course staff, course director, and the TAs was very helpful in answering all the questions, and the most helpful resource was the Ed discussion forum. Everybody was very helpful in both administrative and practical questions, and I quite appreciated that, I think this greatly facilitated my learning and navigating through this class.",
                "Overall, I think the course is quite strong and structured well. The workload was reasonable and we still managed to cover a lot of material. There was real world knowledge gained over the course as well, in addition to theory.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peters is a fantastic lecturer and a great mentor; he always makes himself available to students and genuinely cares about the growth and progress of his students. I also felt very well supported by the peer tutors and TAs, and, overall, I felt that the course was designed well to maximize learning efficacy and help students succeed. No significant weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the workload and presentations were regimented. However, there were not many opportunities to engage with the professor in order to grasp the course material to a greater degree.",
                "Very clear information, but exams were intended to trick students who knew the information well",
                "The course materials and teaching methods facilitated manageable learning, even with complex subjects. This approach fostered a deeper understanding and engagement with the subject matter."

His enthusiasm for the course material is infectious, and he makes a sincere effort at audience engagement during the lectures. The worksheets and psets are not impossible, and genuinely help facilitate learning.

                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it teaches topics that are relevant to everyone, not just economics majors. No matter the field you are going in, but especially if it concerns politics, international relations, or economics obviously, it's helpful to understand how economic policy is conducted, how trade works, and how the financial system works.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about macroeconomics, even if they are not an economics (or related) major. The course provides an understanding of topics that can be applied easily in the real world, and to a variety of disciplines.",
                "I would, as I said it served as an excellent introduction to macro economics. I would have to say this is a very challenging and quite a difficult class although it is interesting.",
                "Yep, macroecon is something I think everyone should take just to be able to process and understand key parts of our world.",
