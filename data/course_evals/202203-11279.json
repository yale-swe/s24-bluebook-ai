                "When I started the course, I only knew a few words in Japanese, and now its like I am on the path towards a journey into another world with many things that are completely new to me. \r\n\r\nThis was the first foreign language class that I have ever taken, and it was a pleasure to learn from Nishimura Sensei.",
                "A great introduction to Japanese - I feel completely prepared to take higher-difficulty classes!",
                "PLEASE don't be intimidated - I just want to be as helpful as possible with my description: hiragana, katakana, 67 kanji, basic greetings and expressions, places, telling time, days of the week, transition phrases, foods, family members, making plans, basic verbs and adjectives to describe familiar situations, objects you'd see when you're shopping, transportation, dining, counting, counters (yep different from counting), various grammar structure things, nature, types of building in a town, types of things in a house, activities and events, daily routines, describing people, colors, etc. AGAIN, PLEASE don't be intimidated!! It was SO much fun learning all of this. You'll be surprised how much you learn, it's SO worth it! And now I can pick up phrases here and there when I watch shows in Japanese and it's just such a gratifying experience. You'll grow so much in this class it's amazing.",
                "The course gave me an introductory level of Japanese grammar and vocabulary  specifically present, future and past tense, use of adjectives and some more complicated conjunctions. These were the skills I expected from the course and am satisfied with it. I look forward to continuing to learn Japanese next semester.",
                "I learnt beginner Japanese at an incredible pace, with the ability now to hold simple conversation.",
                "Simply put, I have learned so much since taking this course. In the span of 3-4 months, I have developed speaking, listening, and writing skills in many (social) contexts. I have learned lots of grammar and vocabulary, while also being able to hone conversations in various social situations.",
                "I have taken away a stronger ability to communicate and hold basic conversation in Japanese than I ever thought possible in one semester.",
                "Having no prior experience with Japanese before taking this course, I felt the class was very manageable. Given the amount of work needed to succeed in this class, I always left knowing more and being able to grasp the learning experience fairly easily. For me, the most challenging part was handling the time commitment to a language course. But this is something that can be easily achieved. I feel I have come out of the course knowing a lot more than I expected, being able to speak, read, and write a decent amount of Japanese for a level one student."

                "I can only speak to my own experience, the strengths for me were the vast availability of resources and the expertise and friendliness of the instructor.\r\n\r\nRegarding improvements/ weaknesses, I don't feel like I am in a position to make any remarks.",
                "The course is amazing - the instructor is fun and engaged, while the focus on spoken practice in class was particularly valuable. Do note that the workload is very high, with a few hours of work required each day.",
                "All strengths, no weaknesses. Honestly the professors are so engaging, I connected very well with my peers, and it's such an interactive class in a really safe environment. There's no reason to not take it, as long as you're curious about learning Japanese!",
                "The strength of the course is also a weakness of it  the course is very very fast paced and relies on a lot of external work from the student. While this helps cover more material quickly, a student who is not expecting the level of workload within this course will quickly fall behind. Anyone taking this course needs to be aware of and prepared for its intensity.",
                "This course draws strength from its small class size resulting in individual language attention as well as extensive spoken practice, so that everything you learn is immediately put into practice. I would say it suffers from quite a bit of work, but that might be necessary for the pace of learning.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the small class size, as it allowed for deeper discussion and individual progression. I also really enjoyed the Japanese Language Clinics, as they allowed me to practice speaking a lot. One weakness I would say, though, has to do with the self-learning element of the course. I believe we should do reviews of what we learned on our own the previous nights, at least for the complex topics such as grammar.",
                "The course is very fast-paced but has to be to get you on a working level of Japanese. The materials we are given, like songs, sheets, videos, and powerpoints help a lot in keeping track of everything we are learning. The only issue I encountered was keeping up with the vocab as some of the vocab we used wasn't in the books, so I had to always write down any words I was unfamiliar with.",
                "I would consider the professor to be a strength of this course. She is equally patient with her student's learning abilities as she is in challenging her students. I found class time with her to be very fun and engaging. The course requirement is also a positive as it will provide you with the necessities to truly learn the language. Weakness of this course would be the time commitment outside of class and the difficulty in learning an East Asian language. With three different writing systems and much foreign pronunciation, it does make learning the language more challenging."

I don't think I would have been able to make it through this course if it wasn't for her. She is a great teacher, and she genuinely cares about her students.",
                "Yes, definitely - I loved the class!",
                "YES! I met my best friends in this class and the professors of Japanese are THE BEST. They really know what they're doing. The classes are so interactive and fun and get this, my class was at 9am and I STILL looked forward to it everyday. It's the single best decision I made in my first semester here at Yale. Take this class!! You'll learn so much and you won't regret it! There's quite a bit of work, but it doesn't even feel like work sometimes.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone set on learning Japanese. While very interesting and rewarding, this course requires consistent commitment from anyone taking it and the benefit you gain is proportional to the effort you put in. I would caution against taking this course without recognising the high commitment level it demands, but anyone who is passionate about the subject will thoroughly enjoy this course.",
                "Yes I would! It's a blast and Nishimura sensei is a great teacher. You will learn an incredible amount in a very sort amount of time. However, I will say that it is a lot of work.",
                "Yes, this course is incredible if you wish to get a quick and deep dive into Japanese language, as well as exposure to Japanese culture. The best part about this course was the final project where we had to plan a Japan itinerary, where we were hypothetically given $12,000 and had to create an entire presentation on our trip. Not only did that allow me to research more into Japan (and potentially plan my future study abroad ideas), but also helped reinforced a lot of the things we have learned since the beginning. It surprised me that we were able to carry on a presentation in Japanese for 10 minutes, but that just simply shows how much we have progressed.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. If anyone has an interest in Japanese culture and/or the language and would like a strong introduction to the language, they should take this course.",
                "If you're interesting in learning an East Asian language I would highly recommend this course. Yes, there are aspects that are difficult. However, the level of proficiency you will receive is well worth it, even as a beginner."
