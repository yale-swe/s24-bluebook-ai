We learned a significant amount about the different types of evidence from textual to archaeological. It was really great to fill in this gap in my historical knowledge.",

                "I liked how the students were invited to participate in debates about unknown points in Assyrian history (i.e., who killed Sennacherib?). I liked the interdisciplinary aspect of the course as well, engaging in both archaeology and biblical studies in addition to its main focus on Assyriology. I liked how we were invited to present on the readings throughout the course. I honestly don't think the class had any real weaknesses.",
                "I found the material and the readings really interesting. It was a period for which I only had a cursory knowledge so each class felt like brand new material. We also had to chance to jump in and ask questions during the mini-lectures so it was easy to stay engaged. Sometimes we got a little side-tracked on tangents that were still interesting, but we occasionally had to rush through some of the bigger moments.",
                "The professor is very knowledgeable and can often just speak from memory about complicated matters, this does lead to the class straying slightly from the plan set by the syllabi, which is not always a bad thing! This does mean that the scheduled reading was revised quit frequently which prevented getting ahead",
                "I think there could be more small assignments so not everything is based on the midterm and final.",
                "The course is very well-organized and does a good job covering a large period of time. The workload is very manageable. There is always some difficulty in a class that is heavily primary source-based when the texts are all in translation, but that can't be helped because most students obviously don't know Akkadian. However, I would have liked to see a little more visual material culture incorporated into the class rather than so many texts. There was a good balance of lecture and discussion during class time. The visit to the Babylonian collection was a lot of fun, and it helps with engagement if you have held tablets in your hand and tried writing in cuneiform. I have to say, some of the time spent on the Bible seemed unnecessary, and instead I would like to have spent more time on the middle stages of the Assyrian empire and the magnates.",

The class size isn't too large and the workload is exceedingly manageable making it a great extra class to fit into your schedule to learn about something totally new.",

Professor Frahm really is an authority on the topic and makes the material feel very relevant and easy to understand. The history of the Assyrians, especially the Sargonid kings who are covered at the end of the class, is particularly exciting in a narrative sense. There are enough assassinations, coups d'etat, and general intrigue to keep it interesting.",
