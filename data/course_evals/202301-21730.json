                "Strengthened abilities of harmonic and melodic transcription and analysis, ear training, active listening, etc. Also learned about the history of pop music and various genre's (disco, hip hop, alt rock) position within history.",

                "Strengths: I loved the seminar style of this class (as opposed to 207). I really got to learn from all the other students, and I liked all the discussions we had. The only improvement I could see is a little more theory teaching in class. Overall, the best fifth class I could take--no stress, learned a lot, and fun!",
                "Strengths: The flexibility you have to study what you want is excitingyou're not bound to a music assignment that doesn't excite you, which I've heard is a problem with other classes in the music department. This class is also very little workit's effectively a twice-a-week music discussion hang.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't learn very much because you aren't expected to produce any serious theoretical analysis of popular music. The assignments could also be more creative and educational. It often felt like a compromise between a theory and history class, with not enough of either. The conversations are also usually disorganized.",
                "I liked the loose and unstructured nature of our discussions. However, sometimes it felt like it could cause people to get left out when the discussion got too high-level and fast-paced.",
                "Strengths: always very engaging and fun, professor always listened to what students wanted\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Prof. Adam is one of the best profs at Yale, maybe my favorite I've had. His attitude, curiosity, encouragement of students' interests, enthusiasm for the material, and utter expertise make this class rock. He fosters a wonderful vibe (along with all the students) of mutual respect, excitement, and effort. I looked so forward to this class everyday. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Weeks of teacher-led material alternate with student presentations, so you get the opportunity to share your insights on your choice of music and hear the same from your classmates.  Incredibly engaging!"

                "1000%. Favorite class I've taken at Yale. It's just delightful, no other way about it. You'll learn so much form Prof. Adam and from the other students. All of the work is meaningful, ie no assignments feel like 'busy work.'",
                "Yes! Nate is a fantastic teacher and the class is so unique and interesting and very educational about popular music theory, which is a field that is not widely covered or understood.",
