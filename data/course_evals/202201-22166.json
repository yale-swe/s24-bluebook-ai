                "Very understanding professor, reasonable workload, and reasonable difficulty of exams\/problem sets. I think doing practice problems in the lecture would help improve understanding.",
                "I think this class needs a TA; there was a lot of material and the lectures moved quite fast, but prof. Lora did not have a lot of time for office hours. The content is interesting and the book is good.",
                "Strengths: This course had great organization and strong lectures. I enjoyed lecture every day and found the content to be interesting and relevant. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was primarily difficult when it departed from the main textbook. The departures were often to add more depth for more advanced topics, so the lack of continuity led to some difficulties when working on problem sets and exams.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, small class environment was nice\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of feedback and not a lot of office hours. ULAs would have been very helpful.",
                "Strengths: the course material and textbook greatly overlap, so it is helpful to have a second resource. Professor Lora also makes the classroom feel more like a discussion, so it is easy to ask clarifying questions. I also appreciate that Professor Lora placed a stronger emphasis on understanding the overall concepts versus memorizing everything. Exams were open note. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the course concepts are difficult to understand.",
                "It is well organized around student learning in terms of the order of information presented.",
                "The course was outlined with great topics, sometimes some of the explanations could've been more clear.",
                "The problem sets were really reasonable and well paced. The lectures, on the other hand, were a little slow paced in that we spent a lot of time on the same things and then rushed through the other things as a result. So I feel like there is room to improve the pace and depth of the lectures."
