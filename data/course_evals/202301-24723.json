                "I learned some essential aspects about white collar crime.",

                "More engagement from other students.",

                "Engaging material and Brad has an interesting career that provides for insightful discussion.",
                "Professor Simons is very knowledgable and kind. The books were very good, and the topics were extremely interesting. I think that the course could have been improved by having more discussions and diving into specific case law. Other than that it was a good survey of various white collar crimes and the broader implications of them.",
                "Professor Simon is extremely nice and cared a lot about his student's learning. However, the amount of reading was unmanageable, so it seemed that most students did not do it. This led to wasted class time, and not much material was learned. I think this course would be much better if Professor Simon started each class with a lecture about the assigned readings instead of opening the floor to questions right away. This course has a lot of potential but just needs more structure and less pages of reading.",
                "It wasnt the most organized course but the professors personal experience as an attorney combined with the guest lectures made the course pretty insightful overall",
                "A strength of this course is the books and the assigned reading  they were really insightful, and the knowledge of Professor Simon is vast! I would love to see the course be more of a conversation\/discussion rather than feeling like a mini-lecture, however!",
                "Readings are not tied into class discussion very well. Professor had a lot of interesting things to say and class\/lecture was always informative and engaging but we failed to really get into class discussions on the readings",
                "Strengths: content is super interesting, and the class readings focus more on recent high-profile cases (i.e. Martha Stewart, Barry Bonds, Elizabeth Holmes, etc.) rather than more dense legal texts, which makes reading a lot easier and more engaging; Weaknesses: the classroom could benefit from a bit more structure to the conversation -- things always kept moving, but there wasn't really set topics that we would discuss",
                "This course could be improved with more structure. Pointed questions about the reading to facilitate conversation, group discussion, and presentations about the readings would offer the course more structure and encourage more people to participate.",
                "The session with the guest speaker was amazing- was very cool to hear from a journalists perspective about how white collar crime is covered and the relationship between police, prosecutors, and the media. At times, the reading was a bit much so some people participated more\/less than others"

Professor Simons is very kind, and he provides students with great resources and knowledge. We also had 2 great guest speakers who gave interesting perspectives on the topic.",
                "Yes! But only if you are looking for a very chill class.",

                "Definitely- It's a low-stress, interesting course that provides a great introductory survey to white collar crime in America.",
                "The course was unorganized. People did not participate very much, and it was difficult to find connections between the readings.",
                "If youre looking for a class where you get out what you put in, this is the right one for you. Professor Simon is super knowledgeable but you have to come to class with questions and ideas for the discussion to be productive sometimes during weeks with less interesting topics, the class was very dry and slow.",
                "Yes I would!  Readings were interesting and I learned a lot just from talking with professor Simon. Hes very smart and personable and it was overall a very chill class ."
