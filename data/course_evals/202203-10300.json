We learned about the essential filmmakers (Errol Morris, Robert Flaherty, Robert Gardner, Dziga Vertov, Jean Luc-Goddard, Michael Moore, etc) and movements in documentary film and how their works and philosophies influenced each other. We also learned how to analyze these films through and critical historical lens."

Professor Musser is clearly incredibly experienced, and just having the opportunity to learn from him was a highlight of the course. In terms of weaknesses, I would love to see even more female directors listed! I would also have perhaps appreciated a little more constructive feedback on my midterm.",

                "YES!!! Professor Musser is brilliant and you will get an education that otherwise you would not have access to because of his passionate teaching style and very forward teaching. He understand the importance of documentary filmmaking and as a student you truly are able to understand that this is within his realm of expertise from the moment you walk into class.",
                "Yes! In fact, I cannot stop singing its praises. In a world that operates on images more and more each day, I believe that should be a required class for all Yale students. It was a wonderful way to get to learn the history of image-making and to learn how to be critical about the media\/content we consume."
