In the first module, the experiments taught me a lot about the basics of NMR spectroscopy and the science behind technologies such as MRI.

                "didn't feel relevant - all labs now program in Python or R but we used Matlab. the procedures felt a bit outdated!",
                "Module 1 (NMR) was not conducive to learning because two groups had to watch on zoom while the third group was in person. The professor was nice for that module and overall, I believe I learned a lot about NMR, but the experience of being on zoom and seeing/hearing/understanding nothing in the moment was not great. Module 2 was fine. Module 3 was pretty fun, except for that fact that sometimes doing a lab with 5 people in the group meant that two people were doing the work and the other three were just sitting around.",
                "I enjoyed how the class was set up as 3 separate modules and the lab report structure of each of them.",
                "Strengths: 3rd module of nanoparticle-cell interactions was very interesting but a bit chaotic given that much of the cell culture was done in not the most sanitary spaces and instructions were a bit vague. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs were not clear in what the intention was (what we should have gotten out of it)",
                "Every module is so different. I wish there is a more standardized type of module. Each faculty for the modules were helpful in different ways and expected different things for thier module.",
                "The strengths of the course was that the modules were quick so if you didnt like one, you had to wait. A weakness of the course was that the lab reports were sometimes very long.",
                "The first module (NMR) of this class was very disorganized due to the covid requirements which severely hindered learning and made the experience somewhat useless. The second module (MatLab image processing) was very interesting and engaging, but it was too long at times and it was difficult sitting for so long in front of a screen trying to figure out code, so there might be a better way to teach the section. The final section (NPs) was fantastic and there was nothing I would change. A final feedback is that the lab reports were a bit too time consuming and long/tedious so maybe something could be done to address that.",
                "Strengths: hands on learning is the best. You learn so many things you don't even realize along the way. Different modules complement one another well, and the profs and TFs clearly have put time into crafting the course. Great working in groups as well as courses are so often individual.\r\n\r\nWeakenesses: lab reports feel manufactured and take a lot of time except for the module 2 in which they are split up. I would suggest making smaller reports due each week in all modules.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed the various modules. I found module 2 to be a source of strength, as I was able to hone my skills in MATLAB. I found module 1 less engaging, however, as we had to do two weeks on zoom.",
                "It was mostly good, I would try to make the first section a bit more engaging for those not in person.",
                "Strengths include the complexity of material, assistance of TAs, working in groups, and detail of procedures. However, the lab reports were long and tedious, with some expectations left vague (second module only).",
                "Strengths: the experiments we performed seemed very relevant and were enjoyable to complete",
                "Really cool being able to do different labs in different groups! The super long lab reports due to only 3 lab reports total over the semester was challenging, but was good overall",
                "The first module wasn't as hands on as I would have liked because we had to split into three groups across three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe last two modules encouraged students to be independent which I think helped me grow and mature as scientist. I was responsible for following the protocol, understanding it and executing without much assistance from teachers."

The group aspect of the course was especially beneficial, as each member can contribute to overall understanding of content should anyone be confused.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to biomedical engineering majors. The BME major is often very conceptually-focused, so this lab provided a great opportunity to see how some of the concepts we learned about in the classroom translate practically.",
