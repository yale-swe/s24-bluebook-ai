I was pushed to think about causes and effects of things like solar energy, and how to really investigate things below surface level. For example, the use of electric cars is more beneficial depending on the state (and how that state receives its energy).",

I also learned a lot about the Yale campus. I heard about the technology involved in powering Yale and its buildings and also saw different STEM facilities.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: extremely low workload (just 3 homeworks, a midterm, and a final project), fairly interesting if you like science.  You take several tours in the second half of the semester where you learn about the specific facitilies Yale has, such as the CEID, Kroon Hall, or that one building with a quantum computer in the basement.  Also the professor is very sweet, and sometimes gives out trinkets in class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: kind of boring if you don't like science.",
                "I think the course could improve by having more student-to-student discussions rather than the teacher just lecturing for the majority of the time. In this way, it could be more of a seminar. The field trips and guest lectures were a neat touch.",
                "It really enjoyed learning about a lot of different things, but I feel because we covered so much, I wasn't able to grasp anything fully. It also would've been nice to have the guest lectures sprinkled in the course evenly and not just saved for the end because they were pretty fun!",
                "Strengths - visiting and learning about the campus. Had some very interesting speakers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of repetition. Felt like we mentioned governor Newsom's energy policies 3-4 times. More content with less repetition would help.",
                "A strength of this course is the guest lectures. I learned a lot about what people did in their careers and gained insight into the type of research or studies people work on after graduation. I think a weakness of this course could be a less student collaboration than I expected. I don't think I came out of this course with many close friends.",
                "Strengths: interesting incorporation of sustainability, engaging topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much discussion/participation of students, sometimes too much like a lecture.",
                "Very low workload and overall a good science credit class. Weaknesses: I feel like some concepts were brushed too quickly, and the mid-term was brutal in terms of time (+30 written questions to answer in 1h15, actually less because it took 15 minutes to start the test).",
                "I think that there shouldve been more review for the midterm. I also think a clearer syllabus for the midterm would've been nice.",
                "Strengths: very comprehensive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: concepts were only explained once, so difficult concepts were very hard to grasp (without the helpful repetition or reexplanation that often accompanies such explanations)",
                "The topics that the course covers are a bit miscellaneous, but I did find everything we covered interesting and topical.",

                "I would. It is a very good introduction to science for non-scientists. If you want a high degree of rigour or know science well, this is not for you. However, as a humanities student, it was worth it.",

                "Yes. You learn about interesting inventions on a deep level that you might not otherwise learn about. Its engaging but not too challenging, it wont need to be prioritized before your other classes.",
