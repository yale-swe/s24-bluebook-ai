    "My French grammar skills got a lot better, as did my reading comprehension",
    "This course definitely helped me improve my French writing, speaking, and listening skills. I learned a lot of vocabulary and grammar that advanced my knowledge of the French language obtained from taking French L3 and L4, making this course a great transition from these previous courses.",
    "Improved my vocabulary, ability to write about films and books, and ability and converse with ease and confidence",
    "This class is a great review of French grammar as a whole and it also teaches some new concepts you might not have seen before. You practice speaking and listening a lot, as the class is conducted 100% in French 100% of the time.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course! My grammar, writing abilities, oral presentation skills, and reading abilities greatly improved. I enjoyed this course very much!",
    "Expanded vocab and practiced language fluidity",
    "Refreshed skills learned in 140, expanded vocabulary, learned more conversational skills",
    "My French grammar and speaking skills improved greatly through regular practice in class and homework."

   "comments": [
    "The course is very well suited for perfecting French grammar\/understanding some of the nuances of what we learned in L3 and L4. I did wish we had more opportunities to speak in class - the class was so short that by the time we went through grammar, our discussion of the books\/movies was pretty short, and some of the questions were pretty targeted so we didn't often have open, animated conversations",
    "This course is well-organized with 3 midterms, 2 oral exams, 3 written assignments, and a final exam. I found the course packet, which contained grammar and vocabulary exercises useful. Additionally, the homework assignments from the course packet helped me keep up with the course material. I enjoyed the books and short stories that we read, which also helped me learn more about French history and culture. The class was small (about 15 students), which I thought was really nice to be able to get to know everyone and to all get opportunities to talk in class. I enjoyed the class and there isn't anything I would change!",
    "Strengths: structured to improve conversational\/speaking ability\r\nWeaknesses: wished more emphasis was placed on grammar especially since all of the exams covered a large portion of this material",
    "All the discussion was very helpful for practicing speaking and listening, however the discussion was a little dry, as most of the time it was about literature. Some of the works we read were interesting, but none were exceptional. I wish the class had been structured around conversation, but just in a general and somewhat colloquial style. There is no real need for literature to be the basis of language instruction at this level when instead we could be reading news articles, watching TV shows, etc.",
    "There was a great balance between grammar and literary analysis. However, the last text felt rushed due to the amount of material that needed to be covered in the course.",
    "Moves fast but also little time to discuss grammar",
    "I thought Professor Skorupa always brought a lot of enthusiasm to the course and put a lot of effort into making the syllabus well-rounded. The readings were interesting and the workload was balanced. I feel that a lot of learning grammar was done for homework, and reviewed in class the next day. I felt this was sometimes too fast-paced and grammar could be glanced over if not given enough attention outside of class, and would have liked to spend more time on learning certain rules and concepts in class."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get a better grasp of French grammar, and feel prepared to take more advanced French literature courses",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to any student considering advancing their French speaking, writing, and listening skills. However, I think this class focuses more on building upon grammar and vocabulary skills than listening and oral skills.  I felt I improved my knowledge of the French language a lot. The class follows nicely after the L3 and L4 courses taught here. The workload wasn't bad (about 1-2 hours of work on average to do before every class) and the course is well-organized with with 3 midterms, 2 oral exams, 3 written assignments, and a final exam. I found the course packet, which contained grammar and vocabulary exercises useful. Additionally, the homework assignments from the course packet helped me keep up with the course material. I enjoyed the books and short stories that we read, which also helped me learn more about French history and culture. The class was small (about 15 students), which I thought was really nice to be able to get to know everyone and to all get opportunities to talk in class.Professor Skorupa is a welcoming and wonderful professor and I would definitely recommended taking the course with her!",
    "Yes - only if they are serious about improving their French and willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes. Learning a foreign language is extremely important. Even if you haven't taken French in a long time and just want to get back into it, this is a great class. I strongly recommend pairing the class with the French Tables at lunch. Going just once a week is a great way to get some extra practice speaking in a lower stakes environment where you won't have to discuss literature and grammar the whole time.",
    "If you want to improve your written French, absolutely!",
    "Yes if you want to improve grammar but have to be willing to put in the work",
    "Yes if youre interested in a positive space in which to practice french.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student passionate about learning French and interested in taking the more specific advanced French classes that follow it."
