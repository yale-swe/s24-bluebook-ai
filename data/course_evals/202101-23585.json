The course also helped work on paper writing skills and critical analysis and discussion of readings.",
                "I learned a lot about how to write long-form PLSC/GLBL papers and how to easily read and process jargon-y PLSC papers that were previously incomprehensible.",
                "I learned a ton about the topic of civil-military relations, as well as some larger themes related to comparative politics and international relations. I think this course does a fantastic job of diving really deep into a relatively niche topic, which I really enjoyed given the fact that many Yale courses can be very broad in what they cover. Additionally, I learned how to write better argumentative research papers and to read political science papers at a higher level.",
                "I learned a lot about civil-military relations both in theory and in practice with case studies from all over the world. The first weeks provided a solid theoretical background on ideal civil-military relations in democracies and non-democracies, and then in the later weeks we focused on a different region each week and examined civil-military relations with a few case studies per region.",

            "comments": [
                "This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. One major strength was the breadth of the material we covered. I also appreciated the number of diverse case studies, which helped us to see CMR theories in action. I also found the structure of the writing assignments (in terms of the final paper drafts that build on one another) to be quite helpful. I did think that the number of weekly reading responses could be cut down. Also, I was very interested in other students' final papers after they had been presented. I think one additional assignment could have been to review another student's paper draft.",
                "The course was fantastically organized. Professor Lotito did a great job of making you understand exactly what to focus on as you were learning and doing the readings (through reading response questions that actually helped guide you). The syllabus and order of topics also does a really good job of bringing you into the topic of Civ-Mil Relations, helps you understand the field and background, and then has you dive into specifics for different regions. While the final assignment is long, it is broken up into component parts over the semester that are very accomplishable and was not a stressful exercise. \r\n\r\nThere are honestly very few weaknesses in the course, though perhaps it would be nice to have slightly more chances to discuss historical civil-military relations (pre-WW2) which was never really brought up in the course. Then again, that might just be a better topic for a different class (that doesn't yet exist at Yale, sadly).",
                "I think one of the main strengths of the course is Professor Lotito. He is an expert on the topic, and does a really great job of guiding discussion and supporting students. The course is also structured really well and has nice thematic organization, so it was always very clear what the readings were going to be about, and what specific topics we would be discussing in class. I appreciated that work on the term paper was spread out throughout the semester, which allowed us to get regular feedback on our progress, and also alleviated some of the work towards the end of the semester. I think one potential weakness is that the course topic is very niche, and sometimes I felt like material got redundant at times, especially in the middle of the semester before we started case studies. I think the first half of the course could potentially be shortened so that we could have more time for case studies, which I found to be some of the most interesting parts of the course.",
                "The class was really well structured and and Professor Lotito was also great -- he was very accommodating (modified readings to make it easier on us, dropping the lowest reading responses, was very flexible with extensions). I also liked how the final was structured -- although it was 15 pages, there were smaller deadlines scattered throughout the semester so by the time the final approached I already had practically half the paper written, had thought about sources, etc. which made it a lot less stressful. The only weakness I can think of is that there weren't a lot of opportunities to get feedback on how we were doing -- only the first reading response or two had comments, and so if we ever didn't get full marks after that point it was unclear why or how to improve. We did get feedback on the paper assignments which was helpful, though.",
                "Would like it if office hours could also be on a different day from class. Sometimes something would be mentioned in class and I wouldnt have a question until a day later, but I would have to wait until next Wednesday for office hours (Id rather discuss things in person than try to explain over email).\r\n\r\nThe professor did a great job facilitating discussion and was helpful when approached.",
                "I like that we worked on doing comparison tables together as a class. given the nature of the case studies, creating summary tables made sense, and also allowed me to interact with other students",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and Professor Lotito is a great teacher -- our class discussions were always very engaging. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated a bit more flexibility on the weekly reading responses. They were sometimes difficult to fit in during the weeks when other writing assignments for the course were also due."

I also liked that the seminar size was small, so that you could always talk if you wanted to and felt like you were a part of the discussion at all times. The only shame really was that we never were all able to meet and person and get to know one another.",

He also is great with email communication, which I felt was especially important for this virtual semester.",

The class was not only covered a fantastically interesting topic, it also did so in a way that ensured you learned a lot without having to do any pointless work or feel like you were drowning in readings. The weekly response memos were actually useful in learning, and were not a major pain like I worried they might be. For a student with any interest at all in the military, military history, foreign affairs, or democratic nation-building, this is a must-take class and a pleasure to take, too.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to students! Global Affairs and Political Science seminars are often very difficult to get seats in, but I think this course really was a hidden gem that I'm lucky to have stumbled upon. It covers a really fascinating and important topic that many students aren't exposed to at Yale, and I think the small class size allows great engagement with peers and with Prof. Lotito. The workload is very manageable, especially given the fact that work on the term paper is spread out across the entire semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, who is interested in this topic. It provides contrasting perspectives on what could be causing issues with democratic transitions. It provides an insight into the military, which is especially valuable to one looking into security studies.",
                "I would! For a seminar, the readings were definitely manageable (and interesting), and Professor Lotito was great and facilitated discussion really well. I really came away from the class feeling like I learned a lot, but I was never particularly overwhelmed by the workload.",
                "Honestly it depends on what theyre interested in. Social sciences may be extremely interesting to some while it may just be another subject to others. This class was pretty new to me material-wise, but I still was able to learn a lot.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this course was very interesting, and I learned a lot about the role of the military in politics, both in the US and in other countries around the world. The course was well-structured, the workload was manageable, and the material was accessible even though I knew nothing about civil-military relations coming in. Work on the research paper starts pretty early in the semester, but I appreciated that we were guided through the research process and had the chance to get feedback on our projects over the course of the semester."
