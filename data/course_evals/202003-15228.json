                "We covered a lot of time and geography in terms of art from China, Japan, Korea, and India throughout ancient history. I do wish we spent more time with more modern art rather than in ancient art, or that we looked at more pieces of art rather than focusing on only a few pieces per lecture.",
                "One strength of this course was the introduction to the diverse art traditions of Asia; however, that was also a limitation because a survey course like this didn't have the time to touch upon the art of other Asian regions like Central or Southeast Asia. With that being said, the course overall succeeded in providing a general survey to Asian art history.",
                "The topics covered in this course are very engaging. I also enjoyed lectures given by the guest speakers a lot.",

                "The strengths lie in the teaching. Professor Ngan was always so kind during office hours. I went several times over the course of the semester and he always gave me additional material to supplement my learning and kind advice on best practices for the exam. Nicole, my TF, was also very kind and always met with me for extra meetings to go over papers and the midterm. \r\n\r\nI found it very helpful that there were optional, challenging readings for us to push ourselves. I think what could be helpful in keeping track of the overall narrative could be a posted timeline and some additional survey readings for background knowledge. I would also appreciate a list of all the art works we learned about or saw through the lectures or sections. \r\n\r\nBut, I can't emphasize this enough, this course was absolutely wonderful and was a bright spot in my week! Professor Ngan's enthusiasm and care for the students really shows. He helped me brainstorm ideas for the exhibition proposal assignment, helping me think about themes about the peony motif in art!",

                "I enjoyed the combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities. The format of the course was designed well to facilitate student learning, and all of the readings were informative. Professor and TFs were all enthusiastic and engaging. Another strength of the course was the discussion style of the lectures; I appreciated getting the chance to share my thoughts and listening to my classmates' opinions!",

Since I came into the class having never taken an art history course, I always learned something new. A big motivation for me in taking this course was the addition of Korea as one of the regions of study. Since I already have a passion for Korean studies, looking at Korea through art was a special privilege. I would only add that while doing the weekly readings does not always directly pertain to the prerecorded lecture material, it provides useful context and facilitates section discussions.",

                "If you have any interest in East Asian culture or in Art History I highly recommend this course! Quincy has organized this class to a T and it makes it so easy and engaging to learn this material. I particularly like that he used the Thursday class meeting as a section rather than adding an extra hour outside of class which is incredibly kind and considerate of our time as busy students. The use of a recorded lecture to supplement our meetings is a perfect example of how tech can be accommodated for remote teaching. If you put in effort, Quincy and the TFs are prepared to help you pass the course since the focus is on learning the material rather than on strict grading.",

It is a great course for both art history majors and non-majors to take, as the class incorporates knowledge and skills from, and is applicable to, different subjects.",
