I learned various proofs and theories on finding Nash Equilibria (and the existence of Nash Equilibria), setting up auctions, forming stable matchings, solving for the price of anarchy, among other neat economic topics. It was really exciting to see how powerful these algorithms are in representing game theory and human interaction. In addition, I learned how to formulate my own algorithms and solve these problems quantitatively and critically. This class had a lot of applications, and it was clear to me that implementing algorithms into game theory and economic principles is a new and exciting field.",

The second unit deals with no-regret learning (and uses the existence of such learning algorithms to provide an alternative proof of the Minmax Theorem). The third unit proves Nash's Theorem and discusses the computational complexity of computing Nash Equilibria. The fourth unit deals with social choice theory and (welfare-optimal and revenue-optimal) mechanism design.

                "Professor Cai is a great lecture who gives clear proofs and is engaging. The material itself is also complex but really interesting and beautiful. The class had really tough problem sets, which often hurt my head and forced me to think critically and dive deeper into the material. However, the toughness and rarity of the problem sets (only 3 problem sets) made the nights before the problem sets due extremely stressful. This class could have benefited from shorter assignments during the weeks where there wasn't a problem set assigned, ensuring that we understood the material and introducing the mechanisms necessary for the tough problem sets.",
                "The topic list felt somewhat incohesive. In particular, some topics we discussed were barely algorithmic (e.g. voting problems), and others, like auction theory, have very substantial overlap with normal economics. A more specific topics list would have been very helpful in deciding whether to take the course.",
                "Strengths: This is basically where Professor Cai's research is, so he knows exactly what he is doing and lectures very clearly. He's good at conveying intuition behind results, which at least in my opinion is often more valuable than knowing the proof. I also just found the topics to be extremely interesting, especially mechanism design; there's lots of practical application here so you feel like the theory you're learning is doing something useful. There are only three problem sets, and even though they are challenging, I was never bored trying to figure out a problem.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only possible weakness I could think of is that we sometimes covered some topics at a pretty shallow level, and I felt like I would have preferred not covering something and instead delving deeper into some areas that we spend more time on.",

                "Yes. If you want to learn about auctions and mechanism design, definitely take this class. ECON 351 does not cover this stuff at all essentially. \r\nThe algorithms prerequisite is not important per se, but primarily there for mathematical maturity purposes in my opinion. A strong comfort level with probability theory is quite important however, it's at the heart of many of the arguments being made.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are interested at the intersection of computing and economics. This class was a quantitative challenge, but one that bridged the gap between the two subjects succinctly. The material spurs a lot of research questions that can hopefully be solved in the near future. At the end of the day, Economics and Computation gave me a better appreciation for the power of computing in other quantitative fields. This class is well suited for computer science and economics majors.",
                "Yes, if you are at all interested in economics or computer science. Although, there's not as much algorithm designing here (we cover some like Gale-Shipley, Top trading cycle, etc.) but that's kind of expected. Most of the classes are proofs, so you should be comfortable with them. In terms of math background, it says MATH 241 is a prerequisite but it's mostly just expected value calculations and you never need anything terribly fancy, even on the homework. In general, I would recommend this course to anyone who's used to proofs. There's really nothing else quite like it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to a student who is interested in theoretical computer science\/economics. For students in economics, the course provides alternative approaches to some classical results, as well as some surprising results that seem difficult to prove without tools used in theoretical computer science, such as LP duality. For students in computer science, the course provides many interesting applications of the concepts taught in CPSC 365\/366. Moreover, the theory developed in this course is both useful in practical settings, e.g., online ad auctions, as well as in theoretical\/academic settings.",
