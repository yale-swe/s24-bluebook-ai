I'm often disappointed at undergraduate seminars' lack of depth, but the student led discussions and Marcia's interventions make discussion flow well and with substance which made for deep discussions. The assignment structure was also very good to keep us engaged and not have work pile up. \r\n \r\nWeakness: None if you do the readings.",
