                "Exciting material, but the readings are long and not super manageable for some weeks.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- super chill, the assessments are very straightforward and easygoing \r\n- very enthusiastic professor and TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the lectures went a bit off track of the main point to the point that I would have maybe liked a bit more structure to them, but overall, it was still enjoyable/interesting/I learned a lot",
                "Make sure to pay attention during lecture, because it's difficult to follow the slides on their own without Professor Manning's commentary.",
                "The lectures are... disorganized. And Prof Manning is a great guy but he's just a little all over the place, which couldn't really be helped (nor do I think he really cares). The concept of the course itself is pretty interesting, but I wish we can have a clearer timeline/map or anything spatial to help us understand the events and their spaces?",

                "The course covered interesting material and the professor was excited about it. However, Professor Manning was only interested in parts of the material meant to be included in the scope of the class. I would have preferred a more even handed look at history. For example, Professor Manning on the day dedicated to discussion women in the Hellenistic world, mentioned how to most important woman was likely Arsinoe II and then spent the rest of the class talking about Cleopatra. While it was certainly interesting, it was also frustrating knowing that there was this whole other topic, more critical to the broad path of history, that we didnt discuss. There are many more examples like this. Overall, I think the course had good spirit, but was hurt by the lack of organization or a cohesive plan for the semester.",

I honestly learned more from reviewing for the exams than from what I remember from the lectures - because they're so disorganized and I barely remember anything after a while.",
