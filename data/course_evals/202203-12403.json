I then learned a great deal of new physics to me, such as special relativity, oscillations, waves, hydrodynamics/static, and thermodynamics. Outisde of the physics, I learned how to hold myself responsible for learning content I couldn't keep up with in lecture by doing my own reading and notes outside of class.",

I also learned content far beyond the scope of other physics classes I had previously taken, as well as the mathematical origins of some of the facts of physics that we have often taken for granted.",

Beyond that, Professor Tipton promised he would train our bullshit detectors, and I thought he did a good job at teaching us to make sure our answers make sense -- to check and make sure they had the right units, to use limiting cases to make sure the answers made sense where you could eyeball them, to make sure they were the right orders of magnitude, etc.",

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of the course was the TA's who helped us in office hours, they put a lot of effort into their explanations and the results were great. The biggest weakness was the instructor, who explained formula derivations in very confusing ways, often seem surprised by his slides, and more. He mostly failed to give us good physical intuition for the various methods we learned. At times he gave up on explaining key concepts because he admitted he simply was unable to do so. And he structured lectures in such a way that it was difficult to know what key aspects of his lecture were actually critical for notetaking and problem-solving.",
                "The strengths of this course are the office hours and the TAs/TFs. They are so helpful and supportive, and it's a great way to meet people from lecture whom I don't normally interact with. I think a weakness of this course is preparation for the exam. Professor Tipton always gave us past exams in order to prepare, which was fantastic, but I would've loved some more guidance for what to do besides those practice exams. Perhaps, though, that was something I needed to learn for myself.",
                "Strengths: The material is really interesting, and I like that you can get 100s on the PSETs as long as you work on them at office hours. It made me a lot less stressed out about my grade. There is also a lot of support from the TAs. Tipton is very approachable and has a good attitude.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt feel like Tipton did a great job explaining some of the more difficult to understand concepts later in the semester (I.e. relativity) and had to supplement with other resources.",
                "Strengths:\r\nOffice hours are great. I learned so much during various office hours throughout the week and the TAs are great and provide a deep level of understanding to the material. There were also many students working in office hours so it was easy to collaborate and gain a better understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAt points in the course, I felt like some of the lecture slides were overwhelming and it was hard for me to follow 4-momentum concepts.",
                "The pace and clarity of the teaching was not optimal - the class moved too quickly without sufficient time dedicated to each concept, while the instructor did not always convey the physical ideas in the most accessible way. However, the class time dedicated to seeing the application of principles to problems was very helpful, and I hope that more of this is included in future courses.",
                "Strengths: the professor was funny and personable. Also, there were a ton of office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: The slides were mostly text, which was not especially useful for understanding. the professor was not good at explaining things, especially when trying to walk us through derivations of important equations from first principles or from simpler equations. The class did not have a productive question-asking culture - while I am generally extremely pro-question-asking and almost always think that more questions should asked, even in big lecture classes, this class made me realize that it is actually possible to have a class culture where too many unproductive questions are asked. Many questions were clearly only barely tangential to what we were learning and were often instead half-joking or otherwise unproductive, which slowed the pace of the class down a surprisingly substantial amount. The professor started to realize late in the semester that this was a problem and so took adequate measures to cut down on interruptions, but even then, we finished a whole lecture behind, which made me feel like I was missing out on some knowledge that I would have preferred to have been taught. Overall, I walked away from this class feeling like I did not have a substantially better grasp of physics than when I entered the class, even though I got good grades on the tests and homework.",
                "+\r\nVERY thorough peer tuotoring and PSet process. Really helps with the understanding of the difficult material. \r\n-\r\nNo weaknesses per se, but it's a challenging course even if you have dabbled in physics before.",
                "The teaching style is very responsive to students, in that it will slow down if students aren't understanding or will speed up if they are.",
                "The lectures were interactive, with a majority of the time devoted to instruction but a good amount of breaks to check understanding. I am incredibly grateful for the peer tutors and TAs in office hours because, while the lectures are clear and understandable, the problems themselves are much harder - as expected, but it was still very helpful to have aid outside of the classroom. One weakness of the course was perhaps the speed at which some of the practice problems in class were explained; oftentimes more energy would be spent towards the instruction leading up to the question and then the application seemed rushed. However, this was only the case for some lectures and overall I appreciated the fact that we did some questions in class.",
                "I like how PHYS 200 covers a lot of modern physics, which is really interesting for me. TA office hours has also been incredibly helpful. I like how this class is structured to help you learn, instead of just throwing a test at you. It would be nice if classes are not taught with slides, however. Because it's so easy to switch slides, sometimes we go so fast and I would just be completely lost.",
                "I think that we went over mechanics and relativity in a lot of detail and I understood them very well, but we went through the other topic really fast and it was difficult to get a good understanding of all of the concepts we covered.",
                "The knowledge of the instructor and teaching staff was the primary strength of this course. Almost every office hours with any member of the teaching staff would be informative and helpful in completing the problem sets. The professor and TFs were all extremely knowledgeable and would be able to help guide students with the correct manner of thinking about problems. I also appreciated the plentifulness of office hours; there would almost always be an office hours session that any student could make it to, and a lot of the TFs and peer tutors would stay to help students beyond their designated office hours time. \r\n\r\nI think that one weakness of the course was the pacing at points. While we would spend a long time on certain topics, many (especially near the end of the course) would be rushed through to the detriment of student learning. As a result, we would have to rely on learning from office hours or just by doing the problem sets. This would ultimately result in worse preparation for the exams (which always seemed harder than the practice exams made available beforehand), and I often felt like I was unable to demonstrate my full knowledge / competence in the short(er) timeframe given to take the exams. That being said, I also wish that there was a little more guidance for studying for exams (i.e., more recommended / representative practice problems from either of the 2 textbooks for the course).",
                "I love this class. I think it went pretty well, and I dont have much feedback for it.",
                "The class, at first, was very good. The TAs and ULFs were incredibly helpful and Professor Tipton's office hours were life-saving. It was strongly organized and with an emphasis on student feedback. My only criticism would be with the lecture slides. Most of the time they consist of derivations, paragraphs that take too much to read and impossible amounts of time to skim with the assumption that we \"know it on the spot,\" and too many things appear to be bolded even if they seem important -- thus taking away the meaning of \"bolding\" and making us unsure of if something was tangential or foundational. As well, for some of the video lectures, he would say he would post the quite-succinct and informative notes but then never show them again, making it so the slides had the implicit assumption you, again, \"knew it immediately.\" My best learning came when Professor Tipton showed us using props and demonstrations (my favorite one was of the gyroscope and of the standing wave) or when he simultaneously explained both the \"why\" and the \"how\" -- I especially appreciated his discussion of the train-tunnel paradox and the twin paradox in that regard.",
                "The course was well organized and it was exciting to cover topics like special relativity that aren't usually covered in introductory physics courses. Lecture slides were supplied about a day or two in advance before the lecture. However, I feel that more practice problems in preparations for tests could be supplied.",
                "I think I would have learned better if less time was spent on mathematical derivations in the lectures and more time was spent explaining the physical phenomena in question.",
                "The course has a great support system through office hours and discusses many interesting physics topics. However, the way some derivations are sped through and the lack of emphasis on how some concepts work and the importance of some equations make following the class often difficult.",
                "Strengths: good support system (professor, TFs, and peer tutors are all very welcoming and helpful), meet lots of cool physics friends from doing psets and going to office hours/peer tutoring, special relativity is mind blowing!\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can be boring and not super useful (manyyy slides that are flipped through quickly)",
                "The course content seemed very rushed, especially towards the end of the semester. Paul Tipton is a great person and professor, but really obviously gave up on teaching at a point. Physics is supposed to be somewhat intuitive, but it was hard to tell what you knew when all you seemed to get were new equations shoved in your face and no explanation as to what those equations actually meant or could be used for.",
                "I honestly think this course has many strengths  the lectures are strong and easily understood, and the PSETS readily pertain to the material. Exams felt quite fair. I honestly cannot think of any substantial weaknesses of this course that I would like to be improved.",
                "I think a weakness was that the slides format made it a little hard to stay engaged as it moved pretty fast.",
                "Weakness: if a blackboard is not used, then that is a major red flag, especially for physics. \r\nStrength: psets were challenging, but in a good way. They tested ones understanding of the material very well. Additionally, there was an abundance of resources to use (TF, TA, ULA, tutor, YaleOCW Phys 200, etc)",
                "Strengths: very engaging professor (very smart and funny), problems are very interestiing, very fair tests and final, TAs are AWESOME\r\nweaknesses: maybe could do more working out the problems on the board but otherwise no real criticisms",
                "Strengths are that the class is low-stress and fun. Professor Tipton loves teaching this material and wants us to love the material as well, even if most people are taking this class because it's a requirement for something. He does an entire lecture on general relativity that has zero math, isn't on any psets or tests, and yet was one of my favorite lectures because it's fascinating and you won't get that lecture anywhere else. Weaknesses are that Professor Tipton was a little inefficient in his lectures. When I had seen the material before (which I had for the first two thirds of the semester), I didn't mind it, but when we came to new topics in the end of the semester I found there were some lectures where Tipton presented the material way too quickly, spent a while answering questions that should have been asked in office hours, and then let us go ten minutes early. I would have appreciated using that time to slow down on the parts I didn't understand and present the material a little bit more cleanly.",
                "Strengths: So much office hours (much needed thank you). I really liked how the office hours were bunched up. They made for good problem solving session. Professor is so funny and makes a great classroom ambiance. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Why did we learn about dampened occilaters if we did not use them for problem solving.  Things of that nature.",
                "This course was alright. I think there aren't too many stand-out strengths. It was a larger lecture hall class and we just sat taking notes. Asking questions is difficult because of the sheer amount of people."

                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, especially students interested in or planning to major in physics. This course is a great, in depth review of concepts learned in high school, and then a fantastic, challenging, dive into new content.",
                "I would highly recommend this class, especially taught by Dr. Tipton. He is an engaging and informative lecturer. Students choosing between this course and PHYS 260 should probably take this, even if they feel extremely well-prepared in physics and mathematics. PHYS 200 is taught better and gives less work. A student taking this class should always go to the lecture, since, even though the slides are posted to Canvas, there is no real substitute for hearing Dr. Tipton explain the material. Even a student who would be bored in this class, or find it particularly easy because it is mostly material they already know, should make a point of always attending lecture, both for the joy of physics and the helpfulness of the worked problems he reviews during lecture. Besides, even the seasoned student of both classical mechanics and relativity might find that the one day they skip class is the day Dr. Tipton teaches something they have never encountered before.",
                "If you are interested in the material, can use it for your major, and are not too worried if you dont perform as well as you expect, then yes. I took physics C in high school and got 5s on both AP tests, so I thought I would be prepared for this class. However I struggled a bit on mechanics during the semester, and then relativity hit and I was even more behind. I think if you are very strong in math/physics then you should be fine, but I would also shop 180. I did not expect the material to be too bad at the beginning of the semester, but it became a lot more difficult.",
                "Yes, people in this class enjoy learning about physics and it is fun to improve and understand concepts like special relativity and thermodynamics",
                "Yes, as an intro class, the course should provide you with the foundations to tackle more challenging ideas later on.",

                "Not particularly, just because it wasn't taught very well.",
                "This course was potentially the most rewarding course I took this semester. It tackles difficult concepts but it also offers a great support network of PSets and office hours to help you through. If you are at all interested in physics (and have a basic understanding of math), this course is a great introduction.",
                "Yes I would! This class will challenge you with new topics such as special relativity, but also treats such topics with an understanding of their difficulty.",
                "Yes. Although the course involved a significant amount of work, the intellectual challenge was immensely satisfying after toiling away on psets. I think it provided a great foundation for future physics courses.",
                "Yes. Really interesting contents and nice intro to physics for non-physics STEM major.",
                "If a student has to take a course in physics, I would definitely recommend this one (of the 4 options). Learning about the extra topic of relativity was a borderline enlightening experience, and I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying physics or just interested in thinking in a different way to take this course. Maybe it would be worth taking this course Credit/D/Fail to reduce stress if this course is not necessary for a given students major.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, it was awesome!",
                "Yes, I would. The class is a great introduction to classical mechanics (provided you know some of the basics already) and provided a solid foundation for explorations of other more modern topics in physics. Indeed, it was difficult to absorb the litany of material thrown at the end (hydrodynamics in two lectures and thermodynamics in another two), but ultimately the course was overall manageable.",
                "I would recommend this course to students intending/considering majoring in physics. This class was really challenging, even for someone who has taken calculus based physics before, so I would not recommend taking it to get an easy science credit. If you have extensive experience with physics olympiads, however, 260 might be the better choice. For this class, prepare to go to a lot of office hours and ask a lot of questions, but overall it is worth it if you enjoy physics and are considering majoring in it.",

                "If you have an interest in learning introductory physics that goes beyond the standard Newtonian mechanics into modern physics I would highly recommend this class.",
                "Yes, it seemed to be the best intro physics sequence from talking with peers.",
                "Yes, if you are a physics major (or just interested in physics in general) and have previously taken a rigorous physics course in high school (e.g. AP Phys I, AP Phys C) this is probably the course for you. Unless you are very, very well-versed in physics (like USAPHO level), stick with 200 and drop to 180 if needed. There is no need to put yourself through the hell that is 260 (trust me, I tried it ...)",
                "It's an important course for physics, but wouldn't recommend to a non engineering/physics-related major.",
                "I absolutely would. You do have to be pretty interested in physics, otherwise the PSETS might become really frustrating (at least for the longer ones). But if you are interested in physics, would absolutely recommend. In particular, I think this course is much better than PHYS 260, which I was in up until the first midterm. If you're trying to decide between the two, unless you're incredibly strong in math and have an intense physics background, I'd pick 200 any day.",
                "If you took AP Physics: Electricity and Magnetism and Multivariable Calculus, and did well in those two classes, then you should probably take Phys 260. If you are a little weak in physics but have a good grasp of calculus 2 or Multivariable Calculus, then you should probably take Phys 200. Conversely, if you have a good grasp of physics but not so much with math, then you should take Phys 200. Otherwise, take Phys 180.",
                "Probably the best physics intro sequence to take if you are interested in the subject, have had previous physics coursework, and have not taken calc 3 yet",
                "VERY highly recommend. very good foundation in important topics in mechanics and relativity and is just relevant to knowing how the world works. plus the professor is very engaging.",
                "I took this class for a QR because I like physics, was relatively good at it in high school, wanted an intellectual challenge, and didn't want to waste an entire semester stressing about 260. I got all of those things. This class wasn't the easiest class I took this semester, but it was the class that stressed me the least. The TFs have the answers at office hours, so every week I would go to office hours and hang out with people for a couple hours and check my psets, which were some of the highlights of my semester. If you're considering taking this class, I would do it -- it's a lot of fun and reminded me how much I enjoyed physics.",
                "Yes! Great intro course.",
                "I wouldn't. I enjoy physics a lot so I had a good time, but I can see how the material can be confusing, the lectures a bog and boring, and the problem sets confusing (because of the wording of the problems.)"
