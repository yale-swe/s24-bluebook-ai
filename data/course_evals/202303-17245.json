                "The class is about 50% math, 30% biology, and 20% coding/computer science. The PSETs skew CS (mostly they're done in Python), while the lectures are mostly math and biology. Topics include: multivariable calculus applied to gradient ascent/descent, neuron basics (synapses, action potentials, excitatory/inhibitory), Fourier transform applied to linear systems (impulse response), linear algebra applied to principal component analysis (principal components are eigenvectors of a covariance matrix), the visual system (mostly V1), edge detection, deep neural networks (perceptron, CNNs, are DNNs good representations of biology?), stereo (using two images of the same scene).\r\n\r\nThe topics are in general quite scattered, although they all apply to vision in fairly fundamental ways. The math is more about intuition than understanding - this isn't a good class to learn about eigenvectors, or learn how to do a fourier transform. However, this is a good class to understand (once you already know about gradients, eigens, fourier transforms, etc.) what these things are actually up to. I took this course at the same time as quantum mechanics, and while I learned the formula for a fourier transform in quantum, I got more intuition for the operation here (we talked about Nyquist's theorem, e.g, and I now have an intuitive understanding of how things go wrong when you don't sample frequently enough).\r\n\r\nOverall, I developed a bit of intuition for some math, an idea of how organisms start processing light, and a sense of how insanely cool and complicated the brain is.",

                "The lectures, though not-well attended, were very engaging. Steve is obviously very knowledgeable about each topic he was talking about, and chose those topics with precision. The homework was very well-guided, and that helped understanding of course material/implementation of each topic we discussed (all of them in MATLAB or Python, it would be good to have some previous knowledge, but not necessary). The TA's were very helpful, with office hours 2-3 times per week and very helpful with problem set questions.\r\nOne weakness was how little information was given about the exams (one midterm, one final) before we took them. Though the TA held review sessions on some material, he hadn't seen the final nor really knew what Steve felt was important enough to know.",
                "The class is poorly taught, and the lectures were not very helpful. The professor would go on several tangents and dive deep into very complex topics without giving much background or necessary information. Lectures weren't recorded, and the notes and slides he posted were very scattered and complex. It was hard to tell what we needed to know for the exams, and there was a lot of self-studying for the class.",
                "Strengths- we cover a lot of material and focus on the most interesting/exciting parts of each one, rather than getting too bogged down in details. The problem sets are also extremely well done, they cover the course material and have helped me to understand the topics significantly better.\r\nWeaknesses- the course might cover a bit too much, if this course could be split into three parts rather than 2 it might be better.",
                "The content is cool, and the assignments are pretty good, but there is minimal feedback from the midterm and minimal knowledge of what the midterm/final cover in terms of content, length, and format.",
                "Strengths: the material is fascinating, and Professor Zucker really knows his stuff - he's been in the field for a long time, and has an understanding of the fundamentals, which is very valuable in a field often focused on highly-specialized optimization. The course covers math with the goal of developing intuition, rather than teaching students how to perform computations (more on this later), which means students who already know the math still have something to learn. I didn't really learn to do anything new, but I think the class has made me a better physicist, and certainly left me excited to learn more about vision and the brain.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course just doesn't spend enough time on math to teach students new mathematical techniques. This is overall a strength of the class, I think, but it means that when Professor Zucker does try to teach math, it doesn't go very well. Even in the best of circumstances, it's difficult to learn math from slides, and Professor Zucker isn't great at explaining step-by-step proofs/derivations of formulas. In preparing for the final, I had more luck learning PCA from the internet than from the lecture/notes. However, the lecture and notes gave a much better intuition for what PCA is/why it's useful than I found on the internet.\r\n\r\nThe last PSET was assigned too late, and was due during reading week, the day before I had my first final. It was also quite long, and significantly bit into my studying. I'm not sure what should be done about this - the PSET was certainly valuable, and I wouldn't want it to just disappear, but also this was really poor timing. Also midterms were never handed back, so I never found out where/why I lost points, which would have been nice to know.",
                "The material offered by the course is very interesting, and there is a great deal of it. Professor Zucker gives great lectures and makes them quite enjoyable with his sense of humor. The workload is always fairly manageable, and there are extensive resources to ensure that you perform well on these assignments. Both exams are quite fair in terms of the content covered and the difficulty, and you are able to perform well if you study well. This class is one of the most interesting ones I have taken at Yale. The class is very carefully planned out, and you gain a much greater understanding of how the lessons fit together when you study for both exams. There are no weaknesses or areas to improve on.",
                "The strengths of this course are the lectures and notes. Improvements to this course could be done by finding better ways to engage with the material outside of lecture.",
                "The lectures or at least the notes were super long/confusing and only a few big ideas were actually needed to do psets/exams, so I ended up not going to any lectures cramming a bit of the main ideas or just watching the review vids for test and that happened to be enough to do fine in the class. overall i put in very low effort and feel like I didn't really learn much because of it. I feel like more structure would have helped me learn more or if it was clearer what info is important and what isn't, because it feels impossible to make sense of the super long noes"

                "Sure! There's a lot of content, but you're really only responsible for knowing quite little. His lectures get into the math, history, and computer science behind each topic, but he really sums it up quite well, and is always open for questions. I think you can learn a lot from taking this course, and also won't be overwhelmed with homework: we had 5 problem sets, so one every two weeks, each taking around 4-7 hours on average (for me; a lot of people I know completed them faster).",
                "Not really, unless you have some background knowledge or familiarity with concepts in computer vision and biological systems for vision. The unorganized state of the lectures and notes left me stressed throughout the semester.",
                "Not really. It is hard to delineate what is important and not. Exams are probably not the fairest way to test understanding given that the lecture notes are incredibly unhelpful and disorganized.",
                "This is one of the worst organized courses I've taken. The entire course is run by the TF while the professor just lectures and doesn't care about the students. He is also insistent on not recording his lectures. This isn't necessarily a problem depending on the style of the class, but the exams are a significant percentage of your grade and often require you to remember small details from the lectures. This means you have to study everything from a bunch of \"notes\" that are often 50-100 pages per lecture, and basically guess what will be on the exam if you don't want to be overwhelmed.",
                "Yes!! I already have to at least 5 friends. I originally took this class as a CS student looking for a science credit, but I ended up finding one of my favorite courses at Yale!",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in computer or biological vision or just want to learn more about that kind of thing. I would really recommend this course if you're into math, because the content is certainly math heavy, but you don't need to actually understand the math to do the assignments or exams.",
                "Absolutely! The material is fascinating, and after taking it I'm interested enough in the material to want to spend my summer doing learning-related research. I think this class is especially good for students majoring in math/physics who are curious about vision and the brain. The course actively helped me with intuition for quantum physics and complex analysis, which I was taking at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis class is special in that Professor Zucker has been in his field forever, and can teach you \"why\" where other courses might only teach \"how\".\r\n\r\nThe course will go better if you have already seen multivariable calculus, linear systems, linear algebra, and fourier transforms. I would be quite hesitant to take the class without multi and linear, because gradients and basis vectors are really fundamental to the course, while the sections on linear systems and fourier transforms are just more understandable if you already have some familiarity.\r\n\r\nI imagine the PSETs would be much more time-consuming without some coding experience (Python or Matlab). The last few especially I think might have taken me twice as long if I didn't already have experience with numpy array operations/slicing.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material itself is some of the most interesting I have seen in any course at Yale. Although much of it is quite complex, Professor Zucker does a great job at making it accessible to everyone in the class. The workload is never burdensome, and it is very possible to perform excellently in the class with proper dedication to the assignments and exams. Garrett's office hours and the written notes are great resources in this class. Lecture was also very fun and lighthearted due to Professor Zucker's sense of humor. This course is easily one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. I found this course to be extremely insightful and intellectually stimulating. I would recommend this to any student who has broad or interdisciplinary interests.",
                "science credit, not too harsh grading, but also might lose interest in the material",
