                "A much better understanding of finance and debt, and the private equity industry in general. I learned a lot about how much of the financial industry is driven by incentives (how much is driven by seemingly tiny fees) and how holders of capital can sometimes make outsized gains while distributing the risk to other parties besides themselves. It also made me aware of how many industry norms are due to habit (that's the way it's always been done, so we're going to keep doing it that way) because people's preferences begin to change according to the market. In many ways, it has made me question the efficiency of capitalism. It also has made me question the amount of value that investors actually provide. Maybe they can work to discover investment opportunities, but they are reliant on material reality to actually create things.",
                "This course gives an incredible foundation to evaluating late stage investments, particularly leveraged buyouts.",
                "This course teaches you how to critically analyze private investment opportunities, understand debt and equity financing, LBOs, valuation, etc. The course teaches you structured frameworks that can be used to facilitate this analysis. It is an invaluable course for anybody with an interest in finance.",

The course does a phenomenal job teaching you about all aspects of private equity investing from the bottom up.  It starts by talking about risk and return, and moves into more detail exploring the structure of debt and equity investments, as well as introduce investment frameworks.  This is the best course I've ever taken at Yale, and by the end you will feel like you know so much more about finance and investing - you feel like a professional."

            "comments": [
                "The course is highly practical and extremely well taught, more econ classes should appeal to practical applications like this for interested students.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough time to cover early stage investing and I believe a second course would be very helpful.",
                "Strengths: The seminar setting is very suitable for this class because Schmertzler is very interactive with students and has rich stories to tell that are relevant to the textbook. I think the examples gave a lot of weight to the seemingly less significant parts of private equity law, because there were many times where those parts made/broke a business. I think the format of the class also helped me understand things much more clearly. \r\nWeaknesses: the textbook is a little unpolished, in some places the images are too small/low quality to read properly. Many of the images are also meant to be read in color, which makes it difficult to distinguish important features of some charts/graphs. Difficulty of the material aside, Schmertzler tries to keep a conversational tone in most of it, but that clashes hard with the legal chapters that are very meticulous. That is probably unavoidable. Though, I think it would be a stronger read if he used vocab that was more to the point. I think this class is interesting and good for non-finance people to take, but it draws a lot of people with bank/hedge fund experience. Personally, I did not have that and it made following along hard at times. I also wish the schedule was a little more clearly defined weeks in advance, because it made it very hard to schedule my work for other classes. Sometimes there was no problem set, and sometimes there was a huge one that required a lot of time, but we usually only knew a week in advance.",
                "The course is very thorough and technical. Very practical and useful. Sometimes the work can be very in the weeds but that is intrinsic to the business.",
                "This is an excellent course through and through. It is very fast paced and you have to really engage every second to follow along (I thought this was a strength of the course, it really forced me to engage with the material). This course really has very few weaknesses. Understand that you should know how to model before joining the class, unless you're willing to put yourself through a crash course during the semester. I only wish Professor Schmertzler taught another class to cover even more material!",
                "weakness: Grade obscurity\r\nstrength: everything else",
                "Incredible course  Professor Schmertzlers style may not be for everyone, but he is second to none if you are interested in this topic",
                "strengths: i really enjoyed the investment decision/ board room simulations because it allowed us to apply the skills in investment analysis, financial modeling, and people skills that we were learning. prof schmertzler is a great lecturer and is very engaging and has many interesting stories. \r\nweakness: if you were new to modeling, there was no help or lessons with that, so I would not recommend this class unless you've had a finance internship before. He assumed we knew a lot already. we also received practically no feedback throughout the semester, except for our midterm exam. it would have been nice to know our standing in the course.",
                "The case format of the course is really fun and makes you really engaged in the material.  The material is also very realistic and practical - you learn about topics that will certainly be necessary to be an investment professional.  Everything about this course is incredible, the only weakness is that some classes are a little less structured and are more composed of asking questions rather than a discussion.  The course definitely acts more like a lecture than a seminar at times as well.  However, the classes that are more seminar-like are super engaging."

                "Absolutely, this was far and away the best course I ever took at Yale.  It intellectually challenged me and forced me to learn a huge breadth of knowledge regarding not only finance but business in General.  I think I learned more in this course than I did over the course of two years of academic instruction at Yale.",
                "Schmertzler is very interactive with students and has rich stories to tell that are relevant to the textbook, and every class felt engaging. It was great to hear the inner workings of the private equity in a very real way. You also learn a lot about the finance industry in general (including early stage funding), finance law, and debt in a very intuitive way.

                "Absolutely. If youre interested in private equity this is a must take course. Has helped me understand the space and how to evaluate investments tremendously.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course. It is actually the best course I've ever taken at Yale. The class is extremely engaging, the case work is super fun and interesting, and you learn a lot of valuable techniques to improve your analysis of investments. There are very few classes like this one, that teach such valuable skills and are also so well thought out. If you have the chance to take this class, take it. It is a lot of work, and you must engage with the material to get a lot out of it, but it is well worth it. Professor Schmertzler is an amazing professor as well!",
                "Yes 100%! I would recommend this course to someone interested in working in private equity.",
                "Would take if interested in a career in investing, across any asset class",
                "Yes, definitely. If you are interested in finance and in entering PE one day then this is a great primer. You actually learn to understand the concepts, rather than just memorize them as so many PE crash courses do. However, warning, almost everyone in the class has extensive finance experience ahead of time. You should feel comfortable modeling and with excel before taking this class.",
                "This is the best course I've taken at Yale and I would 100% recommend it to another student.  Every Yale student should graduate with one course they can easily point to as the pinnacle of their learning at college - this is that course.  The material is incredibly engaging and applicable, and taking this class makes you actually feel like an investment professional even as a student.  The knowledge you gain from this course will put you head and shoulders above your finance classmates, and the other students taking the class are all really bright and fun to work with.  Professor Schmertzler is fantastic - he's funny and treats you like a real professional.  At the same time, he really cares about you as a student and is always happy to jump on a call or meet to provide some career advice.  He has amazing industry stories and teaches you how to think about investing in a way you never would have before."
