    "Strength was David, he was truly excellent. I rated the course excellent not because of the material, but because of him, and because I want this section to have a high rating so everyone knows to try to get him. He was fun and engaging, and everyone was participating--so much more participation that I'd ever seen in a language class. This is partially because David never made us feel embarrassed if we got something wrong, so we all felt very comfortable learning. A lot of the other French teachers are older women who are very intimidating, which I find counterproductive (nothing against them, but I think when people get nervous to speak in class because they don't want it pointed out that they're wrong, then they don't improve as much). So please take it with David!\r\n\r\nWeakness was the curriculum. I wish we had a better textbook to explain things instead of the course pack, which is often taught by example, and doesn't clarify a lot of the rules. And too much reading. I didn't do most of the reading, just read the English summaries. I'm still going to do fine in the course, but I wish they had made us read less so that I could actually have time to read all of the material and really engage with it. The amount of work you have to do is counterproductive... if it were lower, then everyone would be more willing to do it, so we'd actually get more out of it, instead of just skipping a lot of it. In Spanish, they use a proper textbook. I think it's time for an overhaul of the course curriculum, but I'm not holding my breath.",
    "Yale's French classes are outdated, and seem to revel in making students memorize texts and grammar rather than prepare students for actual communication. David gave his all, but he was heavily constricted by both time constraints (having 50 minute classes is too little time) and the constraints of the curriculum. Overall, there was little incentive to learn and communicate in French,  and every incentive to ignore to simply memorize for the tests.",
    "Everything was strong",
    "I think the course is very well structured to provide students with exposure to all different aspects of the French language. I do wish there had been more fluid discussions in class - but these can be very difficult to facilitate.",
    "The course has many weaknesses in its testing system. They tests are proctored in a computer room and the questions are guided with a beeping timer, which is anxiety-inducing enough, but, additionally, certain portions grade a student's ability to memorize minute details from books and stories read in the course rather than ability to speak or comprehend the language. For a language course, very little of the grade comes from one's ability to speak, read or write in the language, while large portions come from how well a student can perform in high-pressure exams.",
    "Having the class every day is both very helpful and very burdensome. It is the best way to improve in french, but also very hard to keep up with. There is also a large amount of work that comes with the class and must be completed every day, which makes scheduling and planning very hard.",
    "This course is very engaging, and almost high-school like with daily assignments and readings. But I find that to be the best way to learn!"

    "I would recommend this section for the reasons I addressed in the strengths and weaknesses question. David is awesome, and I think everyone felt comfortable learning and participating in his section. I'd never seen this much participation in a language section before, and neither had Ruth Koizim. I'm assuming that you're reading this because you're trying to decide between sections of F140, as opposed to deciding whether to take it at all. But if your question is the latter one, I don't know if I would recommend it. You do improve, but I think the improvement could be less painful and more enjoyable if the curriculum were revamped. Like, nobody watched all of those films. Nobody has time for that.",
    "No. Compared to other language courses at Yale, the methodology for the French courses is abysmal. This doesn't seem to be the fault of the instructors, who are always good. They seem to be just as annoyed by the syllabus, and its focus on testing and memorization, as the students were.",
    "No",
    "Yes, I definitely would. It greatly improved my french. H",
    "If you are willing to put in the time and effort, then this class is very worth it. It will take a lot of your time and meets every day, but if it is what you want to take, then it won't seem like a chore.",
    "It requires a lot of effort, but it pays off in the knowledge and abilities you will glean. Know that is very very hard to get an A, if that is your concern."
