A lot of the course was very redundant and circular with extensive time each lecture dedicated to small group discussions which quickly devolved into nothing more than talking about non class related things. I think lectures should actually be lectures. Might have been better as a seminar.",

Maybe my frustration is with the field of sociology and not with this specific course, but I felt like we never really reached conclusions about the questions that we posed.",

There is a lot more of a connection than you initially realize. Throughout the course you learn how to conduct a sociological analysis and make new connections between sports and our society.",
                "The class allowed me to explore the different ways in sport reflects and changes the society in which it exists. On top of this, the wide range of sports discussed in this class exposed me to new sports which I knew little or nothing about prior to taking this course. As for tangible skills, the peer writing assignments helped improve my collaboration skills as I had to cooperate with my writing partner to ensure that our assignments were completed in a timely manner.",
                "Really interesting insight into sports as a sociological institution and how we interact with the world of sports. Discussed placemaking, consumerism, sports as a place of social change, and whether or not sports were inherently good. Forced me to reconsider a lot of inherent biases I had coming into the course and to consider why sports historically haven't been taken that seriously as a field of academic research.",
                "I learned a great deal about sports, not on the surface level but more in depth on how ingrained and critical it is to societies foundation. It was a class where it broadened my perspective on athletes, the way I view sports as an athlete, and high elite level sports."

I think the grading was a little harsh honestly and not always clear with feedback which was a little frustrating given the rest of the class experience was very laid back.",
                "Should be a seminar or completely restructured.",
                "The course is very repetitive, the grading is harsh and not at all helpful in improving your knowledge or abilities, the assignments are unnecessary, and the TA wasn't great.",
                "Just so much fun! Interactive! Organized!",
                "Strengths - interesting readings, engaged discussions\r\nWeaknesses - unclear feedback on writings, no engagement with TF",
                "It was a very good survey course that covered many aspects of how people interact with sports and the impact of sports on everyday society.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was that the students in it had a broad array of experiences with sports. The biggest weaknesses were the grading and the organization. We were expected to use lots of sociological terms but it didn't feel like we'd ever actually learned their definitions. The grading of the course was also brutal for seemingly no reason. The TA and Professor had very different standards, and its seemed like grades were kind of random which made things stressful. The correspondence assignments were fine, but the written ones were tons more work than the audio ones and were graded much more harshly. There wasn't much room to grow, and it seemed like we'd get marked down for not mentioning random things outside the scope of assignments. The class organization was also a weakness. The professor didn't seem to know whether he wanted it to be a lecture or a seminar, and the in-between size was rough.",
                "strengths: interesting material and discussions; fun readings\r\nweakness: while I loved how there wasn't too much emphasis on the intricacies of a given theory (more of a brief overview), I felt like Prof. Manning wanted more discussion of theory in our papers so if that's the case I would like to see more lecture slides giving definitions of theories",
                "This course was attempting to be a seminar but there were way to many people to have discussions in class. For many people, this was their first time taking a sociology class, and I think there wasnt enough time spent learning the sociological concepts that we were supposed to reference in our writing.",
                "Strengths- Even though the class is a lecture, the class is discussion based, and Prof. Manning does a great job getting everyone involved. The class is super well organized and Prof. Manning is a gifted lecturer.",
                "The strengths of this course include the wide range of sports which are discussed and their connections to sociology. Furthermore, the open-nature of the midterm and final writing assignments allowed students to write about topics for which they felt most passionate. This course could be improved by going into a bit more depth concerning the sociological theories which underly analyzation lenses used in the course.",
                "Great organizational structure and really enjoyed the correspondence assignments. Difficult for shy people to get good in-class participation grade, however, as speaking in front of 40 people can be daunting.",
                "Strengths: the layout was straightforward and organized easy to follow, professor was great, material was interesting, class was engaging and fun\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt there was too much reading material there are times where I feel that we werent able to cover all of the assigned work, the class slides could contain more sociological terms and recaps of all of the important terminology at least once to refresh for final projects, it would help to have more and perhaps earlier check ins during the larger projects."

                "I would not recommend this class. The grading was unnecessarily harsh and it ended up hindering my engagement. The class structure was also strange, trying to be a \"leminar\" where we spent much of the class just talking to neighbors every time and reporting back. I ultimately ended up dreading class time, which was really sad because I took this to be a fun class. If it's run in the same style as it was this time, I wouldn't recommend it.",
