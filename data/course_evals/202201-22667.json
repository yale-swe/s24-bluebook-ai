                "Learned about the political and social context of 19th and 20th century Russia. Learned about genre, contentions, and the contrast between French and Russian theater. Learned about different Russian playwrights I had only heard of (Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Gogol, Chekhov) and compared them to one another. Close reading of multiple Chekov plays and learned about how he was complimented by Stanislavsky.",
                "Read some great Russian plays",
                "I was able to close read Russian theatre plays from different authors.",
                "I gained an appreciation for the trends and development of Russian theater from the turn of the 19th century into the early 20th. I learned about the social and political questions Russian society faced at the time, and how Russian playwrights best tried to answer these queries on stage."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: enjoyed the length of the reading assignments (one play per week), enjoyable plays as a whole, great way to engage in Russian culture, great guest speaker, loved the flow of the syllabus (started with Woe from Wit, ended with Chekhov's most famous plays). Julia was available for office hours, gave good guidance for the papers, and graded fairly. Loved how there was only one short paper (midterm, 4 pgs) and one long paper (final, 8 pgs). Weaknesses: class periods felt a little off because they weren't strictly lecture nor seminar. One student per week presented on a given pllaywright and the rest of the class was directed by Julia, who chose which sections of the play we'd focus on. Didn't hear a lot from my peers. Saw a lot of adaptations during class, which would take about half an hour of class time per week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Titus is a genuine joy to work with she is so passionate and engaged about theater that it's hard not to become excited. The course design also worked well to facilitate learning in a way that tracked trends in both Russia and theater. The manageable reading load ensures that students are able to read all of the work that is assigned and that they have time to think about the themes of each play.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The discussions sometimes tapered off during class, especially during weeks that people didn't really like the play we were reading. This course seems to be heavily dependent on the group that takes it. If the group is engaged and excited to experience Russian theater, then the course will be great; if not, the course might suffer a bit.",
                "Strengths: the content is so good; the visit from Yuri is mesmerizing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Titus is so nice and well intentioned but I felt like she wasnt the best at facilitating discussion. Often, someone would say something insightful, only for Prof Titus to move on immediately without acknowledging the comment. Most of our classes were Professor Titus talking at us (rather than us having an enriching discussion) and then watching a filmed version or film adaptation of the play because we would have nothing else to do. I left our classes feeling less enthusiastic about the plays than I did coming into class because our discussions simply had no focus and no clear takeaways.",
                "Some strengths are that the materials we cover are diverse and incorporate many prolific play writers. Additionally, the seminar nature make discussions very interactive. Though, it would be helpful to increase the number of classes per week so that engagement to material remains high.",
                "I think the course was great, though perhaps a bit more reading about the social and historical context of 19th century Russia at the beginning of the semester would have helped with context. I really enjoyed the play selection and felt Professor Titus gave us a great survey of early Russian theater."

                "Yes, if they're looking for a solid humanities class or introduction to Russian culture. These plays are super important, and I would recommend Russian theater to anyone.",
                "Absolutely! I had no prior exposure to theater and learned so much about the topic (generally and within the Russian context). It was really interesting to use literature to study sociological and political trends in Imperial Russia, a type of analysis that I was not super experienced in prior to taking this course.",
                "Only as an excuse to read these great plays.",
                "Yes, the learning from these plays is immense. Russian theater is very different from other kinds of theater, so the learning derived from it is unique and significant.",
                "I would, I really enjoyed the plays we read and discussed, and coming from a non-theater background I still felt I had something to add and contribute to the class. The social and political problems discussed by many of the playwrights we read are still very relevant today, and it was extremely interesting to hear their takes on these issues. Experiencing the trend of theatrical development from Griboedov to Chekhov was also very rewarding, as by the end of the semester I can tangibly appreciate how far the medium has come."
