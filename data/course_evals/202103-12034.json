                "The class was a great way to learn to think creatively and let go of the perfectionist and stressful attitude so many of us have to classes. It was a place to just explore modes of creation and thinking in a very pure and child-like way. This is such an important skill that often gets forgotten.",
                "This course really forced me to be creative in a lot of different ways. It taught me that their is creative value in anything.",
                "This class was not at all what I expected, but I am very grateful for it. Nathan is a kind, charismatic, fascinating soul who I am so grateful to have learned from. Class was always interesting. I learned to express myself and give myself permission to be creative without pressure and attachment to the outcome, and I'm so grateful for the safe space that this class was.",
                "I developed my creativity, as well as the skills to create art using various mediums like drawing, painting, spray painting, construction, and more.",
                "Explored and created various forms of art in new and resourceful ways",
                "I learned to re-evaluate the way I look at the world, see connections and art where I'd never seen it before and live my life with my eyes open! I also learned how diverse and broad the concept of 'art' is. I developed skills in thinking out of the box, using a wide variety of materials and media, and how one can tell a story with something as simple as a recording of footsteps.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: Fun and interactive seminar, acts as a gateway course that introduces many different styles of art.\r\n\r\nWeakness: You really have no idea how you are doing in the class and what grade you will get.",
                "Professor Carter is super cool and personable. He really just let us be creative and create things we wanted based on that day's (loose) prompt. He values creativity in all its forms and it was never scary to take risks because you knew he would appreciate it. A very nice break to other classes.",
                "The strengths of this course: Very low workload (all work was completed in class, no homework, tests, midterms), got to meet other first years because it was a first year seminar, Nathan (the course instructor, artist in Brooklyn) put together really compelling slides and pushed us to take risks in our different creative projects. What other class would you put on a shadow puppet show or make spray paint stencil t-shirts?\r\nWeaknesses: Very low workload, which was nice, but also would not have minded if the course was a little more rigorous and had work outside of the classroom.",
                "This course was great at helping students develop their creativity, and giving students many different types of art to try. For a couple projects, having a little more time would have been helpful though.",
                "As someone who has never taken an art class, this course was fun and allowed me to tap into my creative side. Every class was a little different and we were constantly encouraged to go out of our comfort zone and create art with scraps of materials. I think the course would be improved if there was more direction and organization. While the premise of the course was to learn about art and ourselves, having no syllabus made or feedback on grades made it difficult to interpret how we were doing and how we would be graded.",
                "I think that I would have loved more feedback along the way and more of an opportunity to engage with the thinking behind particular pieces of art. I would have loved to engage with some specific artists, perhaps, and their artwork (maybe not before we'd made ours, as it might limit what we'd done, but perhaps afterwards?) I really loved the freedom we were given, though, and how broad the engagement was. We got to use so many different types of media and tell so many different types of story.",
                "S:\r\nVery chill course, but you can get really into the projects if you want.\r\n\r\nW:\r\nYou need to be fine with chaos",
                "Strengths: very engaging and interactive",
                "I felt that this course was extremely fun with the hands on projects. One thing it could be improved by could be more structure in planning when to do each project and possibly have them build off the other"

                "This course is best described as a middle school art class designed for College Students. This class was the perfect way to start off my day, and it often acted as a detox where I could go to class, chill, and make art. It is definitely a gut course, so this class would best be taken as a fifth course rather than one of your main four.",
                "Definitely take it if you get it. There was no homework or reading at all and we just had fun creating art during class. It was extremely awesome.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a breath of fresh air and a chance to use your creative muscles.",
                "Absolutely!!! It would be a great 5th course, because no homework, midterms, or exams. It felt like an elementary school art class but at the Yale level. We did such cool projects made kites and flew them, made \"time machines,\" spray paint stencil t-shirts, and so much more. After this class, I find that I am so much more willing to take risks and put less pressure on myself, this class helped curb a lot of the \"artistic paralysis\" that so often begets anxiety with artists. Also, most of the class were not artists, which was such a cool environment! Overall cannot recommend this course enough, highlight of my first semester at Yale by far.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in developing their creativity or interested in art in general. The class gives students the valuable experience of getting a bunch of tools, materials and utensils and just seeing what they can come up with. It's a level of creativity which is very valuable to experience and which will be very useful in the future.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a basic intro art class",
                "Yes, definitely. It was a course where the pressure was off, and we were all able to simply be creative and have fun.",
                "Yes. Great art class for both art and STEM students. Every student can benefit from the class",
                "I definitely recommend everyone to take this course. It encourages free thinking and experimenting with materials to produce art. Mr. Carter once said that we were creating art despite the poverty of means or something along those lines. Lacking access to one material pushes you to come up with ways to replace or supplement it. This is a skill that is clearly applicable in any other field. That being said, I wouldn't recommend this course for someone overly obsessed with structure and perfect systems. (or maybe I would, to help them ease up)",
                "Yes this was a really fun course to explore your creative side and think of things new ways."
