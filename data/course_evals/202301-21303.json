Got some purchase on current debates about how or why literature might (or might not) matter, and specifically about the political causes and consequences of English's recent rise to global prominence as a literary language.",
                "The discussions we had about the role of the english language and \"world literature\" pushed my mindsets in ways I'm really grateful for (especially as I move forward in studying literature). My interpretation\/intelligent reading skills improved a lot in this course, too, largely thanks to the caliber of the in-class discussions.",

                "Professor Cleary is the reason why this course is so amazing. He is incredibly knowledgeable about this subject and encourages all students to think critically about the literature. In my time at Yale thus far, he is one of my favorite professors.",
                "Strength: Professor and syllabus \r\nWeakness: perhaps overwhelming amount of reading",
                "I found Professor Clearys leadership of the course, and his discussion questions, extremely engaging and insightful. I felt he effectively balanced the significant workload and reading list with slight alterations to the syllabus as the semester progressed.",
                "Strengths: Some really fantastic books, ones which genuinely changed how I approach the project of understanding people and the world. Professor Cleary is great at getting people to express their points clearly and explicitly, and also encourages us to look at the consequences and contexts for \"easy\" and commonplace arguments. Lots (pages and pages) of very useful feedback on essays.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It felt like we spent a lot of class time essentially summarizing the content of the day's readings. While I think this might've been a response to a weak culture of discussion participation, it seemed like an inefficient response time-wise. I wonder if more frequent cold-calling or reading quizzes (both strategies Professor Cleary used at some points) could have saved us more time for close readings or discussion of larger questions.",
                "I sometimes think that the reading responses were a little bit too much work, in the sense that I had to get through the readings really quickly in order to also have time to write about them. I sometimes felt like I would have appreciated being able to do the readings at a little bit of a slower pace without worrying about getting them done so I could write about them. Beyond that, this was a really wonderful course, and Professor Cleary's skills at leading the seminar discussion contributed to that immensely.",
                "Strengths: Professor Cleary is lovely and such a talented seminar leader, in addition to being brilliant. I loved the texts we read and have found myself recommending several of them. We often got feedback on our discussion posts, which felt above and beyond. Prof. Cleary's feedback on our essays was incredibly helpful, too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! really!",
                "I think the class was organized very well, and the readings were very engaging and thought-provoking. Seminar was always dynamic, and Prof. Cleary's questions really allowed for us to think and probe deeper."

                "Yes! This was my favorite of the English foundational courses, and Professor Cleary is amazing.",

                "Yes!!",
                "Absolutely! Again, Professor Cleary is fantastic as a professor and he takes the time and energy to see you succeed. I learned so much.",
                "Yes, definitely! Professor Cleary is a great resource to improve your thinking, speaking, and writing about whatever you're interested in and how it connects to the details of literary work. Also, a lot of these books are really unusually special. Be aware that the writing load is similar to a writing-credit class, though.",
                "Definitely. The class was great, and you should be prepared to read a lot.",
                "Absolutely. The syllabus is excellent, and it felt really important to take a non-Western focused literature course as an English major. I especially recommend if you're able to take with Prof Cleary!",
                "I definitely would recommend ENGL 128 to other students, even students not studying the Humanities or English. This course dives into other sociopolitical topics that allow for a deeper understanding of the world to emerge."
