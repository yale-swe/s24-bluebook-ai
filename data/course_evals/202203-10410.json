                "I learned about how to effectively navigate large quantities of material and create a story line beneficial to my overall takeaways of the history. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to effectively communicate and work with a group of students within a seminar discussion setting."

                "The course has a very interesting syllabus and the content of the class is great. However, I think the slides in the lecture presentation could be improved. Having only a few slides with just pictures makes it hard to understand what the most important points are. The lectures were a bit unorganized.",
                "Strengths: The class material is really interesting!! I thought that every reading was really interesting. The main textbook, The Soviet Experiment, was really well written and succinct. All of the other readings were also really easy to read but also fascinating. The only assignments are the midterm, final, weekly discussion questions, and a short final paper which allows you to dive into any topic that you like. The midterm and final were both open note and were totally fair---I don't think that they were too difficult or asked you any questions that were unreasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were some classes where we had like 200 pages of readings, much more than the average of ~60-80, which sometimes felt like it came out of nowhere. The lectures were sometimes a little bit dry and it was hard to stay focused and engaged during the entire 75 minutes. I think that it would be really helpful if Professor Antonov made them a little bit more interactive, or gave the lectures more structure. As it stands right now, the lecture is 75 minutes of Profesor Antonov speaking at the class with 10 or less slides with pictures and a list of names or events. Since it's a lot of information, it would have been nice to have some more structure about what was most important or like summary slides or anything. I ended up not taking any notes most classes and just relying on the readings, which turned out to be fine---I still feel like I learned a LOT and did well on the midterm and final----but, it would have been nice if the lectures were fashioned a little differently.",
                "Strengths: topic is interesting, Antonov is hilarious and very kind. Weaknesses: Antonov's lecturing style is unique. He uses two \"slides\" over an entire course time, which can make staying on track a bit hard. Antonov also goes on a few tangents some times, but they are always funny and worth it.",
                "Strengths:\r\nEffective Lectures\r\nNo Censorship\r\nNo Boundaries of Intellectual Learning\r\nExcellent reference materials and aid from books\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLecture slides were not as captivating as the material being spoken about",
                "Course material was really interesting and I loved learning about Soviet Russia in this course. The two 75 minute class periods AND required weekly section added up to over 200 minutes of class time per week -- more than any other single credit course I have taken at Yale. Also, assigning a 6-8 final paper and a cumulative final exam felt a bit overkill. Enjoyed writing the paper though."

                "Yes I think the content is great.",
                "Yes! I think that it's a really important history, and there aren't many history classes at Yale that offer such a survey which I think is a shame. Many higher level classes are going to assume that you know all of this history, and if you went to a high school that wasn't Exeter or Andover which had classes like this, you're going to need to learn all of this context. Professor Antonov is really approachable and easy to talk to, which made a class with such a wide breadth much easier.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The professor was extremely dedicated to both the students as well as the material. Additionally, the syllabus was focused on being both intriguing as well as inviting for students to further their own understanding.",
                "Yes. It's super interesting and I feel like I learned a lot, but would warn against taking it as a fifth class (final paper and final exam added up to 65% of the course grade coming down to the last two weeks of school which was a bit much and felt unnecessary)."
