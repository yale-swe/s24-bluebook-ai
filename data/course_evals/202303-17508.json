I wish the course was structured in a more hand-on way such as activities centering around role-play negotiations, structured meetings, mock sessions. How did the UN really handle these situations and does one begin drafting documents that sometimes hold contentious language for some nations? This course would be more effective if students were able to learn first-hand how the UN works.",
