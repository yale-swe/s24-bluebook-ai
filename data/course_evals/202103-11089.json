I can't imagine this is easier to grade either, so why were both of the midterms pencil-and-paper?? That's not useful in any scenario outside of the classroom and unnecessarily stressful for students. Also I felt that the lectures did not necessarily translate to what was on the psets",

This was a pretty small class, it almost felt like a seminar. Weaknesses: Slade is a bit of a quiet lecturer, so don't expect a ton of engagement with the course. However, if you have questions he will always be able to answer it.",
