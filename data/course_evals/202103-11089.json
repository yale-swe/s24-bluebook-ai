                "It makes absolutely zero sense in any world to have handwritten midterms for a CS course. I can't imagine this is easier to grade either, so why were both of the midterms pencil-and-paper?? That's not useful in any scenario outside of the classroom and unnecessarily stressful for students. Also I felt that the lectures did not necessarily translate to what was on the psets",

                "The course was taught well and in depth \r\n.People seemed disengaged with the course. I did not like the no collaboration policy, because I feel like in the actual CS world collaboration is a key component of program development.",
                "Strengths: Broad range of topics, caring professor, kind TAs.",
                "Much of the class feels self-taught or heavily aided by the TAs.",
                "The psets are super helpful & reflect the lectures.",
                "Strengths: PSETS are really well designed, TA's are incredibly helpful and you really come out learning a lot about Python. Slade knows a lot about the language. This was a pretty small class, it almost felt like a seminar. Weaknesses: Slade is a bit of a quiet lecturer, so don't expect a ton of engagement with the course. However, if you have questions he will always be able to answer it.",
                "The content was great, though the lecturing style was not the most engaging as it was mostly the professor talking at the students the whole time rather than encouraging participation."
