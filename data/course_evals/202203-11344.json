                "Strengths: If you are genuinely motivated and interested in Korean-- take this course with Prof Back. This course will probably work out well for you if you are highly motivated and you are willing to dedicate a large amount of time and effort towards this course. Weaknesses: This course has a very high workload. There is weekly and nightly homework on top of studying daily. Personally, I wouldn't say I liked the teaching style of this course-- some of the nightly homework did not help me actually learn Korean. This, in turn, made me feel like the homework was a chore and something I had to get done to get the credit rather than it being something that can actually help me actively learn the material. Also, most of the slides, textbook, etc. are in Korean-- there is very to little translation on the slides/material so I often found myself having to look up translations to actually understand what the vocabulary, practices, phrases, etc. are. It would be a lot more convenient and an easier learning process if the slides had translations. Additionally, I feel as if this class moved way too fast; I felt that sometimes the goal was to get through and move through the material rather than ensuring all students were comfortable and learning the material. Given that this is an L1 elementary language course, I expected that the class was to not be taught almost fully in Korean sometimes. As someone who came into this course with zero background in Korean, it's difficult to learn Korean in a course that teaches primarily in Korean. It would make more sense if that were the case for higher-level language courses, but not quite L1.",
                "Strength: Best Professor I had at Yale. Very friendly, enthusiastic, and supportive. There is also a lot of student-to-student work.\r\n\r\nWeakness: not a gut class",
                "A strength of the course is the well structured curriculum that made the material easier to follow and prepared me for what to expect. One weakness of the course is that often some of the more challenging material wouldn't be described or taught as much as I would have liked, thus making some assignments confusing.",
                "Strengths: inclusion of cultural elements, Prof.'s encouragement of questions and insight into Korean language and culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: What I feel was a slightly unreasonable amount of work assigned and due in the last 2 weeks of class; later in the semester, the pace of the class moved too fast for most students (myself included)"

                "No, I would not unless you genuinely want a challenging language course and have a strong interest in Korean. If you are comfortable and excited about a fast-paced course and are willing to contribute a lot of time to this course, then it fits for you. I took this course primarily because I had a slight interest in Korean and figured it would be one of my more \"fun\" courses. However, I do not think this course fits for someone looking for that.",
                "Yes yes yes yes yes. If you dont like Korean or are in Korean L100, then I would not recommend it",
