A weakness of this course is that the test material does not always reflect the level of difficulty or the type of problems reviewed in class.",
                "I think the course is pretty straightforward. All the course material was useful.",
                "Strength: I felt that the course was relatively well structured and that the psets aligned with what we learned during previous lectures. Weaknesses: The course was extremely fast-paced, and had I not taken AP Calc BC in high school, I would have been very lost. I also didnt love how each class period was structured, with short lectures followed by collaborative exercises that we worked on together. I think lectures in which the professor worked through problems in front of us would have been more effective because our class did not work together, and class periods were often filled with awkward, silent stretches.",
                "I think the course is organized nicely in canvas, but it would be nice if concepts were taught/introduced more in class rather than in the canvas videos.",
                "strengths: interesting content. weakness: a little disorganized",
                "Strength: the exams were reflective of the problem sets. they gave us good guidance on how to study for exam. no weakness.",
                "Strengths: the pacing is reasonable, the material is actually pretty interesting, and there are many resources in place to help students succeed (office hours, review sessions before midterms and the final, peer tutoring).\r\nWeaknesses: how well the content gets covered depends completely on your TF, the PSets are pretty frequent and the content we need to know to do them often gets covered 1 or 2 days before they're due.",
                "More interactive activities in class",
                "The information was clear but could have been more interactive",
                "Some strengths of this course include its emphasis on the students having to do a lot of their work by themselves (and as a result there is increased collaboration).\r\nHowever, it would be extremely useful to have more in-class demonstrations in the way the explorations (homework before each class )were.",
                "Many of the seminars are taught by graduate students. To put it simply, they lack experience teaching and the students tend to suffer as a result. Students in sections taught by actual professors are at a significant advantage. I believe I had to work much harder and my understanding of the material suffered as a result. I know not much can be done about this issue, but I would suggest that maybe Brett's class be recorded for students in other sections to watch as additional help. I can personally say I know I would have benefited from that.",
                "It was clear and organized. I think sometimes the explorations or interactive digital things detracted from the course. I think more visual aspects could have been introduced, however, in the revolutions of a solid unit."

I also felt that the psets got easier over the course of the semester.",

Unless they are someone who greatly enjoys mathematics or its applications or needs the class to complete a credit, I did not find the class interesting and it often caused me more stress than it did enrich my life. I did enjoy the occasional videos on real world applications though (to be specific, there were videos relating to Professor Demers and that content specifically was interesting).",
