    "Knowledge: about induction, the Fourier transformation, about sine waves, capacitors \/ resistors (LRC circuits), converging and diverging lenses and mirrors\r\n\r\nSkills: how to use some physics apps on my phone. How to do a lot of clicking on Canvas",
    "I learned how to think critically about physics concepts including electromagnetic induction, periodic motion, and electronic circuit. I also learned quantitive skill by analyzing datasets in LoggerPro.",
    "I learned about FFT curves and how to pull useful information out of graphs and tables.",
    "I learned lab skills relating to various physics 2 topics.",
    "lab skills related to electricity and magnetism",
    "I further developed how to write physics lab write ups and exploring the concepts in the real world.",
    "Deeper knowledge of the subjects learned in PHYS181 via practical application",
    "Was good at teaching applications and real world viewing of physical properties",
    "I learned how to use LoggerPro, mastered looking at sine waves, and found out how to create FFT plots.",
    "I learned about physics lab techniques for studying circuits, magnetism, and optics.",
    "Much deeper understanding of physics concepts",
    "I learned about the behavior and analysis of oscillating systems. I gained skills using the Fast Fourier Analysis and drawing circuit diagrams. Overall I learned the great importance of oscillating systems and the different field in which their dynamics are relevant."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 5 weeks, so it's short, you can get it done fast. spare yourself the trouble of prolonging it over the duration of a semester. Also I found that SPL can get really hot \/ has poor ventilation. Strength  of this course: you can take physics lab in the comfort of your air-conditioned house. Another strength, I liked the PLA's, I liked that we could choose from a variety of different things to do.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was online :( no way to actually do the experiments myself, I felt like i spent the entire course just writing, writing, writing nonstop. \r\n\r\nImprovements: send students lab kits! like little lenses \/ wires \/ mirrors or whatever. Snap circuits! Also, I wish the PLA's had some options for students who had equipment in their house. Like I have a voltmeter \/ multimeter and different kinds of wires in my basement, as well as prisms \/ lenses \/ mirrors \/ tuning forks (for resonance)  lying around my house...",
    "I think that this course is very straightforward in regards to conveying the materials. One particular strength that I found in this course was that the professors really are passionate about teaching the material to students and super accommodating in regards to explaining confusing topics. I think that one area of improvement is the work expectations at some weeks, although I think that is largely due to this being an online summer course. Also, I found that some weeks the assignment were posted much too late to actually prepare for class and the lab quiz. Often the lab handouts were not released until like midnight or 12 hours before the class, and I didn't see them until I woke up in the morning.",
    "This course was good for an online lab class, which I understand is difficult. It is hard to watch the videos for lab while someone is speaking over Zoom because you cannot hear the videos if someone is talking. Perhaps we should watch the videos before class and come prepared with questions or find a way where we can mute zoom to watch videos.",
    "I think it was taught as well as it could possibly be taught given the circumstances. In the future would highly highly recommend taking it in person because we didn't get a chance to play around with a lot of cool physics toys.",
    "sometimes it was hard to visualize things through zoom and harder to explain and understand things",
    "More breakout rooms! I miss talking to people.",
    "Strengths:\r\nNot too hard\r\nInstructors were extremely available during class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nVirtual Labs are hard to learn from\r\nPost-lab activities took way too long and did not teach me anything",
    "Fairly good course overall. Well adapted to online learning. Something the camera angle proved it was impossible to fully see what was going on, leading to questions we did not have all the information needed to solve.",
    "This course was great. Way more manageable than the regular semester because the course is much more inclusive and help is readily available.",
    "This semester felt a bit more repetitive in its experiments as compared to the previous semester of mechanics. This is because we were taking the same kind of data over and over again just on different systems or circuits. I understand that almost all of the previous labs were simply converted to an online format. If new labs could be thought of that are more conducive to the online format than the previous ones, that may be more helpful. \r\n\r\nI did appreciate the organization of the course. The videos are easy to follow and the lab manuals are easy to understand.",
    "Generally, I thought the course was well adapted to the online format. The labs covered a wide range of topics and were informative. However, the structure of lab sessions was inconsistent across sections. Some TAs walked students through each step of the lab, while others let students work independently. I think making the structure of the sessions more consistent would be helpful.",
    "Strength: Dedicated, hard-working faculty who are always available to help. Weakness: A bit last-minute on everything",
    "The strengths of this course was the hands on post lab activities. I enjoyed making my own working crystal radio set. Again I was very lucky to have my own materials, I think this course could be made more engaging for other students by providing them with materials to experiment Also sometimes the labs were posted very close to the actual lab time. Ideally it would have been nice to have more time to review the lab before it started."

   "comments": [
    "Sure\r\nGood if you want to knock this course out fast. Don't recommend taking physics + lab for both summer session \"semesters\", you'll get burnt out by halfway point of the second course. It's good, I think, to do just physics + lab for one summer session \"semester\". This course is also good if you don't like the actual experimental side of labs, it's a way to fulfill a lab requirement without actually doing any experiments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any pre-med student. It is a considerable amount of time for a course that is only 0.5 credits, so it is important not to mistakenly think it will not take up much of your time.",
    "Yes, but in person.",
    "It's not bad, but i would probably only take it for a requirement",
    "Yes! The material was interesting and the course was very stress-free.",
    "Only if you love physics or have to take the course",
    "Yes. It was mostly as you would expect which is one of the best things a class can be.",
    "Yes. Prof. Barrett and Prof. Cahn are both awesome and add a nice change to the lab environment from 165.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The labs were very manageable, and the post-lab assignments offered a wide array of options for at-home experiments.",
    "Yes, I would. Fulfills requirement and gives deeper understanding of material",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone else. However, I think and in person version of the class would be superior at teaching the student how to use equipment."
