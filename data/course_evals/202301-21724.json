                "I learned so much about the different uses\/theories of dialogue in literary forms, from drama to the novel to poetry. I was exposed to both theory and works of art that exemplify such theorization.",
                "This was a fun course, taught as a discussion seminar with a variety of different majors taking the class. Learnt lots about different interpretations of dialogue in history and read some cool literature, and discussions varied lots class to class.",
                "Learned about dialogue in a theoretical\/structural sense. Gained more insight into the intersection between philosophy and literary theory",
                "I practiced close-reading alongside theorizing on the entire (fragment of a) text as a whole, and, perhaps most importantly, referring back to the theoretical block of texts even after moving on to drama, narrative, prose, and my readings for other classes--really connecting all the dots across traditions, genres, and even classes.",
                "Theories and examples of dialogue in various forms of writing and philosophical thought.",
                "The course offered an in-depth understanding of how dialogue emerges across the arts. We explore where each medium covered by the class supports and fails meaningful communication. I refined my understanding of genres of the written word to better understand where I can best express my creative interests."

            "comments": [
                "The syllabus is fantastic: I loved almost every 'segment' of the course.\r\n\r\nThe seminar itself could be improved. Because there were two instructors (both brilliant thinkers and teachers in their own rights!), a lot of time was taken up by their dialogue, rather than the contributions of students. Often only a few students would be engaged in the discussion, with others distracted or only chiming in once a class (if at all). I think more effort in the future could be made to facilitating a healthy discussion, even at the expense of the two instructors' dialogue (which was totally fascinating and enlightening for those who made the effort to stay engaged). Perhaps the course would be improved by being led by one primary instructor.",
                "I think Shira and Rudiger taught the course well and it was up to the student to decide how much to engage and therefore get out of the course. My own involvement varied, but when I was more engaged it was super interesting and class discussions (and office hours talking about my paper) were great",
                "The professors were extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable! They were very quick at responding to emails and always eager to help. Professor Miron and Campe work really well together, their teaching styles complement each other very well and it makes class much more engaging. One weakness would be how relatively little time we devoted to certain theorists, specifically Bakhtin! I wish we had spoken about the Dialogic Imagination essay much more, because it was super interesting but I still feel very confused by some aspects of it.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The BEST ORGANIZED course EVER. Seriously. Everything is so intentional and the instructors anticipate what will come up in the future and prepare a sturdy foundation so stealthily but entirely effectively. I'm impressed.\r\n- A very diverse cohort of students in terms of majors and intellectual interests made for vibrant discussion.\r\n- Speaking of discussion, the seminar was incredibly productive and we left feeling satisfied with what we had accomplished (knowing we had addressed a lot), while also still excited to spend more time working through the texts next week.\r\n- I really loved how someone was able to speak whenever they had a comment. Though the effect of this is we would often go over-time (which is not bad), and sometimes we got antsy when the instructors spent a lot of time going back and forth amongst themselves (albeit productively).\r\n- I'm so in awe of how tight the syllabus is and how closely we nuanced themes of 'dialogue' and 'miscommunication' (and perhaps even 'genre')--we stayed very close to course themes and truly explored them comprehensively.\r\n\r\nNot so much weaknesses, but considerations:\r\n- Very fast-paced course, so you really need to stay on top of the readings and fully engage with them otherwise the rest of the course starts to fragment a bit.\r\n- There's a lot of reading, sure, in quantity, but mostly in how dense the readings are. I don't think I've ever spent so much time parsing theory ever as in this course. I really appreciated this, but it certainly came as a shock to me.",
                "I loved the concept of the classI do think the reading balance for each week could be tailored a little bit, as could a set of optional supplements given how many examples were utilized in class.",
                "Strengths - Interesting readings, worthwhile course topics, engaging professors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not always the most engaging in-class discussions, readings could have been more closely examined in context to questions and ambitions of undergraduate students."

                "Yes: it is fascinating course that explores the intersection of aesthetic theories (thinking about works of art) and philosophic theories of life (thinking about ethics, life, human relations).  This semester, in its maiden voyage, there were better spots and rougher spots, but I'm sure in the future, if the course is taught again, it will be smoother and more refined as an experience.",
                "Absolutely if you're interested in comp lit \/ German \/ English literature. We read lots of cool literature, and this class was the perfect example of you get out what you put in. Shira and Rudiger facilitated great class discussions and if you engaged with them, you learnt lots.",
                "Yes! A lot of the reading was complicated and confusing, but the professors and class discussion help you piece everything together. I think this class fundamentally changed the way I view dialogue in literature, theater, and film. Dont take it if you arent into some dense theoretical material though",
                "Absolutely. I'd whole-heartedly recommend this course. It's a great introduction if this is your first graze with literary theory, but the class is also totally set-up to facilitate in-depth analysis if this isn't your first rodeo, so the student composition can vary drastically in terms of prior experience and intellectual interests and make for an even more fruitful discussion. The readings are not for the faint of heart, but if you're willing to put in time and effort and personal care, then this course is absolutely awesome and will change the way you approach reading in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as long as they would also be interested in the theory side of dialogue; the course begins with a hearty introduction of Plato and other philosophical\/hermeneutical thinkers, which can be dry if it's not your thing.",
                "I would recommend the course to students interested in the syllabus. The class is interesting for those who allow themselves to become invested, but one could only incorporate 2-3 readings from class into their personal work and pass, meaning that someone interested in doing as little as required would miss out on valuable, rewarding study."
