                "I developed critical theories for queer aging studies as well as disability studies. This course also provided me incredible frameworks for thinking about queer folks across the lifespan as well as intergenerationally. More than anything this course provided an amazing space to think and work with others in and around queer lives, ageism, disability studies as well as to just be at a time when that is so needed. This course gave me so much.",
                "i learned a ton about queer history as it relates to age and aging, and gained new perspectives and insights into queer aging that id never thought about before",
                "This was my first class in critical age studies, and I think it has done a great deal to further my skillset and knowledge base in WGSS (in fact, I think every WGSS major should try to take an age studies class, and this is a fantastic one). I also got more practice in primary-source analysis and close reading, and I think Professor Herring does a great job of merging the humanities with the social sciences in the syllabus so it really feels like an interdisciplinary class!",
                "I developed extremely insightful knowledge on a realm of LGBT life and society that I had not previously known a lot about. The readings were helpful, interesting, and relevant, and I appreciated all of them. Skill wise, I learned a lot more on how to participate efficiently in class discussion, and writing long form papers.",
                "Truly transformative insights on LGBTQ elders and critical age theory and how theorizations of LGBTQ life spans apply to my life as a queer woman.",
                "I learned about queer crip time and disability studies, bricolage, how archives work, age studies, how to write a research paper, and gained different insights on queer age studies.",
                "This class was eye-opening in its exploration of aging among LGBTQ+ communities. An incredible balance of gaining academic knowledge and thinking about our own futurities. It wasn't just a class - it became a community thanks to Professor Herring's commitment and care.",
                "I learned so much about close reading historical documents and really digging into the material at hand, rather than skating by on vague statements."

                "This course is beyond amazing. By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Prof. Herring is an incredible professor that cares so deeply about creating a generative, kind and supportive space for thinking. The projects were unique and thoughtful and the readings were so wonderful and important. It's absolutely an important and nothing short of fabulous class.",
                "high engagement during seminars, interesting readings",
                "I think my only critique of this class is that the final paper should have been more open-ended (i.e., just a research paper on any topic, with a clear research question, rather than centered on a \"cultural object\" as I found that to be rather limiting and a bit too similar to our earlier paper in the class). It has many strengths with the biggest one being Professor Herring. It is absolutely worth taking this class just to meet him and work with him. The syllabus is fantastic and covers a wide range of subjects, time periods, geographic locations, and mediums (from archives/primary sources to graphic novels to movies/documentaries).",
                "Strengths: Seminar class size was great for class discussion, and professor was fast and efficient with feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think sometimes the discussion and readings were a little too heavy at points, and discussion could be very personal, which made the environment a little tense at times.",
                "Strengths: Professor Herring is a force of nature! Engaging and makes the class accessible to everyone while holding discussions to a high standard.",
                "The strengths of this course are its accessibility, the different mediums analyzed which allow for a robust understanding of how queer history is kept, Professor Herring's detailed contextualization of readings, and the different ways creativity is allowed to be expressed in a structured way. The reading selections are all incredibly interesting and not impenetrable. The two very low stakes partner presentations at the end of the course allow for you to take the readings, films, comics, photobooks, and other media that we've discussed in class together and connect to your personal interests. Professor Herring is also an AMAZING professor. His classroom is very inclusive, he is open to be challenged and critiqued, he has a wonderful wealth of knowledge, and also has a great sense of humor. This class attracts people from so many different disciplines which also creates a unique dynamic. I don't feel like there are any weaknesses, WGSS needs more classes like this!",
                "Strengths: Incredibly dedicated and available professor who clearly cares about his students; prompt, extensive, and useful feedback; professor was committed to making the material accessible to all students and being sensitive around difficult topics (learning accommodations, etc.); professor carefully guided discussions without monopolizing them; assignments were all worthwhile and accomplished specific goals; diverse learning materials (readings, movies, photography, visits to the Beinecke, etc.)\r\n\r\nAreas for improvement: N/A - just wish it could have a second part and didn't end after one semester!",
                "Prof. Herring pays very close attention to you as a student and makes your insights feel valued. He motivates you to care about the material not only for its own sake, but in collective engagement & collaboration with the class. I felt that I came out of this class having actively come to terms with questions that I was struggling with within my own life, as well as just progressing academically. So many professors say they care about giving accommodations - this professor actually sincerely does, and you can feel it. If you want to feel understood, engaged, and pushed to think about frameworks of study you may have never considered before, I cannot recommend a class with Prof. Herring strongly enough."

                "YES! PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! I have not taken any classes at Yale like this which so deeply consider the intersections of queer studies, gender studies, age studies, disability studies, science and medicine. And never really taken before a class that centers age as a key domain. Most importantly Prof. Herring is one of the best professors I've ever had and by far one of the most caring and dedicated. It's an amazing class.",
                "yes! material was super interesting, seminars were engaging, prof was extremely caring and understanding",
                "Yes! Professor Herring is new, so I will go ahead and say take ANYTHING offered by him. No matter what he teaches, I'm certain it will be as amazing as this class. It's perfect for WGSS majors, but I also had friends in the class from many different majors/backgrounds who found it interesting, worthwhile, and fun. The workload level is very fair (definitely not a boring/excessively easy class, but a great fifth class and not overwhelming) and the classroom environment that Professor Herring creates is unlike most that I've seen at Yale. He makes us all feel very comfortable and welcome in the classroom and as a result we all actually talked and shared our opinions in seminar; it didn't feel at all performative (as many seminars often feel).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone but especially other LGBTQ+ students who may have not read a lot of queer theory previously, like me.",
                "I would surely recommend this course--I thought the semester's information was very relevant and important to know, and I thought the seminar style, essay prompts, and readings were important to have.",
                "Yes I would! Professor Herring is fantastic and the course material was riveting, even for someone fairly new to WGSS and queer theory. The eclectic mix of mediums (we studied fictional films, documentaries, brochures, poetry anthologies, graphic novels, books) made the class exciting at all times. Probably my favorite class at Yale thus far.",
                "Yes!! I would highly recommend!! This is a WGSS course that does not assume that you have an extensive background in queer theory or that you've read Foucault. I haven't seen a similar course at Yale before, and I think everyone could benefit from learning more about queer age studies. Readings are accessible. This would be fine to take as a fifth class and credit/d. The final paper gives you a lot of freedom to explore a cultural object of your choosing, and Professor Herring provides resources on paper writing and also how to access archives. We also got to meet some of the people involved in the works that we studied which was super cool.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! One of the best courses I've taken at college.",
