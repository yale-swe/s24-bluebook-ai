We covered a lot of material, the vast majority of which was totally unfamiliar to me beforehand!",

                "bioanthro is a vast interdisciplinary field. i learned a lot about how we contextualize human history and the implications that has for the modern world",
                "I learned so so much in this course. It is a fascinating class that helps you better understand how humans came to be and the environmental and evolutionary forces that shaped our development. This frames the way you'll live and think about the modern world, too. It is super interesting content to discuss with family and friends. In terms of skills, my study skills definitely improved as well as ability to evaluate scientific theories and their strength.",
                "A solid overview of how modern humans have come to be what we are, all the way from our primate ancestors till today. A good amount of technical content but also intermixed with the social context which anthropology operates in. I now view human variation and anthropology in a different light.",
                "I learned so much about biological anthropology, a field that I knew very little about previously. This included so much about primates, human evolution, etc.",
                "I developed an in depth understanding of biological anthropology, ranging from the origins of primates, to the modern history the cultural impacts on human biology. I also strengthened my ability to skim articles to take away the most important arguments\/findings and present them to other students.",
                "I learned about the adaptations, biological evolution, and biocultural relationships of the human species. In particular, we studied the evolution of hominins, primates (their behavior, ecology, adaptations, etc.), population biology, fossil evidence (of primates, hominins, how they can be used to reconstruct past environments, etc.), life history traits, what makes humans unique, and how biological anthropology can be applied in the real world.",
                "So much! all the material was very engaging. I loved the textbook and looked forward to reading it. I didn't do much of the additional readings and it didn't feel as though evaluative work [quizzes] in the class reinforced the fact that you should be doing those additional readings.",
                "Best anthro class out there!",

                "I gained so much knowledge Im not sure I could put it into words - I learned all about the evolution between non-human primates leading up to modern humans which Ive always wanted to learn for years now, I learned about genetics, life history models, biological anthropology careers, etc. It was an exciting class for sure.",
                "Amazing perspective of human existence and human origins. That combined with a comprehensive history of the field, its goals, and what work is still to be done in biological anthropology. A wide variety of what the field entails and a great introduction to the fascinating aspects of biological anthropology.",
                "I learned a lot about the origins of humanity, which was a really fascinating way of contextualizing human life.",
                "I have never learned science so relevant to my life.",
                "Primary areas of study in this class include the scientific method, evolutionary thinking, primates, the fossil record (how scientists study fossils, especially biologically), life history theory, early hominims, early homo, neaderthals, the neolithic revolution, diets of early humans, and bioarchaeology. I was looking for a science credit where I'd learn some interesting things about evolution, which I did, but of course there were some more obscure units (get ready to learn a lot about monkeys and skulls). Prof. Thompson does a good job of integrating science-minded skills such as analyzing journal articles, too. This is probably one of the more useful science credits, though again I'll stress there were some less-than-useful units, too..",
                "I learned about the origins of hominins going back to the very emergence of primates. I also learned about the importance of fossil\/preserved ancient evidence in understanding culture\/behavior . What I appreciated most about the course was the fact that the professor stressed the interdependence of environment and behavior, and how they can both influence one another. I feel like I gained tools that I will use far into the future.",

                "Learned about the evolution of humans throughout time, and our relationships to our environments and ancestors. We've also learned what made us the way we are today. Lots of practice looking at bones, reading academic texts, and discussions.",

                "The weekly\/biweekly exams were nice because it kept us caught up with material,  but it was definitely a key stressor for me during this semester. Sometimes it felt like the questions were really specific and only because the professor was more focused on trying to keep us from cheating rather than helping us review material. \r\nI did appreciate the extra credit assignments, and her attempts to keep the lectures engaging.",
                "The course was very organized and stuck to the syllabus. It was easy to find various resources on Canvas. The material was interesting. It is a fast paced course.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more preparation for each lab, since every time my group mates and I felt a bit lost.",
                "good prof, small amount of time on quizzes felt bad but she dropped some. section was boring because it's meant to be in person, nothing the prof could do about that",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and Professor Thompson is really great. The information is often changing rapidly due to advancements in the field, and Professor Thompson keeps up with it.",
                "I thought Professor Thompson was fantastic. 75 minute lectures are just tough over Zoom, so I definitely found myself getting a little distracted around the 50-60 minute mark, but I really enjoyed Professor Thompson's lecture style and learned a ton.",
                "Weakness - I understood everything until we learnt about the different species of humans that evolved before Homo sapiens. The information given was very back and forth and jumping between species, dates and locations. It was very hard to keep track of exactly what has been discovered and what it has taught us about humans.",
                "I thought this class was very engaging and the lectures were very clear. The study guides were incredibly helpful in organizing the content and preparing for quizzes. I appreciated the format of the quizzes and thought they were a helpful and manageable means of checking my knowledge.",
                "strengths - prof thompson! victoria the TF. actually all the tfs were pretty great. the content is also really interesting \r\nweaknesses - quizzes were just... a tad too short imo",
                "One weakness is that the lab section assignments were not well modified to the online format. It didn't make sense to continue to require students to complete labs when it is so much harder to make observations \/ answer questions correctly from just using online pictures.",
                "I think the content is super interesting, the teacher\/TFs are really knowledgeable, and the structure of not putting too much emphasis on the final was useful. I did find the sections assignments in addition to weekly reading and almost weekly quizzes a bit overloaded for an intro class. I think perhaps sections should be designed to really be finished in that time span, and I felt that review questions should be posted earlier to give students more time to review. I know the logic was to not have students \"rely\" on them, but given how much content was covered in one quiz, it felt like otherwise I wouldn't no where to start in terms of reviewing, so it seems really fair for students to have that as a guide to start out. It also seemed unfair that the weekends of faculty\/TF were emphasized when students certainly don't have weekends and many exams were scheduled on Mondays - their was a disconnect in student support here.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thompson is wonderful at explaining concepts, and this is very engaging and interesting material to learn. Material is presented in an easily digestible way. Short exams are easy but time limit might be rough. Sections are also easy to score in. I really like the way the course is formatted, with the short exams requiring constant work, a little at a time, which greatly relieves the pressure from the end-of-semester hectic period. Prof Thompson is very detailed, meticulous and approachable. She responds to questions quickly and holistically, and the course logistics are very clear and well-organized. Don't be intimidated by the many items on the syllabus! They are all quite manageable.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses! Maybe just that the time limit during exams can be increased to reduce the pressure. Oh and also, for sections, the expectations aren't quite clear sometimes. Section TFs should give more guidance in terms of what answers are expected.",
                "I think that the structure of the class is really great. With the short exams being not too close together but still pretty often, it is a great guideline to make sure that you understand the concepts that were covered in the past few classes. There was also a ton of opportunity for extra credit, which included actually interesting concepts. Some of the discussion sections were a lab format, and I felt like those were not engaging at all, but I really enjoyed the sections where we could discuss our thoughts and ideas as a group.",
                "This course was excellent. The online format worked well (in person + recorded lectures with presentation notes supplied). Although the small quizzes were at times a bit stressful, I think it was a good format for the course. We covered an amazing range of topics, and I enjoyed them so much I would talk about the class with my family afterwards! I really had a great time.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: great professor, lectures were mostly engaging, manageable workload, study slides posted every week helped prepare for the quizzes \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion section didn't contribute much to the class, we had quizzes sometimes every week which meant a lot of studying",
                "Very well adjusted to COVID\/online learning + empathetic towards peoples' individual situations. \r\nThe sections were engaging. So were the guest lecturers",
                "I loved the lectures, but sections were a bit tedious",
                "Strengths: The professor made it extremely clear what you had to know for the short exams and the labs\/discussion sections were not too much work (usually)\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough time given to take the short exams, as even 3 more minutes would allow time to think and not just purge information as quickly as possible",
                "The discussion sections for this course were slightly more difficult because in the Zoom format, we couldnt physically touch the skulls that we were studying. It made it really difficult to visualise the concepts.",
                "Clear exam questions and grading schema. Professor Thompson is extremely knowledgeable and can talk at length and depth about the subject.",
                "The course is very clearly organized, which is a large help. The structure of a test on every 2-3 lectures seems like it would be bad, but is actually supremely useful in learning the material and in making no one test too overwhelming a great innovation. \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by cutting the first few lectures on genetics honestly, they were by far the least interesting and most difficult to grasp of the whole course, and I feel like I could have learned the very much more interesting later material in the course basically equally efficiently without having the first few lectures as part of the syllabus.",
                "Loved the way the work was formatted, ensured you kept up with the material without high stress.",
                "Strengths: Easy to get an A if you put in the work, the second half of the course is fascinating \r\nWeaknesses: You have to put in a lot of busywork to get an A (i did roughly 95 hours of HW\/studying), the first half's content is quite boring",
                "The content of this course was rich and Dr. Thompson is not only a leader in her field, but a wonderful lecturer. Every class was really well structured. My only complaint would be the time limits on the quizzes. Even when I was fully confident in the material, I felt rushed. That said, the flexibility of Dr. Thompson and the TA's was wonderful.",
                "The strengths of the class include that the lectures were arranged very well chronologically, they were taught in a way that really no background knowledge of anything was required which was really nice as it made learning less stressful and more inviting, and there was plenty of time allotted for questions during lectures which made the learning environment very welcoming.",
                "Fantastic lectures. Professor Thompson is a wonderful presenter and always is on top of her game. Explains information well and in an understandable way.",
                "I think the short quizzes could be longer. Sometimes it felt like a test of speed rather than knowledge.",
                "It's all great. If you're interested in human evolution, take this class.",
                "9 exams can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it. It's less studying per exam, but probably more studying if you add it all up than if there were 3 exams. I'm conflicted about whether I liked this structure or not  I do feel it was a ton of work, though not unmanageable, and it did help me stay on top of the material. Strengths: Tons of opportunities for extra credit, fair (generous) grading, Prof. Thompson clearly tries very hard to make lecture interesting. The professor often relates the course to current-day news stories. I liked that there were opportunities to drop our lowest two sections and lowest exam grade. Weaknesses: Some of the lab assignments were a bit disorganized\/poorly constructed. The skull one was very difficult as none of my group understood what the diagrams meant (this might be a product of online learning)..",
                "The labs were not too difficult and really allowed me to solidify the knowledge of the material we had learned in class, however the discussion sections could be a little dry.",
                "Strength: fun to learn, interactive lecture, interesting topics (included social and culture parts too)",
                "I thought that it moved very fast, however i think that is just due to the extent of material that we needed to cover. However, lectures were fairly engaging, and the discussion sections supplemented the lecture material very well.",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely it's pacing and the quality of the lecturing. I really felt like I understood the fundamental concepts and that my understanding deepened\/broadened which helped me make meaningful connections when learning new things. I think that the section assignments weren't always organized in a way that were benefited by group collaboration though which could be improved by changing some of the activities. One of the strengths (that I hope will be continued after the pandemic, in-person) was that the exams were open note and open book, so the class felt more like it was about making important connections between material instead of just memorizing facts.",
                "I found the course utterly fascinating--I learned so much concrete knowledge that I could share and take out into the world, so thank you! I appreciated the quizzes as a way to take pressure off of the final, but I felt that some of the section assignments were a bit lengthy to add on top of that workload.",
                "I thought that the lectures were a bit long and they covered a lot of content. However, a strength of this course is that the lectures are very comprehensive and the readings complement them nicely."

                "The online quizzes were sometimes very time pressured",
                "The lab sections that required observing fossils should have been replaced with something else since we were unable to physically see\/hold the fossils.",
                "The format worked pretty well! I was engaged in section and I preferred the switch at the beginning to live virtual lectures. The only thing for improvement was that the number of assessments and other assignments, by the end of the semester, felt a little tone deaf for a COVID year, in which many students were very mentally fatigued by that point. I do think this was addressed and rectified in advance of the final which I am very appreciative of.",
                "Professor Thompson was very accommodating to students from different timezones, which I sincerely appreciate! For example, allowing us to take the exam at alternative times and recording her lectures.",
                "At the beginning, the lecture was formatted as pre-recorded lectures followed by a q&a during the class time. I did not like this format, but after just 2 classes, it switched to a normal lecture format, which I think worked really well.",
                "The combination of in person zoom lectures\/discussion sections, recorded lectures, and lecture notes in Canvas made COVID-19 learning much easier. Additionally, office hours were a helpful resource.",
                "-the breakout rooms that we did at first weren't the greatest, but breakout rooms for section were fairly successful. \r\n-the weekly quizzes, although they were open note, or perhaps because they were open note, were so frequent that I think it precluded true absorption of class materials.",
                "The virtual lectures were very clear and useful",
                "I liked the virtual lecture with section set-up. Also, the canvas quizzes for tests worked out fine. \r\n\r\nSection was good for encouraging engagement.",
                "Appreciated the recorded lectures and open book exams, but labs were translated poorly into virtual sphere. Not sure how this could be improved, maybe the labs should have been in person (if other courses had in-person labs, biological anthropology labs should not have been virtual).",
                "The online lecture was fantastic and I appreciate the fact that it was recorded. I have no complaints about how the course adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "I think all the online teaching actually went very smoothly.",
                "I think the sections could be improved. A lot of what we were working on seemed disconnected from course topics, and the online labs had no where close to the same effect as they would in person. Overall, I think section and class would have benefited from more discussion. Also, I felt the time given for the quizzes was too short. Every time was a race to the finish, and instead of thinking carefully about each question I felt extremely rushed.",
                "I liked the guest zoom lectures a lot and found them especially engaging. Sections weren't very discussion based which made it hard to stay engaged sometimes.",
                "The only feedback I have is that I really appreciated how the lectures were recorded every time.",
                "Although classes will most likely not be recorded in the future, it was incredibly helpful for me to watch the lecture more than once, especially because we covered a large amount of material.",
                "I thought this class functioned just fine in online format, the only thing that really suffered were the labs and I can't think of any way those could really be improved.",
                "The recording of the live lecture for us to reference later was tremendously helpful!! As someone doing remote learning, knowing that I can always check on canvas for the recording in the event of my internet cutting out or to look through as extra study material helped my learning tremendously. I hope that it's something that can be carried on in future sessions of the class!",
                "I thought that Professor Thompson did a great job in the virtual lecture format. One part of this class that I am sad I missed out on is the in person lab portion of the class."

                "Yes. It is a good class, and Dr. Thompson's lectures, along with the reading, has the potential to deepen a student's understanding of human life.",
                "Not really, especially not during a pandemic.",
                "This course was very interesting and I enjoyed Professor Thompson's teaching.",
                "you'll at least get an -A, harder to get an A tho so maybe not a gut",
                "Yes! It's a great survey course. If you want to use it as a science credit, take into account that the class moves *extremely* fast and the weekly quizzes can really get you if you aren't keeping up with the material. That being said, if you do go to and pay attention in lectures and study intently the night before, it should be fine. Dr. Thompson is a wonderful lecturer and is genuinely interested in the material, and it shows, which makes the lectures much better. She is also really approachable and actually wants to help you. I looked forward to the class.",
                "I thought that Professor Thompson was great, and I learned a ton in this class. That said, I was a little underwhelmed by the level of participation\/engagement from the class itself. I know that a lot of people were taking this to fill a science requirement, but I hadn't quite prepared myself for the feel of sitting in a Zoom lecture and having all of the questions in the chat be about nitty-gritty, grade-related questions instead of the content. I don't think this was a Professor Thompson issue in any way, but it was definitely kind of discouraging that so many of questions that people asked were about course grading policies and whether or not certain material would appear on the next quiz. So it's a good class, and you will learn a lot, but if you're looking for the feeling of \"wow everyone around me loves this material so much,\" I might look elsewhere. I really liked the constant drumbeat of very small assignments; it felt manageable and like the workload was evenly spread over the course of the semester.",
                "The course has a lot of work on a weekly basis with 2 live lectures and a discussion section which had an assignment every week. Although the work insist always hard, having to revise for a quiz every week can be a bit much especially when some lectures had a lot more information than others. The information given is very scattered and mixed up so you need to spend a lot of extra time assessing the evidence and deciding where it fits.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a science credit that is not confident in their abilities in science classes. Professor Thompson and the TFs were very supportive, the content was interesting and relevant and provided intellectual challenge without being overwhelming, and I had fun doing the labs in section.",
                "sure! it's a good science credit. not a gut by any means, but it's not impossible to do well. if anything you just learn a lot about your self as a small piece of a greater puzzle or story. it was really fun",
                "Definitely! It really is a fascinating field of knowledge and you will learn a-lot. It also isn't super high pressure.",
                "Absolutely! Must-take for all students. The material concerns our very selves - human beings - and how we came to be what we are today. The material is inherently very interesting and very relevant knowledge to anyone. This is honestly a manageable science credit, and suits a lot of people, regardless of whether you are quantitatively inclined or not. Grading is fair and you should be able to get an A if you attend lectures and study before the exams. There is no curve and the expectations for an A is clearly stated. There is also extra credit (3 assignments) that you can work on to boost your grade, and they can be very helpful to take off stress from the final. Highly recommend!",
                "I would! As someone who is not great at anything biology related, I found this class to be not super difficult, but still a little challenging. This pushed me to actually focus and learn a lot of the concepts, which were actually quite interesting!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Science majors would enjoy this course a lot, since it is at heart a type of science course. However, non-science majors would enjoy this course equally because the basics of the science are covered at the beginning, and the rest of the course is a long narrative of how humans emerged! Near the end of the course, we talk more about cultural impacts on health, biology, etc., which I personally thought was a fascinating topic, and think would be enjoyable for all audiences. Additionally, the course was conscious of some of the dark history of anthropology (e.g. using limit skeletal evidence to classify people into \"races\", which are in fact just a social construct, and using that as an excuse for abuse, racism, and other injustices), and explained how biological anthropology today is trying to repair that damage. Thus, the course is informative and socially aware at the same time, which I think is great.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in the subject. I'm a humanities major and took this class for a science credit and honestly don't regret it. The class is mostly interesting (I especially liked when we discussed the evolution of hominins) and the workload is light. Although there are many quizzes, they are easy if you study the guided study questions professor posts on Canvas. Overall, it's easy to get a good grade in the class and the subject is engaging.",
                "Yeah, I would recommend the online version of this course to a student. I can't imagine taking quizzes as frequently in person and without my notes. That really felt like a lot.",
                "Yes! The best science credit! Requires some work, but as a global affairs (so not stem) major I found it super interesting",
                "Yes! This is a great course to take no matter your major, especially if you're looking to fulfill your SC requirement. The course is a lot of work, but the material is interesting.",
                "Definitely!! Its very interesting and you learn a real breadth of knowledge from genetics to evolution to forensic anthropology!",
                "For those who need a sc credit and are also willing to put in the work. Not an easy class for those who want to get a good grade but it most definitely rewards students for their effort.",
                "Definitely. Prof. Thompson is soooo fair and a really good lecturer. This is by far the fairest grading scheme of a class Ive taken at Yale.",
                "I took the course for a science credit, and it was a very good way to accomplish that goal. It was by and large an interesting course, but importantly it was one that was very well organized to get a student a science credit without getting a bad grade. it is NOT a gut you certainly will need to work, but the many small test setup means you can be sure of getting the grade that the amount of work you put in deserves. A very fair course, and a good choice for anyone looking for a SCI credit with even a passing interest in Anthropology.",
                "Yes! Great science course",
                "Yes, for the science credit. It takes a fair amount of effort (roughly 7 hrs per week), but if you do this you will certainly get an A. Can't say the same for many other science courses. First half is basically a repeat of 9th grade biology which is rather dull, but after the midterm the content becomes super interesting and engaging.",
                "I would--especially to those not in a STEM field. As a humanities major, the course pushed me to work hard, but was not too advanced to stay on track.",
                "yes",
                "Very solid course, especially if you're looking to fulfill a science credit. It isn't the easiest class, but the study slides and the various assignments throughout the semester are very helpful - it's easy to do well by just doing the assignments and studying for the short exams. Very interesting material as well, and is constantly updated as new articles and ideas come out.",
                "Most definitely. The sections were done in groups which provided nice collaboration, there werent any super confusing concepts, and the material was diverse enough to stay interesting, but not so all over the place that it was difficult to study. There were also guiding questions for the tests which were immensely helpful.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn about deep history of why you exist today, and what humans really are as a species, take this class.",
                "I think so, but it's hard to say based on a zoom class.",
                "This course blew me away. It is the science and history of humans on a huge timescale. You learn all about how we evolved, discussing the biology (and culture, as it develops!) of all the major groups. There are monkeys! Apes! Lucy! Hominins! Early us! Modern us! And lots of fun cousins along the way. The class told the story of humans in a way I had never heard before, from around 65 million years ago when our ancestors were tree shrew-like mammals all the way to today.\r\n\r\nThis course is amazing because Dr. Thompson is amazing. Her excitement is infectious. She uses her research and fieldwork experience to enhance her teaching. She is constantly finding new ways to show the relevance of the content. She is clear when she teaches and clear about course expectations. Her policies are always fair and she adapts well to any feedback. I would especially like to highlight the fact that biological anthropology has a bit of a shady history when it comes to racism-enforcing ideas presented as science, but Dr. Thompson did not gloss over this history and tackled it head on. I deeply respect the way she equipped us to think critically about ideas of race and their relationship to science, and I deeply respect her commitment to do so. This is one of the many examples of Dr. Thompson's unique ability to connect the dots and get you to see how what you're learning is important to our lives today.\r\n\r\nThat's why I liked this course so much: it was always meaningful to me. All semester I have talked to everyone I know about the latest thing we learned in biological anthropology. It's so many different topics and time periods and places, with information coming from so many sources -- archaeology, genetics, observations of chimpanzees -- but Dr. Thompson brought it all together into a coherent picture that made me think in new ways about my life and our collective life as a species.",
                "For a science credit, yes. This course has a lot going for it: the professor is very organized (no surprises, the exam difficulty is very consistent, etc.) and the content is pretty interesting. However I want to make clear that it is NOT a GUT. The content is easy to follow and an A is not that hard to attain, considering there is a ton of extra credit available, BUT this course is just a LOT of work. Nine exams, which you do need to study quite a bit for to do well (I studied for about 4-6 hours for each), really adds up, especially if you have other courses to work on. Also, the labs were not always very fun and took a lot of time (especially some of the biology labs). So with that said, this is NOT a great 5th or 6th class. BUT for someone who wants an interesting, not-impossible science credit, of all the options, this is probably the best one. I shopped this class, ornithology, history of life, and immunology, and I am glad I took this class above the others this semester (although I plan to take Ornithology next year). Take this class with Victoria as your TA if you can!",
                "Yes! I think it was a wonderful way to get a science credit, and it also taught me that I find primates fascinating!",
                "Yes, if you are interested about evolution of humans and are willing to put in the work for the sections which are like labs.",
                "I would completely recommend this course!  Everything we learned was super interesting and relevant to our knowledge about modern humanity and human health. From learning to Neanderthal matings with humans to why skin colour varies in gradients across the globe to the biological roots of the bigfoot myth to why humans are the only species in our genus to whether the paleo diet actually has any valid biological footing, this course has definitely been one of my favorites this semester! I have enjoyed it so so much and talk about what I've learned all the time in regular conversations with friends and family. Definitely take this course!! Not to mention its a pretty chill science credit! There are also loads of great extra credit opportunities to boost your grade.",
                "I would recommend this course because the material is extremely interesting. There is a decent amount of work that you have to put in, but as long as you pay attention during lectures, and do the work then you're gonna do fine in this class.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! It made me think about human history a lot differently and gave me a new lens to consider the world as I continue on. I think this class was a really good blend between the social and biological sciences.",
                "Absolutely fascinating course, will give you so much appreciation for our incredible species!",
                "Yes. It provides a great foundation to the study of biological anthropology.",
