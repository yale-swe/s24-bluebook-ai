                "This course is an excellent survey of African history from the late 19th century to the late 20th century. I felt that there was excellent balance between breadth and depth, and I came away with a solid understanding of the histories of colonization, independence, and the formation of modern African states. I really enjoyed the assignment structure of the course, with one short primary source analysis paper, one medium-length paper analyzing a literary work through a historical lens, and the long final paper, which was the product of longer-term research over the course of the semester. I found that my research and historical writing skills improved significantly as a result of this class, and the course readings were excellent. My TA Bayan was also INCREDIBLE-- I learned a ton in section as well. Overall, this is probably the best course I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "learned about African colonization, decolonization, and the development of postcolonial states.",
                "A general understanding of colonial and post-colonial African history.",
                "I learned how to differentiate the imperial systems implemented by Britain, France, Portugal, and Belgium, and how to trace the remnants of colonial systems to modern conflicts in Africa. Some main themes were the single-party gatekeeper state, the invention of traditions, the effects of tribalism, and African socialism versus capitalism.",
                "In this class, I learned about the state of Africa pre, during, and post independence.",
                "Global understanding of African politics throughout the 20th Century. Time did not allow for anything other than a superficial overview of the continent since the late 19th Century. The most valuable part for me was the exposition to theoretical frameworks for the study of Africa",
                "I learned about European colonial administration, especially in British and French Africa; the formation of \"tribal\" identity; the rise of development ideology after World War II; nationalist movements leading to decolonization; economic growth and stagnation after independence; the idea of African states acting as \"gatekeepers\" between their residents and the outside world; IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs during the 1980s debt crisis; and the slow post-independence democratization.",
                "This class gave me a general overview of colonization, decolonization, and the post-independence period in Africa. As a first-year I also found the discussion section to be a new challenge, in terms of the ability to synthesize and critically examine the readings, but that was probably because that kind of college discussion environment was new to me more than anything else.",
                "Overall trajectory of Africa as a continent and its evolving relationship with colonial\/Western powers",
                "I learned about the different colonial structures that each imperial power (Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, etc.) implemented in their African colonies, and how that impacted how African liberationists and political leaders both understood themselves as Africans and conceptualized the idea of nation-building. I also learned about both socialist and capitalist African societies and how they both struggled with debt from the 1970s oil crisis and eventually had to seek aid from IWF and World Bank.",
                "I gained extensive knowledge of post-colonial African history and gained the ability to look at colonial and post-colonial histories through multiple lenses.",
                "I learned how to evaluate primary sources so as to illuminate economic trends in history.",
                "Learned a lot about post colonial African history. Scope was broad but covered important and interesting themes.",
                "I learned to think critically about Africa during the 20th century, whether on a regional or global scale. This was one of the most effective history classes I have taken because it was a great balance between lecture (explanations and time for questions) and section (thinking critically and doing actual group activities).",
                "I learned so much about the complexity of narratives surrounding African independence.",
                "Broad understanding of nationalist and decolonization movements in Africa.",
                "I learned about African history, something I knew close to nothing about before coming to Yale. I learned about the prevalence of colonialism throughout the past and the prevalence of its legacy today. This class really helped me understand how Africa got to where it is today. I guess that's all I could ask for.",
                "Definitely learned so much more about African Nationalism and independence movements and how they were impacted by the specific European countries that colonized each region.",
                "Broad overview of colonial+post colonial African history, with insight into historiography and wider narratives about the continent",
                "I gained insights into African History, specifically colonialism and independence.",
                "I became better at conducting research using readings and connecting historical ideas and issues across countries, especially looking at trends in politics and economics. It was very informative, and even though it attempted to cover an entire continent, mostly comprehensive. I learned a lot about Africa, revolutions, and colonialism, and I feel like I can apply many of the ideas I picked up to other places I will study in the future.",
                "This course gave me a broad overview level understanding of African colonial and postcolonial history. Rather than focusing on any specific countries, it focused on themes, which I really appreciated. We also examined primary sources weekly and learned how to use those to inform our understanding.",
                "Understanding of the historical context behind Africa's current situation, realizing that Africa's struggles since independence have been caused or influenced in many ways by colonialism",
                "This class provides a general overview of African independence movements and the history of colonialism in Africa. The themes that the professor outlines gives a good perspective into the legacies and consequences of both colonialism and independence.",
                "An overview of the main themes politically, economically, and socially on the continent during the pre and post-independence period, with a focus on socialist and capitalist economic development.",
                "I learned about the general history of colonial, pre- and post-colonial Africa, and the factors that contributed to the manifestation of each stage.",
                "I learned about the African independence movement from the years just preceding colonization to the present day.",
                "I developed an understanding of an area of the world that I had not yet learned about in school.",
                "I learned how the different modes of colonialism affected the ways that Africans fought for independence; I learned how newly-independent countries failed and succeeded at obtaining their goals; I learned how neo-colonialism persisted through European risky loans",
                "A high level overview of the history of colonization in Africa. I thought the wide scope of the class would mean I learned little about each countrys history but we spent a significant amount of time diving deep into examples from around continent and learned many generalizable concepts that helped me build a strong framework for viewing this history.",
                "I gained a really solid understanding of the different forces that shaped colonial and post-colonial Africa. It is a survey course, but a really solid onw at that. We took an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the history, which explains a great deal of the current state of affairs in Africa today. I reference knowledge gained from this class very often in casual conversation with friends or family.",
                "My critical reading improved a lot in this course because a lot of the readings were written with European bias that we had to uncover and discuss in sections. Of course my knowledge on modern and colonial African history improved a lot because it was close to zero beforehand."

                "Could be more focused on a more limited time or region",
                "Strengths: Professor Machava is an absolutely incredible lecturer. His lectures are well-organized and captivating, and I felt that I truly *learned* something from every lecture. He challenges his students but also presents information in a digestible way- there were first years along with senior history majors in the course, and I believe that everyone was able to get something from the class. The readings were excellent and assignments were appropriate and not overwhelming, but still challenging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because the course covers such a long time period in such a huge area (the entire continent of Africa) it sometimes felt like we weren't able to get as in-depth in certain areas as I would have liked, but this is inevitable with such a course.",
                "The material was interesting, but I felt as if some aspect of the historical story was missing, something that would bring greater coherence to the course.",
                "Lectures and assignments were strengths. The only real weakness regarded the primary source readings. Next time Prof. Machava teaches this course, I would strongly suggest that he diversify the primary source selections so that the students read more sources written by Africans themselves. Though I understand why he had us read commentary from The Economist, those articles were repetitive and ultimately unhelpful for my learning.",
                "The lectures touched on important themes and clearly communicated their gravity in today's context. I enjoyed the well-facilitated discussion sections, and I also appreciated the feedback and support I received on each of the smaller assignments. The section visit to Beinecke helped me feel more comfortable accessing Yale's archives, but I think there could have been a bit more personalized support between this visit and our primary source interpretation & thematic essay. I also would have appreciated if the lectures had been recorded\/transcribed or if speaker notes\/lecture notes could have been shared with the class. I understand that it was meant to encourage attendance at lectures, but this was not emphasized towards the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths: I found the content was naturally engaging and my section was fabulous; Tony is THE best!!! Weaknesses: I felt the lectures often recapped the readings rather than building on them or adding nuance. Oftentimes I wondered if it was worth it to do the readings and also attend lecture. Additionally, I wish we had picked a couple of countries to use as consistent case studies throughout the course. I am leaving the course having learned many more generalizations than concrete examples\/tangible manifestations of African colonialism.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was the variety and quality of the readings assigned. They were great at complimenting lecture content. A weakness of the course was the fact that the lecture slides were not distributed to the class. Taking notes during lecture was overwhelming and the lecture slides contained dense information and the professor spoke very quickly. My focus during lecture became scrambling to take notes rather than actively listening and absorbing lecture content. Even after hearing these concerns, the professor refused to share the lecture slides. In the future, lecture slides should be distributed to students. Another weakness of the course is the breath of content it attempts to cover. One of the first concepts were are taught in the class is that many scholars in the past have attempted to define Africa as a monolith which is hurtful to the sheer diversity of African countries. However, at times this class seemed to play into this problem. When learning about independence, we very breifly went over different African countries. This caused the lecture content to seem very scattered as we jumped from country to country. To improve this course, greater focus should be placed on the experiences of African countries as they navigated colonialism and independence. Accomplishing this would be difficult in one semester which may speak to how overly broad the topic of this course is.",
                "Strengths: Prof Machava is a really engaging lecturer. He does a great job of explicitly tracing themes throughout history and choosing a reasonable amount of reading. He also chose to give a few days off during the semester to do assignments, which I appreciated. Being encouraged to look at primary sources for papers also taught me a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Machava doesn't post lecture slides, so it's hard if you miss class one day.",
                "The class was definitely a good overview of modern African history, but I was disappointed by how little we delved into specifics. Admittedly this could be difficult with such a large geographical and temporal range, but it felt like I only ever learned a few snatches of any one country's history, which was less engaging than if we had dealt with a few case studies consistently throughout the class. That being said, I really enjoyed the readings and projects. The three main papers of the course were a short primary source paper (which was meant to help us start thinking about the final research paperI found this scaffolding very helpful), a paper connecting the novel A Man of the People by Chinua Achebe to the historical content of the course, and a final research paper. Honestly these were some of my favorite parts of the class, because they allowed me to delve much deeper into the class content. I also really appreciated the discussion section, in which we talked a lot more about the broader social implications of the history we were studying.",
                "This course was simply amazing. I loved the articles and books we read for class, and I also liked the lectures given by Professor Machava and the teaching staff. If I could fix anything about this class, it would be to have the lecture slides available afterwards so that we can review our notes more effectively.",
                "Strengths:  Prof. Machava was awesome and the course is planned out in a very effective manner.  It really comes full circle and honestly felt like one of the better planned courses I've taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Readings can sometimes feel unnecessary but most are pretty interesting.",
                "Strengths: good lecturer, interesting syllabus, hammered home important themes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a bit broad might have benefited from selecting a few countries and following them closely instead of attempting to tackle the whole continent; also would have preferred either a longer paper or a longer exam instead of both",
                "Strength of the course is the structure: it follows a very simple chronological and geographical outline that is made clear to students. The organization of lectures was natural and section (especially section with Bayan!!) complemented this so well. The only possible weakness would be not making the slides or recordings readily available - I personally like to take notes with my own copy of the slides, but this is such a minor complaint. Prof. Machava is amazing!!",
                "The readings are really great. And the assignments are well spread out.",
                "I found this class to be disappointing because it begins with the premise that Africa is often treated as a monolith which disregards its diversity. Yet the entire course does exactly that. We would occasionally focus on an incident from a specific country but I am left with bits and pieces of specificity and a broad idea of what was happening on the continent as a whole. The lectures were also disengaging because they haphazardly went over the same material covered in the readings. Thus it quickly became clear that there was no point in going to class and to instead focus in section.",
                "Strengths: really interesting and taught well. Moved at a good pace. If you space out the reading throughout the week instead of doing it all the day before discussion, you'll be in good shape. \r\nweakness: I can't think of many weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Really engaging lecture with a super focused section. The readings were all so so wonderful!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Excellent survey course looking at colonial Africa and post independence.",
                "The professor is great, and the class is set up to provide a conducive environment for learning.",
                "I think this course was engaging at both the lecture and section level, and there was a good level of continuity when it came to looking at concepts and ideas from one period to the next. Readings were very interesting and helped me better understand material covered during our lectures, although they were sometimes a bit too long. I do wish my section size was bigger, as I think listening to more people discuss readings would have improved my learning. Assignments gave us a good deal of academic freedom, but I do wish we could have received feedback and guidance more quickly.",
                "The content of this course is amazing. I think the syllabus could have been clearer about expectations from the beginning, as it didn't mention that there would be section or reading responses until we were already taking the course.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very insightful; many country-by-country examples were used; a clear progression of history was shown; not too much work - essays were all given ahead of time\r\nWeaknesses: sections could have been more helpful, there could've been more of a focus on Africa today as opposed to a fully past-focused perspective",
                "Strengths: It provided a great overview of a long, complicated, and deeply important aspect of world history.The sections were engaging as well. Weaknesses: The slides for lecture were shown very quickly and were not posted on Canvas.",
                "One weakness of the course was that the lectures were not organized very clearly thematically, so at times it felt difficult to grasp what we were covering in a given week. The course might benefit from using a number of country case studies to guide the course so that students would leave with particular insight into a handful of countries rather than simply a broad understanding of historical trends on the continent.",
                "This course was a great intro to the history of African independence, although I found it rather broad and sometimes too economically-focused. I would have loved to learn more about the material conditions that manifested on the ground at each stage to ground my understanding in the realities of the time. Discussion sections were too short, there was not enough time to discuss the week's readings and material in 50 minutes.",
                "The course was very well organized and focused.",
                "It provided a strong comprehensive overview of Africas colonial and post-colonial history.",
                "Strengths: The professor offered readily understandable information about African history that made it interesting; the lesson slides offered enough info while not overloading me; there were a lot of opportunities to improve my grade; the professors and TAs had genuine care to make the experience enjoyable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the course material did not include the voices of Africans in desribing their own history after independence",
                "The Strengths of the course: Professor Machava is a mesmerizing lecturer who really knows his stuff. The content is fascinating, and class is always interesting. The readings are fun to do, and the evaluations are very fair. The TF team is also SUPER competent, and you can tell that they are super invested in your success in the class and your interest in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved a little more structure and contextualization of the material. Because we were surveying all of Africa I think it would've been helpful to segment the continent into different segments when possible just to ensure we knew which trends applied to what parts o the continent.",
                "The strengths of the course include the reading materials and the lectures. The assignments were a bit weak and I wish there was more direction for the final paper. My one complaint on the content of the course was that too much time was spent on the colonial history of the content in preparation to discuss the independence movements and post-independence history."

                "Yes, if they're especially interested in the topics of the course.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a great introduction to modern African history. Bear in mind that it is a survey course, and it is far from comprehensive. If you're looking for more of a deep-dive into a specific topic or theme in African history, this might not be the class for you. But as a senior History major who knew little about African postcolonial history, I found this course to be rewarding and fascinating. Prof. Machava's lecture style is at once to-the-point and eloquent. The essay assignments were enjoyable. And though it was a survey course with obvious blind-spots and omissions, I learned so much.",

                "I would not necessarily recommend this course. The content is 100% worthwhile, but I think you could simply read Frederick Cooper's \"Africa since 1940\" or conduct some online research on decolonization and leave with the same level of enlightenment.",
                "Yes. Prof Machava knows his stuff so well, and the class makes a really nuanced case for the connections between colonialism and the problems African states faced after independence. It's a great survey class, too, since it covers a lot of countries with a specific theme. Africa as a whole gets very little attention, and learning about the histories of specific nations makes you appreciate the range of experiences in the continent. The workload is fine: readings are manageable, and the two essays in the second half of the semester are 5 and 8-10 pages. Not a gut, but not bad either and really educational.",

I certainly learned things I didn't know beforeit gives more than a high school class' treatment of African colonization and decolonization, and I definitely now think about these subjects in ways I never would have beforebut it didn't involve the kind of depth that I was looking for, instead dealing much more with trends than with particular countries and their histories.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in being involved in African politics, or at the least want to better understand why much of Africa is the way that it is today. This course made me reflect on my upbringing as the child of African immigrants and think about how my parents grew up and were socialized.",
                "Yes--especially if you are interested in African history.  I'd especially recommend it if you're just interested in the subject area and not even a history major.  It's a great class with a great professor.",
                "Yes! Professor Machava's lectures were very engaging and the subject matter is critical to history.",
                "Yes! Interesting and important African history survey course",
                "Yes!!! Take this class and get Bayan as your TF -- the course is low stress, high reward and really the perfect history class. The lectures are easy to follow and casual (Prof. Machava always saves time for questions and ends early if he can rather than just waste your time) and section is actually enjoyable. Everything is literally set up for you to do well and both Prof. Machava and your TF are there for any questions.",
                "Yes",
                "No. Find more specific African history classes.",
                "I would. Through illuminating African history (which involves colonialism and oppression), it helped me view Western powers such as the UK and the United States from an outside perspective.\r\nI feel like a more effective global citizen because of it.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! The class was greatly informative even to students who would not consider themselves \"new\" to African studies or African history.",
                "Yes.",
                "The lectures were engaging, readings (outside of textbook) were interesting, and it covered more material than the usual history lecture course",
                "Yes, it is a great way to learn about Africas colonial history and how it informs the state of affairs today",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, because it was engaging, instructors and TAs were knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, readings were informative, and discussions challenged me and stretched my learning.",
                "YES! I loved this course. Lectures were incredibly engaging, discussions interesting, and I feel like I'm leaving with so much more knowledge than I came into the class with.",
                "Yes, it was a completely new perspective for me - it changed my viewpoints in such great ways",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants a cursory overview of the topic. The lectures were interesting and the sections were engaging with the other students.",
                "I would, although I would encourage students to take other courses in African history at Yale to gain greater in-depth insight about particular countries rather than about Africa as a whole.",
                "I would. The class is very interesting, the material is well taught and all the teaching staff are fantastic at creating an image of the impact European colonization on the African continent.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to someone who doesnt know much about this era and area and wants to learn more.",
                "Yes: great survey course that had a feasible workload but still intellectually interesting",
                "Yes, because it offered a clear understanding of African before, during, and after colonization, allowing all students to know what factors shaped how Africans built their own governments",
                "If you want to learn about recent African history from all angles (US, African, euro colonizer) and would like to build a solid foundation through which you view modern day challenges with neocolonialism on the continent, this class is definitely for you. I enjoyed lectures more than any other class Ive taken and I absolutely find the content useful and insightful.",
                "Yes! Would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested. Prof Machava is great, and the TFs are also just fantastic. Not only is the team top tier, but they're also African themselves and studying different regions of Africa, and that's a rarity at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great history class that touches on a lot of the roots of modern Africa's problems. Prof. Machava is an excellent lecturer and his choice in readings is fantastic."
