I learned how to use the sociological lens to look at so many aspects of modernity including colonialism, economics, capitalism, and even video games. You really have to take the course and read all the readings and participate in all the discussions to understand how insightful this course was. Easily my favorite course this semester.",

                "Just a PERFECT course with a phenomenal instructor",
                "The discussion in this seminar is definitely one of its largest strengthsI came away from each discussion with new connections, and sometimes with my entire worldview changed. It was like getting a pep talk every morning (although some of them made me have existential dread). The blog system is great - the workload is manageable, and you can really get a lot out of the course if you put the effort in. I loved the structure of our discussions and blog posts, however, I think that the reading load is a little much on some weeks especially when you have a lot more going on. It provides a strong foundation for sociology (this was my first sociology class) and almost all of the readings are super interesting (except some very rare ones that are too difficult that I just gave up on them). Maybe for the harder readings (like Derrida), there could be a little blurb before the reading to explain what the main point is, or to guide us into understanding it?",
                "Variety of issues and a holistic approach is a strength. Maybe the lecture element could be a bit longer so that we are all on the same page. \r\nBlog leader is a great idea \r\n\r\nNo feedback on the blog posts is a weakness",
                "The readings in this class are excellent, and the course covers a wide variety of sociological theories beyond the classics read in most sociological theory courses.",
                "This course is very open-ended which leads to a lot of spontaneous discoveries in class discussions and in weekly blog posts. The entire class is essentially one big discussion section and you get to know the opinions of your classmates well. The course is really structured in a way where you get out what you put into it. A couple weaknesses were that some of the readings were very dense and that we didn't talk specifically about the readings as much as we could have. I would have appreciated a quick lecture\/powerpoint at the beginning of class to review the readings and the lead blog post so that the core ideas of the readings can stick in the minds of students."

Professor Adams is also awesome. She's intelligent, great at facilitating conversation, and super understanding if any personal issues arise during the semester.",
                "Yes absolutely! This is my favourite class this semester. Course readings are very interesting and class discussions are very enlightening. The use of blog posting really helped me organize the materials and participate in discussions with my peers.",
                "YESSS!! TAKE IT! Prof. Adams is amazing, kind, and brilliant.",
                "I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this class! It is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Julia Adams is amazing. She is so sweet, intelligent, and kind, and conducts the class in a very organized and thought-provoking way. In short, the class creates an amazing and welcoming intellectual environment, and you will learn so so much! This is a great introduction to sociology that would make you want to be a sociology major. As an Ethics Politics and Economics major, I feel like the course took a very different lens to look at very familiar topics that make it very unique. I really enjoyed this course, as it is not too theory-heavy and focuses more on the furthest \"imaginatons\" of modernity through some of the most influential sociologists of the past and present.",
                "Yes. It was deeply intriguing and fascinating.",
                "I recommend this class if you havent had much experience reading about sociological issues. Personally I felt like we were given interesting readings, but Professor Adams didnt take enough reign in the discussion to make them relevant to the readings. A lot of times the class just went off on a tangent, and it didnt reach the level of intellectual rigor that the readings deserved imo. But Adams is one of the sweetest professors youll ever encounter!",
                "Yes, for people interested in holistic approaches to analysing society, recent history and complex social processes",

                "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in modernity and social thought and is willing to put time into this course. The course is really what you make of it and you have a lot of leeway to engage with the material in different ways."
