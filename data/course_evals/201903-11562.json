    "Thermodynamics from the ground up and stat mech.",
    "Very thorough understanding of where thermodynamic laws come from.",
    "I learned a ton of stuff in this course. Thermodynamics. Statistical mechanics. The whole thing. We went through a graduate-level textbook in one semester.",
    "This class is a whirlwind through all of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. We covered almost every chapter (except chapters 11-13) in Callen's \"Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics\" as well as every chapter in Schoeder's \"Introduction to Thermal Physics\". This is the class I have learned the most material from, period. This class works from the postulates of thermodynamics to derive critical classical thermodynamic results such as Euler relations, Gibbs-Duhem relations, first and second order phase transitions, stability criteria, and fundamental relations for ideal and van der Waals gasses. There is a brief foray into nonequilibrium thermodynamics.  After the first half of the course (~6 or 7 psets) the focus switches to statistical mechanics where you cover the main results of classical stat mech such as the canonical, microcanonical, and grand canonical ensembles followed by a discussion of quantum statistical mechanics.",
    "Everything you never wanted to know about thermo and stat mech - this course is as thorough as they come for a first semester undergraduate course. Basically 90% of the Callen and Schroeder textbooks is covered. If you like pain, then go for it.",
    "This class made me learn more about problem solving than any other I've taken so far. At first, I approached this class by brute force, and later found that this was not working for me. This class helped me learn how to get the most out of a class, and how to approach problems in a more organized way that really helped build my confidence with problem solving.",
    "an understanding of the foundations and possible applications of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics",
    "A fairly complete understanding of Thermodynamics and Statistical mechanics. The fast pace of the course makes me unsure of how deep my understanding is.",
    "I learned a lot about the general rules and methods of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and how to apply them to different situations.",
    "A general understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The course moves quickly and covers the major topics of these fields.",
    "Rigorous treatment of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics",
    "I learned thermodynamics and statistical physics for both classical and quantum systems.",
    "A thorough introduction to thermodynamics and statistical dynamics. Thermo is developed independently in the first half of the course (applicable even outside of physics) and without needing statistical mechanics before diving into statmech during the second half. The syllabus\/schedule generally followed the order of Callen.",
    "Knowledge of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ability to work long questions under stress. Resilience to do super long homework sets every week.",
    "This class brought together basically all the material that we had learned up to this point in the physics major, drawing on classical mechanics and quantum mechanics to derive really interesting and relevant macroscopic results. Lectures were fairly theory-focused, which helped emphasize the broad applicability of a few simple postulates."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There's a lot of very different content. I can't really give any better way to fit so much content into one semester instead of splitting it into (Thermodynamics) and (Statistical Mechanics).",
    "Good: very well organized course, engaging lectures with helpful writing on the blackboard, professor very engaged with class and available for meetings.\r\n\r\nBad: Way too much material for a single semester course. I also think that answers to psets should be posted online, and the midterm released to students (I have never heard of anyone passing exam questions to students in a later semester in any of my courses I have taken at Yale). I completed some pset problems (involving very complicated math) that left me feeling like I did not have a better understanding of the course material.",
    "The class is as much work as any other at this university, no doubt in my mind. The problem sets are insanely long (due on Wednesdays; there was a stretch of 5 or 6 straight weeks when I didn't go to bed before 2 am).\r\n\r\nNir is the man and class is interesting but having it at 9 am the morning after staying up to do the problem set was absolutely brutal.\r\n\r\nThe class is very tough, but very rewarding. The topics were some of my favorite that I've run into in college physics, but there's just too much material for one semester. Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics should be a year-long sequence.",
    "The material in this class is presented in the best order it possibly could be presented in. Professor Navon sorts out the jumbled approaches of most textbooks and teaches the material in the most logical order: he starts with the postulates of thermodynamics and derives all of thermo in order to motivate the need for statistical mechanics. The downside to this method is that the material feels extremely rushed: key results and insights into the material are relegated to the problem sets. This course is ripe for an overhaul by either covering less material or, ideally, splitting the course up into a two-semester sequence ala the quantum mechanics sequence.",
    "This course covers a ton of material, which is great. However, the amount of work is simply not reasonable to ask of students. Especially if the students are not Physics majors, it is a pretty extreme amount of work.",
    "Strengths - great material, good teaching\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I feel like the course actually covers a bit too much material.... I think it would be better to teach less on the quantum stat mech side of things in order to really focus more on some of the thermo concepts useful to engineering like cycles in PV and TS space. I also think that the course just felt a little crowded and it's not necessary to do it all - quality over quantity. If the students want to read the latter chapters of the textbooks then that's their imperative.",
    "This class is one of the most interesting ones I've taken at Yale, and the best one in the physics major so far. The content is beautiful, the lectures are very well taught. The workload is extremely high and the subject matter is inherently very difficult. That being said, there are a lot of resources to help you get through, and the most important thing is that you learn something, not that you get a grade as high as usual.",
    "The course had an unusually heavy workload that sometimes made spending time understanding the material less feasible, but generally the homework problems themselves very helpful. It would have been good to cut out the ones that were just long algebraic practice",
    "This course attempts to fit in a very large amount of content into one semester, everything felt rushed. The professor does really care about the class and the students, which is refreshing to see in a Yale STEM class. The TF support was lacking. I would have appreciate more collaborative problem solving sessions (lecture style) as opposed to one on one help in office hours. Lack of practice material for exams was frustrating.",
    "The course covers a lot of material. I think it might be as good as it can be, but it probably covers too much for just 1 semester\/credit. The problem sets were very long and a lot of material wasn't covered in lecture, only on problem sets.",
    "It would have been great to have problem set solutions posted or coherent corrections made, but otherwise this course had engaging, understandable lectures and problem sets that really helped to reinforce material",
    "There could be much better feedback.",
    "Strengths: Prof Navon is a great lecturer, and I never left class confused. He takes great care to craft a wonderful course, with thoughtful problem sets.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The problems sets take 15-20hours",
    "This was easily the most comprehensive course in the Physics major. The Problem Sets were generally a good mix of abstract and more concrete problems.",
    "Professor Navon is a good lecturer. The problem sets are long, but mostly reinforce the concepts and are usually interesting, so I didnt mind. In terms of weaknesses, this course covers so much content that it probably should be two separate courses.",
    "Its interesting but we cover way too many topics.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Navon is a fantastic lecturer and really does care about teaching. I rarely left a class confused** -- he was always clear and made sure the explain things. The homeworks were also excellent and really helped to understand the material. The midterm reviews were helpful as were Nir's review sessions. \r\n\r\nI will say though that the homeworks were sometimes a bit long -- I entirely understand why they had to be, and I am glad for they helped my understanding immensely. Still, for a physics major with 1-3 other physics\/math classes simultaneously, it could sometimes feel a lot (or difficult to devote enough time). \r\n\r\nLastly -- the final topics (on Bose and Fermi gases) were slightly rushed, I felt. I know the semester was already tight, but we should have spent more time on them, especially since they are so crucial to further study in physics (perhaps even the most important takeaway of this class). They are also conceptually difficult so going slowly there would have helped. \r\n\r\nOn that note of being rushed, some of the more big picture things (connection between thermo and stat mech) only really came at the review session the night before the final. So having a bit more emphasis on that would have been nice. If only there were some way to have more time in the semester to fit in things like that. \r\n\r\nAll that criticism aside, however, the class was wonderful and I do feel like I learned a lot (even if my final exam seemed to suggest otherwise). I recommend this class to other students.",
    "Strengths: there's a lot of material to cover but looking back, I felt like it was done justice to. Professor Navon is very supportive and I felt like the problem sets were very well designed in terms of walking you through a problem and slowly changing assumptions or conditions to add more material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the material (particularly in thermodynamics) didn't really click to me until all of the pieces came together just before the midterm,. Up to that point I felt like I was more going through the motions and manipulating equations without really grasping the essence of it. Maybe there's some way to get the big picture across and make this process more clear. We covered a little bit of more modern thermo\/stat-mech topics at various times (nonequilibrium thermo and bose\/fermi condensates) but I wish that there were some more computationally oriented problem sets\/topics as well. However, the course is already packed as it is, so maybe this is best left for another...",
    "It's a pretty good course. Only area of improvement would be that I think the lectures on thermal transport and non-equilibrium could be clearer and suffered a bit from not having a corresponding problem set.",
    "The biggest strength is the quality of the lectures, which are very clear and engaging. Even though it was a 9 am, the classroom was basically full every day."

   "comments": [
    "I mean, it's interesting, but there's probably other courses which are easier and cover similar topics than this. If you need to take it, you need to take it.",
    "Yes, but it is a lot of work, and you have to stay on top of your game constantly.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Chances are you're a physics major, an applied physics major, or a related major if you take this. Solid class. Tough experience but rewarding experience.",
    "This course is a lot of work. You're reading these reviews because you're a physics major who has to take this course: don't psych yourself out. When you're in the midst of the class you develop a rhythm and things go by faster (and better) than you would expect -- you can succeed in this class! Here is a piece of advice that no one else will give you, so congratulations on reading this review and learning this: read the textbook \"Statistical and Thermal Physics\" by M.D. Sturge. It's not on the syllabus, but this book hands down will give you the best review of the material that Prof. Navon presents (and maybe even some of the questions asked on problem sets and exams...). Other than that, just start the psets early, like, the day you get them. The exams are fair -- the best thing you can do for these exams is to study the problem sets, because the questions he asks make you do the same mechanical processes that the psets make you do. Don't drop any of the thermo psets (any of the first 6 or 7), because the stat mech psets are much harder and come at a worse time in the semester. Just sit back and enjoy the ride -- it's a lot of work but the problems Prof. Navon gives you are fun and he actually wants to see you succeed. Good luck!",
    "This is probably the worst class Ive ever taken. If you dont have to take this class for the major, dont. If you do have to take it for the major, consider switching majors. This class eats up a truly enormous amount of time every week on problem sets, and Im not really sure I even learned that much from them. The grading is also insane  only 20% of your final grade is the problem sets that destroy you every week, and 80% is the midterm and the final (on which youre only allowed a provided equation sheet without all the equations you actually need).",
    "If you have to take this you don't have a choice. If you don't have to take it, it is an excellent course, just insane amounts of work",
    "You're probably only here if you have to be, so good luck. Let's just say it feels very good to be done. \r\n\r\n(To be fair, the course was actually interesting, and the work didn't feel pointless which was good. It was just HARD)",
    "If you want to learn the material then this course will give you that - just understand that it's a lot of work in a way that's borderline not helpful at a certain point.",
    "Yes! The content is beautiful and the class is challenging in a good way! Since the workload is high, I would suggest making sure you don't take this class concurrently with a bunch of other tough STEM courses, and plan to spend more of your time on this class than on others.",
    "Yes, this course is somewhat of a must for a physics student. Professor Nir is one of the best in the department, and you would be missing out if you never have him. That being said, its unreasonably hard and exams are designed to be quite difficult.",
    "Yes, but only if you have time. This course is required for the intensive physics major, and I think that it is worth it, but make sure you treat it with appropriate respect.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the topics and willing to do substantial work.",
    "Yes, it is a must for Physics majors and it presents the best treatment of the subject.",
    "This was a phenomenal course. It definitely pushed my intellectual boundaries, but I matured as a thinker in measurable ways.",
    "Yes, its probably the strongest course in the physics major. This class has a reputation for being difficult, and youll work hard, but its doable if you give yourself the time to devote to the problem sets every week.",
    "I thought the course was interesting, but I sometimes got last in class because it moved so fast and there was a lot of expected previous knowledge of topics.",
    "Yes, I felt like I gained a thorough foundation in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. I came in with just the basics in both and left with a sense that this is perhaps one of my favorite area of physics in its power\/applicability and a different way of thinking compared to mechanics\/E&M\/QM.",
    "Yes. Truly teaches you a lot.",
    "I don't think anybody would or should take this class unless they are majoring in physics, because it's probably the hardest class in the major. If you are deciding between intensive vs. regular physics and this course is a key factor in your decision, I'd say go for it. I think it was the most interesting and engaging class in the entire major, and although the psets are long, they are also genuinely interesting questions a big change from some earlier classes. You'll really learn to think like a physicist."
