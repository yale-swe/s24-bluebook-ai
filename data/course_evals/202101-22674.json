Really great course and I learned a lot about how complicated nationalism could be",

This, of course, happens in every course. One of the strengths of the course, however, are the guest speakers who present their own research. That gives you a much better overview of the field of Nationalism studies as it exists today, which is something very cool. Quantitative studies are also included, but while I think these are very interesting and add a lot to the course, I also think that in general students are not prepared to understand the math/statistics/economics underlying them and much of the meat of these studies gets lost in discussion.",

With that being said, the course does give you a much broader view of nationalism and the literature surrounding it and still recommend",
                "Yes, but you have to be a particular type of student, I think. Specifically, I think while this course is good and solid for most anyone who would consider it, to get the most out of it, you should either be comfortable or at the very least not-afraid of empirical and quantitative methods. Secondly, the course offers an interesting balance between traditional, abstract theory, and specific case studies and specific hypotheses which is something to take into account. Professor Hierro is an absolute gem and ties everything together quite nicely!",
