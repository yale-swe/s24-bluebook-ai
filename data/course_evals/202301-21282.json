                "I learned about how brain function and cognition connects to language, and how we can use language to understand brain processing. I also learned a lot about how to properly read and understand studies and the study format, and how to construct and record studies of my own.",

I also learned how to conduct a scientific study, starting completely from scratch, as well as how to write an NSF funding proposal and how to properly read scientific papers."

                "This class is really challengingin a good way! It's like Dunning-Krugeryou will suffer a bit in the start, but after you get used to the pace of reading papers and summarizing their results, you will suddenly start to see the big picture. You walk out of the class feeling like an expert in neurolinguistics, ready to interpret any latest progress in the area (which is, in fact, what every exam asks you to do in the last question).\r\n\r\nThis class is not very organized. I'm often lost when preparing for quizzes and exams because the handouts are poorly structured. You need to stay very focused and clear-minded in class to be able to keep up with the discussion.",
                "I think there are too many readings. Also, I think having us do a final paper and a final exam was kind of overkill.",
                "The course is well organized and the papers chosen are excellent. Discussion in the class is supported well\r\nThe switch from not giving handouts out made it harder to pay attention to the class, because even though we got the handout at the end, when things were unclear it was harder to clarify them several classes after we had covered that material.  Having a final paper and exam though is abit beyond what most classes do",
                "This course is extremely demanding. The material is very dense and students should be given more time to digest and engage with readings. Moreover, the workload is extremely heavy. The weekly assignments should count for more of the grade given that they are so time consuming.",
                "Strengths: the material is very interesting, and I really liked the project aspect. The class is very hands-on, which helps with learning. I think the fact that studies are done in groups rather than individually is also helpful, because everyone contributes their own expertise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: although we reviewed studies in class, I was sometimes unsure what the overall takeaways were supposed to be.",
                "Only weaknesses: There should not be a section. There's way too much work. The handouts are awful. Class is incredibly disorganized and a waste of time. Exams do not reflect what was taught in class.",
                "The content was interesting but it was very unclear what information we were responsible for. The semester-long project made it difficult to spend adequate time doing the weekly homeworks and reading the material.",
                "I think that the biggest strength of the course was that it taught me to effectively analyze difficult scientific literature and to extract important ideas even when many smaller details eluded me.",
                "Strengths: the material in this class is really fascinating. And because you (in groups) create an entire scientific study, you really get the feeling of having accomplished something tangible by the end of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: although the material is fascinating, we went through it quite slowly in class, to the degree that the pace of the homework readings fell out of line with the pace of the class discussions. I think this is because Prof Piango would sometimes lecture in circles, but also because students would ask so many questions which were frankly unanswerable. The only other weakness of the class is the exams: the true-false questions sometimes felt a little bit unfair.",
                "The class time is extremely engaging and the major group project as well as the final follow-up is very interesting, it made me enjoy a group project which is a rare occurrence. The readings were good and definitely helped me develop my skills for understanding scientific papers but the quantity of papers to read was at times a bit overwhelming. The tests were my least favorite part of the course, I felt like it was hard to know what would be important to study for them and the questions were often very challenging, but it was mostly multiple choice so even questions that were very hard would have a 50% success rate from guessing. I would have preferred tests that better assessed the broad strokes of knowledge about the material rather than a bunch of trickily worded true/false questions. My favorite question on the tests was the last question on the final."

                "This class well serves its purpose of being a science credit for linguistics students. Take it if you are interested in syntax/semantics and want to dig deeper into the cognitive basis of these functions. You need a lot more background in syntax/semantics than the prereqs may claimdo not take this if you've only taken intro ling or phonology, because you may be lost by some of the linguistics discussions.",
                "If you need a science credit and you're a linguistics major, it's not a bad choice. It's probably a bad idea to take it in a five credit semester like I did- I enjoyed the course a lot but it was kind of a nightmare during finals season.",
                "Yes, if you are specifically interested in neurolinguistics. It's a really hard course to enter casually, and experience in at least one ling course seems necessary. The workload is really high so unless you're committed to learning this subject.",
                "If you're interested in neuroscience or cognition, yes! You'll learn a lot about how language connects to both of those concepts. I might recommend some introductory syntax knowledge beforehand, but it's not hard to keep up with the class so long as you have some basic linguistics OR cognitive background.",
                "No. God no. Absolutely not. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Even if neurolinguistics sounds like the most interesting topic in the world to you (like it was to me), this class is NOT worth it. The most frustrating academic experience I've ever had. I don't even know where to start. This is a 12-person seminar that meets twice a week for 75 minutes PLUS a 50 minute section, which is spent either continuing lecture/class or giving presentations on the pilot study project. Piango is an awful professor who spends class rambling and using \"handouts\" that are basically random words on a page. There's so much work: weekly assignments where you have to read 5+ papers and answer nonsensical questions, an entire pilot study *group* project where you need to design an experiment then collect and analyze data, two midterms, and a final paper AND exam. The exams are so poorly written and do not reflect what was taught in class; there are three of them, all cumulative, impossible to study for, make up a large part of the grade, and overall designed to set students up for failure. They will make you cry. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Please save yourself from a semester of absolute misery.",
                "I might but I thought it was poorly structured",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the information we learn is indeed very interesting, even if sometimes class feels a bit slow because of Prof Piango's tendency to lecture in circles. You will learn some fundamental neuroscience and neuroanatomy, which is very cool, and I think this is the best psycholinguistics class we have, so it is a valuable course to take.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in language and the brain this will be a fascinating course."
