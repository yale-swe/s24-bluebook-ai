It's an incredibly refreshing angle on computer science, which often is so focused on coldly building solutions for the highest bidder with only a veneer of ethics carelessly slapped atop it for marketing or funding purposes. Here I felt that the research I was doing and the tools I was using and building were providing material value to the world in a way that's more intellectually stimulating than nonprofit webdev and more direct than some of the pie-in-the-sky CS projects often touted.",

I wish we had a bit more support for the projects since we were just given general directions, and we would have struggled with getting the project done if most of us didn't have prior experience with the technologies used. The lectures are also a bit bland since a lot of it was going over PowerPoint.",
