                "This course began to fill the woeful gap in my understanding of African and Afrodiasporic history, totally reshaped how I think about genre in music and the arts, and reawakened a lifelong interest in speculative\/science fiction. I found myself applying ideas from Afrofuturism to most of my final papers, not just the paper for this class!",
                "I had never even heard of Afrofuturism before I took this course, and now I feel like I am semi fluent in the theory and can identify Afrofuturist themes in many different mediums. This class really broaden my awareness of how much I do not know, and it made me excited to explore more things outside my comfort zone.",
                "I learned about the complex and compelling history of Afrofuturism not just through a sonic lens, but also through the mediums of literature and visual art. Learned about sonic markers of Afrofuturism and how they can represent an African past marred by slavery and oppression, but also a reimagined African, technological future."

                "I really liked all the reading about theory to start out, but I felt less equipped to apply those ideas to music specifically. The paper applying those ideas to other artistic mediums came very close on the heels of the paper synthesizing the theoretical ideas themselves, and I didn't find it as helpful for practice in applying Afrofuturist theory to music. Honestly, as interesting as looking at the visual art was, and as compelling as I found Octavia Butler, having two or three weeks in the middle to discuss musical devices in-depth instead would have helped a lot.",
                "Overall I really enjoyed all the listening and reading I did for the class. Sometimes, the amount of reading was overwhelming, and because of the weirdness of zoom, leading the class discussion on particular readings was sometimes stressful. However, I learned something from every reading, so it would be really hard to reduce the workload.",
                "Lectures were always compelling and we always had insightful class discussions. At first it felt more like a history course than a music course, but in hindsight the in-depth historical background we established throughout the first half of the course was necessary for us to approach Afrofuturism in music. More time to complete the first two essays would be extremely helpful (both were assigned a little less than a week before the due date)."

I am not sure how to fix this problem, but I think there could be some tweaks so that it is not as awkward.",

To be able to ultimately study the historical developments of the transatlantic slave trade, slavery, and the fight for black liberation through an Afrofuturist lens (encompassing multiple artistic disciplines including music) was extremely valuable."
