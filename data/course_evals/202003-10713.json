All of these topics were very well-communicated and provide an excellent basis for approaching the most common problems in statistics. I thought the connections drawn between basic least-squares fitting and linear modeling were clear and helped distinguish between approximating a set of points versus trying to model variables with randomness introduced. Until now, I hadn't thought deeply about the difference between these two problems. \r\n\r\nFinally, this course was a great introduction to how intuitive, rigorous proofs can look -- and Professor Brinda's clear guidance made this quite painless.

                "The course is a good reinforcement of some concepts taught in Linear  Algebra and S&DS 242. If you understood those the first time, and want to learn anything actually useful, this might not be the best course for you.",
                "Clear lectures, very doable and reasonable psets, overall great class and great workload",
                "I am an S&DS major (third-year), and this is the best course I have taken in the department so far. \r\n\r\nThis is largely thanks to Professor Brinda's dedication to student learning\/educational pedagogy as well as the comprehensible, well-organized textbook he wrote for the course. Unlike most other professors in the S&DS department, Professor Brinda eschews long, grueling problem sets in favor of meaningful, basics-driven assignments. It was clear from almost every homework assignment (almost all involving coding in R) that Professor Brinda put thought into the most effective ways to reinforce concepts from class through example. Rather than being frustrating and borderline learning-inhibitive like some of the 40-hour psets I've had in other courses, I enjoyed our assignments and felt that I genuinely benefitted from doing each one. I cannot emphasize enough how incredible this was, and how surprised I was that shorter, slightly less challenging homework was actually more conducive to learning. I wish other classes would follow suit! \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course was the spaced repetition via Anki flashcards we did each week. Professor Brinda prepared us weekly batches of exercises from his textbook that reinforced core concepts from lectures, and we were encouraged to practice these regularly in exchange for a perfect score on one of the week's two in-class quizzes. I had not tried a method like this for a math course before, and it was really effective. I enjoyed how the decks were not too challenging and thus not discouraging, but rather built up muscle memory so we could better apply fundamentals (like properties of orthogonal projection matrices) to new material. \r\n\r\nI only wish this course were longer, or that there were a Linear Models 2 offered at Yale. We spent a fair amount of time building strong foundational understandings of key linear algebra concepts, which I fully appreciated. But this means we had less time left at the end to go over statistical concepts related to randomness and predictions. It would be great to have a second linear models course taught by Professor Brinda on offer, as I felt this was the first S&DS course at Yale where I was instructed well enough that I would leave feeling confident about the material and excited to apply it. There are certainly more complex linear modeling topics that one could cover in a second course and it would likely be fantastic to study those with Professor Brinda.\r\n\r\nFinally, the twice-weekly quizzes were short and often not made to be difficult, but I found it occasionally stressful to try and complete a question on the spot, photograph and upload it to Gradescope within a timed (short) window. Luckily, Professor Brinda always asked for feedback on quiz difficulty and I felt he responded well to student input.",
                "The primary strengths of this course are: 1) Prof Brinda, who is extremely helpful with assignments and very skilled at explaining difficult\/abstract\/theoretical concepts; 2) the material, which will allow you to see linear regression and linear models in a completely new, geometric way; 3) Prof Brinda's textbook, which is very concise and very clear; 4) the homework assignments, which are reasonably short and give you the opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts of the course to real-world data sets.  There are no real weaknesses.",
                "Covered things throughly, but sometimes went a bit slowly and felt like repeating LinAlg jargon over and over again. Textbook also could be fleshed out a bit more at times - in places it just felt like one formula after another after another",
                "Professor Brinda was the strength of this course- the pace of the course was not too fast nor too slow, and Professor Brinda really took care to make sure that all of us were understanding the material. His textbook is well-written as well and was of great help throughout the course. The weekly quizzes made sure that we were keeping up with each week's lectures. Overall, a great stats elective.",
                "Dr. Brinda did a great job of pacing the course content. He also designed very manageable and engaging problem sets that helped me learn content.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brinda is such a strength for this course. It's clear he's been honing the syllabus and course format over the several years he's been teaching it, committed to making it better for students with each rendition. The textbook and \"variables picture\" approach was so helpful in being able to visualize what is happening when fitting a model (vectors projected into subspaces). I feel leaps and bounds above where I was in terms of interpreting and understanding what is happening when running \"lm\" in R. Professor Brinda also spends the first portion of the class going over the important linear algebra concepts to set the stage before introducing random vectors, which was helpful both for those who took linear algebra a while ago, but also to set a clear foundation before introducing randomness. There were 2 weekly quizzes after class for most of the semester, but if you practiced the flashcards with the given exercises, your lowest score for the week was given a perfect score (and, of course, you were more likely to remember the concepts\/be prepared to do well on the quizzes). The homework assignments were structured really well, with the clear emphasis being to reinforce the ideas of class, rather than have you reinvent the wheel. I liked the incorporation of R as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't receive grades back for some of our quizzes until the very end of the semester (though one of the original graders needed to step away from the course). There were answers posted, but not specific feedback for ours until much later. Beyond that, I genuinely can't think of any. This course was well structured for my learning style.",
                "the course was mildly interesting, though I think the lectures could have been a lot more efficient. I'm not sure if I learned that much new stuff on top of the (admittedly many) stats classes I've already taken. It was fine for a busy semester, but I still think more could've been covered (e.g. different types of regression and linear models). However, a strength of the class is that everything was very fair, and Prof. Brinda provides opportunities for you to make up for poor quiz grades through flashcards (graded for completion) and corrections on the midterm.",
                "Strengths are definitely the teaching and homework",
                "Strengths: the lectures closely follows the textbook, the Anki card problems help with grasping concepts, and the hw assignments and exams are all very reasonable",
                "Strengths: Brinda is a really good professor! clear, moved at a good pace; psets were cool too, unlike other assignments I've had in the S&DS department\r\nWeaknesses: the quizzes were annoying at times for sure, but I think they were still overall helpful",
                "I think that the course was balanced pretty well. Lectures covered course material and sometimes got challenging at times but students were free to ask clarification questions. Homework assignments weren't very long and helped us understand what we learned during class. The professor's textbook was really helpful and had everything that we would need to know to complete assignments. The weekly quizzes were really short and most times doable. But we were able to do flashcards to get full points on one of the weekly quizzes anyways which was really fair. Piazza was also utilized well and aided us on homeworks and exam clarification questions.",
                "I understand the use of the semi-weekly quizzes, but they were kind of rough--I'm never good with a 15 minute time limit. It might be better to switch up the format of the quizzes--say, once a week, with a 30-minute window and posted to Gradescope for submission at any point on a given day, rather than being part of lecture time.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. An overall solid course with a nice professor and interesting content (if you like modeling\/lines).\r\n2. Being able to drop 1 quiz each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Timed quizzes after every lecture that you often failed 50% of.\r\n2. Really hard to do the course if you didn't take 225, because there's a lot of assumed theoretical linear algebra knowledge.",
                "The examinations should not be take home. At least, students shouldn't be given an entire week to do the exams, but maybe a couple of hours or one day? The means of both exams were incredibly (almost artificially considering how difficult both of the exams were) high. I was very disappointed to see that I was below average in the final exam even though my score was really good and I have been doing very well in the class. Something needs to be done about this.",
                "Was tough sometimes to apply class knowledge to homeworks but the lectures were very informative and teacher did a great job with explaining the theory part of everything.",
                "The course was well taught and emphasis was put on how to apply the knowledge in more practical situations.",
                "The homeworks could be more clearly written and the grading could be more prompt. The daily quizzes were great especially this year because they kept you very engaged and you didn't have an opportunity to fall behind.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely Professor Brinda. He is a concise lecturer who cares deeply about his students by stopping to ask and answer questions. The assignments were relevant to the material learned in class without being too difficult. The grading was also very fair and lenient. I guess one small weakness of this course is that I would've liked to see how the material we were learning is applicable in the real world.",
                "Dr. Brinda is an excellent teacher and very responsive to students questions and concerns. The only weakness would be that we had an in-class quiz due on piazza at the end of each class. Given the virtual mode of learning, I thought having a quiz due at the end of class was unnecessarily stressful.",
                "Strengths: Brinda is a great lecturer who goes at a good learning pace. Because he writes everything out by hand, records lectures, and uploads lecture notes, it was suitable for online learning as well. I loved that the psets were all in R with a mix of both theory and coding application of the material we learned in lecture. Brinda teaches to the textbook that he wrote so it's easy to find and review material that was covered by reading an accessible textbook imo\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material at the end of the semester was harder to understand but we took equal or less time on it so it would've been nice to spend more time on the harder textbook chapters towards the end. The final was also quite hard as a result since we covered the final concept on the exam in 10 minutes at the end of the last lecture.",
                "This course is very well organized and taught. The lectures were clear and informative, the homework was well suited to support our understanding of the material, and the quizzes and exams were fair and well written. I also appreciate that Prof. Brenda provides his own textbook for this course which makes it easy to follow along. In many courses, textbooks are extraneous or supplemental. In this course, reading the textbook and working through examples was a helpful and integral part of the class."

                "1. Anki cards: Spaced repetition flashcards with short exercises from the textbook. These were really helpful in keeping us engaged with course material outside of homework and lecture, and easy to do at home in between other activities. \r\n\r\n2. Piazza: I appreciated that this course had a forum for questions and discussion, as well as Professor Brinda and the TFs' thoughtful responses. One challenge with Piazza I've seen in other classes has been students feeling intimidated out of asking \"stupid\" questions, and the forums end up dominated by a few \"top\" students. This wasn't the case for SDS 312, and I appreciated the teaching staff giving clear, helpful answers to even basic questions. I also liked that we could post anonymously to teachers, as this made me comfortable asking a few questions that I may have been embarrassed to post otherwise. \r\n\r\n3. Clear accompanying textbook material: This was especially important given that some students cannot attend office hours or live class due to time zone differences. Having a companion reference in the form of a textbook helped make up for some of this loss as I knew where to look when I didn't fully understand something covered in lecture or homework. For classes without one textbook, having access to detailed slides or other resources for each topic would likely be as effective.\r\n\r\nThings to improve: The only thing that might need changing is the twice-weekly in-class quiz policy. I am on the west coast, so an 11:35 EST start time means I begin class a bit earlier at 8:35. That was fine for me, but others in Asia or Europe likely struggled to attend live lectures so they could complete quizzes in class. I think Professor Brinda realized this and will likely adjust if this is taught online in the future.",
                "I thought the virtual lectures worked well!  I have no further suggestions.",
                "Use of the online whiteboard was great.",
                "Class lectures were recorded, which was nice, especially for students who were in different time zones, or for people who just wanted to go back and rewatch some lessons. We had take-home exams for the midterm and the final. I think these succeeded because we were given an ample window of time to be able to work on them. The after-class quizzes were the only synchronous activity that had to be completed in the same 30 minute window of time after class. Course engagement was definitely subject to an individual and their particular situation.",
                "I think more office hours and TA would have been nice.",
                "Live zoom lectures worked out well, the scanned notes and recorded lectures are very helpful as well. Piazza was really useful for getting questioned answered.",
                "Live virtual lectures were helpful because they allowed students to be engaged. Piazza was really useful to cover questions outside of lecture and work through homework problems.",
                "I really enjoyed the take home midterm and final, actually. It was really conducive to reviewing the course materials as a whole, and gave me extra experience programming applications of what we've learned. And of course having a week-long submission window really lessened the stress of the exam. Honestly, I think that this is how exams should be done even in a normal year.",
                "Please stop having timed 15-minute quizzes after each lecture. They're not great for people in very different time zones and not fair for people with poor connection. There were times when I couldn't see the quiz for 5-10 minutes because my connection would cut out, and by then I couldn't really finish the quiz.\r\n\r\nThank you for recording lectures--they are a blessing when internet goes out.",
                "The recording of lectures was successful, it was easier to understand lectures if there was a way to come back to the lectures and rewind whenever the concepts were confusing.",
                "Brinda's lecture style was very good, only small comment is that he moved the tablet window a lot so I didn't always have time to write what he said. Office hours were also at fairly inopportune times.",
                "Recording lectures and uploading the lecture notes was great for online learning, but also helped when I wanted to go back and review the material. That was a major plus. Having online quizzes at the end of the lecture helped synthesize material, but that may have taken up a significant portion of lecture time which ultimately led to not enough time for more difficult concepts at the end of the course (e.g. power, prediction intervals etc.)",
                "I particularly liked the daily-quiz model. I think including a low-stakes quiz at the end of every lecture was a good way to encourage students to stay on-track throughout the virtual semester. I also appreciated the heavy use of Piazza for questions and discussions."

                "Lectures felt scattered at times but learned a bunch about linear modeling.",
                "This course is neither hard nor a lot of work, but it doesn't provide much value either. Take it if you need a low-stress stats elective, I guess",
                "Yes, definitely! Prof Brinda is an amazing professor, and you learn a lot!",
                "Yes! Solid S&DS class.",
                "I recommend absolutely! This is the best class I have ever taken in the Statistics major. Professor Brinda is fantastic, and I encourage anyone in the major to take this course. Even for those who disliked linear algebra, this is a great way to relearn those concepts in a painless way and to deepen your theoretical understanding of linear models. I never knew there was so much to dig into on the topic. The workload is very manageable as Professor Brinda designs assignments to be short (30 minutes to 2 hours a week) and doable if you read the book and understand foundational concepts. The optional Anki flashcards were helpful but not a burden. He wants everyone to succeed and the course is designed with this in mind!",
                "Definitely! The material is overall very digestible and Professor Brinda is amazing.",
                "YES.  This is a MUST-TAKE.  You will see linear models and linear regression in an entirely new, geometric way.  You will also learn a ton about useful statistical concepts like the distributions and behavior of random vectors, test-statistics, etc.  It is also a great way to sharpen your linear algebra skills (or relearn them entirely).",
                "Yes - brinda was a good prof to learn from and clearly thought about optimal student learning methods",
                "Yes. Brinda is a great professor, provides lots of resources to understand the material and I actually learned a lot about linear models from a linear algebra  and geometry perspective. The homeworks (in R) are manageable, helpful in solidifying understanding, and handy for reuse of R code. There are also mini quizzes at the end of every class, which can be annoying for some, but personally they forced me to not fall behind, without requiring much effort as they were leniently graded.",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially if Professor Brinda is teaching this class. This course's material should be required for any S&DS major. If you want to know the theory behind what happens when you fit a linear model, this is truly the class. Professor Brinda is excellent and has been honing the course material and teaching method for several years. The textbook is good and I really liked the \"variables picture\" approach to the topic, which involves visualizing observations\/responses as vectors in n-dimensional space (math-wise, this translates to vector and matrix operations rather than nested sums). The quizzes aren't stressful if you've done the provided flashcards and the exams were fair.",
                "I'd recommend this class if you're hoping to learn the mathematical basis of the material from intro stats or 230. It's also a good fifth class or fourth class during a busy semester.",
                "Yes. I think this is a helpful class for any S&DS major",
                "Yes. Prof. Brinda explains the concepts clearly, the workload is manageable, and with some stats background you can understand the materials and learn at a good pace.",
                "Yes, for sure! Especially with Brinda",
                "I think that some of the linear modeling concepts were kind of difficult later in the semester but overall there was a fairly reasonable progression throughout the course. Students had ample opportunity to ask questions during lecture, on Piazza, office hours, or by consulting the professor's textbook. It was challenging but overall it is very doable to do well in the course by completing weekly assignments and paying attention to the textbook. If you engage with Piazza and pay attention to lectures, you should do fine on homeworks and exams.",
                "Yes if it's being taught by Brinda! He is such a gift and really cares about the students. The assignments are pretty easy but really serve to concretize what you've learned in class, and responds very quickly to emails and Piazza posts.",
                "Yeah, very solid stats course",
                "If you're looking for a more chill course that fills the S&DS major requirements, this is a solid course to take. The workload isn't terribly high; managing the course is easiest than any other upper-level S&DS courses I've taken. If you're looking for a more applied course, this is not the course for you--Brinda is very clear about the course being theoretical. And it is very theoretical.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a strong theoretical linear algebra background (e.g. MATH 225), this course will be a lot more challenging. The course assumes that you can understand and work with inner products, orthogonal complements, orthogonal projections, etc. very easily\/well.",
                "Yes. Great class. Professor Brinda is a great. Very useful and fun elective for SDS majors.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes if you want some challenge on the theoretical aspect of linear modeling and R practice with said theory.",
                "Yes, this course explained well statistical concepts and it is very useful to create models that explain well the data.",
                "Not for anyone other than an SDS or Math major, but for those people very good and great teaching.",
                "Yeah definitely! If you got a decent or even small background in linear algebra, this course shouldn't be difficult for you at all. Compared to some other S&DS courses, this course is easier and lighter on workload. The assignments aren't too hard and the material we cover is definitely relevant for data science. Keep in mind that this course is a bit theoretical so if you're looking to learn R or data science applications, then this course may not be for you. Professor Brinda goes out of his way to ensure everyone is enjoying the course and he cares deeply about his students.",
                "Absolutely! Dr. Brinda is a great professor and the material is really interesting.",
                "Yes, I think this is a good course for anyone interested in understanding the pure mathematical \/ theoretical underpinnings of linear models. It's a really good precursor to more advanced courses like machine learning, etc. and it definitely will help you learn how to think about regression in 3D vector space.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to just about anyone. I learned a ton in this class and the workload was not terrible. Additionally, Professor Brinda is one of the best professors I have had in my time at Yale.",
                "Yes with Brinda. He goes at a great learning pace for an S&DS course and is cognizant of the struggles of online learning. There is a lot of linear algebra involved so having a strong foundation in LA certainly helps with success in the course. Class is definitely more geared towards theory, but all of the psets are coding in R so its a great mix of statistics and keeping yourself fresh in data science. Overall, would recommend.",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to any S&DS students looking for a way to build their theoretical skills in a way that is not too challenging and still provides useful applications."
