                "I have taken many screenwriting classes, but this was truly one of the best. I received a ton of practical writing advice covering characterization, story structure, story outlining, drafting, revising, and more. The content we covered each week in class directly correlated to the work we were doing, and therefore I was immediately able to apply my learning in a practical way. Additionally, Minhal is fantastic at putting together a great class roster. Everyone was engaged and I learned just as much from my peers as I did from the instructor.",
                "Developed comfortability in pitching, outlining, drafting and revising a script, as well as providing feedback and ideas for other classmates' scripts.",
                "learned about character building, logic of a tv screenplay, techniques for beginning/ending scenes",
                "I loved taking this course!",
                "I learned how to plan, write, and execute an entire pilot episode. I learned the mechanics of stories in a way I had never done before, and this taught me how to not burn your story out. I was able to workshop my material with a class full of people who cared and were dedicated to improving the writing of the class as a whole. I also learned about the film industry, life in writer's rooms, and how execution of a pilot usually works.",
                "In this course, we were exposed to a variety of pilots: half hours, hour longs, comedies, dramas, greenlit, passed on  and had the invaluable experience of peer-workshopping our projects in a \"writers room\" simulated environment. I learned more in this class than I have at any other screenwriting course at Yale!",
                "I learned how to pitch, outline, and develop a TV pilot, and started learning how to use that pilot to develop the rest of a show as well.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I cannot recommend this class enough. This was by far the most engaging class I have taken at Yale so far. You will learn how to pitch a premise for a show, develop scenes into acts, write and revise outlines, and develop a critical eye for your own work and that of your peers. To finish this class with a full, 60 page script (an hour long pilot episode) was incredibly rewarding. This has been one of the only classes Ive taken at Yale where you work on building one project the entire semester, which made it incredibly fulfilling."

                "No notes. Great class, extremely engaging!",
                "This course was a fantastic experience it was so empowering to go through the process of writing and entire pilot script, and so inspirational to see classmates come out with their own scripts as well. Proffessor Baig provided comprehensive and insightful feedback on our work, really taking a lot of time to make sure we produced our best work. It was also incredible to have a professor who is currently in the industry herself, as we all got a glimpse into screenwriting as a current profession. It would have been helpful if the course had been a little more pre-structured, but as this was its first time running I totally understand that it is difficult to know how long students will need for certain things beforehand! It ended up meaning that some weeks we would have no work whatsoever, and some weeks we'd have to write 30 pages of script. In the end, most deadlines were reasonable. However, please do note that the grading is very demanding! In Prof Baig's words, she \"doesn't believe in grade inflation\" only the top people in the class will get an A. Definitely not a reason to not take the course, but something to bear in mind!",
                "strength: fun final project, nice class environment. weakness: would have been nice to have syllabus in advance",
                "The two greatest strengths of the class are the focus on a singular project and Professor Baig. Approaching the class with the goal of producing something made the class something greater than a hypothetical or a pipe dream. \r\n\r\nIt could be improved by having more structured feedback sessions. I feel that students would often skip when they were in charge of giving feedback as opposed to receiving feedback.",
                "The strengths were the feedback I received from both the instructor and my peers. The class operated in a workshop model so it was very critique heavy which I grew a lot from.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that it felt a bit fast paced at times, and I wish we went over formatting a bit more in depth.",
                "Minhals detailed feedback was a real strength in this class, we received specific page notes every draft and she dedicated ample time to building on these ideas further in class, which made the course feel highly personalized. A weakness was the grading rubric  for a class that is already incredibly selective, and where everyone is dedicating a huge amount of time and effort into their projects, the grading at midterm point seemed to be very strict."

                "Absolutely, if you are seriously interested in screenwriting this class is a must. As an active writer in the industry, Minhal has a ton of valuable insights and advice for anyone interested in pursuing screenwriting. Be prepared for not insignificant weekly assignments, but they are so worth it  - you get to see your writing improve each week. For the first time in my life, I actually finished a full-length pilot, whereas other classes only require finishing the first half or so (which we all know will never get finished). This is the type of class that's worth building the rest of your semester around. I would recommend not taking another intensive writing class at the same time so that you can have the time and focus needed for this one.",
                "Absolutely! But do bear the grading and occasional heavy work load in mind.",
                "yes, if theyre interested in tv writing- it was quite a lot of work (you end up with a 40-50 pg screenplay) so you should feel dedicated to the subject. prof is not flexible about extensions (need a deans excuse or else you get penalized).",
                "Absolutely! take it take it",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is actually dedicated to writing a pilot. I have taken other writing classes here in which we learn hypothetical writing skills, but in this class you actually make the product. The personal attention in this class is unmatched.",
                "100%. If students have any interest in learning the basics and fundamentals of writing for TV, especially drafting a pilot in a rigorous workshop setting, this is more than worth it.",
                "Yes! The feedback did not only improve my screenwriting, but my creative writing in general. Especially when it came to structuring a story and developing characters.",
                "YES! ABSOLUTELY!! This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in challenging yourself as a writer and interested in pursuing film or TV writing, this class is a must."
