Breaking the seminar into three parts (a student presentation, discussion and a guest speaker) really helped fight \"zoom fatigue\" and keep students engaged.",

It is very easy to get left behind if you aren't paying attention, and doing work in preparation for the seminar occupied most of my Sunday afternoons and evenings. That being said, the quantity of assignments you actually do for this course is quite low - so you have some flexibility week-to-week if need be.",

                "Yes!",
