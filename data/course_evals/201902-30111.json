    "I felt that having this course twice a week over the summer was a lot, and it times it could be stressful, but that's because the course has to fit into 5 weeks during the summer. It would be nice to have the labs Monday and Thursday rather than Tuesday and Thursday though.",
    "Pretty well organized, lab reports weren't that long. The practical was pretty hard.",
    "One weakness of the course was that questions asked during labs were not always conducive to learning. I would have appreciated more thought-provoking questions that caused me to think critically about the concepts taught in the lab."
