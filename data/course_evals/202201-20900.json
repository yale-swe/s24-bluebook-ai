                "This class exposed me to lots of new poetry, as well as poets' own poetic philosophies. It also taught me about archives, museums, and collecting. Separately, both of these facets of the course were incredibly fascinating. In conversation with each other, they led to surprising class discussions,",
                "I learned more about how to read poems, how to think deeply about objects, how to connect written words with tangible things, how to conduct archival research, and how to ask questions.",
                "This course teaches you to look at regular/common entities (like a chair, or an edge) and really try and explain what they are. In this way, it is almost a philosophy course, but that has relevance to daily things around you. (The link of this to poetry as well is super interesting.) Overall, it taught me to look at the things around me with new interest / wonder, and to take the time to have a variety of (maybe conflicting) ideas about something.",
                "I developed my poetry analysis and research methods. I was also able to spend a significant amount of time with collections at Yale I hadn't been exposed to before and was made much more aware of the resources we have access to as students."

            "comments": [
                "This course is a wonderful exploration into Yale's many archives. I had no idea these materials existed, much less that I had access to them! The assignments were fun, the professors were engaging, and I learned a lot about how poetry enhances objects--while, at the same time, objects can enhance poetry.",
                "This class would be better if it were a two part year long class, with more poets and more collection visits. The course material doesn't really exhaust itself; it stays interesting and instructive no matter how many units are studied.",
                "The only weakness I can think of is that if you really don't like poems or if you're not interested in entertaining occasionally silly thoughts about why people like Stuff, this class might feel weird to you. Otherwise, everything in this class is a strength. There's a lot of space to personalize your work, you get to focus on the stuff that you like, there's no pressure to produce a certain kind of work (just what you want it to be), and you get a lot of brilliant support the whole way.",
                "I really like the poetry packets / our conversations / the ideas we look at in the collections. I think one area of improvement would be to have some time to look at the objects without a structured conversation or group discussion. It takes me awhile to peruse and leaf through the things, and sometimes there's not enough time with the overarching structure.",
                "I think this course does a really great job of having a familiar pattern that doesn't feel redundant. The format allowed me to know what I was walking into while still being really excited to see what would happen each class.  The freeform conversation can be really lovely but can also allow for people to take over and pull it towards themselvesthere were a few times I wish there had been a bit more steering or structure to the dialogue but I also know that too much would have stilted the conversation."

                "Yes!! The professors are awesome and the class is super non-traditional and cool. If you like poetry or you like museums, take this class!!",
                "Yes. This class was excellent, and truly was the highlight of my week.",
                "Yes! Even if you're not super involved in the world of poetry, there is so much juicy content to discover in this class. You have to buy into the concept of the class (looking at stuff and thinking about it abstractly, concretely, and in relation to words), but I found it both easy to do that and super rewarding. It's a fairly active class, involving movement and touch. The hardest part of the class is motivating yourself to actually go look at stuff in the Beinecke, and once you do it once, you realize how cool and fun looking at Stuff can be! After that, the assignments are all very personal, creative, and stress-free. Prof. Roffman gives incredible feedback, Nancy knows everything about the library, and they're both so supportive of any idea. They're a great team.",
                "Yes absolutely. Professor Roffman is great and the class is well organized with lots of resources (poetry packets, collections access). It also teaches you to think differently about the things around you / poetry, which is really fantastic.",
                "Yes! Its so interesting, so fun, professors are so kind and interesting, and I learned a lot. Its a really nice course.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you like poetry or you want to get more involved with Yale's collections, this class is a lot of fun. I will say that you kind of have to open yourself up to it being a little weird at times and taking everything with a grain of saltthe stakes of this class are very different than most classes I've taken. There are very very big thoughts about very very small things and they will simultaneously feel hugely and not at all important. Part of the joy of this class came from straddling that divide."
