                "Strengths: not too many assignments, doable workload, kind Professor and TAs, collaborative \r\nWeakness: Zoom lectures were kind of long and tiring",
                "This course covered some of the classic experiments in biology labs decently well. The lab reports were quite annoying though, as expectations and instructions said different things each time, and points were deducted oftentimes with little explanation or reason.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Moreno is very kind and cares about her students and their feedback. She went out of her way to give us a good lab experience, calling in people from the university library and from ESRI to work with us and give workshops. Weaknesses: The course didn't seem very well-adapted for online learning. Lab sessions were very long and it was just very difficult to learn about laboratory techniques without actually being in the lab. Additionally, I didn't feel that the expectations were very clearly communicated (especially since we weren't given any rubric for the lab reports, just some written guidelines which would change as the semester progressed).",
                "Strengths: introduced me to a lot of useful technology that I think will help me in future research (learning to use graphpad prism, write a lab report, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab sessions were very long and virtual, so it could be hard to focus at times",
                "The course is taught by a great lab instructor, Professor Moreno. Thinking through the different lab procedures was very helpful for writing the lab reports. This class is also very collaborative, which was great over online instruction.",
                "I really enjoyed the ArcGIS project, it was a highlight that could potentially be kept for future semesters. However, the main weakness of the class was that it was held as a virtual lab, which got to be quite draining. Lab report criteria were also not very well explained, so sometimes it can be difficult to know what exactly is expected for us to complete. Lab reports were also very long and detailed, though Dr. Moreno offers generous extensions to make the deadlines more accomodating.",
                "A strength of the course was Dr. Moreno. She was intentional about assignments and made sure to incorporate skill-building activities to the best of ability in a virtual setting by teaching students to graph with Prism, cite with EndNote, and map with ArcGIS. Nonetheless, we still had a classic introductory lab experience by looking at and documenting enzyme quantification, how the Lac Operon works, etc. Our in-class discussions forced students to consider how to strategically perform an experiment to compensate for the online nature of the course. Dr. Moreno was clear, interesting, and extremely kind and flexible with students due to the unprecedented learning situation.",
                "The course went over concepts in great detail. However, it was hard to get a feel for the actual techniques.",
                "I really appreciated all the hard work and preparation Dr. Moreno put into making the course work remotely. Sometimes pre-lab lectures were quite long and difficult to focus on, as we were unable to use the machines\/settings she discussed, which we normally would have been able to use in person. In general, the lab course was quite long, especially over zoom. In addition, it was a little frustrating to receive feedback from the two different TF's, who would focus on different criticisms of lab reports, docking points where the previous TF didn't  this made it difficult to understand what elements to have in lab reports across both TF's.",
                "Prof. Moreno really cares about her students and is also good at explaining the lab techniques. I thought the three lab reports were a strength. We got to learn Prism and had chances to improve our reports with each one. Learning GIS was also a strength, I never would have done so without this class. A weakness was that 4 hours is a really long time to be on Zoom and I struggled to stay alert and focused, especially during the GIS lectures near the end."

                "The first few weeks when we went over labs for 4 hours without breaks while being cold-called by the professor were not fun or enjoyable. A number of things we covered in lecture were already in the reports we were given to read beforehand, so a lot of times it was hard to focus. The second half of the course worked better when we learned to use GIS and worked with groups. Being able to interact with peers in breakout rooms really helped liven up the course.",

                "Working in groups over breakout rooms was successful for student learning. I think this course was overall very well organized for learning during the pandemic.",
                "I really appreciate all the effort Dr. Moreno put into the class to adjust the lab to a virtual format, however, I believe that the class would benefit from more asynchronous components outside of class so that we would not have to be on the Zoom call for 4 hours straight. This would allow us to be more engaged during classtime where we would discuss the more challenging aspects of the lab without having to also run through lab procedures which could be done prior to class.",
                "Virtual engagement was facilitated by the platforms Dr. Moreno taught us how to use such as ArcGIS, the workshop leaders she invited, and the setup of her discussions that prioritized synthesis\/planning of experimental steps.",

Half of the class was a geospatial data and information class having nothing to do with biology. Logistics-wise, the class was 4 hours on Zoom with no scheduled breaks, which was exhausting and tormenting. I do not feel that I am leaving this course with the advertised biology lab skills, so I cannot recommend this class.",
                "Good luck, friends. This course was not particularly challenging, but was quite mentally taxing. If you're new to bio lab techniques, this may be helpful to you. Also if you're looking to explore wet lab research in biology, this could be a good overview for you. Also I guess if you're new to scientific writing.",
                "Dr. Moreno is a great professor who truly cares about her students and their learning. However, I hesitate to recommend this course as it was this past semester. Overall I think this is a course that would be much better in-person -- it was difficult to learn lab techniques just by reading about them, and sitting in a zoom session for 4 hours every Friday afternoon was also very tiring. There was also no rubric or guideline provided for the final project and it felt like expectations for grading were generally unclear. This class is not that much work (only 3 lab reports and a final project), so if you really don't like writing, this lab could be a good way to get 0.5 writing credits. I did gain some useful skills using new programs, and overall I'm happy to have finished the MCDB lab requirement this semester with this lab.",

It gives a great foundation for students of all years for scientific procedures and experiments.",
                "If this class occurred outside of COVID, I may have recommended this class to another student. However, given the virtual lab format, the first half of the class was devoted to conducting virtual labs synchronously, which I feel was not a great approximation of the lab experience we would have received.",
                "Yes, especially if one is interested in building their critical thinking skills.",
                "Yes. It will probably be in a different format, but I learned more usable skills in this class than in lectures. (Prism, writing reports, GIS)"
