We often learn about the slave trade from a Western point of view, but this course challenged my understanding of what the slave trade was, who it impacted, why it was perpetuated, and how it still impacts the world today. If you like history, this is an excellent way to engage with history  especially a topic as important, heavy, and resonant as the slave trade  from a non-Western perspective.",
