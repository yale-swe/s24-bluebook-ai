The second is a practical instruction in the types of activities performed by governments and diplomats (memo writing, press conference, etc.) Highly recommended if you are interested in either.",
                "Amazing course with a great professor. Learned how to write concisely and a lot about the Korean Peninsula.",
                "Learned about the Korean Peninsula and the complexities in coming to a solution. Lots of hard skills: Policy memo writing, conciseness in speaking, presentation",
                "Deeper understanding of US China relationship and diplomatic skills",
                "I developed a strong historical background of the Korean Peninsula taking into account the perspectives of each main regional actor. Professor Rank strongly encourages policy writing, and teaches you how to write cohesive, concise memos that resemble those actually used. Our simulations helped us to cultivate public speaking skills, and were also incredibly fun. I made some amazing friends here and learned a lot. It was an overall great experience.",
                "I learned an immense amount about the history, diplomacy, and geopolitics of the Korean Peninsula. More importantly, though, this class was the single best look (through one prolonged case study) I've ever had at how American diplomacy (and diplomacy more generally) actually works. Prof Rank was utterly amazing, and his insights into diplomacy having worked at State are invaluable to anyone interested in Foreign Policy or just how the world actually works.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the class taught me how to write a really tight, polished, and impactful memo. Prof Rank is a demon with edits but in a way that makes you learn very quickly (without murdering you, either).",

                "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I think it did an excellent job in packaging all the material and having it delivered in a fun way. There were constant guest lecturers, so we were always able to ask deep questions to leading members of the field. Highly recommend this course -- I thought it was super fun and deliverable. Global Seminars are three hours long, but it never felt that long to me and I was always disappointed when a session was over.",
                "No real weaknesses, and I think that speaks to the quality of the course.",
                "Amazing course!! Prof rank was very involved and helpful throughout and gave a lot of feedback.",
                "Very engaging content and fun educational activities",
                "The biggest strength is Professor Rank -- he's fantastic! I greatly enjoyed his patience and humor throughout the class. I appreciated as well that the course material respected and treated seriously the behaviors of all Korean Peninsula stakeholders, including North Korea. Too often in the news and academia, I find people essentialize or belittle the country, which prevents any genuine evaluation of their interests and impact on regional security. Similarly, the class provided nuance to complex and evolving multilateral and bilateral relationships between different actors. I also love that the class was very small -- this allowed me to build relationships with my classmates and professor. \r\n\r\nOne area of improvement is workload. Sometimes the readings could be quite long, even for a seminar, in addition to reading responses and memo-writing. Feedback on my memos was always very thorough and great, but I felt that how they were graded could be a bit inconsistent, and so when I turned in an assignment I was never sure if it was A-level or B-level. I would still strongly recommend people take this class!",
                "The strengths are many: the interesting course material/ subject, the amazing guest speakers brought in (academics, ROK and US State Dep members, etc), and of course Prof Rank himself. Prof Rank is a really nice guy who cares about you learning and as an individual and he also has fantastic stories from his time at State.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: to be honest, not all of the readings felt super useful, especially Oberdorfer. While the overall history of Korea in 20th century is important, i felt more focused texts on the week-to-week topic could have been a slight improvement.",
                "Strengths: great discussions, interesting readings, great professor, productive layout for learning\r\nWeaknesses: I lacked motivation to do readings because we would go over them in class, so it seemed more like it was a lecture style rather than seminar course"

                "Absolutely. Whether or not you are interested in the subject matter, you can always gain something out of it. This is true even if you are not interested with the specific region or time period; I think there is something in this course for everyone. The material was treated with enough detail that you always felt you got something out of it, while not being excruciating or pointless so you don't know why you're learning what you are.",
                "Yes, it is awesome",
                "YES 100%. Prof rank is a gem and you have to take a class with him before graduation",
                "Yes, if you are interested in US China relations",
                "Absolutely! This is a great course that will help you cultivate a strong knowledge of the Korean Peninsula and challenge assumptions you may have. You will hear from a wealth of guest speakers with very different experiences. I made amazing friends collaborating on simulations and group exercises. I strongly recommend you to take it!",
                "Absolutely take this class if you care at all about Foreign Policy or Diplomacy. I was not super interested in East Asia going in (this class has made me much more so) but the takeaways from this class are incredible if you are interested in this field and you don't necessarily need to be an Asia scholar at all to get that out of it. \r\n\r\nThis class will teach you a ton, make you a better writer, and is well organized to help you succeed on top. What more could you want?",
                "I think you should definitely take this course! One of the things I would recommend taking it for is the applicable skills you learn. You learn how to write official policy memos for the U.S. government, participate in mock National Security meetings, and conduct mock diplomacy conferences between nations. The class has so many applicable skills that are much more useful than if we were required to write a bunch of papers all semester."
