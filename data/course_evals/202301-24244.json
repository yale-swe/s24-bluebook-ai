So I learned a lot about how to have those discussions...what's important, what language to use, as well as the actual content of ongoing literary discourses. I'm still not entirely sure I completely and accurately understand some of the frameworks we spent time talking about (maybe that's just the nature of artistic criticism), but I walked away having learned a lot about the way race and blackness show up in media.",

I learned about different modes of thinking surrounding these areas and areas of conflict between scholars.",

Whether you are reading scholarship that legitimizes your experience or learning about the complex role of race, this class always keeps you engaged. Students brought challenging statements and the professor created room for disagreements and discussion. This is a very insightful class!"

                "Good balance between structured time with the professor talking and the students talking. I think if we could go through TQEs more quickly, people can discuss with the larger group more.",
                "Strengths: The collaborative presentation assignment; highlighting different Black creative forms (music, art, film, etc.) although this class did focus on writing; the format of contextualizing content with slides at the beginning of class then going into further discussion on the texts for the rest of class; TQE discussion format \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were fairly dense and sometimes we didn't get time in class to fully talk about them, so it felt like I was wasting my free time reading and trying to understand texts that we wouldn't certainly discuss in class.",
                "strengths: the teacher is very receptive to feedback \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the texts tend to be really dense and I didn't go into the class with enough background knowledge to feel fully ready",
                "Strengths: classroom vibes, readings were engaging, Professor Edwards is amazing!\r\nOnly 1 Weakness: 9am time (it was hard waking up on time)",
                "Strength: every seminar was engaging and you walked away learning something \r\nWeakness: some of the readings would be difficult to understand",
                "I think the syllabus for this course is really incredible and introduced me to a lot of amazing texts I'm not sure I would have found on my own. I also think the dynamic of the class and the discussion was really special. Everyone was always so engaged and had a lot of insight to offer. I think from time to time I was a little unsure of the overall direction or goals of the class (like I mentioned above I'm not sure I have the \"right\" understanding of some of the concepts we were talking about), but I'm also not sure that matters because I know I learned a lot from and really really enjoyed taking the class.",
                "Strengths: the discussion style- every class was a new and exciting topic to discuss\r\nWeaknesses- none",
                "Great discussions in class, great variety in texts and good projects+essays.\r\n\r\n9 am time was personally brutal  if this class was at any later time i would have loved it even more.",
                "A strength of this course is that it exposes students to a diverse array of sources and is also centered around discussions which allows students to really share our ideas. The only weakness was that at times the readings felt overwhelming but Professor Edwards did a good job of addressing our concerns about this",
                "Strengths: This course was heavily discussion based and surrounded a different text every week or two. We also often structured our classes around TQEs (Thoughts, Questions, and Epiphanies) which allowed our discussions to cater to our own inquiries and curiosities. All of the texts we covered were incredibly engaging and reading every text was genuinely enjoyable. The secondary texts we'd read which were usually essays and scholarly articles were, while sometimes challenging, very enlightening and provided nuance to the texts and topics we were covering in class each week. At the end of the course, students formulate a portfolio that contains all of their writings from the semester as well as reflections. The portfolio style of the course really centers student learning and growth over simply adhering to a rubric to achieve a certain grade. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness but if you're someone who learns best with more structure to discussions, you may find this class to be very heavily led by student insights. Discussions are very fluid and while there are distinct texts and topics we cover every class, there isn't necessarily a rigid structure, which works very well for some and perhaps not as well for others.",
                "Strengths: The class offers a lot of flexibility when deciding what art medium students can write about. The musically inclined, theatre enthusiasts, or literature buffs can choose to write about a medium that better suits them. Class discusses a wide variety of art forms that prove relevant throughout the entire semester"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Personally, I haven't been given the opportunity to study Black art and culture in an academic setting, and this level of critical engagement was incredibly enlightening. The texts we read are fruitful and not one-sided. Authors disagree, and there is a level of nuance in basically every text and topic we cover that had me constantly changing my mind and rethinking. Moreover, the first-year seminar style of this course makes for a very comfortable environment where students are encouraged to share their thoughts, disagree, and bounce off one another.",
