    "How to write from a performing arts critic's point of view. How to analyze performances and review them.",
    "I learned to appreciate art forms I had no exposure to, and gain different kinds of insight into art forms I was already interested in. I learned to provide feedback and critiques to my peers, to write more conversationally, and to listen more closely to music.",
    "changed the way I experience performing arts, writing skills, learning how to partake in this type of criticism & writing in particular",
    "I learned how to write quickly, clearly, succinctly, and to use more precise, exciting verbs.",
    "An understanding of the politics and economics behind the performing arts; an awareness of the questions and challenges that critics face; \/greatly\/ improved powers of description"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Seminars were very engaging, and the weekly assignments kept us on our toes. I learned so much, read and wrote so much throughout the semester that I think I really improved my writing skills. There were also many cool events we were able to attend and interesting speakers we got to hear from. Sometimes though, the mandatory events\/shows\/screenings were difficult to accommodate due to everyone's busy schedules.",
    "The course's strengths are its participants, are Prof Spillane--who does an excellent job at creating a space where everyone is comfortable to contribute--, are the readings and the conversations around the readings, and are the feedback from peers. Sometimes, the way in which the instructor withholds feedback in the first draft means receiving feedback too late on something that could have been adjusted.",
    "Loved this course overall, two main areas of improvement\r\n1. I wish the prof had required that we write letters alongside our first versions to describe what we were aiming for. Sometimes the feedback I received seemed to entirely miss what my aims for the piece were\r\n2. I wish the prof had read a complete draft of the final piece! Giving us feedback throughout the semester and then not on the most important piece of work doesn't make sense to me.",
    "Strength: Fun of the material we discuss.",
    "I wish Professor Spillane had spent some time going through the structure of a review, or analyzing review. She often let us, the students, take the lead noticing what parts of a review we'd like to \"steal\" but I don't think that always got to the core of what made the review work.",
    "There was a great sense of class camaraderie, and the workshops were all fantastically productive and informative. Prof. Spillane always had the right anecdote or story to illustrate the question that we were struggling with. She also have great feedback that pushed me to find just the right adjective or verb for the job. Her goal wasn't to mold us into some platonic arts critic but to draw out the best of what we had written and turn it into something even more luminous."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! especially for students interested in the performing arts and want to engage in lively seminar discussions and attend cool shows and performances. I think it also really strengthened my voice as a writer.",
    "I would! I would recommend that someone take it credit\/d\/fail, because you have very little sense of where you are grade-wise apart from a midterm meeting and it can be stressful (especially if you're not accustomed to English classes) to not really know where you stand. It's very possible to do everything on the syllabus in this course and not do well because your writing didn't improve as much as some, but grade-anxiety aside I think it was a fantastic course and one of the spaces I most looked forward to attending throughout the semester. Prof Spillane is awesome and everyone would be so lucky to spend time with her in her class.",
    "yes, if you're looking for a fun way to write & learn about the performing arts, this is a great choice. decent amount of work though.",
    "Yes; it's a fun class  and a great way to discuss and criticize art. Professor Spillane is pretty kind and cool, too.",
    "I loved being able to write about and discuss performing arts with my classmates. I think this is the class where I've gotten to know the other members of the class the most. That said there is a lot of writing (2 pages at 3pm every Saturday) and a lot of outside of class events. It's no small commitment, but Prof Spillane makes that clear at the outset. While Prof Spillane gave a lot of comments on each of our drafts, I think she left a lot of the responsibility of figuring out how to implement those high-level comments to us. I think I could have used more concrete guidance.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested in journalism, arts criticism, or just plain writing better."
