While I really did like the first few readings we did for the \"Introduction\" and \"Childhood as Methodology\" weeks, I think it would've been more effective to read some of these broad readings about the study of the history of childhood in the last few weeks of class, after we had spent a lot of time critically reading history in that way.",

                "Yes I would definitely recommend it because it gave me a different perspective of viewing history, and I learned a lot. However, I would advise them that it is a lot of work. There was a lot of reading for the class every week and it was dense. Also, because our midterm and final paper were research papers, we spent a lot of time researching our topic of choice to reach the final paper.",
