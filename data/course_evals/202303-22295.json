                "ability to critically skim/read and evaluate historical passages",
                "This course offered a broad survey of early western historical and political thought. It was particularly useful in teaching you how to synthesize broad themes from large bodies of text.",
                "I learned more about how the values of ancient Greek and Roman political organization influenced each other and the structure of their societies. Throughout the course of the semester, I learned how to close read and analyze texts to identify the major themes that I could later expand upon on in my essays.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: incredible array of texts we engaged with that provided ample material for discussion in-class. Thought-provoking passages and opportunities. Interesting essay prompts that allowed the students to explore texts to their fullest.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a lack of historical context when it came to the historical texts we read. They often mentioned overlapping dates but then questions were left about unmentioned events that were of significance (ie. burning of library of Alexandria).",
                "Strengths: Engaging material and discussions (which trumps the weaknesses outlined below); small class format; final exam not worth much compared to many other Yale courses\r\nWeaknesses: The course focused more on political thought than historical thought; some of the texts more concerned with religion felt better suited for a Philosophy class (or a currently non-existent branch of DS such as Religious Thought); the texts were often not tethered to historical context; cost of buying books",
                "great reading; great organization; it would be better if the professor could offer more comments on our papers",
                "The strengths and weaknesses both lie in how much the course covers. On the one hand, you get to read a lot of history and are exposed to many ancient and medieval political thinkers, which can be great. On the other hand, there is never time to linger on a text and drill into its specifics because of the fast pace.",
                "The course was very informative. It went in-depth and covered the important aspects of ancient Greek and Roman history very extensively and well. This might just be more of a personal thing for me, but I am more of a visual learner, so it would be nice if some of the seminars had some slideshows with information on it.",
                "Strengths: Quality feedback and interesting texts\r\nWeaknesses: student discussion leaders are antithetical to the purpose of DS; having a PhD lead discussions; that is why there are no Grad student leaders in DS, so why have undergrad student leaders?",
                "There isn't much I would change about Directed Studies except that I'm in the camp where I prefer more authors at the cost of less time for each in contrast to less authors but more time for each. In regards to Dr. Hill's specific section, I would have appreciated slightly more time for student-led discussions (perhaps 20 minutes instead of 15) but that is a minor comment. I greatly appreciated Dr. Hill's discussion-led seminars over the lecture styles other professors prefer. I believe it gave me more of a diversity of opinions and opened the doors to more critical analysis."

                "YES! Historical and political thought was my favorite track because of how it seemed to blend the best of the other tracks into one and how easily it relates to modern-day issues. To be able to analyze texts from the past and relate them to the present was a very important skill that I'm grateful to have developed in this course.",
                "Yes I would, for anyone interested in what has happened to shape our current society/institutions. The readings are extremely relevant",
                "If a student wants to take an intensive course on ancient Greek and Roman history, I would highly recommend this course. I feel that I learned so much from it.",
                "I would highly recommend Directed Studies to another student. While the readings are intense in length and content, it truly is a learning curve, and you get used to the rigor pretty quickly. Learning how to write an essay weekly is a much-valued skill that I'm grateful I learned from this class, and the conversations in seminar are like none you'll be able to get anywhere else.",
                "Great professor and a quality course. Would recommend",
                "Definitely. Dr. Hill oversaw an environment of friendly discussion and critical analysis of the texts. His questions were diverse and provoking (in a good way) especially when considering author bias and society at large. Analyzing gender roles and power dynamics, for example, deepened our seminar discussions especially when these topics were not explicitly stated by the author. I felt comfortable speaking up and asking questions in seminar. Dr. Hill is very approachable especially in office hours."
