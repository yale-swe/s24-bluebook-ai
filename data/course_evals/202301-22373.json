                "I learned a lot about the American incarceration system and its issues, especially pertaining to racism and discrimination against the impoverished and people of color.",
                "Learned about the history of mass incarceration in the United States and how it affects people of color, particularly the Black community.  Learn about how race, class, and gender have ties to the American prison system.",
                "I learned about the historic uses of surveillance, discipline, and incarceration, as well as the philosophy and logic behind prisons. I gained practice with writing long argument papers as well.",
                "I gained knowledge about the evolution of the U.S. carceral system as well as its international implications. I think I gained more efficient reading and writing skills. I also gained some insight on my personal historical interests (and this will help guide my education in the future!).",
                "This course taught me how to better understand current issues in society through historical analysis.",
                "AMAZING CLASS. I had to walk 15 minutes from science hill to LC for this class, but it was worth it. Professor Hinton really shines in her lectures, as they are so interesting. Mass Incarceration in the U.S. is one of the biggest and most pressing issues, and there's so much nuance and so much to dive deeper into this class. Everyone at Yale should be required to take this class.",
                "I gained a comprehensive knowledge of the criminal legal system and how it has developed over the last few centuries, including how it has systematically criminalized certain populations across American history.",
                "This class radicalized me in a good way. I learned so much about policing, the criminal legal system, and the insane things that have happened historically to put us where we are today. I think everyone should take this class! It was so good!!",
                "I learned so much about the history of the US through the lens of the law/carceral state, which was really fascinating and is such a huge part of American history.",
                "I learned how to analyze primary sources and how to use history sources to create an argument.",
                "I learned a lot of the historical context that explains how we got to the system of mass incarceration we live with today.",
                "I developed my ability to critically evaluate scholarship within the fields of history and african-american studies. I gained knowledge on the history of prisons, the theory behind punishment, and learned about alternatives to incarceration.",
                "You learn a lot about the history of America and the effects of slavery, imprisonment and subjugation which has led the US to be where it is today.",
                "I learned a lot about the development of US prisons and the damage they have done and continue to do to communities around our nation.",
                "I learned so much about mass incarceration as I previously had minimal knowledge. I learned a great deal of history in reference to the history of mass incarceration. I also learned great writing skills.",
                "An overview of how the prison system developed over time and the impacts that the criminal justice system has had on specific communities",
                "I developed a much better historical understanding of incarceration as well as ability to critically analyze the idea of prison and punishment in general",
                "so much about mass incarceration",
                "I gained more knowledge and insight into the carceral system in America as well as its history. I also developed the skill of being able to look at history and garner a sense of continuity from individual events whilst still acknowledging the specificity of each event in a historical context!",
                "Through this course, I learned a significant amount about the history of incarceration and punitive punishment, from slavery and the convict leasing system to mass incarceration today. We also discussed the history of the manipulation of crime statistics, the role of the legal system, abolitionism versus reform, and different theoretical understandings of incarceration (such as the work of Michel Foucault).",
                "I developed my understanding of mass incarceration and its related terms. Much of what I had only broadly understood before, I now have a strong handle on. I read a lot of different material, and I practiced applying theory to the analysis of real events. While I may not have figured out my stance on abolition, I now have so much more knowledge to base it on!",
                "I gained a deep understanding of the history of mass incarceration in the United States and its impacts. Not only was it incredibly thought provoking, but it was also unlike any other class I had ever taken and I am so grateful I had the opportunity to learn from professor Hinton.",
                "I learned a lot about the emergence of mass incarceration in the United States; we began with the slave trade, and covered convict leasing, the War on Poverty/War on Crime, and modern mass incarceration.",
                "Understanding of the criminal legal system from slavery (well, even further back to ancient societies) to now. Also, I feel much more knowledgeable with major historical events/laws/decisions that played into this.",
                "I feel like I learned a ton about the institutional creation of incarceration and criminality",
                "I loved this course. It has been my favorite Yale course thus far. I had learned about the idea of prison abolition and so much more about the lengths that society has went to criminalize racial groups in the United States. The engagement I had with this course even exposed me to extracurriculars I have the privilege of volunteering with- such as the Yale Undergraduate Prison Project and the Yale Prison Education Initiative.",
                "How to engage with prison abolition and transformation from a breadth of lenses",
                "The long history of incarceration in the United States, along with the several legal theories and their applications",
                "In taking this course my knowledge as a writer and consumer of history grew tremendously. In completing class papers, I learned how to find, read, and decipher historical documents and use evidence that backed my argument. I also learned how to use this evidence to tell my own narrative and argument not just summarize material. I learned how to use knowledge in a historical perspective while still making it applicable to contemporary and future events and situations. This class offered me so many new insights into the realm of policing, mass incarceration, and the cardenal system. Through weekly reading and Professor Hinton's lecture I learned exactly what mass incarceration was, how policing over the years allowed for its growth, and how the cardenal system grew to what it is over history and the many branches of crime, criminality, and punishment of people that grew/grow from that.",
                "Nuanced approach to the history of criminal justice and abolition.",
                "I learned a lot about the criminal justice system, mass incarceration, what lengths the government and law enforcement will go to, prison abolition, and more. It was a fantastic class, you learn a lot by just listening and paying attention in lecture.",
                "During the duration of this course, my understanding expanded on the concept of mass incarceration within the United States, encompassing its underlying origins and the necessary actions incumbent upon us as engaged citizens to avert discriminatory practices against our populace.",
                "From a content perspective, I learned a ton about the development of the American prison, from slavery to the War on Drugs and beyond. I also learned about the history of anti-carceral resistance, about how people are fighting to create change now and throughout history. I also got some of the best writing support and advice I've gotten as a student, which I think has helped me to enjoy the writing process that much more.",
                "This course gave me a wide perspective of the past and present history that describes and recounts the struggle of marginalized communities the American carceral system. I developed my analytical and writing skills.",
                "I learned the theories behind prisons and the carceral system that laid the foundation for the history of mass incarceration. I learned what propels this system and possible alternatives.",
                "Comprehensive historical understanding of the criminal justice system and mass incarceration",
                "I developed writing, reading, and discussion skills. I found both the lectures and sections to be very insightful and helped develop my understanding of the material as it relates to class and the world.",
                "I learned about the origins of mass incarceration, surveillance apparatuses, and the different forms they have taken throughout the centuries.",
                "The policy decisions that have made the militiarization of policing possible, the history of the criminal-legal system being used to criminalize and punish civic dissidence, the corporal and soulish effects of imprisonment and enclosure on human beings, and the methods that race-class marginalized used to bring the courts to the streets through protest.",
                "I learned more about prison and the carceral system than I thought I could. As someone with a personal interest in mass incarceration, I thought my knowledge was pretty expansive but this class continuously blew my mind. I learned historical background as expected, but on top of that, I learned the complexities and important nuances of daily operations inside and outside of the prison. I learned many perspectives on abolition and how to develop my own."

            "comments": [
                "This class ONLY has strengths!!!! Professor Hinton was amazing and is clearly so knowledgeable on the material!! I came into it not knowing much about our prison system but I now realize how truly messed up it is.  The TAs are also amazing.  If you can, take it with Steven as hes so accommodating but Ive heard theyre all amazing! The grading is fair and you really get the grade with the amount of effort you put into the class.  Overall, great class! The only weakness Id say is that the readings are a lot but you dont have to do all if you cant so dont worry just take this class!!!",
                "Strengths: everything -- Prof. Hinton and the TFs were incredible, lectures were fascinating, readings were very interesting, the assignments/grading felt very manageable\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks had more readings than others, and the number of readings meant picking and choosing which to read/skim, though I would've loved to read them all -- definitely not a reason to not take the course, though.",
                "I think the structure of the course was a huge strength - from the organization of sections and teaching fellows to the clear expectations behind each assignment! The only weakness was the lack of equal distribution of homework - some weeks the reading was minimal and others it was just not manageable. Especially on weeks with major assignments due I found it difficult to do the additional readings.",
                "This course was very engaging and honestly taught me so much about our modern society. I feel like its biggest strength was the way it grounded our analyses of current crises and phenomena in historical fact.",
                "Strenghts - easy to meet with Professor Hinton during office hours, very engaging lectures, great Discussion Sections, only two big essays so manageable workload. The readings are worth reading, very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses - a whole lot of reading (to be expected) around 200-400 pages a week.",
                "Its a lot of content to move through in a relatively short period of time, but Professor Hinton does a great job of weeding through it all and providing the resources for you to delve deeper into the topics youre interested in while still creating a basis of knowledge",
                "The class had just enough work so that it was manageable with my other classes, but it also felt very engaging in the class material and lectures. Even though attendance wasn't formally taken, the class was so good that I never wanted to miss it because Professor Hinton's lecturing was so good.",
                "Discussion section structure",
                "This course is SO GOOD!!! I learned so much, felt like every assignment was meaningful and helped me better understand the course material, and I also felt that Professor Hinton and my TA Minh Vu respected students' time and humanity.",
                "This course by nature has a lot of information and so it is very broad and not very deep. I would have liked a little more depth on some topics, but understand that it is hard with a course of this breadth.",
                "Strengths are that lectures are very engaging, the readings and homework are manageable (when I'm not writing a paper), and the Professor and TA are very accessible and supportive.",
                "Professor Hinton is very knowledgeable and approachable. Very amazing class that I would definitely recommend to everyone.",
                "The syllabus was not very organized, especially in the first half of the semester. Professor Hintons lectures on the the most recent 60 years were incredible, however, and the course has given me a good understanding of Foucauldian genealogy and the main threads of incarceration in the US",
                "The professor and TFs are AMAZING. The course was structured clearly and well organized. This was the first time I had a section that truly complimented the course material. I can not think of any weaknesses.",
                "THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING CLASS!",
                "A strength of the course was definitely the content and amazing professor and teaching fellows. However, one weakness was perhaps the set up of lectures, which were sometimes unorganized.",
                "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: nothing",
                "I really like how the class was ran! No suggestions.",
                "All of Professor Hinton's lectures and the readings for this course are fascinating. Additionally, there are occasional guest lectures from other speakers or teaching fellows which add a lot to the course. My teaching fellow gave me very helpful feedback on all of my essays. I do not see any significant weaknesses with the course.",
                "The strengths are definitely the people! Professor Hinton, Juan, and my classmates pushed me to deeply understand the material and its nuance. The readings were well chosen and powerful, although I wish we could have heard more from people whom themselves have faced incarceration. I truly enjoyed the assignments, and I felt supported throughout the writing process. \r\n\r\nHonestly, there's little I would change. Just wish I could have devoted more time to this course!",
                "The class used a combination of methods to communicate the themes of the course such as videos, images, readings, and the traditional lecture format. This diversification of material presented was very engaging and added to my enjoyment of the course.",
                "The strengths are definitely professor Hintons lectures. They were powerful and comprehensive. The weaknesses were the guest lectures from the TFs. I found them confusing and not engaging. I would also suggest a reduction of the reading load.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hinton, great TA staff, captivating lectures, well chosen readings. BEST course Ive taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only thing I had trouble with was the philosophy and more abstract ideas. Since we come back to the concepts a lot, I wish we had spent a little bit more time going over it since the readings were a bit tough.",
                "There are no weaknesses to the course. I am usually very quiet and shy to talk during discussion, but this class definitely helped me break out of my shell a little bit. The readings were strong. Dr. Hinton's lectures were strong. The TF's lectures were strong. Also, we had the best guest lecturers come and teach us, and it was truly a privilege. We had two law school professors come out, in which one of their books we were literally reading for the course. The other one toured every single carceral institution in New Mexico in 2013. She showed us pictures from that and give us the realest depictions of what some of these prisons are like.",
                "The strengths are the topics it covers; I wish the lectures were recorded though",
                "I thought that this class was structured very well. Lecture was always engaging and the occasional guest lecture kept us on our toes and made it so class never became monotonous or boring. Furthermore, discussion sections gave a great platform for us to share our own ideas and thoughts and work together with our fellow students to understand the course material. I feel like this class would be really interesting if it was taught in a seminar format, though i do understand that if that were to happen less people would be able to take the class.",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections to allow for further brainstorming and thinking on material read and discussed in and out of lecture, Many opportunities for critiques and feedback on writing, outlines, and ideas, Very engaging and thought-provoking field of study, Emphasis on LEARNING and UNDERSTANDING material and its application to the present and past not just regurgitation of information. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture recording were not posted to the class, there wasn't a distinct direction for what a student should do if they are unable to make lecture.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hinton is a phenomenal lecturer and I found myself clinging to every word. The readings were relatively heavy but highly engaging, and the teaching fellows were an amazing resource.",
                "Among the various courses I undertook throughout my academic year at Yale University, I unequivocally assert that this particular course stands out as the epitome of excellence.",
                "I honestly can't think of a weakness this course has... everything was so well organized, Professor Hinton is a phenomenal lecturer who clearly cares a ton about this class and her students, I always got really substantive feedback on my writing. Overall I learned a ton in a way that was really impactful, digestible, and enjoyable. I also thought the arc of the class was worth noting, because it's not like any class I've taken before. Professor Hinton was clearly really intentional about organizing the class such that we went mostly chronologically from slavery to today's mass incarceration, and ended with a couple weeks focused on abolition and anticarceral alternatives. I think in this way it was really clear what possible next steps are and how people are trying to create change.",
                "The course was extremely engaging. Both professor Hinton and my TF Steven Cohen were very diligent, enthusiastic, and helpful through out the course. I which that lecture was 1:15 instead of 45 minutes as there is so much content to cover.",
                "Everything about this class was fantastic, but it would have been great to get a bit more information about the war of drugs events and campaign itself.",
                "There was a lot of interesting reading material. Although we are limited by time, I wish the course had more time to go into all of the material.",
                "Professor Hinton is ultra knowledgeable and passionate about her class and her students. The assignments are very straightforward, and all the TA's are amazing and nice. For some of the weeks, the amount of readings was overwhelming. Although the lectures are very informative, I found that sometimes they weren't very structured.",
                "Strengths: reading material was VERY engaging, Professor Hinton teaching the course is a huge plus because she is so knowledgable, and the papers were broad enough to allow us to write whatever we wanted and still be specific with our thesis. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: i felt that the final paper was too long. maybe 10-12 pages would've been better than 12-15. i felt myself stretching my writing rather than being concise.",
                "Strength: many different perspectives offered through diverse selection of readings, speakers, and abolitionist content.\r\nWeakness: the assigned readings were just too long to possibly get to everything. There was too much to consume, and at times it made the class feel more overwhelming and tedious than interesting and thought-provoking."

We learned how the prison system and how it is truly failed in America and how racism is still a large part of society.  Professor Hinton is extremely knowledge and I cant praise her and the TAs enough for this class.  If you wanna go to law school, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! You will learn so much about the history of our legal system from a different perspective.  I also think the readings are amazing and you should really do all though it is not all required.",

You learn a lot about the origins of prisons and policing and how some of the logic behind them doesn't make sense/is truly just done to target people of color. This course helped shape my views on many different institutions including and beyond prisons.",

She's an amazing historian and I have never learned the extent to which policing and mass incarceration have affected so many lives in America and continue to do so today. Truly changed my outlook on America and I now am so passionate about going into criminal justice.",
                "Yes! Anyone interested in the criminal legal system, prisons and their history, criminalization of minoritized populations or anything in that vein should take this class!",
                "Yes, I think everyone should take this class it was so good. I learned so much in a relaxed environment that facilitated conversation, discussion, and critical reflection.",
                "I definitely would. It was an amazing course!",
                "Yes, these are questions and issues everyone should be grapplying with.",
                "Yes, 100%. The course was challenging and there were a lot of readings, but the readings were paired together beautifully. I learned sooooo much.",
                "Yes, it is very important that people take courses like this one to learn about the history of mass incarceration and the processes that lead the US to having the highest incarceration rate.",
                "Absolutely!!! Professor Hinton is such a great professor and the content was not only very interesting but very well presented. You don't have to be an expert in anyway and should take this course if you just want to know more about the U.S. criminal legal system.",
                "Absolutely, if you have any interest in the prison system or mass incarceration you will go in depth on the work and theories that have dealt with these issues. You will surely become a better writer by engaging with the texts and through the research process associated with the final paper. Also, Professor Hinton specifically is an amazing professor and so engaging.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was incredibly interesting and I learnt a lot. Professor Hinton is also amazing and is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topics covered",
                "Absolutely. Learned a lot and was very engaged.",
                "Yes. I think everyone should take this course. It is super important information for everyone to learn.",
                "Yes! Professor Hinton is a great lecturer and the content is very interesting and important!",
                "1000000000%! It was such a great class. The readings and materials were really engaging and Professor Hinton is a great lecturer!",
                "YES TAKE IT THE BEST CLASS EVER AND SO IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND",
                "yes!",
                "Yes! The issue of mass incarceration is a very pressing one in our country and the first step towards change is educating people on the subject and this class is a great first step!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class is my favorite course that I have taken at Yale and I learned a lot about the history of punishment in the US and the rise of mass incarceration. Professor Hinton's lectures are always very engaging and the Teaching Fellows are great. The course is especially relevant for students interested in law or sociology and the use of statistics, because we explore a lot of the ways that the legal system and crime statistics have been used to perpetuate racial inequality and the carceral system.",
                "Definitely! It had been a long time since I took a history course, and it was so rewarding to work in this field. The material connects to so many other aspects of society: the economy, education, etc, so people of many interests will be able to connect it to their own lives.",
                "Yes 100p!!!",
                "I would recommend this course because of the content. The readings and discussions one has because of this course are far too relevant to the modern fight for social justice that not taking this course during ones undergraduate experience would be devaluing ones Yale career.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I found it engaging, and think exposure to this course material is important for every student to have.",
                "Yes. Professor Hinton was great, and she curated very interesting guest lectures. You also have a lot of freedom when deciding your final paper topic.",
                "Absolutely. This was about the best course Ive taken. Professor Hinton is absolutely amazing, the content is interesting, and you come away with a lot.",
                "Yes. If you're interested in Black history and/or left theory this is a great class",
                "Absolutely, I already have. This is my favorite course that I have taken this far. Dr. Hinton is an engaging lecturer, and my TF was so welcoming and gave me the best feedback I have ever received on an essay that I have written.",
                "Yes, I think it encourages a lot of critical thinking which I think everyone can learn from",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, absolutely! The learning and teachings one gain is invaluable and information I think everyone should know about the climate of policing and the criminal justice/carceral system. The instructors are amazing, the assignments allow for self reflection and freedom into one's own interest within the topics, and the discussion and discourse one is exposed to shapes confidence in speaking and interaction with other intellectuals!",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in criminal justice and want a more nuanced understanding of its history! I took this class thinking that we would one-sidedly criticize punishment and push for reform and was surprised by the level of nuance this class took--for example, the limitations of conflating \"slavery\" and \"incarceration,\" and how the same power dynamics can be reproduced in efforts for reform.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of those courses that everyone needs to take but not everyone will. It hits on such important topics and Professor Hinton is an amazing professor.",
                "Everyone should take this class. The significance of familiarizing oneself with the historical trajectory of our collective identity deems it imperative for each individual to partake in this enlightening experience.",
                "Yes yes yes. Everyone should take this class. Professor Hinton is incredible, and the course is structured like a survey class of the history of American incarceration, resistance, and change. You learn so much in a such a short period of time. There's certainly a lot of reading but if you figure out how you want to prioritize the texts, you're able to take away a lot without reading every single word. Lecture was super enjoyable and impactful and I also got a lot out of section.",
                "Certainly. It was incredibly well taught and so interesting.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to a student. In a country were \"critical race theory\" is labeled as a threat \"indoctrinating\" society, it is more important than ever to engage with real history and to acknowledge our present situations.",
                "Yes, this class has a great syllabus of readings that force you to confront history and the modern world we live in. The papers make you think in a way that constructing your own argument helps facilitate. I enjoyed the lectures and class went by so quickly because I was so engaged.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. This class is my favorite class at Yale and one of the most meaningful ones too. You learn so much about systems of oppression and rethink everything about existing structures and assumptions.",
                "Absolutely. I found this course to be powerful, engaging, interesting, and important for everyone to take.",
                "Yes. Professor Hinton is amazing and all the TAs are very understanding if you have questions or concerns about the class.",
                "Yes, this course is a great intro on the development and racialized use of prisons and how the pathos of punishment has created social disorder and civic alienation in the US",
                "I absolutely recommend. There are so many misconceptions and complexities surrounding prison and the criminal legal system that all American residents should understand. It's wildly interesting and important information that all students would benefit from exploring."
