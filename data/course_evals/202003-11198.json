                "This class helped me tremendously in improving my Chinese skills and Su Lao Shis stories are always very entertaining!",
                "I greatly improved my Chinese proficiency, especially my speed of reading and processing. I was able to practice my speaking skills on the regular, which helped me become more fluent in my translations and responses.

                "It was a great course that was very interactive, welcoming, and push me to improve",
                "Strengths are Su laoshi's interesting anecdotes and experiences, weakness is the late feedback.",
                "The course was very engaging and informative.",
                "I don't think there were many weaknesses to the course, I enjoyed that the class size was relatively small. There was a good distribution of material learned and I like that we weren't strictly focused on vocabulary\/readings but had the opportunity to learn about Chinese culture and history.",
                "I appreciated that, even with the virtual format, this course was very engaging and required students to be vocal each class. We took turns reading from the textbook, answering questions, and repeating key phrases. It was also unique that it still emphasized writing and traditional characters, which sometimes can be glossed over with our modern typing tools. Some may view this as a weakness, as sometimes the traditional characters didn't seem as crucial to learn, but I could understand that we learned them to recognize the words' historical roots. We learned Chinese very thoroughly, through speaking, writing, and listening, and it was clear that Su Laoshi was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The only critique I can think of is that the assignments and due dates could have been communicated more clearly, and further in advance.",
                "Strengths are that Su Laoshi is extremely kind, engaging, and makes each class super fun. He's always bringing up interesting topics throughout class, teaching us both about the Chinese language and even some culture\/history, and he really allows each student to participate in discussion and class. He was able to make even virtual classes a blast.",
                "Strengths: Amount of coursework is just right. The work doesn't overload me but I also learn from each of the assignments I do and gain valuable language skills from writing essays and preparing for presentations. The stories and outside of textbook topics that the professor talks about are also interesting and makes it easy to engage in class.",
                "Strengths: Curriculum is enriching, covering a multitude of topics of Chinese culture, while strengthening skills in Chinese in the process.\r\nWeakness: Consider giving more frequent grade updates via Canvas."

                "The live format was successful in that we were still able to practice speaking Chinese together, which is a crucial component to any language class. It was harder, however, to try to learn words on the spot from Su Laoshi, since he didn't have a whiteboard or a method of sharing the written characters more clearly.",
                "Each class was on Zoom. Students were called on by the teacher to either answer a question or read a passage. This was extremely effective because each student could participate a decent amount each class, and no time was wasted with using the raise hand function or anything like that.",
                "Reading the text of the textbook out loud one by one helps with pronunciation. Calling someone different to answer each question also helps everyone participate in the class.",
                "Succeeded: Office hours as well as live Chinese lectures were a success. Chinese Table was not a bad idea but could be more heavily promoted, it seemed to be under utilized and was a great opportunity to practice speaking the language casually."

                "Yes! Absolutely.",
                "Yes, Su Laoshi is a wonderful and caring teacher who puts a lot of energy into this class. He truly loves sharing his knowledge and stories, and his frequent tangents are always very informative. He tries to get to know every student as a person, and gives thoughtful feedback to the writing assignments. I will say, though, sometimes the material from the book is a bit outdated--I've shared topics with my parents, and they are surprised that the contents come from many years ago. Nonetheless, you learn a lot about Chinese culture and important vocabulary to talk about everyday life. I just wish we could have been in-person, so we all could have wrapped dumplings together at the end!",
                "I definitely would! Not only is Su Laoshi one of the best profs I've had, but the material was difficult enough that I could see improvement in my skills each week, but not too hard that it was discouraging. I enjoyed the various readings on many different topics, as well as essay topics that ranged across many different subjects.",
                "Absolutely!!! Su Laoshi is an awesome teacher and will elevate your Chinese to a whole new level. You'll learn cool idioms and phrases, interesting facts about the Chinese culture, and watch your reading, listening, and writing skills improve throughout the semester."
