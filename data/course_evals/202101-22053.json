                "This class goes into a lot of different topics including computer vision, sensors, filtering, and some neural networks. We went through each section pretty quickly, so I usually learned only enough to complete the next part of the project. Throughout the class, you will also learn how to use the Robot Operating System (ROS) and how to construct a system for the different sensors on the car to communicate.",
                "I learned about many of the techniques involved in self-driving cars, such as computer vision, PID control, Kalman Filters, and machine learning. Gained an appreciation for the various factors that have to be accounted for in creating self-driving cars.",

                "Great course, but sometimes things could be explained better. There was some difficulty in some of the more involved things with certain machine learning techniques were not repeatable or hard to work on solo.",
                "It's incredibly interesting and Man-Ki is really helpful. Also, building towards a concrete end product that works was awesome.",
                "The hands-on parts of the class in were lab were very helpful in completing the assignments, but the lectures were a little hard to follow sometimes",
                "I really enjoyed the in person lab components of the class  it was such a privilege given the mainly virtual year",
                "Strengths: Man-ki is truly a delight and wants the best for his students. He'll stay after to help, come early, and responds lightning-fast on slack. The psets are very straightforward and useful for learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Be prepared for the exam to look nothing at all like the psets! The exam is math-based, and comes mostly from the lecture content. I personally think the exam should've been split up into bi-weekly psets\/quizzes, so that we had a chance to practice the math \/ ensure we understood the content as we went along. (and then obviously have an actual exam at the end, too)",
                "The strengths of this course include Man-Ki's extremely clear and helpful slides (including code!), well-written Github assignments, amazing helpfulness and diligence in person and on Slack, and fun lab, complete with rainbow keyboards and x-box controllers. I have no weaknesses to say - I honestly learned so much and it wasn't too much work at all.",
                "The strengths of this class are the breadth of topics covered, the \"coolness\" of the projects, and the helpfulness of Professor Man-Ki. It was a lot of fun to watch the car become smarter and smarter and complete laps on the lab track. However, the breadth of the topics meant that we didn't go super deep into any one area. Labs were always a bit rushed, and especially towards the end of the class with the final project, things felt a bit disorganized.",
                "It was a lot of fun to write code for the car and see it working. There were also a lot of interesting topics covered, albeit not too much in-depth. The lectures were sometimes a little dry, and it was often frustrating to work with machine learning, but other than that the course was good.",
                "This course taught several really important components that go into self-driving car software systems. However many of these components felt like atomic modules. It would be helpful for contextual understanding if more time was spent investigating the connections between these different approaches and solutions to self driving."

Virtual engagement was also very high when we had stellar guest speakers from NVIDIA and Intel talk about autonomous driving in their companies.",

                "This course was very effective at creating a mix of virtual lectures and in-person labs. When going over new material the course was taught virtually. This allowed us to meet in-person to work only on the components of the class that necessitated being together."

                "Yes! Its such a great CS elective",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student - even during COVID-19, we were able to work on programming and testing our cars in person, and it was extremely rewarding to see our cars perform lane following, obstacle detection, and traffic sign detection. I am a physics major who did not take 223, yet Man-Ki was super kind in letting me into the class and helping me throughout the semester. Anyone interested in autonomous driving who has some background in Python should take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes project\/lab courses. There aren't many CS electives that require you to test out code on a physical machine, and I loved the hands-on feeling of the class. Prof Man-Ki is also great and is willing to go above and beyond to help students understand the material. The material itself was kind of all over the place which made the final difficult to prepare for, but seeing the car race around the track was definitely worth the minor headaches along the way.",
                "Yes, definitely. You get to develop your own self-driving car and see it working. Everything is doable and Man-Ki is very helpful if things go wrong. We cover a lot of topics at the surface level, so it is a good way to expose yourself to many different things in computer science.",
                "I would. It's a really fun and rewarding class. By the end of the semester things started to really come together and the project became really cool. Integrating driving, stop sign recognition and more happened all at the same time and within a few hours our car was very capable. One thing to note is that the workload was fairly low throughout the semester, but increased significantly towards the end of the semester, when the final projects and final presentation were due - which also co-occurred with the finals and final projects of other classes."
