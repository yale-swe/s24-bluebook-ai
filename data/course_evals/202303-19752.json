                "By taking this course, I developed knowledge of using machines such as the welder and cast maker through observation of demonstrations. It was crucial to know which protective equipment to wear and I developed skills such as carving and attaching metal pieces together with planning. I also developed insights of working with others to perform tasks and communicating ideas during presentations.",
                "I acquired proficiency in working with metal as a sculptural material. I learned techniques such as welding, grinding, finishing, cutting, bending, and casting.",
                "All the basics plus more. Feel confident utilizing skills in other metal shops outside of Yale. Appreciated situating the course in contemporary arts conversations. Made working with metal accessible while not short-changing us on our potential as beginners.",

                "I gained an understanding of basic metal working skills and machinery. Over the course of the semester I became more comfortable in the shop and developed the ability to work independently with the guidance of my professor and peers. I discovered my love for making. I learned to be comfortable with failure and redevelop a plan when a certain technique wasn't working out."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were the wide range of options of machines to work with and create pieces for each assignment. I enjoyed the breadth of the assignments that allowed me to think of what kind of area I wanted to focus on with metal, such as nature (mountains and field) or the sun, as well as with the shape of a pan. One weakness of the course was the difficulty in narrowing down my focus. I feel like if I were given more time I may have thought of something different for two of my pieces. I believe this could be improved with a brief talk with Professor Desmond in class about what direction I should take with regards to the focus of my piece. However, I really enjoyed the assignments and appreciated how Professor Desmond allowed us to share the inspiration and creation process of the pieces at the end of the development process.\r\nI loved getting to know my classmates better and asking them for help or advice as I worked on my piece during class and during studio office hours. One thing that I thoroughly enjoyed as well during class was the artist focus as I enjoyed observing the sculptures that are located in different cities around the world, each with the specific design style of the artist. It was inspiring to see how large and real-life the sculptures stand through the photos and I hope to come across some of them some day. I thought it was also intriguing how some of the sculptures such as water dams are used for real purposes related to energy and located in rural areas of the country, which were videoed using hovercrafts. I think this is amazing and shows the extent to which metal is used for both artistic and viewing pleasure as well as practical, life-supporting and -sustaining purposes. \r\nI believe another strength of this course was the demonstrations outside of casting as well as molding. In addition, I thought the blowing up of the metal calf using the fire torch and fire blanket was so amazing. I really appreciated how Professor Desmond allowed us to go outside and work with tools and machinery, as well as observe demonstrations as they were very intriguing and helpful in the idea inspiration and creation process of my own works!",
                "The class meets only once a week, with a duration of four hoursa brief amount of time. In addition to the four hours, time must be allocated at the metal shop (to become familiar with the machines and complete projects). The shop operates within restricted hours, necessitating adaptability to the schedule.",
                "Assignments were balanced by being open enough and requiring a technical skill (such as use of rivets, no finishing, etc)",
                "The professor is extremely generous with his time and effort, ensuring that all students get to experiment and achieve what they want. Guidance at every step of the way. Personally, it was an unprecedented level of help from a professor, who was invested in our work.",
                "The shop training\/ demos were helpful and informative and time to work in class was always appreciated. There was not a lot of learning about artists who work with metal but I liked that this class was more focused on building skills.",
                "Strengths: assignments are SUPER open. never take them at face value. Not a weakness but a warning: it's all trial and error, and you need to spend real time in the shop to become acclimated to the tools and environment.",
                "A major strength of the course was the classroom environment. Desmond was such a supportive instructor creating an environment where everyone felt heard and unafraid to ask questions. I was able to connect with my peers over the struggles of trying a new medium and rely on them for assistance. This was my favorite course of the semester. I always wanted to be working in the shop because of the gratifying nature of seeing improvement and an new found appreciation for steel."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I believe the variety of options in the assignments, locations of class work, and free studio office hours were all wonderful. This class made me want to take another sculpture in metal class during my time at Yale. The instructors were very helpful and quick to offer advice on how to approach the metal sculpting so that I could achieve the type of result and piece that I wanted. In addition, I was happy to get help from my peers and ask them for advice or thoughts on how to improve my piece. Finally, I loved the time outside of class time during studio office hours and the in-class presentations of artists and famous metal sculptors to learn more about their creation processes, design inspirations, and works that span the world. It was truly inspiring and eye-opening!",
                "This class has been my favorite at Yale so farit was enjoyable and rewarding. I must caution you about the workloadit's quite intense. Personally, I found myself spending over 20 hours in the shop every week.",
                "Yes. Fills a gap within the art school. Actually learned skills and problem solving abilities for building projects, esp as a graduate student.",
                "Yes, if they have the time, they should absolutely take this. Challenges you in a different intellectual way with workshop + group crit sessions, great access to school of art students and resources, a ton of fun and you can really make exciting things here.",
                "If the student is driven to put in a lot of time in the shop, yes.",
                "Yes, it was my favorite course so far.",
                "Absolutely. I had never worked with metal before this semester and now cannot imagine my practice without it. If you are even somewhat interested in sculpture and intrigued by industrial materials (or maybe you just want to say you can weld), take this class. It will open up a whole new world for you if you let it.",
                "I would recommend this course if one is willing to take themselves seriously and put in the time. A majority of the students in the class were artists who understood the time consuming nature of a creative medium. However, metal especially for a beginner is very finicky. You will need to practice a lot outside of class and remake elements of your projects."
