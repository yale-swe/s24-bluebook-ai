   "comments": [
    "A strength of this class was that is encouraged students to speak more with Spanish but a weakness was that I feel a lot of the stories we read would have confusing in English so they were very difficult in Spanish.",
    "This class is kind of boring.",
    "Weakness: Changing assignments from what is written on the syllabus; too many assessments",
    "I really liked all the stories, but class time was really boring.",
    "This course was strong due to its frequency, rigor, and discussion-based classroom dynamic that allowed for lots of verbal practice and productive collaboration. It could be improved by incorporating more multi-media assignments (like Spanish movies, music, and cultural materials).",
    "The strength of the course was the use of different forms of media to help the students learn Spanish.  The weakness was that many of the assessments were very close to each other, so some of the materials learned was not tested.",
    "This course could be improved with way more focus on grammar. I felt as if the grammar lessons were often rushed to accommodate reviewing homework from the previous night or something.",
    "The immersive nature of the course is very helpful. I felt like it improved my listening skills a lot. The weaknesses are class size. My class was too big, so not everyone could speak every day and often it felt like we were rushing through activities to get to everyone. In a class where participation and class engagement are so key, I think the class size could have been smaller to allow for more people to speak more.",
    "Strengths: meets frequently \r\nWeaknesses: extreme workload",
    "There was too much packed into this course. Each day, there were several items on the syllabus that we were supposed to do in class, but we never got to all of them because we spent time reviewing the homework or responding to questions. Professor Mayer seemed rushed and pressured to get through all the material, to the point that she was sometimes hesitant to respond to questions fully or elaborate on grammar points. I don't think this is her fault. I'm not sure how she was supposed to fit everything in when activities inevitably took a while. The quality of each activity would have been improved if there were fewer of them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there were TOO MANY STUDENTS in this course! We had eighteen students, which meant that if you talked once each day in class, you were lucky. This is unacceptable from a Yale language class; I saw better in my public high school. The group work we did slightly improved this situation, since it gave more people a chance to talk, but there really should have been twelve or fewer students in order to hold students accountable for their work and provide time for speaking and listening in class."

   "comments": [
    "I mean you have to take it so no, but most people don't have a choice. The only reason it was bad was because it was everyday so it was a greater time committment than my other classes both in class time and work, but for something that I didn't enjoy. I think this is why most kids were really unengaged during class.",
    "Yes  this course will help you to improve your language skills, and lead you a few steps closer to fluency!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has a bit of a lighter schedule, as the workload and the fact that you have to meet every day can wear on you.",
    "Overall, yes. My Spanish improved quite a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "No.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good continuation of level 2 in terms of grammar and enhancing speaking\/listening skills. The course also incorporates more culture into the learning, which I enjoyed.",
    "Yes-good course",
    "I liked SPAN 130 better than SPAN 120. There are plenty of problems with the course: the work gets old after a while, and since it meets every day, it can be really hard to stay engaged and focused. That said, this course was overall well organized. The first part of the semester was a lot of review of SPAN 120 concepts, which seemed boring at first but actually really helped to reinforce them and give us a strong foundation. Then we moved to more advanced grammar and actually got through a lot of content. There were movies and readings, which were pretty enjoyable and intelligent-seeming (with the exception of the final book, which was boring and felt a little infantile). I would recommend this class, with the usual reservations that it's a language class that meets every day, it's too large, you have to be prepared to do work every day, and you will get out exactly as much as you put in."
