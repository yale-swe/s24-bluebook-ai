                "I think that the biggest weakness of the course was how fast it moves. It is difficult to keep up with how much material is being presented, especially because we have the class every day. The asynchronous day was very helpful in going over what we had just learned in class and prepping for the next ones since we were moving so quickly. I do think, however, that having the class every day is very important. It aided my learning significantly to go to class each day and practice with other people. I think that placing more of an emphasis on learning vocabulary would be helpful in this course.",
                "It is a bit difficult to enter this class as a student who has no prior Spanish knowledge because the professor only speaks in Spanish. Because I knew a bit of Spanish from high school, I was able to understand some of the things talked about in class, but I knew that some of my peers struggled.",
                "The strengths include the fact that we have class almost every day which creates a routine for repetition and solidifying knowledge. I also liked the conversations we had to have with a native speaker every 2 weeks because we got to apply what we had learned and get comfortable with coming up with answers to questions we didnt expect.",
                "The remote work day was very helpful in giving me time to prepare and catch up on course work. The small class size was also really beneficial in making our class feel like a community"
