                "We were exposed to a large variety of philosophies of mathematics; we began with Kant, then Frege, intuitionists (e.g. Brouwer), structuralists, etc. Given this survey-style approach, we were able to understand and compare a number of vastly different philosophies, evaluate them, discuss them, and then decide which one (if any) we found most persuasive. The course content is especially helpful for Math + Philosophy majors, since you get a really broad understanding of the major schools of the philosophy of mathematics since Kant that can serve as an ample starting point for further research.",
                "I gained knowledge of some important schools in philosophy of mathematics, especially foundations of mathematics. One insight I'm taking away is that the source and extent of the certainty of mathematics is still an open question.",
                "Learned a ton about the different views on the foundations of mathematics.",
                "This was my first philosophy class, so I learned a lot about how philosophers think and how to read philosophy papers. In general, we covered a new perspective on the philosophy of mathematics each week, and so we got a fairly broad introduction to the subject.",

The weekly reading responses also helped me distill my thoughts about different positions into strong and cogent arguments for or against them. I now feel like I have a much more stolid understanding of where math comes from and the purpose it serves in discourse."

                "Strengths: Sun-Joo!!!! Professor Shin is so fun and engaging. I've taken a few classes with her, and every time she makes the class so enjoyable. Cannot recommend Professor Shin highly enough. Professor Shin read each of our assignments very quickly and gave thorough notes/comments for each. I also enjoyed the structure of the class (presentation each week from a group + Sun-Joo's support, weekly reading reports, abstract presentations, and final paper). The structure facilitated discussion participation from everyone in the class, whose students came from a wide mix of math/philosophy/CS/physics and tangential majors. \r\nWeaknesses: none--wish I could continue it into next semester!",
                "I think the readings are quite good and the weekly reports really motivated me to engage substantively with the material. I think we should have done some more ground work before jumping into the different theories, though. For instance, we spent a huge amount of our time discussing whether mathematical objects exist, but from what I remember we never really talked about what it would mean for a mathematical object to exist. Things like that made me feel like I couldn't follow the conversation at times.",
                "The material of the course is interesting and the readings were very carefully selected to be short but substantial. Each week two students explained the reading for that week in class, and then Professor Shin gave more context and prepared us for the next weeks reading. I think that this facilitated active discussion in class, but I think I would have learned more if I heard more from Professor Shin, who was an excellent and passionate teacher.",
                "Professor Shin runs the class exceptionally well, while managing to be rather hands off. Probably the best run course of my Yale career: Shin intentionally keeps readings low, and requires weekly reading responses, encourage students to do them; each week, students present on the week's material, which gives you space to actively challenge them. When needed, Professor Shin will interject to ensure the views are treated fairly.",
                "interesting subject matter, its a survey course though, so maybe a little more depth in a couple of topics would be interesting",
                "Strengths: Prof Shin is a Yale treasure - she is as entertaining as she is brilliant at teaching, and always has something witty yet informative to say in seminar. For the most part, this course was also flipped classroom (with a different pair of students introducing material each week), which also felt more relaxed and enjoyable than the usual seminar style. Weaknesses: Because of the flipped classroom, sometimes seminar would drag along slowly if it felt more lecture-like than discussion-like, but Prof Shin did a good job of trying to ensure that each class had a balance of both."

                "Absolutely! You get a good overview of the philosophy of mathematics, the course structure facilitates discussion and participations. I enjoyed hearing the different perspectives people had, especially as the students came from a wide range of majors (for instance, the math majors tended to favor platonist accounts). Readings were meaningful and interesting. Sun-Joo is great.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. Professor Shin is fantastic (in and out of class). The material is quite interesting and fairly diverse. There's also a nice mix of straight philosophy majors, math majors, etc. in the class, and people tended to be quite engaged. I think we could've allotted more of our class time to discussion rather than the presentations, which were helpful but sometimes felt more like review of the readings, but that's my only complaint.",
                "Hard to say whether you'll like this course. The material can be both very challenging and very abstract, which is a tough combination because it can leave you feeling like you not only don't understand, but aren't even sure that the questions being asked matter. If thinking a lot about questions like \"what is a number?\" is up your ally you'll definitely like the course. Even though there were several discussions I left feeling unsatisfied, I still enjoyed engaging with the ideas in the readings and overall I'm glad I took the course.",
                "Absolutely, if this is a topic they're interested in.",
                "Yes! Any course with Professor Shin is fantastic, and this course is a great survey of the philosophy of mathematics.",
                "If you are a mathematician or an analytic philosopher, a course on the philosophy of mathematics has the opportunity to be eye-opening. For mathematicians, it opens up the possibility of discourse on issues that affect the profession, and for philosophers it exposes the oddity and uniqueness of mathematical thought. As a philosophically minded mathematician, I rank this course as one of the finest I have ever taken.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. The material may not be very useful for mathematicians, but is relevant and should be very interesting. I think this is an excellent humanities for math people, since it gives a different perspective on the foundations of mathematics. Most of the students in the course seemed to be familiar with math, but you will not really do any proofs or computations in this class.",
                "Yes, it's a wonderfully run course, and comprehensively goes over the different groundings of Mathematics. It will be difficult to take the course and *not* emerge with an understanding Mathematics' groundings.",
                "yes, definitely",
                "If you're interested in how math is special and what philosophical privileges it enjoys, you must take this course, especially if it's with Prof Shin. The positions I engaged with in this course were highly formative to my philosophical views."
