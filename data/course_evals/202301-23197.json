                "The syllabus was strong and discussion sections were great, but the course had many weaknesses. First of all, it was poorly organized. We received assignment prompts much later than they were promised to us and received minimal extensions in light of the delays. I have a very poor sense of how I'm doing in the course because I've only received one essay grade this entire semester. In speaking with peers, it seemed like the whole class was incredibly frustrated with how poor the organization and communication was. Further, lectures were incredibly boring. Given how small the class was, a seminar-style format would have been far more conducive to learning. Instead, dry lectures that merely summarized the readings led to low attendance and low engagement with the class. It was a shame because the subject matter is so exciting, yet the execution was so disappointing.",
                "The strength of this course was the diversity of content. Weakness are that the professor did not make it engaging, we rushed through much of the content forcing us to make our own conclusions with the readings, and it felt that the way we navigated these different philosophers lacked cohesion.",
                "Lectures were good",
                "This course is very disorganized. Given that this is an intro level course, you would expect that students be given lots if feedback on their assignments to ensure that they are able to learn and grow from their prior errors. However, I have only received feedback on 1 of 3 assignments. I have no access to what my grade would be, nor do I know how I am even doing in this class since before spring break when we received the first assignments grade and feedback.",
                "Lecture was filled with a lot of information, and became redundant after a while. The professor has such great insight which helped in terms of understanding course material, but the course went too quick to really digest a lot of it",
                "very content heavy but very detailed",

                "I would recommend this introductory course in Political Philosophy. I think I could have benefitted by being more consistent with my readings - I felt at times that it was tough for me to recall some of the work of the different philosophers we covered. I wish I could have done a better job with preparing. Our lecture slides were comprehensive, which was great for referencing. I had difficulties at times finding ways to contribute, but Political Philosophy is no small task to take on. To future students, I would say to be successful, you should make sure you read the texts and have a solid understanding of what they are before coming to lecture to get the full experience - block out a couple hours to look through the texts and gain some insights.",
