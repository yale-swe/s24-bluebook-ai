                "Knowledge of intellectual history and social theory, concrete essay writing skills.",
                "My professor brought with her a unique perspective in teaching the texts we read. She sought to not only make sure we understood the texts we read, but also understand that there were multiple ways to read a text, either by itself or in conversation with other texts. Her sharp analytical perspective enriched our knowledge surrounding the texts and made class fun and interesting.\r\n\r\nI learned how to produce consistent good quality writing. My professor was very helpful in sharing resources to better our writing and holding mini-workshops for us to brainstorm how to write better. She also provided feedback on not only the content of my essays, but also on the writing itself. I'm grateful to her for making me a better writer.",
                "Thorough understanding of the foundations of modern political thought.",
                "In this course, I was able to develop critical reading skills, conversational skills, critical thinking skills, as well as writing. For this course, we read many different texts around history and politics, and for each text, an emphasis was placed on understanding what message the author was trying to get across as well as what was left out. We analyzed what the vocabulary meant for each time period in the authors context, and we compared/contrast the texts we had read with each other to better understand them. In terms of conversational skills, during discussions, we learned how to differentiate our voice from that of the authors when we spoke of the texts. Moreover, we practiced our critical thinking skills when selecting passages to discuss during class as well as to write about for our essays. In terms of writing, this course placed a great emphasis on practicing our writing skills. We were taught to make our essays clear, and concise.",
                "I gained insight into the evolution of modern political ethics (Machiavelli), concerns (freedom and democracy, abstract vs. \"concrete\" rights), and systems (democracy and its relationship to tyranny (Tocqueville), Capitalism and Communism, totalitarianism as a 20th century phenomenon).",
                "I learned a lot about more modern political theory from Machiavelli to Arendt. The second semester of DS H&P definitely focused more on political theory than on history but it was super interesting. I also improved in writing papers on political thought.",
                "Developed a working understanding of the seminal political works that comprise the modern European canon",
                "I learned how to glean important information out of dense texts and engage in discussion with those of different political viewpoints.",
                "Close reading skills and knowledge of different foundational texts in political theory",
                "It was so fascinating to see how and where and when many of the ideas we have today concerning property, rights, individualism, equality, and the philosophy/trajectory of history came from."

                "Strengths: Directed Studies H&P in the spring, I feel, is much more diverse than the fall in terms of the texts and authors that we read. We got exposed to authors writing in various key moments throughout world history, spanning different times and geographies. This diversity continues to foster an intellectual rigor, and the process of grappling with the texts continues to be a challenging but rewarding process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. I would have liked to have spent more time on certain texts, but overall, I have absolutely no complaints about DS H&P. It is simply magical.",
                "Amazingly thorough course load and conversations.",
                "Apart from learning to read the texts critically, this course placed an emphasis on developing writing skills which was extremely helpful.",
                "This course generally spent the same amount of time on each text, even when some were more difficult to grasp conceptually than others. I would have appreciated spending more time on the question of how we should think about history, for example, which we explored through Hegel and Kant, among others implicitly. The question of whether history is circular or linear or something else would have been nice to set aside and focus on together/during a seminar lesson, to compare different thinkers' thoughts. This ended up being a question one could explore in a final essay, but having chosen to do otherwise, I still think it would've been productive to have this conversation and synthesize new texts with 1st semester DS.",
                "I mean DS is all about breadth over depth which is just something you have to know going in but there are definitely moments where I wished I had a more complete understanding of a certain text. Especially some of them that we only spent one day on. Also the exam was unnecessarily difficult. There is no reason H&P should have two essays when the other two subjects only have one.",
                "Final exam seemed largely unnecessary unnecessary and largely extraneous to course material another essay seems more fitting",

DS is not only a course of study, but also a family. Your professors and fellow students will push you to become not only a better student, but a better critical thinker and person.",
                "Absolutely  this course is an excellent foundation for modern political thought.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The books we read in this course gave me a clear picture of texts that influenced history and the politics we see today. Through discussing these texts during class, we were able to connect them to our present day society and see how far we have come and how we can improve. Additionally, the reading and writing practices during this course were extremely helpful and I am certain the texts we read will be beneficial throughout the rest of my Yale years.",
                "Yes: this was my favorite DS course of the second semester because of how it clarified the foundations behind modern political decisions for me.",

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who took DS first semester and liked it. I found that I actually liked the Greek and Roman texts much more than the ones from second semester (to my surprise), but there are still some amazing books this semester (now that I'm home for the summer I plan to read pretty much everything Arendt and Du Bois ever wrote...). Be careful about burnout, though -- writing an essay a week can get a bit exhausting, even if it felt manageable first semester.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, as well as DS in general. It lays the foundation for future intellectual endeavors to be based upon and I can't wait to re-read some of the works over again this summer (which I never thought I would say)!"
