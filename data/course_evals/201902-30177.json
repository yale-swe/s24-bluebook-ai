    "The basics of psychology as a field of study and the basics of the human mind",
    "Not a great deal besides the basics and common sense, knowledge which I already possessed.",
    "I was able to learn more about psychology and the different fields that it includes. As well as learning about more physical things such as the brain and body, I also learned about more mental things, such as mental disorders and developmental growth. I learned how to study more on my own and how to properly prepare for college classes.",
    "I learned about broad knowledge on different fields of psychology, from its history to how they can be applied. I enjoyed the part where I could learn about. psychological disorders and therapies, which I didnt have a lot of opportunities to learn about before. I also developed my skill of discussion. Each student had to write two discussion questions for each session, and as I prepare more questions, I could feel myself being better at preparing discussions and actually discussing about different topics in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covered a large range of topics which was really great, but some topics were skimmed over while others were focused on heavily such as memory and sleep, when I wish everything was touched on equally and topics such as mental health were touched on more",
    "The major weakness of the course was all of the discussion sessions which we had. I didnt feel that I gained much, if any knowledge from the professor and TA answering our questions. I would rather have been lectured to and actually learned during these sections, rather than having to watch all the lectures on my own.",
    "Strengths: A lot of contents in the lectures that can help students to get a broad sense for psychology in a relatively short period of time. The examples given by professor were humorous and were helpful for me to remember. Instructors are professional and responsible.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the videos and readings were a bit too much for Wednesday, given the situation that my other course has so many reading materials.",
    "As an online course, it was very convenient and rather easy to use. All the expected coursework was clearly laid out, and multiple resources were given that allowed students to succeed. Additionally, the zoom classes were, although confusing at first to use, fairly easy to understand after my second or third time using it. I don't really see any clear weakness of this course; all the weaknesses that I see were mainly due to poor decision-making and procrastination on my part.",
    "I think the strength of this course was that the information was not only broad but also deep. In the limited amount of time, we observed different aspects and fields of psychology, and learned about broad range of topics. However, even though the topics were really broad, they were not shallow, and actually were really deep and therefore I could take lots of informations in every session. However, there were some parts that could be improved. Since we had to learn broad and deep information, we had to read a lot of articles and write a lot of questions, and sometimes they were demanding."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would! I loved the summer format of this course and the instructor was GREAT",
    "No I would not recommend this class to another student, because I feel that the exams were very unfair in actually assessing my knowledge about the course.",
    "Yes. For especially beginners in Psychology or those who would like to try Psych, this course is literally the best choice. Making this course online can make it easier for international students to take and can give students another way to communicate with each other, which is actually really fun. Learning classes by watching videos can guarantee a free studying schedule, and also make it much more convenient for students to retrieve vague memories by rewatching the videos when review for the tests.",
    "Yes, I would. As someone who is considering majoring in psychology, this course was a good introduction to the subject. I was able to learn about the basic foundations of psychology and the different branches of psychology. Even for those not even considering majoring in psychology, it was a fun class to take,  as I was able to learn the reasoning behind certain behaviors and more insight on the human consciousness.",
    "Yes. This course guides you through the different fields with deep information about those fields, and therefore I think this is one of the most important courses if a student are planning to be a future psychologist. This course is good for students who are starting to pursue their future career as psychologists, or students who are trying to find the right field of psychology for them."
