                "A profound understanding of Homer and the Iliad. This is my third course with Professor Bakker, but there is still a lot of new material I learned this go-around. You will learn a lot about meter, Homeric linguistics, Homeric reception, and oral poetry",
                "My ancient Greek greatly improved as well as my knowledge of Homer's Iliad. The scholarship Professor Bakker assigned was also very illuminating.",
                "Your Homeric Greek will improve so much with the sheer amount of lines you will read in this course. You also get a grasp of the entire narrative of the Iliad, as you will read the entire thing in English alongside the sections you read in Greek. Finally, you learn about the different perspectives Homeric scholars have on the Iliad through reading of secondary scholarship.",
                "This course immerses students in the intricacies of Homeric Greek. Careful attention is devoted to linguistic analysis, translation, and literary study. If you keep up with the readings, your reading fluency will no doubt improve by the end of term!",
                "I gained familiarity with Homeric meter, language, and style, the structure of the Iliad, and different schools of Homerists.",
                "I read a lot of Homer, talked about the origin of the poetry, and the big questions and different schools of thought in Homeric scholarship."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths--exposure to a true Homer expert. Any question that has an answer Prof Bakker can answer. I swear he must have this entire poem memorized, the way he can just draw examples as if from a hat. He is truly a genius, especially with regard to Homer. The class also forces you to read a ton, which is good practice for any serious classics student. It has been so satisfying to go through the entirety of the Iliad this semester, talking about almost everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--The class is a bit disorganized at times. Prof Bakker would mention quizzes but there would be no announcements or Canvas notifications, and once I showed up to class not even knowing there was a quiz. The readings also get a little cumbersome at times. I feel like we could get more out of the Greek readings if they were a little bit more manageable. Workload is huge",
                "This class was great! I loved the consistent structure of 100-150 lines of Greek, a book of the Iliad every class and an article once a week. I think this class gave me a very strong introduction to the Iliad. I perhaps wish graded work had been spread more evenly over the semester (I worked hard throughout the semester, but felt a bit overwhelmed that 80% of the grade was riding on the final exam and end of term written work).",
                "The strengths are the reading you complete in the course and the extensive knowledge the instructor brings to the class. However, it was an immense amount of reading at times that was too much. 150+ lines of Greek for one class could feel excessive and more stressful than what it was worth. Finally, it was frustrating that 80% of the grade of the class rested on final assignments due during finals week. Dispersing the work throughout the semester would have been much better and less stressful.",
                "This course offers a rigorous introduction to Homer's Iliad, with significant portions (> 3,000 lines total) assigned in Greek the entirety read in English. The selections focused on in Greek are well-chosen and the weekly assignments were supplemented well with secondary scholarship. It was also interesting and helpful to learn more about different types of Homerists  (unitarians, oralists, neo-analysts, etc.) and their theories about the making of the Homeric text.",
                "We had a great balance of broader discussion of the poem overall and translation of the day's Greek assignment. The secondary readings were varied and exciting.",
                "Prof Bakker is very knowledgeable and I learned a lot every day. Weakness is that it seemed disorganized at times especially with most of the assessment for the final grade coming right at the end of the semester."

                "I would strongly recommend this course to a serious classics student with the caveat that it is a ton of work. Be prepared to be reading almost two hundred lines of Greek, a 30+ page scholarly article, and an entire book of the Iliad in English for every single class. It never stops, including when there are quizzes. At the end of the semester, you then have to prepare for an exam on 3000+ lines in addition to a 20 page final paper. This class is SERIOUS work, and I did not expect that coming in. However, the experience is incredibly enjoyable. Anyone who wants to continue with classics will have to encounter classes with workloads like this, so it's important to start sometime. Prof. Bakker is very fair and understanding, and overall I am very glad I took this course. I can't possibly quantify how much of Homer I have learned.",
                "Yes! Anyone who wants to learn more about Homeric Greek and the Iliad would enjoy this course.",
                "I would recommend the course, but warn any student that it is a high workload. You will learn so much from the course and at its conclusion, you will be able to look back and reflect on how much you have learned over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes, if you are a committed student of Ancient Greek who would like to take to a higher level and immerse yourself in one of the most texts foundational texts in the tradition!",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in Homer! We read a LOT of the Iliad; so much that we didn't have time for a midterm and had a mountain of end-of-term work. But it was exciting to see my understanding of Homeric Greek and the overall context of the Iliad grow so quickly.",
                "Yes! You will learn a lot."
