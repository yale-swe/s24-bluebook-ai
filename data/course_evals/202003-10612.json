The readings were often repetitive and from incomplete literature-- the book we read for the class was a draft with references and editing notes instead of useful information in some places.  Throughout the semester small groups of students gave presentations discussing a chapter from the unfinished book that lasted the entirety of the 110 minute seminar.\r\nI would have benefitted from more discussion.",
