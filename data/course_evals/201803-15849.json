   "comments": [
    "I am a significantly better and more confident Spanish speaker and writer.",
    "I definitely improve my spanish speaking abilities.",
    "1.\tThroughout this course, I have improved my conversational and compositional Spanish skills tremendously. Many aspects of the language which I previously had to think through (preterit vs.  imperfect, indicative vs. subjunctive, etc.) are now intuitive. Through the readings, novels, and short films assigned in the class, I have a better understanding of contemporary and historic Hispanic culture. I am now at a point where I would consider myself fluent in the language to the extent that I would feel comfortable spending time in a Spanish-speaking country and interacting exclusively in Spanish.",
    "I think I definitely developed better grammar and speaking skills in this class. In addition, the different movies and works of literature were able to help me better under the Spanish culture. I liked that I was urged to try my hardest in this class -- due to Sebastian, I had less of a problem speaking Spanish out loud. I was no longer afraid of making mistakes because I knew they were welcome.",
    "It really served as a forum for me to practice my Spanish regularly. My grammar and writing skills were also really helped by this course.",
    "This class was great for gaining confidence speaking\/conversing in Spanish.",
    "My Spanish improved immensely, and I gained a lot of fluency."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is amazing because of the professor, and the course fluctuated between very interesting information and less interesting information. When the readings inspired interesting, dynamic discussions, the class was wonderful, but at times the material was dense and boring and the discussions were not as good because of it.",
    "A lot of busy work and sometimes assignments were unclear.",
    "3.\tStrengths: The readings were very insightful and interesting. There was a lot of work assigned but it rarely ever felt tedious or excessive. With regards to the structure of the class, I really enjoyed the in-class discussions, which really helped to cement understanding of the readings. The feedback on the assignments was always very insightful, and actually helped me address the mistakes that I was making regularly.\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have utilized technology like the Canvas platform in a more interactive and involved way. Although the online discussion forums were insightful, I would prefer if they were more conversational between the students instead of having each student post a paragraph or two and leave it at that.",
    "I think that the main and overall strength in this course is that it was able to help me improve my Spanish greatly. I think that because of this course, I would like to take more Spanish courses here at Yale. The only problem I ever had with this course was the syllabus. I felt as though the syllabus was set up in a way that confused me and caused me to mix up assignments.",
    "I think there could be less busy-work given. I would want more group and individual projects in the course -- projects that allowed us to really explore our interests through the lens of Spanish.",
    "Not a lot of grammar review, lots of in class conversational opportunities",
    "It's a great course. It's a lot of work, but the syllabus is well-organized and it has a good balance of types of material."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as a way to improve your Spanish before taking a higher level literature course. It is a good place to make mistakes and get better at the language.",
    "Yes, Sebastian is a great Professor and the classes are fun. He really wants you to improve your spanish and there are really a lot of resources available to ensure that improvement. If I wanted to improve my spanish I would definitely take this course.",
    "Yes, I feel like I definitely improved my Spanish abilities.",
    "9.\tI would definitely recommend this course as the ideal first-year L5 Spanish class. I have made drastic improvements in my language skills. However, I cannot vouch for the other sections of the class, as I have heard that it varies widely between different instructors.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to another student. I think that this course is the best \"beginner\" course for L5 students. I like that this course set up in a way that allows students to learn and improve on their Spanish.",
    "I would, but only if you are really excited about fine-tuning your Spanish skills. A lot of attention is paid to the small mistakes that a lot of other courses tend to ignore.",
    "Yes, this course is great for someone who just wants to keep their Spanish freshgreat",
    "This course has a VERY high workload--expect the normal work for a 1.5 credit language class, but for only 1 credit. That said, it's a great class and your Spanish will become much more natural and fluent! Professor Diaz is an absolute sweetheart, more chill than he seems, and he'll do his utmost to make sure you succeed."
