Or just pay attention to lecture.",

I learned how to solve boolean minimization problems, design Moore/Mealy FSMs and implement them using gates/wires, perform timing analyses, use Verilog for electronics problems, and apply MIPS and LC-3 assembly.

                "I enjoyed the labs! They were challenging but fun.",
                "I think that the course was well taught but sometimes the information was presented in a confusing way.",
                "If more context can be given to the material then a lot more students would understand what's going on.",
                "Most of the beginning half of this course was well taught and relatively interesting. That being said, the pacing of the course was insane. I do not think I have been in a course before where so much information had to be processed so fast to keep up. Part of the problem was that Professor Panda wrote all of the annotations on the slides instead of writing them during class, this turned times that she should have been writing on the board for us to follow along and process information into tests of how fast one could physically copy down notes. There were also many parts of the course where the topics covered were too complicated to put on the exams (such as going over a 4/4 divider circuit). If these parts were cut out and the time gained from them was used to spend more time on the material that was covered too fast I think the course would greatly improve. Additionally, the last 4-5 weeks of class consisted mostly of staring at the diagrams of LC-3 and MIPS processors and talking about them until they made sense. There is no way that this is the most effective way to teach this topic. I am not sure specifically how one could teach about these processors in a better way but I am confident there is one.",
                "At times the information was really interesting, but some lectures were extremely boring. We spent way too much time on adders, and I would have liked to do more examples in class. Labs were hard and exhuasting.",
                "Course covers a lot of content. The lectures were sometimes hard to follow, but more of the shear volume of content we learned. On the other hand, you really get some scope on how cpus work and its cool to see how far youve come at the end.",
                "Strength: labs are fun and you learn A LOT.\r\nWeakness: Too much content crammed into one class.  Not a lot of practice material outside of coursework for us to master the content, so I would say it focused more on breadth rather than depth. The midterm practical was not a great experience - we had maybe two lectures on Verilog code, definitely not experts. There is a lot of workload for this class, be prepared to spend over 15 hours on labs and assignments combined in some weeks.",
                "Strengths: the course is really interesting and the problem sets are quite extensive. The labs are also very useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the pace of the course (especially in the second half) was really fast, and we did have to refer other sources than the main textbook. Also, the final included material covered in class but not on the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: Professor Panda, posted lecture slides are complete and have lots of examples, exams are fair and based on the content learned in lecture, flow of class from low-level to high-level concepts is very natural\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement: Would be helpful to have more ULA availability",
                "Lectures were unclear. It would be better to have more slightly smaller problem sets to practice the concepts",
                "The labs were great! Using a FPGA board we got to program into existence different parts of a computer processor. Most importantly, I learned Verilog which is a super valuable industry skill. The lectures went too fast for me, but the textbook was good, so most of the time I didn't go to class and just read the textbook instead.",
                "lighten content of lectures",
                "Strengths: passionate, committed professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the labs were very difficult if you don't have prior coding experience. FPGA code is not very intuitive and very hard to debug (especially, as I said, if you are new to coding)\r\nLectures moved too quickly",
                "Good content; only 1 TA with limited additional resources. The textbook is pretty good, but other than that it's difficult to get outside help. However, Panda was great about setting up meetings when I missed classes due to covid.",

                "This course completely changed from past years and the workload was a lot greater. There was a lot of content covered, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a lot harder than other engineering classes. Be prepared to do a LOT for this class including labs and assignments. If you don't have a good CS background, all I can say is good luck and rip. Be prepared to learn how to code in Verilog in two lectures.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is really interesting, but be aware that the material can be quite challenging.",
                "YES - absolutely!! This is an amazing class if you are in EE, EECS, CS, or any engineering / physical sciences major. The principles that you will learn in this course are foundational to further study in many fields. More abstractly, the process of taking a complex problem and distilling it to the most essential parts is a really important skill that you will take away from EENG 201. You can take EENG 201 before or after EENG 200.",
                "The material in this class is very relevant for any form of computer engineering. However, the lectures were a real mess and most of us learned all the material at the last minute.",
                "If you want to fundamentally understand how a computer works, then yes. You build up a conceptual understanding of the CPU from the transistor level, which was so cool! The labs require a lot of programming--some of which at points can feel mundane and frustrating-- so be prepared for that (I didn't personally like programming in Verilog, but some students did). Kevin Ryan, who runs the lab space is AMAZING.",
                "If you are interested in computer architecture, I'd definitely recommend this course. I really felt like I learned a lot.",
                "yes, it gives valuable insight into the fundamentals of how computers function on a lower level",
                "Recommend, potentially as a Credit/D, for those interested in how computers work at a very low level. The work and the exams are difficult but fair. Course content is interesting, although could be presented in a more interactive way.",
                "Yes! Required for EE, but also great for anyone interested in the basics of digital logic. Also helpful to get some hands on experience with Verilog!"
