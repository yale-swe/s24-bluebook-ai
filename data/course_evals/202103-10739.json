The course content itself is so engaging that seminar discussion flowed naturally and never stalled. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The breadth of \"decision-making\" often led to tangential discussions, and points not covered by the readings were often supported anecdotally or instinctively, rather than empirically. Additionally, and I never thought I'd say this about a class, but I wish that we met more than once a week. There simply wasn't enough time to fully process and discuss the readings in a single class period.",

                "Absolutely. I learned SO much in this class and genuinely looked forward to attending. The readings were expertly curated and the discussions were always illuminating and engaging. Prof Crockett knows exactly how to strike the balance of letting the class discussion flow organically, while knowing when to interject to clarify an idea or give us more helpful structure. I loved how the discussions were always oriented around the social implications of the research we were reading. Besides being a brilliant scientist, Professor Crockett is a deeply empathetic human whose commitment to social justice shines through in her passion and innervates her work. She started the class by asking: \"what keeps you up at night?\" Every class since, she has helped illuminate how the neuro-scientific principles we have been reading about could be harnessed to attenuate the various existential threats that are currently plaguing the planet in large part because of  policy makers' callous and inept decision-making. My learning always felt so meaningful, so grounded and contextualized. I always felt inspired in class as both a scientist and a global citizen. Professor Crockett shares the same vision that I have of pursuing psychology research as a vehicle for social improvement. Instead of pursuing self-aggrandizement or intellectual vanity projects, Prof Crockett cares about pursuing research that matters. That will shed light on the most vexing and pressing problems. That will expose bias. That will hold the Goliath social media companies -- that are exacerbating polarization and mental health crises -- accountable. That will save the planet from global warming. Professor Crockett is such an unbelievable role model who not only spent all semester granting us insight into some of psychology's most interesting findings; she also taught us all how to ask the right questions to begin with. Yale will miss her so much. And so will I. Fantastic professor.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely!",
                "100%. If nothing else, the course grants an appreciation for the limitations of neuroscience, and the difficulty of producing fruitful neuroscientific research. If you're looking to go into neuroscience, but have yet to decide on a specific subject, I would highly recommend checking out this course. You will not walk away short of ideas you want to pursue.",
                "YES!!!! Amazing class - Professor Crockett is super intelligent, knowledgable kind, understanding, and thoughtful. She really encouraged students to push themselves to think critically",
                "Yes, it was a great experience and I learned a lot from my instructors and peers."
