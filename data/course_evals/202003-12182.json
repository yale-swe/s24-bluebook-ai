                "Not really. The content had the potential to be super interesting, but I thought the class sessions were boring and unfocused. Prof Wargo is a crazy knowledgeable and very kind teacher, but not the best seminar leader. He's great one-on-one, though, and he was very willing to help out with the big final paper. Having a course dedicated around a final paper felt high-stakes because you don't really get any feedback on your work in the course until the end unless you go to office hours, but it was a rewarding experience to learn how to write a proper research paper.",

                "Yes!!!",
