I have learned how to write conclusions that doesn't restate what has been said throughout the entire essay, but rather write a conclusion that causes the reader to think about the topic in a different way. Throughout this course, I have also learned how to close read text better for symbolism and deeper meanings in the text. I also learned how to construct a voice essay and how its different from a normal essay.",

                "Strengths: Professor Morse is extremely kind, and cares about our learning. She is flexible, and also gives great feedback. We also had great classroom discussions, and it was super cool to hear what the others in the class had to say each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: CTM all the way, classmates were awesome, really laid back environment which allowed for great discussion and never felt like a class was useless to learning and moving through our papers. \r\nWeaknesses: lots of reading and writing but that is an English class for ya! Had to write the research paper draft over spring break",
                "Strengths: the biggest strength of this course is truly Professor Morse. She is the loveliest, passionate, caring teacher ever, and made this one of my favorite classes! She is very communicative and genuinely want her students to learn.",
                "With writing overall, I believe I improved so much as a creative and academic writer. I found that I love writing with these two aspects combined to make an academic piece of writing more enjoyable to the reader by adding pieces of creativity in the mix. Some of the key skills and strengths that I will take for the rest of my writing career include creating an outline before every writing piece to ensure proper organization of ideas before the actual writing of the paper, using a sticky note with my claim written on it and sticking it to my computer or desk as I write to ensure I dont stray away from my topic and claim, and most importantly making sure that topic sentences of paragraphs are clearly stated to help maintain organization and flow of the writing. In the future, I want to learn more about creativity and how it can be incorporated in all kinds of writing. I want to learn how to write in a way that is more engaging for readers from all backgrounds. I also wish to learn how to better incorporate attitude and tone into writing in order to make it more effective. Is there a way to actually make the readers stress the words you want them to stress while they read your work? These are topics in writing I wish to explore in the future.",
                "Strengths: Papers 3 and 4 where we are able to write about any topic that interests us. Professor Morse is amazing!\r\nWeaknesses: Papers 1 and 2 are a bit tedious.",
                "The course was very strong in providing regular feedback on writing assignments with opportunities for peer collaboration and revision.",
                "I feel like the strength of this course was the essay prompts being so broad that they essentially allow you to write about any topic you have in mind, thus not forcing you to write about one single niche topic that you may not like. Another strength of this course was that I felt that the projects were all spaced out in a manageable manner, giving appropriate time for each essay. Another strength of this course was the revision process, in which the professor was able to revise our first draft so that we can submit a second draft for that one to be officially graded. However, I felt that a weakness of this course was when we dedicated class time for our students to revise our work. Often times I found many students just reading the rough draft during class, leaving no room for discussion. In order to fix this, I think it should be made mandatory/ an assignment for to read, revise, and comment on students first daft before class stats that way the class can begin right away with a discussion.",
                "This course was well-organized, thought provoking, and challenged me to become a better writer. I started the semester feeling uncertain about my ability to write college papers, but as I progressed through the course I became much more comfortable. I liked how we started off with shorter papers and gradually made them longer and more open-ended. I think this organization allowed me to become acclimated to college writing and become increasingly confident in my ability to write papers. To be completely honest, I can't really think of weaknesses of this course!",
                "strengths: professor morse did an AMAZING  job of engaging with her students and did everything she could to make the class as fun and worthwhile as possible. i loved how flexible the topics for the essays were, which made it very easy to write papers on things you are interested in and increased my engagement with the class. I was genuinely excited to come to class and do the assignments because class was fun and helpful, and I was able to write papers on things i was interested in.\r\nno weaknesses!!"

                "Yes definitely. Professor Morse is the best professor ever.",
                "Yes because English 114 is so good for a writing credit because it walks you back into writing papers for what works for you instead of what high school taught you. Loved it (but probably because the professor was amazing).",
                "100%! This is the best course Ive ever taken at yale!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. This is an amazing course to start your writing career if you are not sure if you enjoy writing. I came into this class not sure if I really enjoyed writing and I left with a passion to continue writing in new creative ways. It is an excellent course with detailed constructive criticism so one can improve on their writing quickly. And the professor is so kind and is eager to help her students be the best writers they can be and makes sure that as long as you are writing to the best of your ability, you will succeed in the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the class truly fosters creativity. Especially papers 3 and 4, you are free to virtually write about any topic you'd like, which makes the papers more manageable to write.",
                "I would recommend this class. It is a great introduction to academic writing and builds foundational writing skills.",
                "Yes, because I believe this course allows you to think about your typical essay format (Intro-3 body paragraphs- conclusion) differently and allows you to rite a typical essay so much better then what you could have before. Considering that typical argument essays are an important valuable skill in any field, I think this course will also help with writing more sophisticated essays.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Morse is teaching the class. The class is engaging and challenging in all the right ways: it was never overwhelming, but still pushed me to improve my writing. I received extensive, constructive feedback on my assignments that allowed me to focus on particular weaknesses in my papers, and I really enjoyed our thoughtful class discussions.",
                "definitely, specifically if professor morse is teaching it. it is great for everyone to improve their writing, especially if they are a first year or a non humanities major. the class is very fun and not overwhelming, and professor morse does a great job of working with students to support them and make sure that they are able to complete all of the assignments without getting overwhelmed. it is a great class to fulfill your writing distributional requirement with as it is not too much work and improves your writing a lot"
