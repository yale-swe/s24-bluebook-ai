Material is not so interesting, but I guess that it's a language class, so you can't really expect a whole lot. Some projects felt overly involved, while other assignments felt totally useless. Also, some of the work included watching tv series, which could take an hour+ of watching per week.",

                "This course is phenomenal for anyone who genuinely cares about learning better Hebrew. It is a lot of work if just doing for the credit.",
