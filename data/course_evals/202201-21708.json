                "Strengths: The presentation topics across weeks connected well and helped students develop an understanding of mechanism design and blockchain.\r\nWeaknesses: The level of engagement was fairly low throughout the semester. It would be helpful for the professors to present some of the topics, or have smaller weekly assignments to allow students to work with the material regularly.",
                "It would have benefited from a smaller class size and more lectures given by the instructors, given how knowledgeable they are",
                "Content was interesting. Signups and logistics for presentations could have been better organized (mechanism design!) as is just felt like a scramble to choose a date as quickly as possible without having time to really consider what one wanted to present and some weeks ended up super over or under subscribed.",
                "Strengths: Gave good practice presenting, and being able to watch others present made it even more valuable as you could see what they did which worked and didn't work and incorporate that into your presentations. We talked about interesting material and had really excellent guest speakers. Giving presentations required detailed preparation and actually understanding some of the material, which was good experience really digging into a piece of the literature. The final paper, similarly, allowed a pretty deep engagement with one area of interest.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The presentations tried to cover way too much material. This meant that it was super difficult for other students to follow along beyond the initial setup, and this meant that the value of paying attention to the entire presentation was much lower than it could have been. This, as a side-effect, led to pretty low class engagement, with only a few people ever asking questions or making comments, and this made the course worse on the whole.",
                "this course requires some major adjustments. Instead of having a general theme for the semester and letting students prepare presentations in some specific part in which they were interested, there was a rigid syllabus of papers for presenting which we had no say in. the general theme was \"economics of the internet\", which is very aligned with Professor Bergemann's work, but something I have no interest in. I believe the purpose of this course was to practice and get good at presenting. However, there were so many students in the class and everyone was required to present twice, so each person got roughly 15 minutes to present each time. In that time, we were expected to present a mathematical result, which is practically impossible to do well with the level of difficulty of the papers. What ended up happening was the presentations went way too fast through quite complex math, and no one paid any attention. Everyone's engagement was very low--you spent some hours in the week before your presentation making slides, and then did absolutely nothing and paid no attention for the rest of the semester. We also got no feedback on our presentations despite the fact that they were very hard to follow, some people seemed very unprepared, and/or didn't fully understand what they were presenting on.\r\nSomehow the most positive part of the class was the final paper because I was able to actually write about something I am interested in, and got to apply some of the more general/fundamental results from the first couple of seminars to a specific environment.",
                "Honestly there isn't much I would change about this course. It's a big switch up from the way literally every other math undergrad course here is taught, but not in a way that catches you off guard. The biggest weakness is bad student presenters, but that's not something that you can really work around in a course that's centered on student presentations. Dirk does intervene if anything is too difficult to understand (not in a scary \"gotcha\" kind of way though; more like throwing a lifeline to both the presenter and the class).",

                "It is a requirement for the Econ-Math major and fulfils a requirement for the math major. A very small number of people in the class were taking it because they wanted to. I would not recommend this class if you don't have to take it, but you probably do.",

You might have the option to take 480 instead, but being taught by Dirk Bergemann gives 481 the clear advantage. It's a fair bit for work for the two weeks in which you give presentations (and the final paper takes some time, but can be done early when you aren't busy), but other than that you just get to sit back and listen to lectures about interesting topics.",
