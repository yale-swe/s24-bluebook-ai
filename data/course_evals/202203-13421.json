This included gaining an understanding of the immigration and settlement of South Asians in the United States, the various forms of discrimination they faced, and their subsequent fights for civil rights. I also gained an understanding of the various South Asian American communities that emerged in the US, their contributions to American society and culture, and their legacy in the present day.",
                "Learned a lot about 20th century South Asian American History and pre-1965 which was rlly interesting!",
                "This class really taught me how to look at social issues as a historian. It gave me some important language to describe trends of racialization and relationality. Most importantly, it touched on a lot of hidden histories of South Asians that were incredibly interesting to learn about!",
                "This course gave me insight to the historical, cultural, and social formations of South Asian Americans. While primarily a history course, this class was informed by works in ethnic studies, gender studies, and related fields.",

                "HIST 183J emphasized how the racial formations of South Asian American diaspora are deeply related to that of Black, Native, Latine, and other Asian American communities. We explored systems of power rooted in anti-Blackness, expanding on how these systems are reflected in the model minority myth. For example, one week focused on the complexities of South Asians using largely Black-created culture and art (for example, rap and hip hop) as a form of their own resistance. Throughout the semester, we expanded on anti-Blackness within South Asian communities, and expanded on solidarities and relationships with other racialized people, reading books like Vivek Balds Bengali Harlem and Karen Leonards Making Ethnic Choices. The South Asian American diaspora should not be deemed invisible, apolitical, or passive within larger fields of ethnic and Third World studies. More classes like Prof Adis HIST 183J 01 are needed to combat the erasure of South Asians within the academic institution. Because of the lack of general investment on South Asian American studies, Prof Adi's class helped teach me how we, speaking as students of color, are integral in writing down the pieces of history and knowledge we've grown up learning from the generations before us. For our final paper (which focused on a primary source), many people relied on oral interviews, and it was very powerful to hear about other people's projects documenting neglected stories."

                "Strengths: The readings and topics covered in this class are novel and interesting. Adi does a great job bringing in supplemental material (art, articles, photos) in class to add to course discussion on readings and topics. \r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "Strengthens critical thinking and reading skills: Reading and discussing course material encourages us to think critically about the topics studied. We can explore the different perspectives and implications of a topic and practice evaluating and analyzing evidence.",
                "ADI IS AWESOME! The readings were great and insightful!",
                "The seminar was small, which was helpful in facilitating more intimate discussions. I also appreciated that weeks were organized thematically, not just through time. The highlight of the course, though, was Adi. He was a fantastic lecturer and seminar leader. He clearly displayed immense knowledge in the field, while staying approachable and friendly. Adi created this course from the ground up, and I hope that it inspires more courses in South Asian American history.",
                "Adi was a great instructor and the course was well organized. Sometimes class felt a bit repetitive with the presentations, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless. Readings were insightful and guided our discussion.",
                "The class was structured very well, starting with a good introduction to make the class more accessible and understandable for people who may not be as familiar with ethnic studies. Our first class unpacked what the model minority myth actually meant, what racial formation meant, and listing/defining some forms of powers that impacted racialization (ie. race, caste, class, gender, nationality, sexuality, ethnicity, etc.) This served as a great foundation to the rest of the class where we expanded on all of thisand of course, we would revisit these definitions and use new readings to add complexity to the concepts we'd discussed in the introduction. The class was very well organized into themes as well. As some examples, Week Five: Gender & Identity across the 20th Century, Week Eight: Post-65 Afro-Desi Solidarities, Week Nine: Gender & Labor in the Late 20th Century, Week Twelve: Contemporary Media, Culture, and Representation. Our Professor and the way he guided our writing was amazing. I'd say the way we could improve this course is to have greater investment into other South Asian American history and ethnic studies courses like it, as to provide an even stronger foundation, more guiding context and theory, and less reliance on one course alone to teach these histories."

                "Yes! 100%",
                "Yes! Every history major should take this class! It is so unique, engaging, and well-taught! It is also just encompassing of a lot of hidden histories that are not taught enough in the Yale History Curriculum.",
                "Absolutely! I'm not sure if/when it will be offered again; Adi is a graduate student and this course was created with the intention of it only being offered once. However, if this class is offered again - or if you have the privilege of taking any class taught by Adi - I would highly recommend.",
                "YES! Adi is a thoughtful instructor who brings this field for the first time to Yale. I learned so much that shapes my understanding of Asian American History, beginning to fill many gaps in my knowledge. Adi is a great instructor and guides you through the course.",

For our final paper (which focused on a primary source), many people relied on oral interviews, and it was very powerful to hear about other people's projects documenting neglected stories. To expand on writing, we were given 5 short reading responses throughout the semester, which served as great checkpoints to make sure I was actually understanding and analyzing the content. In class, Professor Adi gave us writing exercises in pairs/groups to put dense readings into more accessible language, and that has definitely helped my approach to readings in other classes. For our midterm, we had a review paper, and our final surrounded primary source analysis. A very manageable workload, while also being very useful in improving our writing, reading, and analyzing skills. Morever, Prof Adi was one of the best professors Ive had during my time at Yale. Actually tries to make the class accessible to everyone, and communicates with students with mutual respect and understanding (while still helping us keep ourselves accountable). Notably, Prof Adi responded very kindly during a one-on-one discussion about disabilities and accommodations in the classroom. He was also very helpful in creating a plan/schedule to check-in on progress on papers. Prof Adi was very good at providing context and guiding questions, while also giving students the space to expand on their own thoughts and engage with each other. He also provided extensive feedback on our papers, and was very open for office hours. Ive deeply appreciated Prof Adis outreach, kindness, and his extensive knowledge on South Asian studies, especially considering the already limited access to similar classes and content. Lastly, the class was structured very well, starting with a good introduction to make the class more accessible and understandable for people who may not be as familiar with ethnic studies.
