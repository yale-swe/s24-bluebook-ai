                "I feel like I didn't really learn anything in this class. Lectures were hard to follow and not very informative.",
                "I think the course is good in general with a clear structure.",
                "Although the course is called intro probability and statistics, I felt like I spent more time learning about empirical applications of statistical methods than probability theory or statistical theory. The applications were interesting, but I wish we had spent more time learning about theory.",
                "The problem sets were too difficult and there was no guidance provided on coding, though that was a big part of problem sets. Where advice was offered, it was very inaccessible to anyone without a background in coding.",
                "Strengths: helpful videos, interesting applications, a TA that puts in the time and effort to make answer keys and to be available for answering questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the explanation of the probability theory was rather scattered, and it felt like I mostly got definitions that I had to piece together afterwards",
                "It was really hard for me to grasp the essence of what exactly was going on the entire semester. We went through mostly topics we went through in ECON 117 but in depth and with lots of theory. I wish there were simple examples in class or in section for each regression model so we can get a better intuition as to what exactly we are doing. Also especially in the first half of the class, you get asked questions in homework and the midterm about material in the textbook that was never covered or glanced over during class. I had no idea how to do those questions and it took me forever. I ended up using my knowledge and sometimes my actual notes from ECON 117. Also not teaching coding was very unhelpful. It said so in the syllabus so I was expecting to have to learn on my own, but I learned so much more from ECON 117 because that class actually taught coding in sections.",
                "The course is a very shallow and very broad exploration of probability and statistics. I wish that less material was covered, but more deeply. I also feel that the exams weren't super fair, with deeper questions asked about concepts that we were given a shallow explanation about.",
                "Strengths: I learned about the applications of statistics in economics through the exploration of research papers and by recreating results on psets\r\nWeaknesses: I did not feel that the course gave me a good foundation in probability or statistics. The probability portion of this class felt greatly rushed (one lecture often covered one chapter from the textbook) and important statistical concepts were underdeveloped (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing was glossed over during lectures and covered in sections instead in preparation for a pset).",
                "Strength is Professor Narita and Fernando are both very dedicated to teaching, very good at explaining the content, material is interesting. Weakness is problem sets are not well communicated and much more challenging than content discussed in class, and TA section materials are too proof-based and not so relevant with course materials.",
                "Interesting content, really cool papers to go along with lectures.\r\nPsets barely correlated with lectures so quite a bit had to be self-taught, and there isn't much help available from the TA or professor.",
                "Strengths: The curriculum was well-organized, with lectures building on each other. I thought the explanations of the different cultures of the various schools of thought in statistics was very important. The example studies in each lecture were very helpful in getting me to understand different approaches to answering different questions.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think we were given enough information (especially coding-wise) to do our problem sets well, even for people with coding experience. I also wish that we were given more examples (like, example math problems) for the earlier, more mathematical parts of the class. Writing down the definition of a moment-generating function and seeing how it works with a handful of made-up data are very different things. I felt that my shaky understanding of the earlier theory made later course comprehension tougher.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, engaging empirical applications discussed, and engaging lectures \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt a bit disorganized. Pset questions weren't always super clear, and some were significantly more difficult than others. Also much less theory than I expected considering S&DS 241 and 242 are the equivalent prerequisites for Econ 136, but perhaps we did discuss everything we needed to.",
                "Notation can be somewhat overly complicated for simple concepts and the course doesn't spend a lot of time on statistics but it was very useful going through a wide range  of different studies and discussing the details  of how they were designed. I felt it was a great course for getting exposure to the statistics used in economics.",
                "Luckily I knew R and some probability before, but the high paced nature of this course that does not dive deeply into any one topic makes it almost necessary that these concepts are familiar before the class begins. I wish there were more attention to mathematical proofs and the mathematics behind confidence intervals and the different statistical models. Luckily I will have a chance to take advanced probability to fill in these gaps. None of this is the fault of Professor Narita, instead it is just the nature of forcing two terms into one. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as the syllabus, I feel the section on causal inference could be shortened.",
                "They throw a lot of information at you in this class. It was very difficult to know exactly what the expectations were and in general the lectures were very disconnected from psets and exams.",
                "Strengths: Very interacts and hands-on approach to learning econometrics\r\nWeaknesses: What was taught in lecture differed from section which differed from Psets which differed from the exams.",
                "This course is structured quite badly, there is a huge disconnect between the material taught in class and what is actually asked on the problem sets and exams. This is especially true for the problem sets. The sections were also extremely unhelpful as they were structured pretty badly, especially when section in the first half of the semester was just going over the last weeks problem set.",
                "The professor is a really clear lecturer, but this is one of those classes where what's taught in lecture often has little to do with section and the problem sets. The class felt a bit disjointed for that reason. I also believe the professor should narrow the range of subjects on the syllabus -- I would have preferred going deeper into the foundations of econometrics rather than getting a whirlwind tour of machine learning.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture slides could be clearer; test questions were a little open ended and could be more well-thought out (it is unclear exactly what information to include to get full marks)",
                "Strengths: the lecture slides were helpful as were the practice exams\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Narita explained things too fast sometimes or glossed over concepts",
                "Teaching could be better and more clear",
                "A big strength was that the professor and TA were kind and reachable. Both responded to emails quickly to student concerns. In the middle of the course, additional support networks were also created (study groups, Piazza), which was also a strength. Another big strength of the course was the workload; I felt like the psets, while difficult, were well spread out over the semester and the course was designed to not be comprised of busywork but rather a few meaningful assignments. Finally, another strength of the course was that it emphasized important concepts and techniques in econometrics that I believe would be helpful for students to know.\r\n\r\nI would say, though, that despite the above strengths, there are a few areas in which the course could be improved upon. First, the first part of the course on probability and statistics went by really quickly (~3-4 weeks) and I would recommend that more time is spent on those areas. I came into the course thinking that I would develop a solid foundation in probability and statistics but by the end, felt like my knowledge fell short, as the majority of the course was less focused probability and statistics but rather econometrics. Another recommendation I have for the course is for the section material to be more directly related to what we covered in class (perhaps a review of that week's concepts or practice problems). This would have helped me internalize the material better. Third, I wish that graded assignments would be returned faster to students; often times, it would be at least 3 weeks before we received our pset feedback back. This made it difficult to gauge how one was doing in the course. \r\n\r\nFinally, I really wish that there was a peer tutor for this course who would hold additional office hours. The course was really difficult and I would have appreciated having a third resource outside of the professor and the TA.",
                "Strength: Lots of coding assignments, professor and TA very approachable and available for asking questions\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded lectures were not necessarily engaging (could be better if all of them were synchronous), midterms and final exams did not make much sense compared to the class material",
                "Strengths: The lectures in this course are very organized and interesting. Prof. Narita utilizes case studies and past papers in order to show how concepts we are learning can be applied and used in research. This made the lectures super interesting and exciting.\r\nWeaknesses: The PSETs were oftentimes much more difficult than shown in the lectures and included a lot of coding in R\/Python. If you are not experienced in coding\/data science, this makes the course incredibly difficult because the lectures only cover conceptual knowledge, but doesn't actually show you how to materially apply it in your psets. There wasn't much help on the coding portion in this course. Also, psets were graded very late so it was difficult to receive feedback and improve your grade until it was too late.",
                "Strengths: covered a lot of great and interesting material. Has a good mix of theory and application.\r\nWeaknesses: this class covers a ton of material, and unless its appeared on a problem set, I didnt always feel like I knew quite enough to actually implement the methods we talked about."

                "Absolutely not. If it's required for your major (like econ\/math) then you have to take it, but if not then you are much better off taking a different econometrics sequence. For one, you really blow through the probability and statistics part of the course because there is so much to cover. If I hadn't taken AP statistics in high school I would have been completely lost, but even still I feel like I didn't really get a good grasp on the theory. The second half of the course is spent talking about different regression techniques and is totally confusing. You watch the lecture (and can re-watch) but still don't feel like you have learned anything, even though the material is incredibly difficult. Also, I came into this without any R experience and pretty much felt like I was drowning (especially towards the end) because there isn't a good introduction to R for problem sets. So far the exams have been decently fair, but not worth it for the overall experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to have solid econometric skills.",
                "Yes, it is necessary for the economics and mathematics major, though I would also add that it is really very challenging.",
                "Don't take it unless you have to. If you want a solid foundation in probability theory, take Stats 241-242 instead. A good amount of prior knowledge is assumed in the teaching. The lectures aren't terrible, but they're not great either.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this course. Unless you are Econ-Math, in which case this is a requirement, I would not recommend this class to any econ major. I was so confused by topics that I found out towards the end were not difficult at all, and you are better off satisfying your econometrics requirement with Econ 117. At least that class actually gives you easy examples to build intuition, and also teaches you how to code.",
                "only if you HAVE TO take it for the major",
                "For an introduction into probability theory, I would recommend taking S&DS 241 instead. However, for a quick overview of basic probability and an exploration of the ways in which different papers have used various statistical techniques, this course is decent.",
                "Yes! A must-take for advanced econometrics sequence, the material is not very dry since it's application-based, fun class and challenging materials, problem sets and exams",
                "If you're interested in probability theory and theory behind regressions\/etc., I didn't get much from this course. And this class is a step removed from actual applications, so it feels difficult to use what I learned. Having taken ECON 117, I would prefer it to 135.",
                "Yeah, just remember to review the slides in tandem with the textbook.",
                "The class was more empirically oriented this semester - if that's what you're looking for, then I would recommend this class. If you're looking to learn more theory, perhaps S&DS 241 and 242 would be better before you go and take Econ 136 or other electives. Chances are you're taking this class though because it's a requirement of some sort, but I regardless think the course content is interesting.",
                "Yes. Great course for getting more experience with actual research designs in economics.",
                "I find intro statistics to be something that you just have to get out of the way. This is a quick but painful way to do that. The alternatives are slow and painful.",
                "If you're econ and math then yes you have to take this course. If you're not considering the major then maybe look into a different econometrics course because this is in no way an introductory course. The material is advanced and there is very little time to process anything. The exams are also extremely difficult.",
                "Unless you are in the Math and Econ major, dont take this course. Unless they restructure it. Then maybe itll be helpful. As it stands, I have no idea what I learned this past semester or even what I was supposed to learn.",
                "Only if you're doing Econ & Math or really want to take 136 for some reason. This class has an overly ambitious agenda, I think, and thus only scratches the surface of interesting topics. If you want to understand how econometrics and stats are used, try pairing a class devoted to probability theory (say, 241) with a class devoted to 'metrics like Econ 123.",
                "Yes. It provided a good foundation of statistics.",
                "It's a requirement usually.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it were required for their major or if they have a strong interest in economics with sufficient background in probability\/statistics\/mathematics\/coding. In particular, I would also only recommend this course to students who are looking for a quantitative challenge. The course is mathematically rigorous (involving the application of calculus to probability\/statistics) and doing well will require one to be comfortable with mathematical notation and to spend a lot of time with the textbook.",
                "Absolutely not, we were expected to self-teach material ourselves and all assessments left students feeling woefully underprepared.",
                "Only if you have to take it. Really if you're an math and & econ major.",
                "The course is super interesting but also very difficult",
                "No if you are looking for not too difficult econ classes",
                "Would recommend if considering grad school in economics.",
                "Yes if you are interested at all in a more formal econometrics class!"
