            "comments": [
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nWILLIAM HAWKINS (the course coordinator, but held sections, office hours, and review sessions). He is INCREDIBLE. He keeps this class EXTREMELY organized, and he is always available for help. Go to his sections and office hours in my opinion, he often explained the material more concisely than the professors would in class. He is so engaging, and genuinely cares about helping his students learn. Whenever I asked a question on Ed Discussion, he would respond almost immediately. Dr. Hawkins is responsive and will always be there if you need his help. I can't express how much I loved him as a professor (I would say one of my best professors at Yale). \r\n\r\nProfessor Zilibotti was a much better lecturer than Professor Moscarini. During the first half of the semester when Moscarini was teaching, I learned mostly from going to section, peer tutoring, and completing the PSETs rather than lecture. I would attribute this to his lecture style; while he was very knowledgable, he is soft-spoken and not very engaging. However, Professor Zilibotti in the second half of the semester was a lot clearer and I learned a lot from him (albeit, I still preferred Dr. Hawkin's style of teaching in section. It always helped).\r\n\r\nI liked the worksheets before the PSETs, it helped to solidify\/consolidate our knowledge before tackling the PSET.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutors were amazing!!! Shoutout to Grace and Mark.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe the lack of practice tests for the off-sequence curriculum, but this honestly wasn't really an issue because Dr. Hawkins told us which questions from each practice test were relevant.",
                "I personally was not extremely interested in the course content, but the course was taught very well and with great detail.",
                "Strengths: lots of office hours and resources\r\nWeaknesses: some classes are not very engaging",
                "strengths: super relevant information that directly applies to our world. very easy to see how this knowledge can be applied to everyday life\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the class felt disorganized. needed more overarching \"this is different from this because...\" explanations",
                "Strengths: very well organized and course director is fantastic. No suggestions for improvement.",
                "It was pretty much what I expected.",
                "The professors and TFs were very accessible and eager to help with any questions. However, often in-class instruction was unclear and the important synthesis of information was done individually.",
                "The first half of the course is extremely boring but gets more interesting as you reach topics like inflation. Also, Dr. Hawkins is by far and above, the best part of the course. His lecture summaries are a godsend.",
                "This course is very well taught with numerous digestible topics. I would love to have more intensive psets!",
                "William Hawkins should be teaching this class. Having very senior people do the lectures results in disconnect between students and teacher. No one understood anything until they went to review sessions with Hawkins, which were super helpful. The whole time I thought Hawkins was the more senior person because of his amazing teaching and immense knowledge. He is definitely better at teaching the introductory stuff, and at times I felt like this course was more confusing and difficult than it had to be. Strengths: passionate lecturers. Weaknesses: the lecturers struggled to teach to undergraduates.",
                "Strengths: consistent, professor fabrizio zilibotti \r\nWeaknesses: professor giuseppe moscarini, course director professor hawkins.",
                "The general ideas of macroeconomics are extremely interesting and exciting. However, these ideas would only every so often shine through the clouds of complex math that compose most of the instruction in this course. I think it would be better if those ideas could be taught more clearly and all at once, and then be obscured by the formulas and derivations.",
                "great course director and TAs and very detailed lectures\r\n\r\nperhaps getting rid of \"worksheets\" and just making the psets more detailed",
                "Strengths: generally interesting topics and relevant to real world. It was more social science than Econ 115, so it felt applicable to what was happening. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of content and memorization required, but the worksheets and p-sets are great at solidifying learnings.",
                "My TF was nice, but honestly I felt like I didnt learn a whole lot in my sections which I found frustrating.",
                "It was very well delivered between Professors Moscarini and Zilibotti, and the way it was conducted vis--vis not releasing lecture recordings in the beginning was quite smart!",
                "The wonderful peer tutors and the amount of separate tutoring opportunities for students was a huge strength. Unfortunately, the lectures and sections were not very helpful. Grace Miller in particular was incredibly helpful and contributed a great deal to my success in the course.",
                "One strength of the course is that it is very structured -- each topic always came with an accompanying slide deck, problem set, and worksheet. One weakness of the course is that it would be cool to apply some of these topics and not just learn about them theoretically. I would also love more feedback about my progress and grade throughout the course.",
                "Strengths - Information is laid out very well and the course doesn't feel rushed. Well structured for learning.",
                "This course was very well-taught! Lectures were engaging and well-paced, and the Worksheets and Problem Sets really enhanced my learning. I appreciated that support was available whenever I needed it, whether through office hours or peer tutoring sessions. The class was also incredibly well-organizedI especially appreciated having access to the Ed Discussion Board.",
                "I thought the sections and many office hours were very helpful\r\n\r\nThe course does go VERY fast and theres no time to even think about the material youre learning during the lecture. That makes it very difficult to follow along with the instructor builds on material taught in the same lecture because you have not had time to process it.",
                "Struggled with memorizing formulas",
                "-Strengths:\r\n-Professors were knowledgeable and quite engaging\r\n-Well structured curriculum, each subject guides nicely to the next\r\n-Good out of class resources\r\n-Lecture summaries and lecture slides available\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-lecture volume, only twice a week, sometimes more volume could make more engaging with 3 classes of 50 minutes instead of 2 classes of 1:15 hrs",
                "This course was very thorough, and I felt like I was always where I needed to be. The professors had a lot to say, and the material was very straightforward. Dr. Hawkins, my section leader, is my favorite instructor at Yale, as he makes things clear and is very understanding of what his students need.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were times during this class where I found myself zoning out or getting bored. I would recommend including some examples that are relatable and\/or entertaining, in order to keep the class engaged.",
                "The course is extremely well organized. I appreciated how structured the discussion sections were, how many office hours were offered, and the effort Dr. Hawkins put into providing us lecture summaries. The worksheets were also quite helpful in internalizing the curriculum.",
                "I think the TF and ULA office hours are the greatest strength of this class.",
                "Strength: the content material was enlightening and interesting. Section with William Hawkins was great.\r\nWeaknesses: many of the lectures felt slow and difficult to engage with.",
                "I think real life examples are very valuable and important. Modern news, documentaries, and historical examples are great learning tools. This class used a few of them, but I think that it could benefit from more. The book is a massive strength and the worksheets.",
                "The professors did not provide organized lectures and the content was a bit over the place in many instances. For instance, some material was never covered in class, but appeared in problem sets and the exam. The professors also did not do a good job of explaining concepts and it was to the student to find out through peer tutor hours and collaboration with peers. I think there needs to be more structure to the lectures for this course to get a better rating.",
                "Very well organized with lots of resources available to get help and learn. I think the psets were fair and the worksheets were super helpful and I really liked their format.",
                "Strengths include great teaching staff and peer tutors, most notably Grace Miller, William Hawkins, and Mitchell. One weakness was that there was not much material to practice studying for the last few sections of the class because previous exams did not test on this material. This material includes Taylor rule, inter temporal budget constraints, and inequality. A fix for this would be to create some extra practice questions before the final.",
                "The second Professor did a much better job explaining and engaging.",
                "I liked the weekly sections. One weakness was the policy of not recording classes. I think students would have benefitted better if the classes were recorded and the recordings released on time.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the class was very informative. We received a lot of feedback on our assignments such as PSETS and worksheets. \r\nWeaknesses is that the sections were not as helpful as I thought they would be towards the exams."
