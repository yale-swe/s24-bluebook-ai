I appreciated that he formatted our class discussions in a way that gave everyone an opportunity to participate, and I looked forward to going to every class. I enjoyed all of the books that we read and our class discussions and papers helped me to develop a deeper understanding of their meaning. I am very glad that I took this course and can't think of any weaknesses.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students looking for an introductory English course. This course was accessible to non-English majors and my close reading and critical writing skills improved significantly. Professor Smith was very thoughtful and gave everyone an opportunity to participate each class. Our discussions were always engaging and I enjoyed all of the books we read.",
