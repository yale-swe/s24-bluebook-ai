                "I found the syllabus texts extremely interesting!! I like how the course provided brief overviews of different environmental injustices. We took deep dives into different topics each week which I appreciated, however it was emotionally draining. I found the discussion posts very engaging too, I really enjoyed the creative responses that each student had the option of completing. It helped me grapple with the emotional taxing. I would have appreciated brief structured lectures during each class, especially because we met only once a week, to give us an overview of definitions, key points and structural inequalities at play in each text. I think the lectures would have provided the class discussions with more structure than just simply discussing. I also thought that submitting drafts of the final essay during reading week was time consuming and stressful. I would have appreciated just submitting one final draft to complete the class during reading week."

I found the creative weekly discussion posts very helpful and interesting. I learned a lot from my classmates and my professors. The class felt a little long a times though, and I wished we dove deeper into the historical or political informations that led to these injustices."
