                "Honestly just a lot of really interesting facts and history about a place I wasnt familiar with",
                "This course taught me everything from ancient Chinese history, excavation techniques to bio-archeology! I loved the comprehensive way this course explained both methods and history. At the end of this class, I felt that learning about archeological methods put me in a strong position to analyse journal articles. Furthermore, digging into the ways that contemporary artefacts are acquired is often overlooked and I felt that Professor Wolin covered the ethics of archeology very successfully.",
                "We learned about the basic procedures and theories behind archaeological sciences, which was very helpful for people outside of the major.",
                "I studied about several archeological approaches for studying ancient Chinese history. Not only did I learn about Chinese history, but it also clarified what anthropological and archeology studies are like at Yale.",

                "Strengths: The course was organized chronologically and was very efficient for learning. Course modules were organized so that we were able to always know what readings and things were required for each class. Assignment details were clearly laid out and communicated with rubrics. Weekly reading responses allowed for some flexibility as well while also keeping you accountable for reading during most of the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: None that I can particularly think of.",
                "Overall course was designed well to facilitate and engage student learning.",
                "I thought the course spent too much time on the slow progression of food production in 30 different regional Neolithic cultures a lay person would never have heard of before. I wish instead wed been given a higher level overview. Without that big picture I felt lost and bored in class, because we were just learning details that I couldnt keep straight and struggled to place into a broader narrative.  The second half of the course seemed more interesting, but I had already burned up the energy I set aside for this class. I think a topical organization would have taught me more than the chronological one actually used in class.",
                "Projects were a strength. Made me learn the material in fun way",
                "This course was a great introduction to both archaeology as well as ancient Chinese history. However, it was difficult to keep the chronology and geography of China in order due to my lack of familiarity with it all. If there were a map or timeline with the chronological history of China, it would have been easier to keep everything in order.",
                "strengths:\r\n- organization\r\n- assignments \r\n- projects\/papers\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- not super engaging lectures \r\n- lack of diversity in types of homework (mostly readings)"

                "Yes, this was a really good overview of Chinese archaeology, which is exactly what was promised. Professor Wolin is also very passionate about the topic and often engages with the biases that affect archaeological study as well as the power dynamics that are inherent with studying history that is rooted in modern day geopolitics.",
                "Yes! Professor Wolin does well at teaching this subject because she fosters a welcoming environment for questions and conversations. This course is ideal for anyone interested in archeological and anthropological studies regardless of their degree.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in archaeology or Chinese history.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student interested in history or archaeology because it is not very engaging otherwise. The lectures were very similar every day, which led to a lack of engagement. I would say for a student just looking for a new course to take, I wouldn't recommend it."
