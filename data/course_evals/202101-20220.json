I think it's always tricky when planning a survey course like this one to balance a desire to group works chronologically with a desire to group works by movement or by similar characteristics. By and large, though, I thought the order of works made sense and was conducive to discussion."

                "Yes! I'd recommend this course to anyone, but especially to students interested in literature, history, art, theater, foreign language, and the arts and humanities more broadly. I think looking at a single literary category over time provides a good balance of the general with the specific; I came out of this course feeling like I'd learned a lot, not only about literature in general, but also about the history of German theater, for instance.",
                "If you are interested in literature, I definitely recommend this course. I was a little hesitant to take this class at first because it was focused entirely on theater, but I found that reading theater - a kind of novel minus the narrative descriptions - was really helpful in terms of thinking about writing and literature as a whole. I enjoyed thinking about speech, set design and stage directions, and it was particularly interesting to see the evolution and development of these ideas from the ancient Greeks to the modern day."
