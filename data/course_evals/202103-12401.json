                "Learned principles of microeconomics. Supply\/demand, consumer theory, producer theory, different market structures, and game theory.",

No calculus is required, but students must be proficient in basic algebra and graphing.

                "The only strength of this class is that the slides are posted following each lecture. This class was poorly taught, there was low instructor-student engagement, and the content was taught in a convoluted manner.",
                "There was very little help offered in this course for struggling students. The professor was available but many students needed more in-depth help for the problem sets.",
                "iIt was a little confusing sometimes and I had to do a lot on my own. I did enjoy the level of interaction with my professor and getting to ask questions in lecture",
                "The tests are very hard because they do not match the psets or the practice questions that we take in class. Yes, it's the same material, but because the class doesn't properly explain the ideas, it becomes really hard to solve any question that doesn't exactly match the psets.",
                "-strength: small seminar format means that you get more from simply attending class, lots of engagement with the instructor and can ask questions\r\n-weaknesses: lack of official textbook means that its hard to supplement in class learning with readings",
                "Strengths: the problem sets were fun to figure out alongside the amazing slides notes, the class content felt satisfying to learn (though it also felt surface-level), and the professor is so sweet, understanding, and helpful. The office hours were incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures, while entertaining, didn't cover much more than what could be gained from the slides, and I sometimes felt like I could learn and understand the material faster on my own.",
                "Strengths: Slides are viewable after lectures (and sometimes before), answers to all problem sets are published\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Information is not summarized properly. It is not clear how concepts fit together, and when\/where they will be used. In-context examples take precedent over universal explanations of the content, which makes it hard to decipher. It was difficult to communicate with the professor. The course was incredibly fast-paced, and exams felt unpredictable and excessively hard.",
                "This course lacks the necessary resources built into the lecture style class. I wish there were peer tutor or TA options made available for extra help. Being able to review additional problems with someone knowledgeable outside class would be nice. Also, only one set of practice problems was given throughout the semester and I would've liked to see more. The wording in problem sets can be confusing so more practice problems could help with this.",
                "This course was very engaging and organized. All the required information was clearly presented in the slides, and the optional textbook provided a good supplement for what we learned in class. My only suggestion would be to provide more practice problems prior to exams to really solidify our knowledge.",

I originally took this course because I knew I was poor at economics and would need more help; that is why I elected to take the seminar rather than the lecture. This class, however, turned out to be taught as a lecture even though it was supposed to be a seminar. Because of this, we did not get any discussion sections or TAs.",
                "I would not recommend this course for a student who has never taken economics before. There is very little support offered for students to improve, and tutoring is only offered to people who are getting a C in the course.",

                "Econ 100 is going to be very different depending on your professor. Don't take it with this instructor, and if you can, take econ 115 for a better curve and more TA's.",
                "I would recommend the course. It is definitely more intensive than the lecture but it was very well taught.",
                "Yes, even if they're not an economics major and just want an interesting, basic course about economic thinking. I've heard that people who like math enjoy this class a lot more than people who don't.",
                "I would not recommend ECON 110. If someone wants to take an introductory microeconomics course I would strongly recommend taking the lecture instead (ECON 115). The lecture class has a better curve and access to TA's. The seminar acts like a lecture since it is so fast paced, but it lacks the discussion section and TA office hours that go along with the lecture class. In my 110 class, the professor offered office hours but I think having multiple TA's would be better.",
                "No, I would recommend others to take Econ 115 instead so they have more resources like TAs, practice exams, and review sessions. In my opinion, the main benefit to seminars is the personal connection built with teachers and the ability to get one on one help in class, but I feel I did not get that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn the foundations of economics in an engaging, interesting way.",
