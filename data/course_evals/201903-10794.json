    "I learned how to read and speak in Korean. I learned a variety of words and grammar structures that will lay the foundations for the next couple of years of taking Korean. I also gained a better understanding of Korean culture and life in the country.",

   "comments": [
    "It was sometimes difficult to catch grammar or vocabulary knowledge if not listening constantly. This is difficult because of the nature of the class, however, it comes up again later on and she is helpful in reminding you. I believe having everything written out on printed sheets would allow for greater organization and learning.",
    "The course is awesome at providing support for students. My professor and teaching fellow were always there for us. I also think the course is great at teaching Korean. Everyone in our class improved exponentially since day 1. \r\n\r\nI can't think of areas of improvement.",
    "Weaknesses: none!\r\n\r\nStrengths: Everything. Professor Lee is a gem. I loved this class!",
    "Angela Lee Smith is probably one of the best instructors at Yale. She is extremely passionate about the class and organizes it in a way that makes learning effective. She does a great job at creating a stress-free environment that is conducive to learning. The course did a great job of laying a foundation of grammar patterns and vocabulary. There were many resources to turn to, both online and in-person, whenever we needed help with the material. The only thing I would change about the class is making homework deadlines explicit.",
    "Professor Lee-Smith is an amazing professor with great energy. Because each module is so compartmentalized, you easily learn each topic in Korean without being overwhelmed.",
    "Strengths: meeting every day was very good to keep us all practicing speaking, and it was a fun class to go to anyway!\r\nWeaknesses: the workload of the course got extremely heavy towards the end compared to the rest of the year because we seemed to be behind, but it may have been the weird timing of the breaks. Sometimes homework assignments were not very explicitly stated either, but the professor is very lax about it so it was fine.",
    "The course is incredibly fast-paced. I think that the classroom facilitates a good learning environment but I wish that we went more in-depth with certain topics, including the grammar structures.",
    "Listening and speaking in Korean",
    "This course only has strengths! Professor Lee is incredibly encouraging and enthusiastic, and is very good at explaining new concepts. The class is structured in a way that teaches you a lot without feeling overwhelming.",
    "No weaknesses to this course - the professor is very kind and knowledgeable, the work was doable and helped add to the language learning process.",
    "This class was great! One potential weakness is that some parts of the course felt like busywork, although I understand that repetition can be a helpful tool for memorizing vocabulary. One place I think the class could be improved is an increased emphasis on language retention over the long run, rather than short vocabulary quizzes every few days. Luckily, Prof. Lee-Smith was quite receptive to this and tried to adjust the class accordingly."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Lee is a kind and helpful professor that just wants everyone to succeed. She builds an environment thats fruitful to both the academic success of her students and engaging with her and the other students.",
    "Definitely! Professor Lee-Smith is a truly amazing professor. Korean is a hard language to learn, but she makes it accessible and fun. You learn so much about Korean and Korean culture in a semester. It is by far one the best classes  I've taken at all.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic language course with a fantastic professor. You learn content past the 110 level that really lets you get a better grip on the language. Take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if taught by Angela Lee Smith. The course is structured in such a way that improves your reading, writing, and speaking skills. Although it increases slightly after Thanksgiving break, work is also distributed evenly throughout the semester and it does not feel like a burden.",
    "Absolutely! You will learn a surprising amount of Korean with a very fun and dynamic teacher!",
    "Yes!",
    "I think that anyone wanting to learn an East Asian language would definitely be well-suited in this class. However, if they are looking for a course with a minimal workload, they definitely should not take this course.",
    "Yes, the teacher is amazing. And I learned more than I thought I would in one semester.",
    "Definitely! You will learn a lot and have fun doing it!",
    "Yes, definitely! Its a very good L1 language course to take because it isnt overwhelming, but you still make a lot of progress in language learning by the end of the semester. Its a very comfortable environment to practice speaking in, as mistakes are scrutinized and instead are used to learn from.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a great introduction to the Korean language at a beginner's level. The course was geared towards facilitating greater comprehension of Korean rather than earning points through assignments and assessments."
