                "Strengths: You learn a lot, particularly if you're not cultured on the EU like I was before taking the course\r\nWeaknesses: Just Zoom, but that was unavoidable this year. Still think we made the most of it.",
                "Strengths of the course are Marnix and his understanding of the material. He was always so engaging in class and was able to push the discussions very far. Most of the readings were very great, however some of the were just not that applicable. He also got amazing guest lecturers that actually pushed our knowledge to another level and it was super awesome to be able to get to see first hand accounts of certain things. A weakness of the course could be the vagueness with rubrics and what exactly was wanted with certain assignments.",
                "The class was early in the morning, which is not the best for a class that requires a lot of attention. Marnix is an expert on the topic and speaks very quickly sometimes and some of the things he says may go over your head. Otherwise, it's a great course and is clearly structured to better prepare students for life after college and for real work. For instance, the assignments included policy memos and an oral exam, which are both practices that better prepare you for the work most of us will be doing in the near future. Your writing of academic papers and taking written exams aren't really preparing you for the types of work you'll be expected to do in the real world. The assignments in this class are.",
                "For me, the biggest strength of this course was that the economics learned were clearly connected to real-world events and applications. A possible weakness would be that there is not much clear grade feedback, but I guess it is not as important since the course is a seminar.",
                "Good discussion, good variety of material, but we could get more active feedback throughout the semester. It would also be nice to get your peers policy memos before the debate, so you can prepare.",
                "I enjoyed the seminar format of the course. Professor Amand made classes very engaging and interesting and I rarely found myself losing focus. I also thought the assignments were manageable and fun to write. Finally, the guest speakers were of exceptional caliber, which made guest lectures amazing. One weakness of the course is that we did not receive much feedback on our work.",
                "I loved this course. Professor Amand is fantastic and the speakers were amazing. The work is challenging and enjoyable, and the paired format is a cool addition."

                "Absolutely. I cannot wait for the day when I meet an attractive European (Italian?) girl at a bar, and pull out this wide range of knowledge that I have accumulated on the European Union. We're going to talk Brexit, the sovereign debt crises, and much much more. The ultimate European knowledge cocktail class in my opinion. Attributes gained: +10% douchiness, +10% worldliness. Take it for a fun, engaging credit with a wonderful professor.",
                "Yes, it is amazing. One of the best classes that I have taken at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you are very interested in the EU and if you have some knowledge of it because if you are not really interested you'll end up not paying much attention to the nitty-gritty details from the readings and class and this will probably be bad for you when it comes time for your oral exam. You can get through the course and get a good grade on all the assignments leading up to the oral exam without doing an immense amount of work but unless you really pay attention and pick up and study the material throughout the entirety of the course you will not do well on the oral and you won't get much out of the course. So have a real interest in the topic.",
                "Yes most definitely recommend!! Coming out of this course, I have a much much better understanding of how not only European economics work, but also how the equations and models learned in economics are actually applied in real life. This class really helped me put all the information together. I understand the economics behind Brexit and also the currencies, exchange rates etc. I recommend this course because the information I learned was not something I would study for the test and then forget, and I definitely have a more profound understanding than before. So if you want to take a class that will make you understand why economics you learn are important and how they work in real life, take this course !!!!",
                "Yes, definitely. The course deals with a very engaging and dynamic topic that is particularly interesting if you are European. Prof. Amand is super engaging and knowledgeable, which makes for very engaging lectures. The assignments are not too difficult and you will get the chance to hear from some wonderful guest speakers.",
