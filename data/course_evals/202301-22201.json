                "Strengths: Got lots of great feedback and it was an engaging class. Plus there were many fun performances to watch. \r\nWeaknesses: Critiques were quite tough to go through. Also the class was almost entirely on modern dance, which I guess could also be a pro for you.",
                "Strengths - This class is a very complete survey of American 20th century dance. The video footage we got to look at is quite difficult to come by and gives amazing detail about \"big names\" like Agnes De Mille and Martha Graham. We also had amazing guest instructors come to talk to us about different dancers and teach us a little bit of different styles.\r\nWeaknesses - This course can be a little intense at times. Assignments are graded particularly harshly for a small seminar, contributing to some increased anxiety about grading. By relaxing grading while still providing the same amount of comments, this may reduce stress in the small classroom setting while still pushing students to write better and better with each exercise.",
                "Strengths: tons of opportunities for really accesible feedback like tons and it helps you really improve as a writer\r\nCons: the class sometimes felt a bit narrow in material and too broad in the use of class time. Would love to see a more diverse syllabus!",
                "Sometimes in class activities felt really repetitive which hampered engagement. Towards the end of the semester, you could see the engagement weaning."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in dance and musical theater. After the course's completion, I was able to draw connections between works I had never heard about before the course. I also wrote a nine page final essay for the class, which was a great celebration of how far my writing has come this semester. I am so glad that I learned how to write in a more concise, analytical fashion about art!",
