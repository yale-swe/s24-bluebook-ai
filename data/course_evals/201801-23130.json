    "Writing academically",
    "Professor Jones was a fantastic lecturer, who really encouraged my ever-growing journey as a writer. I learned the art of argumentative writing, and charitable approaches to opinions that were unlike my own. Also, I really gained a great deal of knowledge about art and its impact on our lives!",
    "Much better writer",
    "I gleaned a lot about self-image, art perception, and also close reading analysis and essay writing techniques in general. It was extremely insightful to me in more ways than I imagined."

    "Maybe more feedback and close analysis on our paper",
    "Very great material",
