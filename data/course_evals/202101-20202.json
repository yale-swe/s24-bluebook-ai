I have learned how to be more intentional about every word, to think more critically about what the specific language I use conveys, and to develop first drafts into much stronger pieces. Overall, my work just vastly improved -- it is clearer, smarter, more pointed, more meaningful, and overall, just better than it previously has been, thanks to feedback from my advisor, her assistant, and other faculty and students in the Writing Concentration.",

It also gives you a chance to see whether a life as a writer is something you're interested in.",
