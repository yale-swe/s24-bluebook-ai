I also gained a broader sense of what it means to understand and remember history through using a variety of media types (history books, documentaries, news articles, and poetry) and by speaking directly with historians, activists, and scholars from Northern Ireland who joined our classes at Professor Weirs request.",

                "The strengths of this course were many, so here are some of the biggest ones. Professor Weir is incredibly knowledgeable and well-connected and uses her experience to make the content as accessible as possible. She packed an incredible amount of information into the syllabus without it ever seeming overwhelming. Getting the chance to speak directly with other experts on the subject was wonderful, but Professor Weir also did a great job of encouraging students to share their own thoughts and analysis through presentations and discussion. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that I would improve about this class is that I would have liked a few more opportunities to speak with my classmates in smaller groups and get to know them that way (always a struggle on Zoom!).",
                "Strengths: Professor Weir is amazing. I loved the format of the class, with weekly guest speakers and classmate-led summaries of course material. The guest speakers were all so interesting. Weaknesses: Because we had guest speakers every class, we didn't have as much time for class discussion. I wished I could have spoken to/gotten to know my classmates more, and also heard more of Prof. Weir's insights. Prof. Weir didn't give us much feedback on our weekly reflections.",
                "A strength is listening and learning from guest speakers who were directly involved in Northern Ireland's conflicts. A weakness is that the grading is arbitraryonly ~a quarter of grades were uploaded by the end of the semester to canvas, so it's hard to gauge what exactly the professor is looking for.",
                "Strengths: Professor Weir, class discussions, guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: student presentations (usually very long and not as engaging as lecture)"

                "Having weekly assignments rather than a few large papers was helpful for me in staying consistently engaged with the course without feeling overwhelmed by looming deadlines. It was also a treat to Zoom with experts residing in Northern Ireland, which I dont think would have been as possible in a non-virtual format.",
                "Each class a student would give a presentation and then the guest speaker would answer student questions. It would've been useful if the professor contextualized the point of that week's readings and tied together the readings, speaker presentation, and guest speaker's bio at some point during class.",

                "Yes! This seminar is a great political science or history class for anyone who wants to go in-depth about a particular region with the help of a really wise professor. Its also accessible for students who may not have taken upper-level history or political science seminars - this was my first history class but I wasnt overwhelmed!",
                "Yes! Class assignments are weekly reflections and not papers  which is a pro or a con depending on what you want to get from the course. I would have felt a lot more satisfied leaving the class having completed at least one paper. Either way, the course was amazing. I loved Prof. Weir and the guest speakers and feel like I know so much more about the Troubles. I do wish I'd gotten to engage with the coursework in a more meaningful way, though.",
                "Yes. Learning about Northern Ireland gives one a platform to learn about the complications that are involved in sectarian violence. No conflict is as simple as they are made out to be, and there are fewer conflicts in the world that demonstrate the complex nature of violence as well as Northern Ireland does.",
                "Conflict in Northern Ireland isn't heavily discussed in other classes, so if this is a topic of interest, then you should take the course",
