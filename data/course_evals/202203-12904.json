                "Strengths: Not too bad a workload despite being every day (this could depend on prof). Not too focussed on semantics and grammar - more about prof knowing what you are trying to say \r\nWeaknesses: Feel brainwashed into a liberal agenda to get a good grade",
                "The greatest weakness is the computer use policy. Classes like this one thrive off student discussion in class, but the class is generally on their computers even when they are not needed, and as a result it is difficult for the prof to engage the students.",
                "Strengths: the content felt very interesting and relevant and I enjoyed all the units. Weaknesses: it felt like we moved through a lot quickly yet superficially and I would have personally preferred a few less topics and the opportunity to delve deeper.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the projects we worked on during the asynchronous days. One of the weaknesses of this course was the play we read (I found it very confusing).",
                "tough and challenging, witches section was pointless and unhelpful, not relevant and difficult to understand but rest was interesting",
                "Strengths: I liked how we were encouraged to speak without too much focus on grammar and correctness. I was able to improve my fluidity speaking since I did not have to focus as much on speaking correctly.\r\nWeaknesses: This class had a lot of work that was unequally distributed. Sometimes projects or large assignments would be assigned so they had to be done in one or two weekdays and then multiple days\/weekends would be left with little to no work. For instance, a paper was assigned Monday, a full draft was due Wednesday, then we were given a full week to edit that paper before it was actually due. A more equal distribution would have helped make the workload more manageable."
