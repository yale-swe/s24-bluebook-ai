We covered subjunctive forms, motion verbs, participles, gerunds, and various aspectual distinctions. This course was a little bit more hands-on than the Elementary Intensive, as we also got to create presentations in Russian on topics of our choosing, and we read some interesting stories, poems, and songs, including  and .",

                "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the course, mainly because Professor Muravnik (as well as the two other assisting teachers) is so engaging and passionate about what he teaches. However, the workload is extremely high, and I often found myself spending two or more hours per day on homework. When I grew busy with other courses, a few days of late homework quickly compounded and necessitated full days of only Russian work to get back on track. I understand this is the nature of the intensive course, but I wonder if there could be a way to make it less time-consuming.",
                "Strengths: Small class size make for engaging seminars. Professor Muravnik is an incredible teacher and the TFs were very helpful and insightful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not so much a weakness, but the daily classes are difficult to fit into a busy course schedule. Still, in my view, if you are committed to learning Russian quickly, there's no better option at Yale to do so than Intensive Russian.",
                "Strengths: I just love the intensive format in general. It's really lovely to learn a language with a bunch of other people who also really want to learn the language, and my class became quite close as a result. We moved really quickly, so I felt like I was able to fully immerse myself in the grammar of the language, and my fluency has improved leaps and bounds as a result. It became clear that studying Russian every day of the week was paying off when I realized I was accidentally slipping into Cyrillic when writing notes for other classes. Weaknesses: communication between the two TFs and the professor was lacking. It could be really confusing at times, because there just wasn't a lot of clear coordination between lessons, and all the constructors often seemed confused as to whether or not we had a quiz coming up, or exactly where we'd left off in the textbook. There were occasions when the professor would forget to post the homework, and the homework was often confusing. We mainly stuck to the workbook material, but the professor split up the sections erratically, such that we might have 3 pages of work on Wednesday and then 20 pages on Thursday, which made life kind of difficult at times. Additionally, I kind of wish the professor had  scheduled the date for our midterms and final a bit earlier. For both, we didn't learn when the oral exams would be until about four days before the scheduled date. This made studying for them kind of difficult.",
                "This course is great! Its a lot of work, but the chance to read short stories and present at the end is really rewarding. On the other hand, the  workbook pages start to feel repetitive and overwhelming about halfway through the semester."

                "Especially with Professor Muravnik teaching, this course is a must-take. If you are committed to studying Russian and rapidly improving your fluency, there is no better option than the Intensive Russian program. This course demands a high commitment from its students, but if you're willing to put in the effort, you will earn tremendous rewards.",
                "Highly recommend! If you want to become fluent in Russian, the intensives are the way to go! They're difficult and fast-paced, but incredibly fun and rewarding. Just know that you will have homework every night, and if you don't do the homeworks, they really start to pile up. I somehow managed to stay pretty much on top of everything, although I did skip the assignments that were posted after they were supposed to be due, which happened twice. Also there is a quiz and a test every week.",
