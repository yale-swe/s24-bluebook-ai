    "In addition to learning about the text, I learnt a lot about Catholic theology and Italian history and literature. Its impossible to cover all of the depth in the Comedy in one course  but we definitely learnt a lot!",
    "I gained a rich appreciation for perhaps the best poet in the western world. I absolutely fell in love with Dante, and learned a variety of tools and ways to think about the text that have kept me thinking about it even when Im not reading it. I also gained a greater facility with reading for intertextuality AND intratextuality.",
    "This is a guided reading of The Divine Comedy over the course of the semester. I learned about all the different references, styles, and intricacies of a great work of Western Culture.",
    "General knowledge of Dante and the period",
    "You will learn so much through this course, covering everything from Dante's life to medieval Italian politics to Christian theology. The Divine Comedy is amongst the greatest works of the Western literature and it is quickly clear whythe language is gorgeous, the imagery deeply evocative, and the narrative moving. (I read the work in English; the above might be even more true in Italian.) Finally, I think this course could be especially fulfilling to those curious about poetry and Christianity.",
    "I learned more about Dante and the Divine Comedy.",
    "Close reading of The Divine Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso), engaging discussions on the themes, characters and historical context of the poem.",
    "I learned how to close read a piece of literature. I also learned how to think of things such as historical context, intertextuality, and intratextuality when reading epic poetry. Most importantly, I gain an appreciation for an immensely beautiful classic work of western literature.",
    "I read the entirety of the Divine Comedy and learned more about the classical tradition it reflects on, as well as deeper meanings behind aspects of the book.",
    "This course offers a deep analysis of Dante's Divine Comedy from Inferno through Purgatorio to Paradiso."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this course is Professor Mazzotta. He is one of the worlds leading Dante scholars, and this becomes clear super quickly in class. He knows the text inside and out, and is so passionate about it! While this meant that the class felt unstructured at times  we would, at times, spend much longer on specific tangents than on the assigned reading  I think it was more natural and more interesting this way.",
    "A strength of this course is the reading itself, which it would be absolutely impossible to improve. The reading each week is minimal, allowing students to really engage with it, but I felt like a lot of other students werent as engaged as I was. The final paper offered a great opportunity to dive deeper into the material.",
    "The lectures were super disorganized and hard to follow. Mazzotta has a lot of really cool ideas about the Divine Comedy, and it was great once the TF's explained them to us in section, but it was often almost impossible to understand him in class as he jumped really quickly from subject to subject and didn't always explain the connections. In the second half of the semester we started using the beginning of class to talk in small groups about the readings which I actually found very helpful. The text is a little dense and being forced to discuss it in class made me actually try to understand what was going on.",
    "This course is pretty easy.   You'll have about 3-4 chapters of the book to read for every lecture, you'll discuss the chapters in lecture\/section and write a paper at the end of the semester.  It's fun, and the professor really knows his stuff.  It can be slow at times though.",
    "Mazzotta is very hit or miss. He got off to a brilliant start and became more and more incomprehensible as the semester went on. \r\n\r\nHaving a final exam and paper was not good - the paper should be due earlier or we should just have two midterms and a paper.",
    "Strengths: sections are very good at helping one understand the text, reading the Divine Comedy is amazing, and lectures help you understand the context behind Dantean poetry. There is so much going on in Dante's poetryhistory, Italian culture, and theology all drive the work below the surfaceand Professor Mazzotta is an excellent guide in unpacking the hidden meanings and subtle references tucked away within the poem. Had I read the text on my own I would not have been able to attain this level of understanding and clarity in reading the text. Professor Mazzotta is among the greatest Dante scholars of his time and has dedicated a lifetime to studying this text. This level of mastery and scholarship of a single text is something I have never seen before and it is a delight to see it in action during lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures can be a bit unfocused, because Professor Mazzotta knows so much about the Divine Comedy. As a result, we went on tangents that made lectures hard to follow at times, but were nonetheless interesting.",
    "This course was amazing! One of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating subject to explore - no matter who you are or your background, there is something to love here in the text. Section (Kirsten Herdman's - she is amazing) was actually a really fantastic add-on to the class that clarified points covered in lecture and in the text - this is vital as people are from vastly different backgrounds and have differing levels of pre-class knowledge. Mazzotta is a very passionate and knowledgable professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class was extremely disorganized all of the time - Mazzotta is brilliant, but it would really help to add structure or planning to his lectures. If Mazzotta is taking this class in the future, try Credit\/D-ing this class if you can; he is amazing to just sit back and listen to but when it comes to understanding the material you don't really have any notes to go from. The other TA (Sandro) was really unpleasant to students from what I heard about from people in other sections and my own experience dealing with him in this class and in the past. Making the essay worth less and the exams worth more would improve the balance of the class - the exams (which have a lot of guidance and tests your knowledge of the text) are only worth 15% each (even the final), but the essay with no real guidance or grading scheme is worth 50% and you have no idea where you stand with it before the semester ends.",
    "This is very much a classic Yale humanities lecture. You show up to class and have the professor lecture at you about the particular section of the reading for the entire time. It works well, and seems appropriate given the breadth and depth of discourse and commentary that have accumulated around Dante for the past seven centuries. I wouldn't have the class any other way. Also, there is something nice about having this kind of old-school experience. It isn't trying to be something its not, and it ends being very sincere. The obvious strength of the course is the material. The Divine Comedy is sublime. The Professor is also so knowledgeable and passionate about the material. He doesn't just know the text, he somehow feels it in a way that transcends understanding. The TAs were very helpful and kind. Overall the class had a feeling of rigor and respect for its material without taking itself too seriously or creating an environment that was stuffy or oppressive.",
    "The strength of this course is that you get to read the entirety of the Divine Comedy in detail. Another strength was section  my section was really helpful for clearing up confusing parts of the book, learning more of the context behind intertextuality in the book, and learning more about Dante's world and the classical world. For someone who's interested in learning more about the classical and\/or catholic tradition, this is a great class. A serious weakness was lecture, a lot of times. Professor Mazzotta is one of the best Dante scholars, and it's an honor to be in his class. But his lectures could be hard to follow, and I wouldn't always necessarily leave knowing what I learned. Having a sort of structure for each class meeting, beyond the canto we are studying, would be helpful.",
    "I was drawn to this course because I really liked the premise: close reading the Divine Comedy in the greater historical context to really get the most out of the brilliant text. However, I found the class extremely disorganized. The professor never had a clear lesson plan, which made it even more challenging to understand the text. I think this class has the opportunity to be GREAT. The three texts provide a natural roadmap, and the instructor should be prepared to follow it or deviate thoughtfully."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Catholic and Italian history  but also to anyone looking to examine their own moral beliefs and examine a piece of incredible literature. This class puts life into perspective.",
    "I would. I think its the perfect fourth or fifth class- intellectually stimulating and inspiring, without being too much work; a pure delight.",
    "No, Professor was clearly an eminence in his field years ago, but his lectures are disparate and incoherent at this point. You could tell because students gave up on taking notes halfway through the course. TA's frustration could be noticed throughout lecture.",
    "The lectures were super disorganized and hard to follow. Mazzotta has a lot of really cool ideas about the Divine Comedy, and it was great once the TF's explained them to us in section, but it was often almost impossible to understand him in class as he jumped really quickly from subject to subject and didn't always explain the connections. That being said the work load of this course is super light and the lectures are not boring if you can stay focused through them. There is a midterm and final which are both very easy, basically just passage identification, and a final paper which was about fifteen pages long. I found the final paper a little hard to write. There was plenty of guidance early on but it's worth fifty percent of the final grade and it's the only out of class assignment.",
    "If you've always wanted to read The Divine Comedy, take this class.  You'll learn the text way better than you would by reading it on your own.",
    "Solid 5th class - would probably not take w Mazzotta but it is very easy. Dante is such an incredible read. Shop it.",
    "Absolutely, this is a gem of a course and one of the best I have taken at Yale in my four years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was incredibly interesting and well-taught.",
    "This was a fantastic course on a seminal work of literature: TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Mazzotta is an excellent professor who gives a lot of context and explanation alongside his interpretation of the text. Even if you aren't an Italian\/Lit major, this course is not difficult. The reading load is light and always engaging.",
    "I mostly would recommend this. The subject matter, the assignments and the TA-led section really help you to enjoy the class. Mozzotta is such a brilliant mind, however his lectures are so disorganized that, while entertaining and fun to listen to, really don't help you understand the material at all and can confuse you even more. Workload is very light outside of the two (relatively easy) tests and a final paper that you can write on almost anything tangentially related to The Divine Comedy. This is a prime class to Cr\/D!",
    "Absolutely! The Divine Comedy is such a pleasure to read. It opens so many new frontiers for intellectual exploration. There is truly no concept that cannot be thought of in relation to the poem, as it is truly encyclopedic. I am not even a humanities student and this class was the most engaging and honestly useful of my semester. The workload really is not bad, which I think is an important aspect of the course. A modest workload combined with a very engaging subject results in a situation where one wants to spend more time on the class than is strictly necessary. Therefore, I actually felt like I had the time and encouragement to just sit back and think about Dante and the Divine Comedy. It is very much a work that deserves such consideration, and I would change nothing about the class as it promotes that kind of intellectual interaction with the text.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class to another student, particularly if they're interested in the material. Lecture isn't the greatest, but if you really want to read Dante's work, it's worth it. And the TAs are awesome.",
    "It depends on who is teaching the course. I would recommend it if you don't have Professor Mazzotta, as I found his lectures incredibly difficult to follow and frustrating. If you do take it with Mazzotta, make sure you have a great TA who can fill in the gaps."
