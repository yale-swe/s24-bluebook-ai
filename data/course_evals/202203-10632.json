Having taken this course, my Russian vocabulary has increased to a great extent, and I feel much more confident producing certain grammatical constructions than I did last year.",
                "I learned a lot of Russian history while also continuing to polish my Russian grammar and acquire vocabulary",
                "Greater proficiency in Russian speech, writing, and reading.",
                "I gained an ability to speak about a wider range of subjects in Russian and solidified multiple grammatical topics.",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course was the instructor.",
                "Strengths: Professor Muravnik is a super engaging and enthusiastic instructor. He is very good at explaining grammatical nuances and is quite willing to entertain linguistic, etymological, or topical rabbit holes (), which I appreciated. I also found our presentations fun and helpful, in that they fostered group discussion. And I really enjoyed the home reading project, from which I gained not only an increase in my vocabulary, but a deeper appreciation for Russian literature.",
                "The main strength of this course is that there is so much reinforcement built in. You learn vocabulary that comes up in the history readings, get quizzed on it, use it in grammar drills, and see it on the test. The essays on history are read for homework, discussed in class, and reviewed. Grammar is practiced and reviewed throughout. I always felt prepared for quizzes and tests and summative assignments. The main improvement that I think could be made is to increase the amount of listening practice. There was something near the beginning, and we were supposed to listen to the essays for homework, but otherwise we never did any focused listening practice. Of course we listened to Russian every class, but that's not the same as being exposed to a variety of sources and practicing global and local listening comprehension. I think the outside reading requirement should be pared down or spaced out with intermediate deadlines because it was a lot of reading to complete all at once (as I think most of us did).",
                "Strengths - language immersion, daily engagement through homework, history lessons intertwined with vocabulary enrichment\r\n\r\nWeakness - as so much of the class was lecture-based, speaking was not practiced as much as listening and literacy skills",
                "The strength was the instructor and the textbook he wrote. I also enjoyed that we could plan when to do our major presentations so they would not interfere with other midterms. On the other hand, I know many people scrambling to do them all in the last week, so this is definitely a class that requires you to organize yourself. The main weakness was that the syllabus was released week by week on Sunday evenings for homework and tests which can be a bit annoying but not a major issue by any means.",
                "This course is very well organized. It followed a natural progression, and I feel like all the material we covered was relevant. I wish we had had more opportunities for oral practice, but that is a minor complaint.",
                "This course is well-structured for student engagement, the seminar style provides opportunities for students to practice their language skills and encourages a popcorn-style of dialogue with the professor."

That said, be prepared to do homework assignmentswhich typically consisted of grammatical exercises, an essay to read, and a summary to writethrice weekly. It's a fair amount of work, although it's very much worth your while if you're trying to reach a higher level of fluency in Russian.",
                "This is a really good way to develop your Russian proficiency",
                "Absolutely. If you want to improve your Russian, especially if youre a history person, this is the way to go about it. Its a challenge for sure but the improvement Ive noticed in my own proficiency is considerable.",
                "If youre interested in Russian, 100%!!",
