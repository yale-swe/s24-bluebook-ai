                "In this course I gained a genealogical understanding of the American Presidency. Too often discussions about the American Presidency focus either on the Constitutional construction or on one or another institutional reformulation said to have dramatically altered the nature of American Presidentialism. This course helped me understand how the American presidency evolved incrementally over time from a restricted, apolitical office to the expansive and politicized branch of government it is today. After taking this course, I'm convinced that understanding this complex history is a prerequisite to having an informed opinion about modern proposals to reform American governance.",
                "Through this course, I was able to understand the development of presidentialism deeply and comprehensively. Its foundations, development, and current practices. The readings were excellent for understanding both the constitutional and institutional aspects and the political aspects from the different perspectives that nurture the understanding of the subject."

                "Strengths: Prof. Skorownek is incredibly intelligent and you will leave each class more attuned to broad institutional development \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You dont receive a grade for any assignment so its hard to gauge your place in the course",
                "Professor Skowronek is deeply invested and knowledgeable on the topic. I appreciated his selections of readings that directly engaged with and refuted each other; I feel like I came out of the class having read some of the best arguments on either side of the often contentious topics at issue. I found Professor Skowronek's honest attempts to solicit disagreement from students particularly helpful; class discussions were lively and interesting.",
                "Strengths: 1) Prof. Skowronek's profound knowledge and outstanding teaching ability. 2) The excellent selection of readings, rich in different points of view. 3) The small size of the course allowed interesting debates. 4) The atmosphere of respect for differing opinions."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. Presidentialism was a great course, and there is no greater expert on this topic than Professor Skowronek. I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the study of institutions, has previous experience with American political history or APD, and enjoys reading.",
                "Yes if this is of interest to you. The reading is heavy and the material is dense but if you are intrigued by this area of focus there is no better person to learn from than Prof. Skorownek",
                "You should take this course if you think American government needs reform, and if you have any opinion whatsoever on how to reform it. I came into this course with some very concrete ideas about what I thought was wrong with our system of government as it currently functions, and with some vague ideas about what could be done to make it better. To the extent that any of those ideas impacted the presidency, I can now say that my opinions have either a) changed, or b) are significantly better informed by history and a grasp of the incentive structures created by having certain institutions over others.",
                "I definitely recommend the course. If you are interested in presidentialism this is the perfect course. Stephen Skowronek is an excellent professor, respectful, and very interested in his students. The readings were fantastic and they covered different points of view. Class discussions were really interesting."
