                "I am an English major but my previous coursework has primarily focused on reading for craft and discussing how form conveys meaning. So, this was the first time I took an English course that was very content-based, and it was a huge learning curve for me. The first few sessions I felt super uncomfortable just because I wasn't used to my classmates actually refuting my reading of the text. Initially, I was annoyed because I felt there was a lot of fancy rhetoric being used for very simple ideas, which I don't think is untrue, but I definitely came out of this course with a better handle on both articulating my own argumentative thoughts and listening and then parsing someone else's argument regarding the text. I would also say that the content of this course itselfEmerson's essays, Dickinson's poetry, and then Melville's proseis pretty demanding, so I was definitely pushed in terms of both internalizing and then articulating my thoughts about these authors.",
                "I learned how to approach literarature and reading in a fundamentally different way, and how to track distinctly American styles and throughlines in the works of the three writers we read."

                "The biggest strengths of this course were Professor Deming himself and the syllabus. During our last day of class, many of my classmates expressed how these readings and the course itself changed their lives, and I could not agree more, particularly with Dickinson. There are not many courses out there with such a large emphasis on Dickinson as ENGL 275, so taking this course just for Dickinson alone would be worth it. However, Emerson and Melville are both incredible writers, and all the readings were fascinating and engaged with each other so well. Professor Deming was also a fantastic seminar leader and really pushed us to take our ideas further.",
                "Overall, I think this is a very strong course. I think there could have been a better background on transcendentalism/how these authors contrasted or conformed with convention of the time. Over time, the through-line of these three authors definitely becomes obvious, but I do think we studied each in a silo and putting them in conversation could be enriching. Going back to how I improved, this course heavily emphasized using the text to justify any argument you are making, where I felt in previous classes, it was easier to rely on feelings alone. A weakness would be the amount of material (I'm thinking specifically of reading, or trying to read, Moby-Dick in 2 weeks). We definitely ran into that classic problem of not being able to discuss a large amount of what we readeven on Dickinson, which was definitely the lightest part of the course, we often spent one class discussing one poem. This isn't a totally bad thing, as I think the central virtue of this course is how it pushes you to think, less the content it forces you to read, but I think it's something to maybe be interrogated.",
                "The strengths of this class are the texts we read and the professor: Professor Deming is truly a once in a lifetime teacher and scholar.",
                "Strengths of this course are fairly universal: the texts, the discussions, and the professor are all fantastic. Workload, too, is manageable, and geared towards improving discussionin addition to a midterm and a final, everybody writes one ~1,000 word discussion response, spread out according to the schedule, with which to \"lead\" discussion during the next class. This worked a lot better than I expected, allowing us to more directly engage with the ideas of the people around us. No weaknesses that I can think of, even in the online format.",
                "Professor Deming is truly one of the English Department's finest teachers. This course benefits greatly from his instruction, especially with regards to the units on Emerson. I only wish the seminar could have been in person. Regardless, even with the zoom format, I found myself immensely engaged with each and every session."

I can't make a decisive judgement value either way because a) I generally think it's better to lean into zoom silences than try to fill holes because it can generate better discussion but b) the professor's various antics definitely fostered a banter (aloud and over chat) amongst the people in the class that was totally absent in my other seminars.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The readings are incredible and never felt overwhelming, even when reading Moby-Dick! We had ample time for the readings and assignments, and the expectations were also very reasonable. Beyond this though, the course is very engaging due to Professor Deming's leadership of seminars. I really appreciated how he made efforts to actively involved everyone and how he pushed us to go further with our ideas and thoughts. The essay feedback provided was also incredible. It was extensive (a page long to be exact!), precise, and helped tremendously in improving my writing. Professor Deming also made himself really available to us through email and office hours.",
                "Yes, but not because I was obsessed with the professor or the authors (in fact, I think coming in with an adoration of the authors is not a good thing), but because I genuinely think I was pushed, by both the professor and the authors, to interrogate all of my opinions and really read a text from inside-out. Basically, I don't know if I became a \"better\" student through this course (I skipped most of Moby-Dick), but the depth of my scholarship definitely improved. Also, Deming is the kind of professor that expects all students engage and the texts themselves allow for super fruitful discussionsmy class rarely ended on time, and often Deming was reeling us in where we could have easily gone on for 30 more minutes.",
                "If I could take just one class at Yale, it would be this one. You have to be receptive to the authors, obviously, but if you're even a little bit interested in thinking about American literature with an amazing professor, this won't disappoint.",
                "Terrific course. The readings are great and conceptually interact with each other on a deeper level than I've seen in any Yale course, and the structure of the class is really conducive to some great discussions. Professor Deming is fantasticreally smart, fun to be around, just a stand-up guyand the whole semester experience really comes together to be something special. I would highly recommend this course to any other student.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is truly one of the best I have taken at Yale. Professor Deming is one of the English Department's finest teachers and this course benefits greatly from his instruction, especially with regards to the units on Emerson. He has an infectious enthusiasm for the texts we read, and encourages his students to engage with the readings and following discussions in a meaningful, truly thoughtful way. His feedback is excellent, and I can say with confidence that taking this course with him helped me become a clearer writer, but also more importantly, a better person. These texts are not light- they're meant to make you think deeply about purpose, morality, and evoke incredible emotions. To read them alone is incredible, but to read them with Deming is a true honor. Take this class, don't think twice."
