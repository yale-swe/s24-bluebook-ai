    "My Spanish has definitely improved overall.",
    "I learned how to speak Spanish comprehensively and how to write essays.",
    "My verbal and written Spanish improved a lot during this class.",
    "Spanish",
    "I furthered my grammar, vocabulary, and speaking skills in Spanish.",
    "I learned more intricacies of the Spanish language",
    "I greatly improved my Spanish comprehension, grammar, and ability to speak fluidly. I also learned about various topics surrounding art, culture and history of Spanish speaking countries.",
    "I developed the ability to speak and write in Spanish with greater fluency and ease.",
    "I gained better speaking skills from the frequent conversations we had about interesting course content, and my reading and writing abilities improved due to the challenging stories we read and the in-class essays we had to complete.",
    "Improvement of Spanish speaking and writing.",
    "I got a much better grasp at Spanish in conversation and in reading\/writing.",
    "This has been by far one of the best Spanish classes I have ever taken in my life. I mean this not because it was \"fun\" or a chill time, but because if you legitimately want to learn Spanish and improve, then this teacher and this course will get you to a higher level. I haven't seen my Spanish transformed like this in years. I also LOVED that the class made a conscious effort to integrate Spanish culture without whitewashing it or denying the role that the US played in the violence in the Americas. I felt like I got a much stronger, authentic grasp on the history of Spanish countries. Beyond that, I loved that the course integrated art, music, and film into the class. Truly, it was a wonderful course!",
    "I walked away from this class feeling as if I had gained a comprehensive understanding of the Spanish language, specifically its gramatical structures. I thought I spoke decent Spanish going into this class, but walked away much more confident in my speaking, writing, and overall understanding of the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The teacher is amazing. At times, it can go a bit fast.",
    "A big weakness was that you were taught a lot of information at once and expected to know it immediately. We did get practice but everyone had a different Spanish background, so it was difficult to tell how you were doing. The grading was also pretty harsh for minor mistakes. \r\nThe course could be improved by being slowed down and the novel being less of a focus. We don't need a month to do the novel. It was also difficult to get help, because you could only go to your professor.",
    "Strengths: You get to practice speaking a lot during class. We sometimes watch\/read interesting things.\r\nWeaknesses: We go through a lot of grammar concepts very quickly.",
    "Quizzes unfair for vocal.",
    "The course's readings were often quite interesting. Another strength was being able to speak frequently with other students in class, which improved speaking ability.",
    "The course is a fine way to practice the Spanish language, however, it is a bit tedious and boring.",
    "This is a great course that helps students improve at a very fast pace.",
    "This course did a great job of combining a lot of different forms of media to make the most well-rounded experience possible. There really weren't any major weaknesses for me.",
    "The online work doesn't usually feel very beneficial, but the course is great for improving speaking skills; we conversed about varied topics multiple times a class. It also gives you a chance to read and write about Spanish literature, which is great. If the online work was decreased, I think that the engagement in the challenging texts, such as Christopher Columbus' letter, would be higher.",
    "Strengths: lots of opportunities for verbal\/conversational practice as well as writing, varied in format of assignments and class structures, very well taught \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because it's a daily course, it's a high time commitment, and can get tedious\/feel burdensome on top of other classes.",
    "The class is honestly great. It's a nice break from my other classes and it's a lot of work, but we also learn a lot.",
    "Strengths: the integration of art, culture, history, and language. Beautifully done.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more available study materials for tests and especially for quizzes. I also found that most tests gave more material that what I felt like I had time for.",
    "I enjoyed the different ways we learned. Be it watching movies, discussing readings, or group presentations, the class always kept me on my feet and interested. Personally, I didnt always love the group projects, because I never love relying on someone else too much, but they definitely had pros and cons."

    "I would recommend it, but it really does depend on your background. If this is going to be your only Spanish course, maybe just take L5. Or, do L3\/L4 for a better background.",

    "No.",
    "Yes, the course helped improve my Spanish.",

    "If you want to improve your grammar and vocabulary in conversation while reading interesting material, this is an excellent course to take.",
    "Yes, your spanish will improve! Professor Cividanes is wonderful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student in a heartbeat. If you want an easy Spanish course, this is not for you. But, if you are willing to work and are eager to improve, then yes take this class.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot and had a great time. Professor Cividanes did an excellent job creating an atmosphere for learning and having fun."
