                "Strengths: Professor Robinson is extremely chill and nice. The plays you read are interesting (although they can also be upsetting at times). Going to see actual live theater really added to the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading two plays and watching one play each week is a big time commitment, especially when the recordings of the plays are long.",
                "Could be improved by more discussion of the papers. I think Robinson assumes a high level of experience from the people in the class such that they can take a barebones prompt and run with it,  but it might be worthwhile to provide past examples or at least a little more scaffolding for the assignments.",
                "Brilliant professor",
                "The biggest strengths of this course were the diverse, well-curated syllabus and Professor Robinson!! Professor Robinson picked a range of plays that really gave us an excellent overview of contemporary American theater. Particularly fun were the more experimental pieces (which were met with resistance by the class). However, they were still ultimately very fun to think about and discuss in the framework of the larger question of \"what counts as theater / a play?\" Professor Robinson is brilliant, supportive, and engaging. His mini-lectures at the beginning of each seminar grounded our discussions and helped us approach the material, especially since his background is in dramaturgy. He provides helpful context about the plays' productions and histories, and he would talk about his experiences watching the plays if he saw them. I think the class's aim of getting us to think about theater outside of traditional evaluative standards of merit (like a substantial \"plot\" and character development) was very successful. Even if you do not agree with what the plays are trying to do, being exposed to these \"experimentations\" has certainly been generative in helping me think about the potential of the dramatic form not just for entertainment but for didacticism and driving social change. The class has certainly sparked a lot within me, and I know I will be taking these insights as I engage with the dramatic form and other genres as well. In terms of potential improvements, I thought the discussion posts provided a great way into the plays for the week, but perhaps a word limit could be enforced as some posts got very long, and it became difficult to engage with all the posts on a meaningful level as the semester went on. My last note, which is not necessarily a weakness since it really depends on what kind of seminar-style students prefer (and was a result of the class's student makeup), but for me, I wish the class discussions would have dug more into some of the formal elements that Professor Robinson introduced through guiding questions at the beginning of discussions. These moments were the most illuminating, especially when we looked at specific moments in the text. The plays chosen are perplexing and intriguing, but sometimes our discussion would get sidetracked and emotionally charged in a way that felt unproductive. Expressing one's opinion certainly has a place in a seminar, but the opinions sometimes drifted into attacking the plays instead of discussing them on a deeper level. There would be less focus on the specific things the plays were doing in lieu of sweeping opinions based on macro-level components. I wonder how much of this aspect could be addressed by reducing the number of texts. I enjoyed being exposed to the range of texts, but I think that meant we didn't have as much time to discuss each on a deep level. But overall, this was a fabulous and really generative course. I learned a lot; the texts were wonderful; and Professor Robinson is amazing!!",
                "This is a unique course at Yale. There are no other theater courses that are as contemporary and relevant to understanding the theater landscape that, as a theater maker, I will be graduating into. The selection of plays was excellent. Another strength was the discussion boards. They really helped me focus my thoughts before class, and it was interesting to see what other people were thinking to. Every discussion board from every person ran well over the amount that I think was expected (most discussion posts were anywhere from 200 to 500+ words), which I take as a good sign for student engagement. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course, however, lay in the classroom. Professor Robinson was not very good at prompting discussions, which is so essential to a class. I will elaborate on this further during the \"strengths and weaknesses of the professor\" section"

I didn't have a huge interest in plays before the start of this semester and I'm now going to live theater whenever I can.",

I really valued the syllabus he curated and the formal questions he introduced about the nature of the dramatic form. I also really enjoyed the chance to engage with Professor Robinson during office hours; he was very supportive in helping me find ways to think about the perplexing and challenging material.",
                "It's a good class. The conversations can feel stifling, but everyone interested in contemporary theater should read these plays in a space where they have the opportunity to reflect on them."
