                "The utmost strength of this course is Professor Campbell. She is kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and most of all, ridiculously skilled at facilitating discussions on poetry. Professor Campbell also gave us two \"rest and revisit\" days without homework, which was one of the nicest things I've encountered in a Yale seminar. We sat and discussed our favorite poems and our memories on those days -- it was super nice.",
                "The strength of this course was really in the discussions between the professor and students. Every class discussion was insightful and students contributed ideas based on excerpts from the texts up for discussion.",
                "Strengths Professor Campbell is a fantastic discussion leader, provides thorough feedback on all writing/ is a fair grader, and has selected an excellent and well balanced syllabus. Really a wonderful class. Minor weakness: could maybe have provided more introductory remarks on the various poets/units to contextualize the development of poetry a bit more/provide more information on various movements and developments in literature.",
                "I liked that Professor Campbell focused on poems that people in class were interested in and allowed us to really focus on certain aspects of the poems. It made our discussions very engaging and gave me new perspectives on the authors we were reading.",
                "Strengths: Professor Campbell runs an amazing seminar. It is really inclusive and interesting. Even more, the syllabus flows nicely together and creates lots of opportunity to draw lines between poets across centuries. \r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes a lot of the material we did not have time to talk about. In addition, there was a baseline assumption of poetic knowledge (like certain poetic forms or iambic pentameter) that I did not have and felt behind on when starting the class.",
                "Strengths: professor! Format! Selection! Pacing! Quantity of work! Quality of discussion!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none."

                "I would recommend this course to any Yalie who's willing to write a few essays in exchange for the absolute privilege of getting to be in a seminar room with Professor Campbell.",
                "Required for major, I'd take this over readings in poetry 1 bc they spend a lot of time on a long epic poem that I am forgetting the name of, so even though we spend our time in the trenches with Alexander Pope, it's at least different poems of his. And the drama between the poets of the period is interesting and entertaining.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. If you aren't particularly interested in poetry from the 18th century, the course moves pretty swiftly to more recent centuries. The discussions we had in class were truly some of the best that I've experienced at Yale -- big ideas and insights about the way that we live and remember were inspired by the poetry that we read.",
                "Yes! If you're an English major and need one of your core, Professor Campbell is the perfect person to take it with. A course accessible to non-majors, too!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in poetry. Professor Campbell gave us opportunities to write our own poetry and interact with our readings in fun and exciting ways.",
                "Yes! It is a great way to familiarize yourself with poetry and provide a real solid foundation to continue studying poetry in the future.",
                "Yes! Professor Campbell gives the best feedback Ive ever seen incredibly in depth. Course is well structured and we get to read many different authors.",
                "Yes, it is an incredible introduction to poetry."
