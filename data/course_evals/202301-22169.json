In the beginning half of the semster, we raced through the remaining chapters of Hansen and Quinn's intensive Greek textbook; then, in the waning days of the term, we read selections from Plato's Apology.",

                "The grammatical portions of the course could have been reinforced with more time spent on drills (short translations, morphological practice, synopses, etc). This is a symptom, really, of the intensive nature of the course--there's just no time for anything, nor is it possible to backtrack or review during the term, since so much material must be introduced.\r\n\r\nAssessments were regular as clockwork and adequately reinforced the grammatical material assigned; standards were clearly explained, and the workload, though substantial, was no more onerous than should be expected in a classical language course.",
                "The textbook and class structure is a bit of a double edged sword. On one hand, the class moves super fast and it can at times feel difficult to consolidate all of the grammar being thrown at you. On the other hand, I can read Plato after a year which is super cool! Hansen and Quinn can get a bit dry at times with all of the drills and I would have appreciated having more narrative structure within the course (like starting Plato earlier but moving through it slower). I also did not enjoy having three quizzes a week, especially when they never assessed grammatical concepts and translation (except for two) and prized rote memorization of vocab and verb, noun, and adjective paradigms. I would have appreciated having one, more substantial quiz each week that tested these concepts working together.",
                "One of the main strengths was Talia, the TA. Shes incredibly kind, smart, and encouraging, and never makes you feel bad for asking a question. One of the weaknesses was the way quizzes were set up - I crammed for them the night before, regurgitated the information on the quiz, and then promptly forgot the material. But Im not sure if theres a way to structure quizzes better since theres simply a lot you have to memorize when learning ancient Greek. Another weakness was how little Hansen and Quinn prepared us for tackling real Greek when we finally got to the Apology. Maybe some more short passages of real Greek, modified if necessary, could be introduced prior to reading the Apology."

If you are a classics major and/or are taking Greek to get to the literature as fast as possible, this course will get you there. I feel very solid reading and parsing through Greek syntax after taking GREK 120. However, if you're just trying to get your language requirement out of the way, I would not spend it on Ancient Greek grammar drills.",
