                "I learned techniques that otherwise would have taken me months to years to uncover. The hand-picked readings were enlightening and gave me the security that I understand my craft better. The teachers then did a brilliant job reiterating the ideas in these readings. I learned first-hand how to implement the ideas in the reading. Overall, this course has given me a great sense of confidence and inspiration.",
                "I learned so much at this program I am so thankful to have been apart of it!",
                "What I've learned from this course is more than all I've learned in my three years of high school drama classes. This was a wonderful experience for me to actually delve into the art of acting. I learned so much on how to extract information from language of the character, how to disect the script, and a variety of exercises I could do during rehearsals. It also helps me build a stronger knowledge on objectives, actions, inner imageries, given circumstances, etc.",
                "How to stay connected to the play, how to find objectives, breath techniques to help the way one delivers their lines, analyzing text to find the main goal, branching out to more styles, etc.",
                "I gained a deeper and more thorough understanding of acting and an actor's work. Some information and exercises were things I already knew, but this program reinforced and deepened that knowledge.",
                "I developed an understanding of acting that I had never had the opportunity to discover before. Specifically I learned about implementing given circumstances into my acting, how to throw action, and how to increase my specificity during a scene. I also learned amazing voice techniques and self tape tips. I also got to explore my creative side in clown and how to be more comfortable with failure.",
                "wasnt in this class",
                "I have learned how to collaborate with others in a way that allows us to share ideas and give alternate inputs. I learned that everyone learns differently, and it was great to see people take the information we learned and shape it to what helps them evolve their performance.",
                "Over the duration of this program, I learned to take more risks, push myself out of my comfort zone, and let go of what I deem to be the right way to tell a story. I also became more in touch with my vulnerability and the rawness of a real moment. In addition, I learned how to work more effectively in a collaborative environment, as well as in a Zoom setting. I look forward to building upon these lessons and continuing to grow as both an actor and a person.",
                "1. Independence: One of my biggest takeaways from his program was the ability to take responsibility and control of my own learning and growth. Working with college students, having to schedule our own rehearsals outside of class (and how much rehearsal we had), optional work or participation, and other aspects of the program all helped me practice taking my education into my own hands. The teachers respected and trusted us, and I learned how to get the most out of the program through my own work and passion/ambition. \r\n\r\n2. Acting: Of course it's a given that I gained knowledge, skills AND insight about acting from this program! Starting the course with Evan's \"dance\" and getting down basic fundamentals was super helpful to get vocabulary in our mouths that we could take with us throughout the course but also to establish a sturdy foundation in technique and get ready work with a variety of different instructors. Each class brought something new to the table. I learned Linklater and adjacent techniques that supported me as an actor in other classes, discovered a new warm up routine, and learned so much about my own body and alignment in Voice, for example. Text Analysis class was one of the most rewarding for me in terms of learning. We learned about plot structures, given circumstances, production, attacking a text, and ultimately how to approach a play as an actor. I feel prepared to dive into the next play I work on with a skillset of text analysis tools. I learned the basics of clowning! I had never taken a Clown class and had no idea what to expect, and I learned SO MUCH with Gabe about etiquette, humor, warm ups, and fun. \r\n\r\n3. Life after the program: Discussions held at the end of the program with Evan, Jakeem, and Dana painted a clear picture and answered any questions I had about possible paths for me. We discussed professional acting, education (college / grad school programs, what it's like to teach, etc), and everything in between. I learned not only about being an actor in the real world, but also about other fields (ie Dramaturgy, directing, etc). KLV gave us lots of insight into the different directing/casting/teaching processes she's experienced and the struggles that come with it.",
                "There were multiple insights about my acting that benefited me greatly, the primary one being that I focus too much on myself and not on trying to convince the other actor on what I want them to do. Other things of note are to remain on voice and the clown class which helped me open up."

            "comments": [
                "While the course is online, the teachers did a wonderful job connecting with the students, in some cases one-on-one. The course could be improved by creating easy opportunities for the students to interact outside of class. This criticism is simply because of the constraints of Zoom, so as long as the following years aren't over Zoom, you should be fine.",
                "I do not think their were any weaknesses adapting to the zoom environment is never easy but Yale mastered it beautifully!",
                "Strengths: the instructors were all very preofessional and wonderful teachers. The vareity of the classes within this drama course provides me with a well-rounded set of skills to takle plays and hone my acting skills. Practical exercises were intorduced so I could utilize them in future rehearsals, auditions, and performances to improve my acting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was kind of difficult for me to concentrate on zoom over a long period of time. The instructors were doing their best to limit zoom fatigue but I guess I'm just not a computer person lol. I really wish this course could take place in person next year!",
                "It was a bit difficult over Zoom, but that's to be expected. The instructors were wonderful, they did a great job of personalizing their curricula for all of us. I would have liked more time in the On-Camera class, but I still learned a lot from Jakeem.",
                "A major strength to the course is how knowledgeable all the instructors were about their specific field they were teaching. I completely trusted each instructor and they helped me implement their advice smoothly. I can only think of one weakness. I probably would have enjoyed more individualized work with some of the teachers, but I understand that that might not be possible due to time constraints and the online nature of the course.",
                "The strengths of this course would have to be the level of collaboration, involvement and effort the program requires of the individual. The course had a lot of individual work, but also involved aspects of team building and connectivity. The one weakness I would list for the course would be that is was online this year, but even with that, we were given access to a different kind of learning style that wouldnt be replicated in real life.",
                "I especially liked the small student-teacher ratio, which allowed me to form meaningfull relationships. I also appreciated how the course pushed me to think outside the box and dig deeply into the materials. I recognize that the virtual nature of the program created a new set of obstacles that were handled well overall. However, perhaps the course could have been more organized, where all the faculty posted assignments to the same platform.",
                "Weakness: initial organization/communication. For my section at least, several of us were confused about work we were supposed to be doing outside of class because the Canvas assignments / announcements and what our teachers said in class were not reflective of each other. Everyone in the class was doing different assignments for the first week. Eventually we got it all sorted out (especially when teachers would subject announcements with something like \"SECTION A ONLY: WEEKEND HOMEWORK\"), but I think this could be resolved if we established more clearly at the beginning of the course who was meant to do what work. \r\n\r\nStrength: scene work. I think scene work was where I grew the most as an actor / what I learned the most about because of the way this program was structured. For one thing, working exclusively on scenes in Acting with KLV was the perfect way to work by doing, and I received lots of helpful feedback from the instructor and from my classmates. It was also great to watch other pairs work on their scenes. Everything we learned in other classes was helpful for scene work as well (either directly like the scenes we did in Acting for Camera or by discussing scene structure in Text Analysis). \r\n\r\nStrength: Clowning! I think Clown class is one of the best aspects fo the program. It's completely different than any other kind of acting class I've ever taken and I learned so much from it. It was full of the unexpected and Gabe was delightful and insightful. It was also a really cool way to laugh (A LOT) and get to know all of my classmatessharing experiences in Clown brought us together and helped us work together even better in all classes. I'm looking forward to working with Gabe soon on his free monologue workshop for his students this summer!",
                "I mean, it's an online course for acting. Of course it wasn't perfect but it was as good as it could've been. Besides that, my biggest suggestion is to give specific time for pupils to get to know each other because I hardly knew any of my peers."

This course is amazing for setting up the foundation for a good actor to become an excellent one. I am currently a rising senior in high school who will be applying to drama programs for college, and I feel comfortable knowing what I need to work on to get the most out of my time at drama school and beyond.",

So much professional and practical information was passed on to me that I  am greatly benefited from this course. The instructors were also all professional teachers/actors so they were the best people you could be learning acting from.",
                "Yes, it has definitely changed me as an actor and person. It has taught me things I never knew that were important to know/ learn as an actor. I've met wonderful professors and talented students that i wish to stay in touch with.",
                "Yes! I think anyone who is interested in acting can benefit from this course, even if they do not plan to pursue it as a profession.",

Everyone is so kind and willing to assist students in their journey to become the best version of themselves. It is not only an intellectually stimulating course, but a fun and enjoyable one too.",
                "Absolutely. It is rigorous and requires a lot of involvement from you, but it truly shapes how you perform, present yourself and even how you pertain yourself to everyday life.",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to other students who are interested in homing in on the foundational elements of acting. In specific, the course would allow students to expand upon their understanding of the craft by hands-on, intensive exploration of oneself and others.",
                "Definitely! I grew not only as an actor, but as a studentI learned a lot of really important skills to take with me into college, no matter what I study. The program was a really good amount of work for what I was looking for. While five weeks almost felt too short, the amount of class time and homework was extremely effective. I was able to balance this program with college applications and relaxation. The unique classes in this program are a perfect combination, and I think anyone would be lucky especially to get to take Clown with Gabe. The work in every class translated well on Zoom, and I enjoyed the balance of hands-on physical activity with intellectual work like text analysis and readings. The diverse backgrounds of all the instructors created a super cool and unique melting pot of experiences that I as a student could pull and learn from. I also got great insight from Evan, Jakeem, and Dana about possible paths after the course, and tips about acting professionally and academically for the next several years.",
