                "I became more confident in my conversational Spanish and circumlocution skills in this class, and learned new grammatical structures that I hadn't learned in previous Spanish classes.  We engaged with a variety of materials (written works, films, art, etc.) and I became more comfortable expressing complex ideas in Spanish.  I also gained a lot of cultural knowledge about different Spanish-speaking communities around the world.",

                "Some strengths included cultural connection to material that went beyond just grammatical and monotonous details. It was great to engage with Spanish in a new way.",
                "Strengths: a strong emphasis on culture, a good amount of help on vocabulary and grammar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I kind of wish that there was more emphasis on the history of the Spanish speaking world. It would have helped put the cultural things in perspective and deepened my understanding of these cultures. Also, there was a very large workload (with many projects).",
                "This course was taught very well, and the content we covered was engaging and interesting.  Since this class met so many times per week, and we had a variety of different types of assignments, I feel that I improved my conversational and written Spanish.  \r\n\r\nSometimes, the sequence of the class felt a little bit disjointed.  I also wish we had more time to practice the grammatical structures we learned in different contexts throughout the class.  There were many group projects in this class which I enjoyed, but became a little weary of by the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by devoting more time, or providing more resources to practice new grammatical structures, as well as establishing more concrete transitions between units/topics in the class.",
                "Asynchronous days were helpful and allowed me to focus on other stuff on Wednesday. Too much group/ partner work.",
                "SPAN 130 emphasizes writing skills as well as cultural and media comprehension which proved to be very helpful. The use of short films and movies helped me develop a wider vocabulary, a better cultural understanding, and better analysis skills. I think the course could be improved by putting a greater emphasis on interpersonal communication. While I think my presentational speaking skills were improved by this class, I would have liked to have had more interpersonal conversations with my classmates.",
                "I really liked the structure of the course. I loved how interactive and engaging it was!",
                "Sometimes I found it difficult to figure out what assignments to do because of both the differences between the syllabus on the umbrella cite and the individual class cite and the fact the assignments were rarely communicated in class and put on canvas.",

                "I would recommend this course to other students seeking to develop their Spanish skills.  The workload and class content is challenging, but never felt overwhelming.  I think that the class was structured and taught in way that was conducive to developing Spanish skills in a lower stakes class environment.  The small size of the class was also crucial in creating a comfortable environment that made it easy/comfortable to participate.  If you're usually unsure about participating in larger classes, or even larger seminars, as I was at the beginning of the year, this class helped me overcome my anxieties and become comfortable sharing my thoughts with the class.",
                "Yes, although SPAN 130 was sometimes demanding, I believe that it improved my language skills and was rigorous without being overly stressful.",
                "Most definitely. Not only did I learn a lot, but I also enjoyed being in the class, and even the homework was relatively interesting.",
