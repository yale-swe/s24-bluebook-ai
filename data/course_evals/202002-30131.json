   "comments": [
    "I learnt a lot about using calculus in economics and giving real life examples to explain complex economical phenomenon.",
    "I gained a strong base in Microeconomics through this course. We discussed consumer theory and firm theory. Tolga often brought in global examples to help contextualize the theory we were learning in class.",
    "I gained insight particularly into the relationship between supply and demand, and I grew in my understanding of the way that consumers think in the market.",
    "I learned how to do economics, brushed up on my algebra, and learned a lot about the world in general.",
    "I think this course really helped me to think critically about the information I rely on and the ways in which our behaviors are dramatically impacted by the way in which information is presented to us. Additionally, I learned about the way in which consumers interact with producers and how the market brings both parties together. More importantly, I learned skills that will help me in my future life as an employee and a relationship partner.",
    "basic microeconomics skills, which are very necessary as a perspective econ major",
    "Learning about basic consumer theory, firm theory, and models of economic theory between these systems at the micro-economic level. Through this I learned insight toward how firms like insurance companies market and make profits. I also learned about how companies take advantage of consumer behavior to make as much profit.",
    "I learned mainly about the concepts of supply and demand, different market structures, general utility, and the (ir)rational ways in which we tend to approach market decisions.",
    "I refreshed my math and problems solving skills, and also learned a lot about how economics plays a role in other areas of life, like politics and job prospects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very good, it would be helpful to have more practice exams because the timeline does not allow for a lot of in class practice.",
    "Strengths: Professor Koker is very organized and structured in lecture notes and pset exercises. Weakness: due to time constraint (online 5-week summer session) there was no discussion of how the principles and concepts in lectures are applicable to current events which would have made discussion more engaging.",
    "I think it is a good overview course.",
    "Tolga was extremely mindful of the fact that this was an online course. If he sensed we were getting restless in class, he would take a quick break and tell a story to keep us engaged. Furthermore, he set up study groups- which made the PSETs way more manageable- and office hours. He truly cares about you learning the content over failing you.",
    "I very much enjoyed the theoretical side of the course, and although the maths was important In understanding the content, I would like to see an even greater emphasis on the mindsets of consumers outside of those who are assumed to be perfectly rational.",
    "Strengths: I love Tolga! He really wants us to do well and makes sure we're working hard. The online lectures and in person discussion sections were good.",
    "I think this course is very well adapted for online learning. I also think the professor is very skilled in presenting material in a manner that is clear and concise. However, I think it would be interesting to discuss the value of money and the role it plays in how we view happiness. The assumption in the course was that (to a certain extent) money can buy you happiness and at times it made me wonder",
    "strength: the professor explains things very clearly. He prepared us very well for the exams. Psets are very helpful and reasonable. \r\nweakness: too  much cramming; the exam questions are phrased a bit weird and was a little confusing.",
    "Everyone in my section seemed too nervous to ask a lot of questions, so we didn't develop a great class dynamic. I think having more time would help this, because Prof. Kolker had so much material to plow through it didn't leave a lot of time to develop the comfort required for easy discourse."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Tolga is an incredible teacher and explains concepts very clearly.",
    "Unequivocally--regardless of major, this class is essential in understanding current events related to market structures (ie your ability to \"think like an economist\" will stick with you far longer than how to solve for duopoly price equilibrium based on the excellent teaching).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Tolga is a great professor and makes Microeconomics seem like an easier topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to undertake a business major as there is a challenging mix of theory and practical maths that I enjoyed.",
    "Yes! Be prepared to work hard if you're not a math person, but it's definitely doable. Sometimes the textbook is a bit above the level we're learning in class, but you should still read it. Practice the PSET and problems from class before the midterm!",
    "Yes! I think, especially in a short summer setting this course covers both breadth and depth. I think the material is presented in a very relatable manner that makes it easy to follow.",
    "Yes! It helps you understand a lot about economics and the world in general",
    "I would only recommend it if the student was interested in economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in the market and in the psychology behind economic decision-making.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to the field. Challenging but manageable."
