                "Tutorials were tedious, but discussions are engaging.",
                "Strengths: Frequent projects that give very open direction for our interests, interesting reading topics, seminar/studio style instruction\r\nWeaknesses: Seminar discussions were often dry and could have been facilitated better. The occasional cold calling to talk about our reading responses I didn't mind, but it didn't feel like a smooth way to incorporate the entire group into a cohesive discussion.",
                "i was not a big fan of how discussions were formatted. would have loved to do more hands-on things in class and have discussions while being engaged in that way.",
                "Strengths: Introduction to the material listed above. An interest in tying art-historical and theoretical considerations to the aesthetic and technological possibilities of artificial intelligence. It wasn't hobbled in by association to status-quo or functionality-oriented ideas of contemporary practice, but rather looked at its relevance to culture at a greater scale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weaknesses are those that I associate with the seminar structure at YSoA in general: namely, the class length and the limited depth of inquiry allowable due to that sort of structural limitation. Two hours a week isn't enough for any computationally-oriented course, especially one in which there must be both reading discussion and presentation as well. Another general issue I have with Yale is an over-reliance on student-led discussion and presentation, which tends to yield uneven results of questionable value. With this course, as with most of the others that I have attended here, I would prefer to see more lecture content from the professor than from students. The only real course-specific weaknesses are the final project (perhaps a bit too proscriptive and too tenuously tied to the course themes for that reason) and the fact that the computational element was entirely provided by a student Teaching Fellow. He did a great job considering, but his primary responsibilities as a student led to a delay of the release of tutorial content, often far past when its incorporation into the assignment at hand was functionally possible for people like me who with a full course schedule who needed the weekend between classes to meaningfully explore the tutorial content.",
                "I enjoyed the studio portion of the class a lot more than the discussion portion. I don't think 2 hrs/week of class was enough for both reviews/desk crit style discussion about our progress on projects and for discussing the readings. The readings were interesting, but I think the discussion could have been a lot better and more natural. It felt like our discussions were essentially recapping the reading responses that we wrote, so there wasn't a lot of new information/new ideas being discussed. We would have had a lot more time for discussion if we didn't have reading presentations, which could take at least half of the class. I think it would have been better to simply discuss the reading as a group rather than listen to a summary of the reading. The class is also much more enjoyable if you take it with people you know/make friends quickly because all of the projects are group projects.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- very interesting class (very experimental)\r\n- very informative \r\n- professor and TA are knowledgeable and helpful when asked \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the timing and quality of some tutorials\r\n- the expectation of the course (especially the first assignment)",
                "Strengths: Assignments, projects, and reviews. I loved gaining new skills and learning how to use AI tools to aid in the design process. The online video tutorials were long but I learned a ton of neat and useful skills from them. The assignment reviews were insightful and the feedback and discussions were very constructive and helpful. The readings were also quite interesting, but often were a bit dense. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Each student was required to do in-class presentations on one reading throughout the semester--these were often uninteresting and repetitive in format but I guess were a good way to do a deep dive into one of the readings, and were a good way to learn about a reading in class if you hadn't done it. I feel like that time in class could have been put to use in better ways though. The discussions on the readings were often dry. I also felt like sometimes the assignments were a little too open-ended and might have been better if they were more structured or if there were more guidelines.\r\n\r\nI think that an additional discussion section / working period would be extremely beneficial to this class to allow students to work through their projects and discuss 1 on 1 with the professor/TAs in more depth the work and process. It felt like the 2 hour class on Thrusdays wasn't enough time to really engage with the curriculum, especially considering that we often had a lot of things to cover in the short amount of time, so my main critique is that there should be a discussion section and less reliance on the readings.",
                "Strengths: 1) Exposure to a variety of cool techniques. 2) clear and helpful digital tutorials. 3) I particularly enjoyed some of the theoretical readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) Sometimes I felt like this course straddled a weird gulf between the theoretical and the production. For example, many of our readings engaged critically with AI practices in aesthetics. However, our projects asked us to use these techniques, and didn't seem to challenge us to think critically about their implementation. 2) It was difficult to generate conversation during our class -- maybe the students need to have more sense of agency/authorship?",
                "Great selection of readings, well balanced between cultural impacts, philosophy, and technology. The class discussions are pretty dry, people held off from expressing their ideas/subjectivity, could definitely benefit from more sharing of insights/perspectives from the professor. Recorded tutorials are super dry as well, hard to sit through. Little support on the printing part of the final assignment."

                "Yes, i think the material was interesting.",
                "It depends on the student. I think for undergraduates or non-major graduates with little computational knowledge (or more importantly, making knowledge), as this version of the course was oriented toward, it may be a bit challenging to produce the kinds of content desired by the instructors. This could perhaps be solved by requiring student pairings to include internal diversity, so that strengths are matched beyond ties of friendship.\r\n\r\nFor the usual version of the class for graduate architecture students, I think it certainly has the potential to offer something unique and not otherwise represented in this curriculum at present. I think both its strengths and weaknesses reveal the need for greater diversity of courses that focus on design computation and critically on the way in which technology, culture, and design are inseparable. As an auditor, my interests were primarily in understanding techniques and their application to my own design work, but I appreciate the cultural framework continue to find that to be the part that many of the masters students here struggle with- either their projects tend to be all technique/technology/architecture with little cultural consideration, or entirely about culture with precious little architecture, design, or technological sophistication. I think courses like this have the potential to emphasize the connections between.",

I gained a bunch of cool skills that I will likely put to use in the future. Highly recommend this course to architecture / art majors or generally anyone interested in futurism / using digital tools in design / philosophy of artificial intelligence... Brennan is a very insightful and wise professor and always has interesting, helpful things to say.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn more about digital processing techniques, wants to expand their oeuvre of digital techniques (for other architecture courses, or art, or personal enjoyment). I think this class was not very well suited for someone who had a primary interest in the theoretical underpinnings of aesthetics -- it was \"lite\" in a way (theoretical rigor; intensity of internal criticism) that makes me think that it is best suited -- in its current form -- for a computing and the arts major which more frequently straddles that interdisciplinary divide.",
