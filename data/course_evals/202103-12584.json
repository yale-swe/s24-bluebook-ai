                "More than anything, this course helped me develop a critical approach to hegemonic historical narratives. Throughout the semester, we approached history through alternative sources, focusing heavily on literature as an entry point to these suppressed accounts.",
                "I learned about the ways that archiving, memorialization, and other processes of remembering are heavily influenced by their colonialist languages and frameworks. It was interesting to explore how aesthetic works from literature to art and film can be used to unlock new ways of imagining and remembering the past.",
                "In this course I was able to harness my written and oral French skills. I also learned of Professor Jarvis' and Doyle's research which brought the class to life in a sense because it made the texts and films of the course feel tangible and urgent rather than something to be studied that we then quickly move on from.",
                "This course introduced histories of French colonialism in Africa through testimonies presented in film, novels, poems, art, photographs, and journalism.",
                "This class was an excellent introduction to the world of African history, politics and historical testimony. I learned about the different factors affecting African historical testimony, and how those issues perpetuate themselves in the world today.",
                "I learned how literature can be tool to learn histories that are typically silenced."

            "comments": [
                "So so many strengths. The variety of learning material felt incredibly generous and generative for classroom discussions. This course was recently transitioned into an undergrad seminar (having been taught to graduate students previously), so occasionally the workload felt rather heavy. However, Professor Jarvis was well aware and often checked in with us in order to make adjustments for upcoming weeks\/years to come.",
                "Strengths: Incredible reading material, great writing feedback, section, level of engagement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The conversation style of the class made it difficult to speak and actually be listened to. Creating an order of who is going to talk next just had the result of no one actually responding to each other and listening to the previous comment. Wish it could've been a more open conversation and no hand-raising.",
                "Strengths of the course are Prof. Jarvis! She is highly knowledgeable on global histories and invisible traces, and a kind teacher overall. She asks you to sit with the texts, as they are heavy, and class discussions are very fruitful",
                "This course was very well organized with each weekly module emphasizing a certain theme that would become the basis for our class discussions. The professor and TF also did an excellent job facilitating class discussions and fostering a community where students entered with open minds and freedom of debate and diversity of thought flourished.",
                "Great syllabus: the readings were very interesting and allowed us to traverse an entire continent and various time periods. They structure was great as well as the themes often connected very well to each other.",
                "I literally have no notes about this course it was amazing. The weekly reading responses helped me focus my thoughts in preparation for the class and led to engaging and active discussions. The essays \/ projects built on each other in a way that enhanced my French writing and critical analysis skills. Overall, this course just completely opened up a new way of learning and knowing by taking testimony and creative works seriously as truth tellers.",
                "The curation of this class' reading content was well done. I understood every week's purpose, and could easily make connections to the entire syllabus as presented to us at the beginning of the semester. Professor Jarvis led every class with poise and great dexterity. I looked forward to the class every week!"

                "Definitely. Professor Jarvis is incredibly warm and welcoming to students of various educational backgrounds. I was genuinely excited to go to class every week because the discussion dynamic was absolutely wonderful. Prof Jarvis does a really good job of encouraging students to speak up without making them feel like they're being put on the spot. The weekly reading responses are also a great way to feel prepared to verbalize thoughts on complex material.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about France's colonial past. You will gain so much.",
                "YES!",
                "Absolutely. Whether or not you study French any opportunity to learn from Professor Jarvis is one students should take advantage of. It is rare to find another professor so invested in students engagement and success at Yale, and with such an intimate knowledge of the topics at hand, this is course you would not want to miss.",
                "Yes! It is rare to have an opportunity through which you get to learn about the history of colonization from the perspective of the colonized. Approaching these topics through novels was particularly enriching.",
                "1000% this course (or really any of Professor Jarvis' courses) are essential for students interested in decolonial studies, the humanities, and Francophone and\/or African literature and studies. The syllabus introduced concepts of \"anarchive\" that will guide me in my future studies.",
                "Yes! This class changed my life and perspective on the politics of African historical memory as well as arts and culture on the African continent.",
                "I would because in this course narratives are talked about that would not be talked about any where else. Additionally, things discussed in this course do not show up in other classes meaning students who take it are exposed to unique information."
