                "The Jupiter notebook lecture format is really not a great form for online learning. It was very hard to focus and keep track and follow along when lectures were just Jupiter notebooks running code",
                "Lectures were not very engaging but the problem sets were doable with help in office hours.",
                "The topics in this course are interesting and important, but lectures were extremely dull. By far the most engaging classes were when students grouped up to work on coding tasks together. Seeing as this course is so much about practical data science skills, I think more opportunities for students to practice together would be very helpful. Also, given that the lectures and assignments are based entirely on the professor's notes, those notes should be as organized and error-free as possible, and should contain references for further reading.",
                "The course was a disaster. Disorganized, lectures and handouts full of mistakes. Office hours were poorly managed and help wasnt available beyond the trite advice, try the simplest thing for every kind of problem. Avoid this class.",
                "Strengths: introduction to a range of data science concepts\r\nWeaknesses: organization of course logistics (having pre-determined due dates for psets before the semester started, rather than announcing pset due dates along the way), presentation of material not very cohesive (unclear what the connection was between each of the separate things we learned), lecture was not very strong (sometimes lacked a fluid presentation of the material, lecture style was rambly and at times hard to understand what was important to take away)",
                "The class was very well organized. All code was posted on the class github, and the professor even uploaded (I assume latex) pdfs for the really mathematical content. Students also got a lot of autonomy, which meant the class could be chill and informative if you let it.",
                "Lectures were not always engaging and at the beginning the expectations for participation though online forums was unclear.",
                "Strengths: prof is really passionate and tries hard to make the class a good environment for student learning. Homeworks are interesting and fun without being too difficult, and allow you to really pick up the skills.\r\nDisadvantages: The main way the lecture is taught is by throwing up Jupyter notebooks on screen and running through blocks of code to see how they work. Fundamentally, I don't really think it's a great teaching methodology, to just show students the code running while throwing in a bit of explanation. Since I already have a lot of background in Python, I actually found it fairly easy to not pay attention in lecture, because you could do the homeworks and pick up the same skills just by reading the docs.",
                "A strength was that the psets were very interesting and I felt like I learned a lot from them. A weakness that could be improved was how organized the course was.",
                "Strengths: I liked how there were not any exams in the course, and it was just the problem sets and HWX. The problem sets, although hard (probably 15-20 hours every other week), were truly representative of what we learn in class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Lederman is a nice guy, but he can be hard to work with at times. Whenever I or someone else would ask a question on Github, 90 percent of the time he would tell us to google our problem (Even though many students do google it before asking). At many times he didn't really like to give help/hints.",
                "More ULA office hours. The psets are hard and the OH werent at convinient times.",
                "Strength: If you're into data science and like Python, then definitely this course will be for you. A lot of the material covered is very relevant to data science and it focuses not just on programming but also a bit on the fundamental concepts like Linear algebra and SVD. Weakness: Some of the grading is a bit arbitrary and unreasonable at times where lots of points are taken off for minor mistakes.",
                "The actual material of the course is important and useful to know for anyone interested in statistics! However, the class itself was not extremely engaging, and lectures were not particularly helpful in learning the content. The problem sets were often confusing and Professor Lederman was not great at explaining more confusing aspects of the course. The choice to just scroll through code while not explaining what it did and the theory about it didn't make much sense. Some of the linear algebra concepts were confusing, and it would have been helpful for Professor Lederman to cover the basics before jumping into complex mathematical theory. The integration of GitHub into the class was interesting, but it would have been nice to be able to collaborate more freely given the type of material/how those projects would be completed in practical situations."

I think other courses are much more organized and with better lectures than 262 with Roy and which offer similar skills and material. If you're looking for a good intro to the stats major, I highly recommend 230 with JDRS and not this course. If you want to learn Python there are other courses that do a better job (e.g. 365) or learn it on your own time (really easy to do so if you've already taken a class that requires coding in another language, e.g. 230). 262 was not a challenge for me, because I took this in my last semester for the stats major, but if I were seeing this material for the first time, I probably would've been much more confused. I don't think 262 really taught the material well either so that's why other classes are probably better",

                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they had completed the prerequisite classes. I took one of the prerequisites (Linear Algebra) at the same time as this class (which was allowed) but I felt like I was at a disadvantage in the class because of it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student; however, I would recommend that you have a pretty manageable course load because this class can take some time.",
                "If you have a strong python background & have been exposed to data science already I think its a good course. You browse over concepts quickly so most of the things you learn wont really stick with you unless you use it often.",
