Through this class I also learned about the various ways many thinkers examined, viewed, and told history. From Hegel's arc of history to Arendt's reconciliation of the breaking down of society and civilization in the 20th century I learned about what my professor called history with a capital H. Alongside learning about how history was told and how power dynamics interacted with the narrative of history I learned about the social contract, different formulations of the state of nature, varying takes on majority, the power of a sovereign, and equality held by authors like Machiavelli, Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Tocqueville.",

                "The course is amazing, I feel much more well-read now.",
                "Professor Thompson did an incredible job engaging us every day. The small seminar format provided an excellent venue for in-depth and informative discussions.",
                "Strengths: Directed Studies H&P was consistently one of my favorite classes for its rigor and depth. I felt like I was able to make the most meaningful connections between texts and ideas and narratives of history in this class both in the spring and fall. In my section with Professor Thompson we touched the beginning of the readings through discussion starters which were student led and then we expanded to the rest of the text. This method of section allowed everyone to speak and also ensured that the major points of each reading were covered. Professor Thompson facilitated section so that we could delve into the passages with close reading and her extensive knowledge of the curriculum elevated our discussions and added complexity and clarity to my understanding of these authors - more so than any other class H&P with Professor Thompson gave me the skills to close read and look for complexity in the texts we engaged with.\r\nWeaknesses: This is true across the DS curriculum, but the readings can be quite heavy and the pacing fast. That being said although there were readings which I did not take as much away from, for the most part in H&P my section delved into the readings with depth and intensity which gave me a better understanding and appreciation for the texts.",
                "This was a fantastic seminar! It was well-run and engaging, and it integrated well with the format of zoom. The professor did a good job of bringing in modern day politics (which everyone in the class cared a lot about) without making it contentious, a careful balancing act. I think that most of the shortcomings of the course (mainly, staring at a screen is disengaging) were due to the format of zoom and would be solved by the class being in person.",
                "As always in DS, the only thing that can really be improved upon is the reading list. There were some works that felt somewhat unnecessary or poorly done. For one, we spent far too long on Machiavelli. The Kant reading was also terribly uninformative, it felt disconnected from the conversations between the other thinkers. No one really responds to Kant's thought, and Kant basically just elaborates on one of Rousseau's theories. I wish we could have explored other important political theorists, like Grotius or Lenin."

                "Yes! DS H&P was consistently among my favorite of the DS tracks for its rigor, depth, and the vast array of connections and complexities it explores. Professor Thompson is an excellent seminar leader with her extensive knowledge of the texts she always pointed to important passages that added nuance to our discussions. My feedback on papers was always timely and constructive and I felt I became a much stronger writer by the end of the course. Although I was nervous at times in seminar I never felt intimidated about speaking - I definitely recommend this course if you are considering DS.",

If you take this course, especially towards the end, you'll get this wonderful taste of all the connections between new ideas in political theory, literature, and philosophy (especially philosophy). It's immensely satisfying.",
                "Yes, very much so. I enjoyed reading the works we studied, and Professor Thompson was an excellent professor.",
                "Absolutely! If you want an understanding of political theory, and why many activists and people think the way they do, the seeds of all of it are found in the DS curriculum. The Left is Rousseau and Marx, and the Right are the Federalists and Burke! Locke is much more complex than history books make him out to be, as is Machiavelli. Nietzsche is utterly fascinating, and Dubois's telling of history is enlightening.\r\n\r\nTake this class! It's perfectly structured to form your thinking!",
