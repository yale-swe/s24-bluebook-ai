As we learned in the class, the process of building computer systems is less about the actual code and much more about the people writing it. This course gave me a much broader perspective on CS as an industry.\r\n\r\nThe topics from the class are somewhat all over the place, from infinities and abstract algebra to the invention of RFID technology. Nonetheless, I found the breadth refreshing and valuable.",

I also learned a ton about the history of computer science, computability, probability, and logic, and how all of these things tie into the technology ecosystem that we have today.",

The work is a bit challenging if you're not familiar with linux kernel development, but you are provided ample resources both in class and via office hours to make sure that you not only complete the assignment, but understand it. I want to be clear though the work is challenging, there is not a lot of it. It is not a programming intensive class. The lectures are very entertaining, informative, and easy to understand. I was eager to show up to class every day and when I had to miss I made sure that I got caught up quickly. Prof. Zhong is an amazing professor and you can really tell that he cares about how his students develop not just as CS majors, but as members of society. This has been my favorite class at Yale.",

                "Sure, it's a organized course with not that heavy workload. Students do learn something from it.",
