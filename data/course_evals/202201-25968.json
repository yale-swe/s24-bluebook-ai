The modules were incredibly well organized, and I appreciated the many ways you could learn the material (live lecture, recorded lecture, professionally recorded videos, etc.).  I also really enjoyed that both exams were open-note and untimed; it reduced stress at a very stressful point. Weaknesses; the grading sometimes felt very random, especially in the written-out sections. I also think TAs can be hit or miss; I met with some outstanding TAs who were beyond helpful and some who just made you feel bad about not getting it.",
                "The course can be taken entirely asynchronous, which can be good or bad base on your goals",
                "The flexible schedule of this class can be either a strength or a weakness depending on how you are as a student. As JDRS states himself in one of the first lectures, if you want, you can work through all the pre-recorded lectures and do all the assignments at a faster pace and maybe even finish everything in as short as a couple weeks. But the non-requirement of going to class also means that you can easily fall many lectures behind and then do the minimum to complete the assignments (e.g., skipping through the videos on 2x speed and copying from the instructor's class codebase, which is often nearly identical to the code needed for the assignments). \r\n\r\nOne definite weakness is the factory-farm style grading; students are seemingly encouraged to copy as much of the code as possible from JDRS's class examples for use in the problem set to verbatim replicate the output so the graders have an easy time, and the regrade request culture is a little toxic, with tons of kids grubbing for that extra 1% at office hours if they got 99% and the graders threatening that \"the whole pset will be regraded if you request a regrade for a single question, so your score might go down.\" Here at Yale there's already enough grade toxicity and disincentive to do original work if risks decreasing an assignment score; this class shouldn't contribute to that but it does.\r\n\r\nOne strength is JDRS himself - a funny and engaging and consistent lecturer, clearly with a strong understanding of all the material being taught, and a savvy with Canvas that sets the class page up a lot like an easily navigable webpage and takes advantage of other online resources, like his Intro to Stats class.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is its flexibility of attendance. The professor does a great job of accommodating students both in person and virtually.",
                "The class is pretty flexible since there are multiple options: online, live lecture, and lecture recording. JDRS also provides a lot of resources for review and study. There are a lot of office hours and a lot of ways to get help in the class if needed.",
                "This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. It's pretty much a choose-your-own-adventure course, I took the class entirely asynchronously and really enjoyed it. I learned a ton, and it wasn't crushingly difficult. While I've heard that some find JDRS' teaching style unbearable, I really really enjoyed it and felt engaged the entire time. The homework assignments and final project were genuinely fun to work on. I really recommend anyone, regardless of major, to take this class. I had no previous stats experience and I did just fine, JDRS provides so many resources to do well.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of was the grading of the final project. A lot of us found the peer-grading scheme to be unnecessary, unstandardized, and annoying. I recommend removing it from the course.",
                "The class could be done entirely remotely and often the psets could be done by just looking at the lecture R markdown files. While everything in the class was overall not difficult, the final project was rather annoying. You had to grade 3 other groups' projects and part of the grading process is ranking the projects assigned to you relative to each other, and you are graded on how accurately you graded the other projects. It's kind of ridiculous because the standards are pretty arbitrary, and you are forced to rank other people's projects relative to each other when that was not even told to us that we had to make the projects better than everyone elses. It was so toxic and stress-inducing.",

                "A big strength of the course is that JDRS is a very charismatic lecturer, which made paying attention relatively easy. Both a strength and weakness of this course is that it can be taken completely asynchronously, which makes fitting it into a schedule easy but it's also easy to fall behind on lectures quickly.",
                "Since the class is so big its really difficult to be able to contact any instructor/have them respond quickly. A lot of students had questions on Ed or via email that went unanswered and it was really stressful. Also, the peer grading on the final project was abysmal. Nobody follows the rubric",
                "The TA support system in this class was excellent  I really liked that there were a lot of office hours and an online ED forum to post questions.",
                "A strength of this course is that it can be taken asynchronously each of the lectures are pre-recorded on Canvas, and you do not really need to watch any of the lectures to gain a decent score on each of the homework assignments. Most of the code for classes (which are provided on canvas) are sufficient in completing the homework assignments. \r\n\r\nThe course's biggest weakness is that the mean score for each of the assignments is very very high, and thus the curve is known to be incredibly hard. The peer grading section (which was new this semester) was very poorly executed, and very little instructor or TA feedback was available for it. Rubrics for completing the final project and the rubrics for peer review were very inconsistent, and thus it was a very chaotic process.",
                "Strengths: flexible, and able to adjust to own pace\r\nWeaknesses: grading system was horribly skewed, even for a large class like this. For homeworks, the nit-picky grading took away from actually learning the content, and more about stressing over getting points off for minor aesthetic details or graphic mistakes that had nothing to do with understanding or grasping the material. Since there was such a downward curve in the class, these details would sometimes be the difference between an A and B.\r\n\r\nFor the final project, the grading was far worse. Here is an excerpt of an email I sent to the S&DS DUS about the final project grading:\r\n\r\n\"For our final project, our grade is completely determined by the grading of our peers. This in itself seems problematic to many of us, given that students surely cannot be expected to have the ability to grade objectively and apply consistent standards in the same way that TFs and professors have been trained to do. Although there is a rubric, it is vague and open-ended, making it so that preliminary peer grading on my group's final project has been wildly all over the place and, in some cases, blatantly not in line with the rubric. We have had no opportunities as of yet to challenge or at the very least request regrades on problematic sections of the grading of our peers.\r\n\r\nEven besides the decision to use peer grading for our final projects, perhaps the most egregious aspect of grading is one item on the rubric, which instructs students to rank the three projects they have been randomly assigned to grade. This part of the rubric makes up 10 points out of the 100 points for a project's final grade. Here is a direct quote from the rubric: \"You will grade three projects. YOU MUST RANK THESE PROJECTS RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER. Give the best project 10 points. Give the second best project 6 points. Give the third best project 2 points.\" We were not given any advance notice on the ranking aspect of the rubric until the morning that the project was due, when the entire rubric was updated with a new section about ranking. As a result, we had no opportunities to express any concerns to our professor or TFs until now.\r\n\r\nWe find this ranking process inherently problematic for a myriad of reasons. Firstly, our projects all address vastly different topics, and although there are guidelines and a rubric, there is a lot of room for creativity and interpretation within those guidelines. Thus, it is unfair and impossible to ask students to compare these vastly different projects apples-to-apples. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the three projects that a person is assigned to grade are completely random, meaning that a certain project could be compared against two extraordinary projects, or two average projects. It is up to complete chance whether a project receives 2 points vs. 10 points from this section of the rubric, which could be the subsequent difference between an A and B. \r\n\r\nLastly, ranking projects and determining grades from comparisons with others puts unnecessary emphasis on grades, and takes away from the learning process that a final project is supposed to be about. The ranking portion of the rubric has nothing to do with the effort or quality that we have put into our project, and creates heightened competition and unnecessary comparisons between students that should never be the focal point of learning.\"\r\n\r\nThis should sum it up.",
                "This course is highly flexiblesince all the lectures are pre-recorded, the class can be taken completely asynchronously. JDRS is a clear and engaging lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe grading for the weekly assignments can be questionable at times, with points taken off for seemingly minute details. Further, I was not fond of the peer grading system for the final project. Each student was assigned three projects to peer review, and was forced to rank them from best to worst, giving the worst project 2/10 points for the ranking section. This does not seem entirely fair, as it forces a certain number of projects to receive very low scores in this section, as well as introduces unncessary randomness (the score a project receives depends on the quality of the other projects assigned to the same student grader).",
                "This course was really well organized! I took it completely asynchronously and never felt that I was missing anything. JDRS provided lots of supplemental materials for review/background information.",
                "the asynchronous nature of this course was both a strength and weakness. while it was easy to watch lectures and do the work, it was also easy to fall behind as well. as long as you're on top of it, though, the course was great. i didn't have much of a stats background and it was still very doable since we went over the stat concepts and there was supplemental material provided",

                "I dislike the amount of cheating in this course.",
                "It is really nice to have the asynchronous format in addition to all of the office hours. It is super easy to get help. That said, I think it is easy as a student to. become disengaged from the class with the asynchronous format, so just something to keep in mind.",
                "strengths: well organized, low workload \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "It was well-taught and I loved how there was an asynchronous option. One thing though is that the grading structure was a bit unclearwhether there was a curve, etc.",
                "Strengths: I really liked how you could go through this course asynchronously, as it allowed me to take another class at the same time. I also thought the problem sets were pretty fair and the frequent office hours were amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: The flexibility of the course. JDRS accommodates both synchronous and asynchronous learning very well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading. I personally didn't have a big problem with the harsh grading, but it did make the work for the class much more stressful. The class became cutthroat competitive as a result.",
                "I took this course asynchronously. I appreciated this option, as it wouldn't have worked with my schedule otherwise, and I don't feel like I missed anything,",
                "S&DS 230 definitely helped me to learn how to use the R programming language. However, problem sets and exams were often identical to class lectures, providing no additional challenge. In addition, I felt that a deep understanding of the statistical methods that we were using was not really tested in the exams/problem sets. There is almost too much emphasis on data analysis and not enough on the methods we use (ANOVA, linear regression, etc.). The peer grading system of the final project was ridiculous, with no feedback from TAs or JDRS given to help us grade the projects. As such, peer grades for a heavily weighted part of the class were extremely subjective and in some cases, unfair.",
                "Strengths: having the asynchronous option is great and allows you to go at your own pace, lots of resources for help and very responsive teaching staff, JDRS is great at explaining. Weaknesses: this semester there was a lack of transparency around how final projects were graded. It was ultimately based just on peer grades, which was frustrating because there wasnt a ton of guidance around how peer grading should work (how many points should be taken off for certain mistakes etc)",
                "I thought it was great, I took it totally remote and never felt left out of information from the live lecture",
                "Strengths: asynchronous, entertaining way of learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: quite self guided",
                "Materials should be up to date--many times instructions were incorrect/outdated and created needless confusion. Also, the final project grading was needlessly harsh and unclear--peer grading in general doesn't have enough value and created too much confusion and did not aid in learning",
                "I thought the entire structure and everything about the class was fabulous up until the final project grading where we had to rank the three peer projects we were grading and give one a 2/10, one a 6/10, and one a 10/10. I hated that because it was docking points for extremely arbitrary things that werent on the syllabus and academics shouldnt be a competition.",
                "Easy to learn and practice material. More time for final project would have been appreciated.",
                "The main strength of this class is 100% JDRS - he is an engaging professor (yes, even in recordings) who is very good at explaining the content concisely. Some may call him funny, but that is more up to debate. The weaknesses are, well, basically everything else. The problem sets are graded awfully, with the explanation questions making little effort to help you find what specific point they want you to mention, though the code questions are generally better. The problem sets would benefit hugely from added specificity, something which clearly hasn't happened as this has been a complaint for years. There are many OHs, but office hours were, at least for me, pretty unhelpful in explaining the underlying statistics - though most TAs will tell you that specific point you need to mention in the explanation questions if you ask. It's a long winded way of figuring out (as it could easily be in the question) but you will get there. I will add that all the lectures are available from the get-go, rather than having to wait as in prior years. You could easily complete the entire course in a couple weeks, though why you would want to is beyond me.",
                "strength could be it can be pretty much be all online but also dangerous cause easy to fall behind",
                "The flexibility allowed by providing everything necessary for the course online was extremely practical. They also provided plenty of office hours which were very helpful.",
                "The course is very well designed, offers a lot of flexibility, but is still very rigorous. Instructors are very accessible and it is easy to get answers to questions. Assignments are fair and I learned a lot from them.",
                "Grading system for final projects had the potential of being extremely unfair.",
                "Great course. Strengths are that the online videos the professor made are amazing and the R markdown documents provided are great templates for taking notes during the lecture. Also like the flexibility the course allows. Weaknesses are that the peer grading system for the final projects seems unfair and a bit bizarre, given that students are not really equipped to grade this type of work.",
                "I really liked how this class was fully asynchronous while providing in-person classes which meant students had the freedom to choose what works best for their learning. I liked how there was an abundance of office hours. However, the grading was a bit strict and points were taken off for things not asked for.",
                "Strengths: fun/easy coding, to the point homework assignments, good lecture modules, JDRS is cool\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the final project crept up out of nowhere and plays such a huge role in your final grade but is then graded relative to others' final projects, once you fall behind you stop learning and start copying the format of the JDRS code notes from lecture to do the homework, the ULAs can be very nitpicky with the grading",
                "The course was overall strong, but sometimes leaned towards \"plug and chug\" thinking. It might be nice to have a more detailed overview."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to another student! The course was well-planned, the videos great, JDRS is excellent, and the material you learn is helpful in basically any other discipline (primarily social sciences). Since the workload is manageable and so many people take it that you're bound to have a couple of friends, I would go for it! Also, you don't need any prior stats background.",
                "Yes! the instructor is amazing and I think this course is great at introducing students in R",
                "If you want to learn how to code in R and do some basic stats with that language, sure - take the course. If you put the time into watching and paying attention to all the lectures, and starting the problem sets early, there's a lot of material to absorb, and everything that you're tested on in exams and problem sets is covered in the lectures, so you're never left guessing. And if your work ethic isn't up to scratch and you put off the problem set until the night it's due every week, you can speed-run the video lectures and bang out the psets in 2-3 hours. Obviously recommend the former, but am guilty of the latter on occasion. It's a light class, especially if you have some familiarity with another high-level programming language (or R itself) already. But the graders are fussy and the experience of submitting a pset and losing points for silly things like one letter cut off in the title of a graph or one word cut off from the page assignment in grade scope, that gets old fast.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is looking to gain more skills in data analysis.",
                "If you want to learn some basic R that could be useful in other parts of your life, yes. I think the course was enjoyable and I learned a lot without being overwhelmed.",
                "Absolutely. I learned a ton and had fun. If you think knowing R and basic data analysis skills will be useful to you, take it. JDRS is truly one of the best instructors at Yale.",
                "highly recommend. especially to the graduate students. if you are looking for one stat course that gives a concise overview of the important statistical concepts needed in research this is the one. A good intermediate course in between intro and higher level stat major-y class.",
                "Yes. This class is very approachable, and there is a lot of built in support with many office hours and collaborative homework assignments. Statistics is a very valuable subject and having skills in R is something I foresee myself using in the future.",
                "Impartial. You do learn how to code in R but most people I know treated it as a gut.",
                "Yeah definitely!",
                "Yes, you learn to apply your stats knowledge in the R Studios environment.",
                "I would recommend this course for people looking to become more familiar with statistics or coding in R, as JDRS does a great job teaching both.",
                "If you dont mind big classes/little one-on-one time and you enjoy coding, then yes. Manageable workload",
                "Absolutely! The teaching was super clear and as long as you try to stay ahead to ask your questions you'll be set up for a nice experience!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for an asynchronous course, or a fifth credit that would not be too much of a time commitment.",
                "Only if the grading system is changed.",
                "Yes, if you want an introduction to R! This is a good course to take on as a fifth credit.",
                "Yes! A great intro statistics and R course. JDRS recommends that you've taken an intro stat course before taking this class, but I had never taken statistics before and just reviewed the supplemental materials.",
                "Yes, you probably should be able to do some stats no matter what you major in.",
                "yes!",
                "yes, it is a low stress way to get to learn R and review basic stats concepts",
                "Absolutely! If you want an introduction to stats in R, this is the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend! It teaches you the basics of a really important coding language and it reinforces the basics of statistics. If you do choose to take this class, I would highly recommend to watch the module videos or attend the live lectures. This class was much easier for me because I did that, and I got a lot more out of the process through actually learning the statistics.",
                "Probably not in the state that it's in. Again, the course felt more competitive than collaborative. The final projects were especially hellish, because we had to grade and rank other people's projects which made matters much more stressful. Literally everyone was at each other's necks with the project grading.",
                "Yes, but only if you are interested in data science specifically and are self-motivated. It is very easy to slack off and end up not learning much unless you hold yourself accountable. Also, dont mistake this class for an introduction to statistics.",
                "Yes, definitely learned a lot and had a lot of support",
                "Yes, great course for those who want to learn R and how to use it for many different statistical situations.  Grading was really lenient which allowed you not to stress about your work",
                "Yes, if you want to learn R.",
                "Yes, very helpful hands-on data analysis course",
                "Absolutely, this course was super well organized, a manageable workload (1 pset due every friday at midnight). I learned a lot and you can take it entirely asynchronously but the online lectures are still fun JDRS is a funny guy.",
                "Yes if you need this skill.",
                "No, and I cannot think of a worse class that Yale offers. A strong assertion, but given all the classes I have took here (and trust me, I've took some bad classes), this is unequivocally one of the worst in the Yale catalog. For one, the grading is nonsensical. The R code is actually graded quite fairly and reasonably (with points largely based on function rather than conciseness), but the explanation grading is nothing short of ridiculous. You will likely lose the entirety of your points within the question if you miss one required point, with little care given to the (likely valid) other explaining you did. Psets are largely a task of 1) copying whatever code JDRS made 2) applying it. They're boring at best. You won't learn the actual validity or usefulness of these statistical techniques, only cmd+c and cmd+v, and the explanations required are often barely relevant. Learning wise, JDRS is as interesting as can be for a fully asynchronous course, with a good amount of not-amazing-but-existent humour and the recordings themselves are both concise and well-organised.",
                "sure not life changing but you get out of it what you put into it",
                "Absolutely. Provides a good insight into statistical analysis and introduction to R.",
                "I would recommend this class to a friend who wants to learn statistical data analysis using r.",
                "Yes if you want to learn R! Great intro to it. Not a ton of actual statistics knowledge needed.",
                "Yes!!! It is an amazing 5th class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the material is interesting, relatively easy to learn, and the homework is not difficult. However, DON'T FALL BEHIND! You will regret it! Also, actually put a lot of effort into the final project.",
                "Yes, this course is set up to help you learn and teaches you a lot. It's a safe place to start, considering that most people tend to do well and there's tons of support."
