                "stage combat, partner boundaries, the barrel!",
                "I learned how to do many fight moves. I learned how to work cohesively with a partner and to work with others to build a a section of fight choreography. I learned how to take a scene and incorporate violence into it. I learned how to keep myself and my partner safe. I learned about the use of violence in theater. As an actor, I was able to work on finding realistic motivations and actions for the use of violence.",

                "There are no weaknesses in this course! I loved every aspect of it!",
                "Overall, this is a very strong course. At the beginning, it felt a little slow as we were doing a lot of spatial and ensemble-building exercises, but as the course went on, I realized how important these beginning days were. Without this foundation, we would not have been in the place where we could choreograph our own fight scene for the final. One weakness could be that sometimes class felt a little slow or tiring, but those moments occurred very infrequently. The biggest strength of this course is Mike and Kelsey. Working with them was a highlight of my week, and they are so kind and helpful in making sure that everyone in the class feels comfortable. They also are so knowledgable about violence in theater and were always happy to help me hone a fight move. I would highly recommend taking any class or working on any production that Mike and/or Kelsey are involved in.",
                "This class is AWESOME!!! Mike and Kelsey are the best and created a fun, safe environment where we learned so much. I was able to step out of my comfort zone and I now have a great collection of fight vocabulary to use in future theatrical projects.",
                "The environment and community created in this course is absolutely incredible. I have no major notes. The pacing did feel a bit fast when we first started learning moves in earnest, but I caught up after a couple weeks, and I honestly would not recommend slowing things down, because I think it pushed me to learn."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only is it a fun class, it also teaches things like communication and how to work with a partner in different types of scenarios.",

I had such an amazing time in class and it was a space where I could decompress from my week while also learning about an interesting topic. The course fosters collaboration and a really fun environment. It also is a low workload outside of class, but extremely engaging in the classroom. Definitely a highlight of my semester.",
                "Yes! This is one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Especially if you work on extracurricular productions, the skills you learn in this class are so valuable and it is such a fun experience.",
                "Absolutely!! I learned so much. Mike and Kelsey are wonderful instructors!",
                "Absolutely. The course is an amazing environment. The material is super interesting (and useful if you're in theatre), Mike and Kelsey are fantastic to work with, and the course is a great way to learn a lot of new things, while still being easy to fit into a schedule."
