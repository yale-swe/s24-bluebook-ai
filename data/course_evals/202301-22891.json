                "I learned how to be a better writer, which begins with reading more. The texts we read for class helped me develop my writing style and helped me understand what works and doesnt work to be an effective writer.",
                "I learned how to write effectively with less bounds and more freedoms for creative input. I learned about effective mechanisms for emotional and comprehensive writing, both on a macroscopic structural level and a line-by-line writing standard. We read many amazing pieces and I felt that the class improved my understanding of strong writing greatly.",

                "Derek Green is fantastic, loved the reading list, fair grading and workload, great course structure. Hard to think of a weakness.",
                "Strengths: It is nice to be reading the actual work that you are writing. You are trying to emulate as closely as possible what you are reading, and for that reason it feels much more tractable than typical English courses. Weaknesses: I wish there was a little more direction on the part of the prof, such as breaking down the techniques more carefully and talking about a different theme each day.",
                "The strengths of the course lie in the content of the learning with Professor Green and the works that we read from and used. The course has a great discussion environment, is very relaxed, and allows us to feel comfortable pushing the bounds of our writing. The only major weakness of the course to me was that sometimes the professor was late to provide feedback (although being fantastic all round).",
                "Amazing - would maybe just have liked more assignments",
                "Strengths: engaged professor, manageable workload and lots of feedback.",
                "Strengths: amazing course to improve and focus on writing, basically a creative writing class in non-fiction (and not application-based!), amazing and positive classroom community, light reading load, essays are super fun to write and not very long, 5 essays is a lot but with being able to skip one of them the course was super manageable and fun!\r\nWeaknesses: workshops could have been a bit more focused and students didn't send marked up essays with thoughtful comments like they were supposed to (I wish this had been enforced because hearing other people's feedback is so helpful and is one of the best parts of the course)"

                "Absolutely! Whether you've barely written at all or you consider yourself an experienced writer, you will benefit from this course.",
                "Yes; I would. This is a quintessential Yale course for a reason. Even if you don't like what's going on in class, just doing the readings and papers will make you a better writer. It's also fun to write about these topics -- most fun academic writing you might ever do at Yale.",
                "Yes I would - great place for comfortably learning how to write better, being surrounded by friends and peers who want to support you.",
                "Yes, 100%! This course helped me grow in so many different ways - in writing, expressing myself, critically thinking, and reading anything. Prof. Green is such a wonderful and supportive mentor! Take ENGL 120 - you won't regret it!!",
                "Definitely- perfect for perfecting essay writing skills",
                "I would! It's not a lot of work, but I improved as a writer. Definitely worth it for everyone, regardless of major.",
                "Excitedly and absolutely! ENGL 120 is a great course for both students who are experienced writers and students who are just looking for a writing credit. Reading load is easy and light, the essays are short and fun because they're creative non-fiction, and the small seminar style is great for casual and open discussion. I came into this class with a strong background in writing but still found this course monumental in making me a better writer and focusing my style. Professor Green is particularly amazing. He's kind and hilarious, and he does an amazing job explaining what makes an essay effective while creating a close-knit, positive, and engaging classroom environment. I learned a TON from him and he really loves his job and his students. ENGL 120 is a wonderful and meaningful course I think all Yale students should take!"
