                "Fun course",
                "Strengths: Content is very interesting, Professor Glenn is a great professor and really into the material, and the tests and assignments are fair. Weaknesses: Some parts of the assignments could get tedious at times, particularly the last 2, where it's hard to get a consistent test on how well your program is performing, and much of the assignment turns to into making tiny optimizations.",
                "You'll learn each topic in depth and thoroughly understand how it works, though for some hard math concepts the proofs are skipped. But you'll usually learn it better if you review the slides and trace the pseudocodes manually. The in class visualizations are pretty helpful too.",
                "The grading policy is quite tough, and some of the homeworks are too vague.",
                "Strengths: Glenn is passionate about this subject and it shows! The content isn't super engaging to begin with, but he keeps it relatively interesting. Math can be difficult to parse at times as a non-math girlie\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 9am lecture oop, psets aren't bad but it's still a cs class lol",
                "Strengths: Professor Glenn is super passionate about the content of this class. I think it's his bread and butter. As such, he keeps it entertaining and fun. I enjoyed the content of this class and really wish I had been more engaged and dedicated more time to the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I often couldn't follow the different algorithms, but this might have just been a function of my relatively weaker comp sci background. I had some difficulty implementing said algos on psets. I also do wish some of the psets went beyond just implementing algos, but in a way that wouldn't require even more work",
                "Strengths: Great topics and content and Professor Glenn is really nice and funny\r\nWeaknesses: 9am is tough, recordings cut off near the end (I assume their is a time limit, but the professor continues talking after the video cuts)",
                "Psets were interesting and short, but the midterms were hard to prepare for. They dont count for much, but maybe getting rid of the midterms and assigning quizzes or responses in the homework would be better.",
                "Strengths: The PSets were fun to do and a really interesting challenge.",
                "Professor Glenn and Jarred were strengths, always providing support and assistance whenever needed. Professor Glenn was very responsive, corrected mistakes when they were made, and was clearly passionate about what he was teaching. A math background is recommended for this course.",
                "Very manageable workload and interesting variety of programming assignments. I wish it went a little bit deeper into neural networks and included a programming assignment on it, but I understand why we didn't cover those topics as thoroughly.",
                "Strengths: This course had some amazing assignments that were super super fun, and the exams were mostly fair. The topics were super interesting and taught super well and lectures were fun!\r\n\r\nI can't really think of any weaknesses honestly, this class was super fun and I highly recommend it!",
                "Strengths: Learned a lot about the space and the projects helped to solidify understanding of certain techniques.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Walked away from the class with understanding of different techniques, but not too much on how to apply them in a real world setting. It seems that a lot of the actual applications in the modern day require a lot of discretion and there are a variety of nuances to applying different techniques, and I wish there was more \"case study\" kind of lectures to give that perspective. Overall more of a minor suggestion than a weakness though."

                "YESSSSSSSSSSS! It's not just about games, but a way of problem solving. These games can translate to real life and continuous state problems etc. You learn so many math, econ, and AI concepts that they can be applied to a variety of stuff. Plus the homework isn't difficult since you are coding pseudocode with less than 30 lines per assignment (generally). Plus you get to play games as Glenn walk you through it during class. Really really fun.",

                "Yes, if you're intrigued by the content of the class!!",
                "I took this class because I needed to for my major, but looking back -- this is a very interesting class to take regardless. I was taking this with econometrics and a lot of the topics overlapped and I felt that this class gave me a really good understanding of the foundations of game theory AI and machine learning techniques. It was relatively low workload day to day with PSETS due every other week, but the exams were quite tough in my opinion. Regardless, very applicable class.",

                "Absolutely! Glenn is wonderful and super nice, the assignments are a lot of fun, and it's a really interesting topic, with a lot of freedom for the final project so you can do pretty much anything. I enjoyed the class a lot! Definitely recommend, it's one of the most fun CS courses I've taken here.",
