   "comments": [
    "The professor taught slowly in the first half of the semester but quite fast in the latter and skipped something. It would be better if it could be balanced.",
    "reasoning",
    "It is quite a dilemma for the professor when students are of different levels in terms of how much they know about game theory. Personally speaking, I would like the course to be more intense and challenging.",
    "Strength:very interesting and learn a lot \r\nWeakness:it will be better if there is more discussion",
    "I thought the course itself was very interesting, but had trouble applying it to the real world. Game theory, to me, seems more like a thought experiment than a field that can be implemented in public life, though I can see how some portions of the worldview espoused by game theorists can be helpful to strategizing about public policy. I think this practical application would require a deeper understanding of the field than what was exposed to us in class. It could be improved by being more interactive and less lecture-heavy.",
    "Course could be improved just by having more time with the material. There were only 10 meetings and 2 of which were midterm\/final. So overall not that much lecture time.",
    "maybe due to schedule of summer but material went fast. Professor did excellent job in teaching in an engaging way.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are efficient and teaching assistant is helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Problem Sets are really difficult and it is better to have more time to discuss them in class.",
    "the exercise questions were challenging and the presentation of the content involves many movie clips, which makes the class more interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Yes because the professor teaches in an interesting way and the methods are useful which can be applied to daily life.",
    "yeah,because it's knowledgeable.",
    "Yes, of course.\r\nThe professor is so nice and he encourages us to think actively and imaginatively. Besides, he is always patient to answer your questions.",
    "Yes as the course provides a clear and concise brief introduction to game theory. The teacher has a good way of teaching that makes complicated concepts easy to understand and makes good real life examples to illustrate the points. Both the teacher and the TA give timely and helpful feedbacks on the works done throughout the whole term.",
    "Yes, the professor has good sense of humor, takes videos and personal stories into the class. And classmates are keen to discuss. Its awesome.",
    "Yes,its very useful and not so difficult",
    "I would recommend it to a student that is well-versed in math, including calculus, set theory, and probability. These should be included as prerequisites in the course description (though it wasn't necessary to use these concepts in the class, so perhaps the professor could eliminate this type of notation and concepts in order to avoid confusion for non-math students).",
    "I'd recommend for a person looking for an introduction to game theory. Don't expect too many difficult concepts.",
    "Yes I would recommend if they are interested in intersection of psych and economics. Very good professor",
    "Yes. For social science students, this course teaches me the basic knowledge of Game Theory, which enables me to get further study.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes I would. I find this course very interesting and beneficial."
