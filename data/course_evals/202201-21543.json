                "The course is wonderful! Swapna ji is such a good instructor, and the Rupert Snell book is engaging and helpful. It was also more organized than last semester, as our weekly plan was posted each week.",
                "This course was structured well and class was informative and easy to follow.",
                "Very strong course. The course allows you to learn at your own pace while still holding us to certain deadlines and checkpoints. Although language courses can seem overbearing, Hindi has been extremely insightful and enjoyable.",
                "I think this class is excellent; our professor is excited about teaching and has been keeping the class informed ahead of time about what each week will look like. My only idea for improving this course is to introduce more practice of grammar techniques.",
                "The main strength of this course is the daily practice in class. Each class we practiced the grammar from the chapter and often reviewed grammar and vocabulary from previous chapters. Hindi is a great language class because of the sense of community fostered in the class. The main weaknesses to this class are a degree of disorganization (though it is still much more organized than other classes I've taken) and a greater need for practice listening and speaking. Right now, I feel like my reading and writing abilities are much better than my listening and speaking abilities. There are opportunities to speak in Hindi in class, but the practice is not always structured to use the vocabulary we learned from the textbook, meaning people use lots of words in English, or we are given new words that we forget.",
                "This class was a little weak organizationally, but part of that was because the instructor was overextended this year and it will probably be better next year. It improved this semester from last semester! This class has a really understanding teacher, and eases students into the material. Its also a great environment!",
                "The class atmosphere was positive and it was a fun mix of lessons and videos and stories.\r\n\r\nThe class was disorganized, though -- sometimes frustratingly so. It's likely because Swapna ji had to teach all of the Hindi classes at the same time.",
                "I really enjoyed the course and the mix of textbook, in-class, and partner-based exercises. I also really enjoyed the use of natural media (movies, videos, news clips, etc) for comprehension. My only suggestion is that I wish we had more opportunities for conversation in the class itself. Unfortunately, given my schedule with the School of Management, I could not routinely attend the additional conversation section and wish that I could have done so more."

                "Absolutely; I learned a lot of Hindi, found a community in my classroom, and had a great time doing it all.",
