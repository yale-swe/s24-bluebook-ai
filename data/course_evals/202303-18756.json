We discussed many different aspects of protest: grievances, opportunities, mobilization, organization, repression, other causes of demobilization, institutionalization, success or failure, other implications, etc. After taking this course I came to see protests not as merely emotional outbursts, but movements that require many, many things to fall into place.",
                "I learned about theory behind collective action, the factors that can lead to protest movements, what can demobilize them and what can transform them. Through this course, I became acquainted with many different examples of old and contemporary protest movements.",

However, I don't know if this was really avoidable, or just a necessary part of preparing us for the later portions of the semester.",
                "This course has a lot of space for student discussion. With many varied in-class activities there was no class where conversation lagged. This course also did a great job in incorporating guest speakers, media and movies to add on to our weekly readings.",

                "Strengths: Interesting readings, good guest speakers, committed and enthusiastic professor, well-planned in-class activities \r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes conversations were US-centric, heavy reading load per week (we were unable to talk about all of it in seminar), guiding questions were sometimes unspecific"

                "Yes  PLSC 410 is a great course. I would definitely recommend it, especially if Prof. Hierro is teaching. The content is interesting and very applicable to our current time, and Prof. Hierro is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material. The workload is pretty heavy, but it is spread out very nicely throughout the semester so there were not really any points in the semester where the class was piling work on you in an unmanageable way. This also helped me stay engaged with the course the entire semester, rather than going through periods of less or more engagement. I felt like I learned a lot in this class. Prof. Hierro and the other students made it worthwhile and very interesting.",
                "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in political science.",
                "Yes! Great class and great prof! as long as youre prepared to write a bit (tbh not even that much), youll have a good time!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is very well organized, and the topics of discussion are very interesting.",
                "Yes! Maria Jose is a wealth of knowledge and facilitates student learning well (google doc of in-class notes, very structured class time, clear knowledge of pedagogy). Take this class if you're interested in protest. Very good balance of political theory, case studies, and history.",
                "I would recommend taking this course if you have specific interest or experience in political protests. If so, it is a great way to learn about its theory and practice through interesting readings and discussions. Without a specific interest, this course might be too niche."
