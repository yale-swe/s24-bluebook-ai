It was also fully motivated in terms of the 'why', like why HTTP came around, which gives a fair amount of intuition. The PSETs helped a lot in being able to better understand the content and the project helped us apply the skills in a novel way. Even the midterm forced you to really get a good grip on the course content. I feel, for the first time, that I am able to independently code a full application.

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the format of the midterm, and a lack of actual paper exams. I think that the hands-on approach for everything really helped me learn the content in the class, and the TAs and/or Alan were available to help with problems when they arose. I also liked the group projects, since having other people to work with made the class a lot more managable. \r\n\r\nCons: The second homework, making the GUI was really frustrating, since the GUI felt like a step back from everything else the class is doing. While that pset also split the front end and backend, I think it would've been a lot less frustrating to do it without the GUI.",
                "Very slowly progresses to full-stack principles. I don't believe we needed a pset to implement a GUI. Also very unorganized, there was no auto-grader setup for any of the psets and lectures were very slow and not too engaging.",
                "good Psets, good lecturing",
                "I thought the course was very good. However, I would say that for programmers who already know how to do full-stack programming, it may be a waste of time.",
                "strengths:\r\n\r\nComprehensive learning: Full stack web programming courses offer comprehensive learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.\r\nHands-on experience: Practical projects enable students to apply what they have learned in real-world scenarios.\r\nExposure to latest technologies: These courses cover a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that are essential to building modern web applications.\r\nFlexibility: Full stack web programming courses can be taken online, enabling students to learn at their own pace and convenience.\r\nCareer advancement: Learning full stack web programming can open up new career opportunities and enable professionals to advance in their careers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nFast-paced nature of curriculum: The pace of learning can be challenging for some students, especially those who are new to programming.\r\nLimited depth of knowledge: Covering many topics in one course can limit the depth of knowledge students acquire in any one area.\r\nLack of specialization: Some students may prefer to specialize in specific programming languages, frameworks, or tools but full stack web programming courses cover a wide range of topics, making it difficult to specialize.\r\nLimited instructor feedback: Some courses may not offer regular feedback and support from instructors, making it challenging for students to identify areas where they need improvement and how to address them.\r\nTechnical difficulties: Technical issues can arise, especially with online courses, such as internet connectivity problems or issues with the learning platform.",
                "The live coding was extremely helpful for understanding how things work (especially if you ask questions). The PSETs are enjoyable and feel like you're learning. The midterm was coding-based which was so much better than other CS classes. The final project is group-based which can make or break it.\r\n\r\nI honestly thought the lectures were great. However, attendance was pretty low (and it's hard to get the most out of it without going to lectures) so I am sure that will affect other people's ratings.",
                "Did not have a wonderful experience with the midterm. Instead, I wish we had more time to have a 24-hour midterm so we could resolve any potential issues that would arise.",
                "strengths - good psets and the final project was fun. weaknesses - lectures weren't the most helpful, doesn't teach up-to-date technologies (no react, still using flask+python), and lack of guidance on the final project.",
                "strengths: really good progression of topics that build on top of each other\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "strengths: some of the high level lectures are quite okay. They have good content of what web programming looks like\r\nweaknesses: a lot of the technologies used are dated. The PSETs are alright, but somewhat unnecessary and don't line up well with course covered content. We spend a lot of time learning syntax for Python and JS. The final project is poorly structured since it relies on ULAs to manage them.",
                "Strengths: PSETs were great in terms of scope, and pair programming is always nice when not a lot of CS courses do the same. Alan is a good lecturer who takes time to explain material, although he's not great at checking emails so post questions on ed instead. The participation point encouraged me to watch lecture online if not in person. The midterm grading was also very generous considering you could resubmit for half points. \r\nWeaknesses: The midterm was a little too similar to the PSETs, I wish the database was a little smaller and different so we had to test our SQL skills there instead of copying code over. The grading was also a little slow at the start. Otherwise, great course!",
                "Course materials are informative and practical, and assignments are very relevant and instructional.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Alan is a good lecturer and a kind professor. The course is overall well-organized\r\n- The ULAs are also great but depending on who your ULA is, you could receive pretty different grades on the PSet to someone who as the same PSet as you\r\n- Very practical course and great introduction to a lot of web-app technologies\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Definitely need to hold more Office Hours. OH were only held twice a week over a 2 hour period in the evening on weekdays, making it difficult for people to attend.\r\n- Clearer specs for the Problem Sets and preferably demo videos for all of them\r\n- Faster grading for all the assignments -- only the midterm was graded at a reasonable time.",
                "Assignments were interesting but the specs were not very precise and often lacked clarification. For later psets, it would be helpful if there was a section that specified the differences between the current pset and the previous pset.",
                "Strengths: Very well structured for learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths include that the material we covered was interesting and useful outside of class. I think wen development is an important skill for all cs majors to have. I found the times midterm to be a little difficult as one bug could stop u from completing the exam and did not feel it to be an accurate representation of my skills. I also appreciated the group work element of this class which really helped me improve my use of git and GitHub.",
                "The course is well taught and the lectures are easy to understand, and the project-based assignments are really helpful for learning the topics. Being able to work in groups for the projects and problem sets is also very helpful since it splits up the large time requirement. The psets could be better specified, and the midterm quiz felt a bit out of place since writing even a simple full-stack app in 75 minutes is very difficult.",
                "The organization of the class was really great and the lectures were amazing. I think the psets were really fair and evenly paced, and even the midterm quiz was very doable.",
                "Strengths: assignments were pretty interesting\r\nWeaknesses: grading of assignments was often inconsistent and nitpicky at times",
                "Less focus on Python and more focus on JavaScript since JavaScript is a lot harder to master.\r\n\r\nMore active feedback on project milestones.",
                "This course all and all was pretty good. I learned very useful things, the assignments were good and so were the lectures.",
                "This course had several strengths: all of the skills learned in lecture are applied to make a web application through the homework assignments, the course staff are helpful and supportive, the final project followed a good timeline throughout the semester and helped me realize how much I had learned throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: Final project was fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first problem set assumed a lot of prerequisite software engineering knowledge that are not taught in lower level CS classes",
                "Very interesting for someone who has no background in fullstrack. Lectures covered an interesting breadth. Psets werent too challenging though which was a shame. Well designed to build on each other, but definitely could have been 1 week psets after the first couple. I wish more feedback was given on psets or perhaps a working example after the pset is due like OOP does because I never could tell if my sqlite queries were optimized.Grading isnt too harsh to make up for this though. Lots of opportunities to learn which is amazing. Midterm is a toughie even if you have been keeping up and understanding lectures/psets if you dont have prior knowledge. Only students with background did well, but there was a makeup option which was very fair in my opinion. I wish we couldve sped up pset timeline earlier so that we could have gotten more hands on experience with more modern tech or nuanced executions. Final project is a fun opportunity but can be a little bit of an overhanging stressor since its hard to motivate spending time on it without the schedule. Even then, its easy to ignore the final project when it is a really cool idea. Try and put regulat time into it, but if you cant you will still do fine",
                "This course would be better if it taught tools that are actually used like React js, bootstrap, etc. I wish I came out of this class feeling like I could make a deployable website today but honestly watching youtube tutorials on building websites might be better than taking a course. I wish the lectures had felt more engaging and I'm not sure how to make them better. Perhaps Full Stack as a class just isn't that interesting of a topic?"

You can learn more up to date technologies, and you can learn the concepts covered in class without much hassle since there isn't a high barrier to entry. However, if you want a chill class, would recommend.",
