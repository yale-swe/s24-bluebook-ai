I wish the course could have provided more modern relevant topics from literature, and how to think experimentally. This was a good foundations\/fundamental knowledge course, but I don't see the content on mechanisms being too valuable for my research. I liked the chemical genetics and the final lecture, where there was more applicability to experimental design and results. If the beginning material on mechanisms could be built up to relevant experiments from literature, that would be nice.",

                "Yes. This course was paced well, had an excellent instructor, and had a good workload. For students who haven't had strong organic chemistry\/ chemical biology background, this course is arguably essential. Having a strong organic chemistry background and having taken a natural products synthesis course in undergraduate studies, a lot of the content presented in the first half to the first 2\/3rds of the course was review of what I had seen before.",
