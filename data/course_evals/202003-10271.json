I leave the course with a greater appreciation for what creative fiction can accomplish in a society, how race and class function in South Africa, and how different authors have written about, engaged with, and reconciled with the legacy of South African apartheid.",

I came to see literature and the world through completely new lenses. Professor Allen encouraged us to explore and engage with our subject material in ways I had never before considered. I learned so much throughout this course, from literary analysis, to postcolonial theory, to college-level writing."

                "The course was really amazing. The novels and other materials we read forced me to look at the world in a slightly different manner than I did before. And I think this is one of the course's strengths: it forces you to think about things you used to deliberately ignore. Honestly, I think the only problem\/weakness it had was being virtual.",
                "The strengths of the course lie heavily with Steph Newell. She is a gem of a professor and worked so hard to make this an amazing course for her students. Her level of engagement with the course material is so high, and she pushed us to think deeply about the themes and messages of the texts we read. As a result, our discussions were so interesting, and you could tell she was just as excited about them as we were. The only weakness of the course I can think of is that because Steph offers so much supplementary material in addition to our weekly novels, it could be somewhat overwhelming to complete and with only two class sessions a week, sometimes there were things we just didn't have the time to cover and talk about. With that being said, because of the breadth of material, we were able to touch on so many different aspects of South Africa that we may not have been able to if we had spent more time on a fewer amount of material.",
                "Strengths: I loved the discussion format. It was mostly student contributions but Prof Newell also provided a lot of valuable information and insight in classes.",
                "This course was pretty solid the way it was.",
                "This course was amazing. I would 100% recommend it to any student who is interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the world, so long as they're willing to put in the work (it's a lot). I was initially hesitant about taking an African literature\/history course taught by a white professor, but Steph is such a sweetheart and is very careful and considerate in all of the points she raises terminology she uses  you can tell that she's dedicated her life to the field. I think beginning the course with a a few lessons on the historical background of South Africa would be invaluable to our understanding of the texts. Often, we'd be referencing events like the Boer War, or the Afrikaaner Trek from East Africa, or the arrival of the Afrikaaners in the 17th century, and I'd feel a bit out of my depths. Also, though this is something Steph mentioned a few times that she should have been better about, I think most of the novels we read this semester were by white authors. I was hoping to have read a few more works by Black African authors discussing Black South African life, as those were the ones that were often most engaging\/insightful. I don't think this is usually the case, or will be the case in future iterations of the course, but reading from more Black (as well as \"coloured\" South Africans  mixed race Black people, as well as South Asians, East Asians, etc.) would have provided a better view of South African society. Overall though, this course was definitely a highlight of this semester, and I truly felt like I was reaping the rewards of all the work I put in. Definitely take a course with Steph if you get the chance  she is amazing!",
                "I could have improved on my citation skills during this course as they were usually the downfall  of my papers.",
                "A strength of this course is Professor Steph! She is amazing and really guides conversation well.",
                "The strength of this course is it's professor and reading list. The weaknesses are sometimes it can be overwhelming and there is a large focus on literature in the form of a novel, but those are extremely minor compared to the overall excellence of the course.",
                "Professor Newell is the best professor I've ever had. The strengths of this course were her enthusiasm and immense knowledge of the subject material, as well as the ways in which she encouraged us to critically engage with the text, explore it on our own, and have deeper and richer discussions week after week. I enjoyed everything about this class: the conversations we had, the carefully curated and diverse texts we read, and the amazing people I met. Although we met as a class on Cross Campus, my only regret is that I wasn't able to share a physical classroom space with Professor Newell and my classmates this week. My classmates and I commented on how close our group became throughout the semester, even with the pandemic. I hope we can continue to meet (this time, in person!) once normal live is able to resume."

If we wanted to say something, we would raise our hands (on Zoom) and Prof Newell did a great job of keeping track of who had raised their hand and determining who should go next. We also had 2 group projects, which were valuable in helping us get to know our classmates during a pandemic.",

Professor Newell was so enthusiastic each class period, and our group was so excited and engaged with one another each section that it came to feel like we were talking in person. It's difficult to describe, but despite the fact that I was reading, writing, and talking alone in my dorm room--despite the fact that I have never met Professor Newell in person--I came to think of this class as a Yale family. Our course remained alive even in the middle of a global pandemic. Again, the only downfall of learning during quarantine was that we weren't able to meet and discuss in person!"

                "Absolutely!!!! This a must take class, especially for first-years as it is an amazing introduction to the English department (even for non-humanities majors like me), in addition to just Yale academics at large. I would take this course again if I could, it's that good. Steph Newell is an incredible professor and educator, and as a student I was so appreciative of the thought and care she put into designing and teaching this course. Steph knows so much about the field of contemporary African literature, but she always took a step back to let us take the lead on discussions and class sessions. Additionally, the discussions we had as a class were so fruitful, partly because the novels we read were so thematically rich. South Africa has such a fascinating (and tragic) history, and we engaged deeply with topics surrounding race, gender, queerness, class, masculinity, urbanism, and many more. It should be noted (and Steph also includes this in her syllabus) that the novels and discussions do not shy away from some pretty heavy topics, including rape and other forms of colonial violence, so people should be aware of that before enrolling. Also, you have to be prepared to read a novel a week, which seems daunting but honestly wasn't too bad- the majority of texts are contemporary fiction novels so they read pretty quickly, and you don't have to spend too much time \"close reading\" anything.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course is an incredible opportunity to immerse yourself in South Africas rich literary tradition, history, and culture. You will leave the course a much better reader, writer, speaker, and thinker.",
                "Yes because it focuses on such a unique and unspoken part of history.",
                "Yes! Steph is absolutely incredible and the course is so unique and interesting.",
                "Yes because the professor is one of the best I have ever had and this course is fairly challenging",
                "Yes! This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. If you like history and literature, this is a great class for you.",
                "Yes.",
                "I really cannot recommend this course enough. It is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. The subject material itself is difficult yet meaningful: despite focusing on a single country, the conversations surrounding South African history and literature we had as a class encompassed themes as universal as race, class, gender, colonialism, and even topics such as humor after tragedy. This class confronts some extremely complicated topics, and it taught me to think and read in ways I had never before considered. However, what really makes the class are the people and Professor Newell. Professor Newell is the best professor I've ever had. Despite publishing a mountain of research outside of class, she devotes herself entirely to her students. She came to class excited each day, and, after taking pages of notes throughout each section and office hours, she would use our previous conversations to inform and expand each new analysis and text we encountered. She cared deeply about our wellbeing, asking us how we were coping during the pandemic and challenging us without overwhelming us. Her feedback and encouragement helped me improve as a writer, read, and thinker beyond words. Moreover, the friends I made in this class are among the most amazing people I have ever met. I sincerely hope that, even as we learn online this semester and take different classes these next four years, we continue to meet as a group. Please, please, please take this course. You will not regret it."
