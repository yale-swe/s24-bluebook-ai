    "This course centers around the idea of leave taking in literature and in life. Goodbye to you loved ones, work, passion, a place, an idea etc. Its an incredible survey of Italian, French, and some Spanish literature. Professor Tylus is amazing and I cannot ask for a better instructor.",
    "I learned how to think inquisitively about various pieces of literature and to think introspectively about how the experiences detailed in the writings applied to my life experience.",
    "This class covered different ideas about saying goodbye, death, and how writers deal with saying goodbye their works. The content covered in this class challenged me to think more about the role of goodbyes in my life and the importance of accepting and embracing these goodbyes.",
    "Familiarity with major texts in the Christian tradition related to saying goodbye, intellectual framework for addressing themes of death and goodbye"

   "comments": [
    "Professor Tylus has the amazing ability to animate the class discussion. I love how she guided us and let us go free at the same time. The weekly writing pieces were great opportunities for us to reflect on the reading in a meaningful way, and they complemented the in-class discussion really well.",
    "A strength of this course is the instructor. She is extremely engaging and provokes a lot of interesting topics of discussion. I really enjoyed most everything we talked about and the only thing I found less fascinating was the emphasis on the printing process. I would have preferred to spend more time talking about death or different forms of goodbyes but it's only a minor issue. I did learn a lot about print versus manuscript production. A weakness of this course is sometimes we could get off on a tangent and not everyone could get a chance to speak.",
    "This class was wonderful! I loved going to the Bienecke every week and the books chosen for our class were always very interesting and provided a new insight to the topics covered in this course. Professor Tylus always brought passion, energy, and insight to class that made each discussion engaging and fun.",
    "The main question asked by this coursehow do we say goodbyeis a fascinating one that could be discussed to no end. The syllabus includes a lot of the most important works in the Western early modern tradition.  I found the scope to be a bit too broadwe read a lot of texts at a somewhat superficial level. I also didn't especially enjoy the Beinecke visitsI'd rather discuss the works themselves rather than the material culture\/physical objects in which they manifest, but maybe that's just me. The weekly papers pushed me to engage with the text on a deeper level, which was good. The discussion at times felt more intellectual\/academic than I would have liked, especially considering the deeply personal and emotional nature of the subject matter. While I got to read a lot of literature on the theme of saying goodbye, I don't necessarily feel that I gained a deeper emotional or personal connection to the subject. I do think the course could have been made more accessible to those who aren't specializing in the area."

    "Definitely take this class. Highly recommended for non-humanities majors to explore great literature without the burden of a writing course. For humanities majors, this course will change the way you read and interpret literature in ways that no other Yale course can. Dont let the goodbye part of the course fool you. This course is more than a few lessons on goodbye  it explores how we approach life through our leave-takings and questions the human condition in the face of unexpected losses.",
    "Yes I would. It's a very interesting topic and I really enjoyed viewing life from a different perspective. Also the weekly trips to the Beinecke were an amazing experience that I'm grateful I could partake in.",
    "Yes! It was a wonderful course that made me rethink the role of goodbyes in literature as well as in my own life. I think that everyone would gain something from this course.",
    "If you are interested in reading the works on the syllabus, definitely take it. Some background in early modern Italian literature is helpful, but not necessary. I would especially recommend this course if you like looking at old stuff in the Beinecke. If you don't like doing that, then I would maybe not take this course, because half of the classes consist of going to the Beinecke.",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. One of the most fascinating, engaging, and thought-provoking classes I have taken over the course of my four years at Yale. The weekly visits to the Beinecke were also absolutely spectacular."
