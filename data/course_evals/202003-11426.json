                "I learned how to effectively distinguish my written arguments from that of authors we studied. I definitely became a stronger writer through this course. Th curriculum was well fashioned in a way that provided us various perspectives of the Afro-Latinx experience.",
                "By taking this course, I feel as if my writing skills have developed greatly. Through the professor's helpful comments on each assignment, I was able to fix my mistakes and become a better writer.",
                "How to accurately analyze literary documents to understand what the writer is trying to convey to the readers\r\nThere is never enough analysis\r\nEveryone's analysis varies greatly and you need evidence to prove why you perceived the writing the way you did",
                "I feel like I improved a lot as a writer and I learned a lot about race and ethnicity, specifically Blackness and Latinidad and the intersection they form in Afro-Latinidad. I think that I have grown in the way that I understand and talk about race and ethnicity.",
                "I learned a lot about how to develop my writing skills. This class gave me a much better foundation and basic understanding of the elements of an essay, and this class helped me learn a lot about how I personally worked as a writer. I also became better at writing discussion questions and steering group discussions with my classmates.",
                "I learned how to write and think critically. One of the most important things I learned was most likely how to close-read, which I had never done before. I also learned how complex the intersection between blackness and Latinxness can be. The professor provides very clear feedback and direction on how to improve your writing. She is straight to the point about your writing and will not hesitate to point things out, but is the furthest thing from rude or condescending. Through her feedback, I am confident that I was able to improve my writing, especially on gathering evidence and connecting them in a way that doesn't rely on intuition from the reader. I also found that my writing became much more concise, which is much more difficult than simply writing a long paper that fills the page count."

                "Cera provides so much great feedback on papers and really takes the time to teach us how to improve our writing. The best part of the class is the discussion on the literature.",
                "The strength of this class is the set up itself. For each paper, there are two different versions. Version one is workshopped by someone in the class. After receiving feedback from a peer, we write version 2 of the paper, which is graded by our professor. This two version system allows for the student to receive helpful feedback before submitting the paper for a grade. All the other assignments, ranging from close readings to annotations, helped me by giving me extra practice.",
                "One strength was the small class size. We were able to become really close and understand each other's perspectives on what we were talking about. The conversations at times seemed never ending because the professor would delve into the questions we provided to make us think more diligently on what our questions provide to our perspectives of Afro-Latinx life in the United States. The due dates are flexible if you show true participation about the topics and let the professor know in advance. All of the feedback we received was very detailed though at times I felt like I was not improving in my writing after receiving similar comments of my writing on every assignment.\r\n\r\nOne weakness would be that some days the entire class would have to peer evaluate papers and nothing else. We would rarely finish peer evaluations during class, so it would end up becoming homework. If we were originally assigned the peer evaluations for homework, we could have used the class time for more beneficial reasons.",
                "The syllabus had such a great variety in authors and types of literature (memoir vs. poetry vs. novel) with such different perspectives. We really got to see different aspects of Afro-Latinidad and the relationship between this identity and other parts of life. Our exploration of the literature and Afro-Latinidad was also well-balanced with our learning about writing. I honestly just wish we had more time!",
                "Earlier in the course, the writing seemed very male-focused. It seemed most of the authors were men, but that may have been due to the chronological order that we read the stories in. The class also felt very short. Like one of my classmates pointed out in our last class, we had so much more we could have discussed about that topic that we never touched. \r\nDespite the online format, this class was very engaging and informative. The small group discussion format was great for establishing a welcoming place for analysis, questions, and overall discussion. The readings about writing were very informative.",
                "The most enjoyable thing about this class was learning from my classmates. Because it was such an intimate setting, I found that it was not only easy to voice my own opinion without fear of judgment, but it was also so much easier to really listen to what others had to say. The professor makes sure that we feel free to do this. Because of the tone she set, I found that all of my classmates were respectful towards one another even if we had disagreements on sensitive topics. A weakness of this course for someone could be that the class is small, so there are a limited number of perspectives, but I personally found it to be a plus."

                "The professor's office hours allowed for one-on-one conversations with the professor. I enjoyed how the professor made us of the breakout room feature on Zoom to allow the class to bond a bit, which then allowed us to have better conversations as we all felt comfortable. Towards the end of the semester, after we would read our readings for homework, we would have to write a discussion board question. These questions were brought up in class, which facilitated different conversations, centered around things we thought were interesting. Cera was extremely flexible and would allow reasonable extensions for any due date whenever asked, which was incredibly helpful.",
                "Cera made a lot of the shorter readings accessible online, which was very helpful. They also were very accommodating and understanding about how these circumstances might affect us, being flexible and helpful whenever we struggled.",
                "I think this class was best suited for virtual learning during the pandemic. The class discussions were great at helping me understand the material and learn while keeping me engaged. The work students were expected to do outside of class was also interesting and manageable. I really appreciate that most of the outside class work could be done away from a screen which helped reduce fatigue, eye tiredness, etc.",
                "I appreciated the virtual discussion format, even though likely everyone in the class would say that they would have preferred an in-person one. Although not ideal, the professor made it work by engaging us in virtual learning styles, like learning from presentations together and online activities. Breakout rooms were often made, and I felt familiar enough with my classmates to actually enjoy them."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in becoming a better writer and learning more about the U.S. Afro-Latinx identity. This course will allow you to read interesting material and practice your writing in a comfortable setting. Cera is an incredible professor who understands the struggles many first year students face and is extremely flexible.",
                "If you enjoy reading about the lives of a little-talked about group with no clear definition of how they should act, look, or exist within the United States, you'll enjoy this class. The history of Afro-Latinx people is constantly changing and the readings cover a wide range of time periods so you'll be able to see the changes and development of the group over time.",

                "Yes. I really enjoyed what I learned in this class. The topic was interesting. The work assigned was challenging enough to help me grow as a student but manageable enough that I was able to focus on improving instead of turning in whatever I could. I also loved many of the books, short stories, and poems that we read.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn something new. As much as it sounds that that is the case for every class, it isn't every year students get the opportunity to explore something as specific as Afro-Latinx literature. If you take this class, you will walk out of it having learned at least something new."
