American democracy is overrated and nuanced!",

In contrast to the mainstream view of the Early Republic as being entirely defined by a group of wealthy white men, this class studies the era through various other vessels including informal political participation, the development of a sociopolitical culture, and minorities which tend to be extremely underrepresented in the prevailing literature of this time.",

It complicated my understanding of the founding fathers and taught me more about the nuances of this time period from the revolution through the 1830s. This class provided a really strong foundation for understanding the origins of America and the founding of this nation. I also improved my primary source analysis skills and essay writing abilities."

                "Strengths - Prof. Freeman is incredible! Lectures are so fascinating and she presents the information in a casual, captivating way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - grading on assignments varies by TF and is extremely harsh; readings can be a lot to get done in a week; sections didn't align with lecture materials; unclear expectations on assignments\/tests; lack of transparency on grade standing\/harsh curve.",
                "Strengths - interesting course material, engaging TF\r\nWeaknesses - no visual aids for lecture, disorganized format, unclear instructions from the professor, boring readings",
                "I loved the discussion section where we were able to discuss the readings and lectures more in depth.",
                "strengths: professor Freeman was an extremely energetic and fun lecturer! You hear so many hilarious anecdotes and weird facts from her that you will never forget! All the TFs do their own research on early national America period so they were very knowledgeable about the course material which is amazing. The course material was interesting and well organized. The workload was also very manageable: no quizzes or reading responses; just 2 papers and 2 exams and doing your readings.\r\nweaknesses: some course readings were not particularly related to what we learn in lectures; sometimes weekly readings include reading an entire book which felt too much",
                "This course was extremely well taught! Professor Freeman was an incredibly engaging lecturer and is clearly an expert in her field. My TF, Emily, was always so kind and, like Professor Freeman, is very knowledgeable on the material. My only complaint about the course was that it had to be virtual!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Freeman! Even though it is hard to pay attention and to stay focused during online lectures, you could tell that Prof. Freeman was trying really hard to make the content engaging and lively. She would include historical anecdotes in her lectures, which I found entertaining. Prof. Freeman is a great storyteller and I was maybe a little disappointed that I wasn't able to take this class in an in-person format, in which I'm sure she would have shined. Another strength was my TF, Emily, who was somehow able to pinpoint all of my writings' weaknesses and to further augment my strengths.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes our readings for section heavily overlapped with the lecture content, and it felt repetitive.",
                "Strenghts: professor Freeman, the TFs, workload, subject matter, everything really\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Far too much Presidential history and not enough social or cultural history. I am interested in learning more about the common people\/culture of the period and less about particular leaders. \r\n\r\nAlso, I would like more study of slavery\/Natives and how these marginalized groups really were a key, key part of the early national period.",
                "Strength - Sections really helped to reinforce the themes discussed. It was very engaging - many different viewpoints were talk about (which aren't usually discussed in history)\r\n\r\nWeakness - No accompanying powerpoint or pdf came with lectures; could help some students' learning",
                "Strengths: everything. Professor Freeman is such an amazing lecturer. The TFs were also amazing (especially Kyra)! \r\nWeaknesses: I really can't think of any. The only thing that was somewhat annoying was the midterm and final exams were timed essay exams, which I thought was a little strange during COVID. I don't think this will translate to a post-COVID world, but I think it would've been better having them take home exams.",
                "Strength: Take this course for Professor Freedman, especially if you're a history nerd or someone who's passionate about history. She is super energetic and tells great historical anecdotes that will help you better comprehend this time period. While I enjoyed most of the readings, some of them were unnecessary and a bit boring, in my opinion.",

                "Strengths: Phenomenal Lectures, Professor Freeman really makes this class engaging and you can tell she is very passionate. The assignments for the class were also unique which made them more enjoyable to do.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we glossed over certain historical details in order to focus on the themes but I think we could have still focused on the themes while learning a little more about individual events, especially from 1800 on.",
                "The course is very engaging and intellectually stimulating for those who perhaps do not know much about American history, although its content may not be new for many American students who took AP US History.  This might warrant a mention on the syllabus page.",

                "not a single weakness, tho think midterm and final could pretty easily and productively be replaced w papers\r\n\r\nstrengths: said it before and i'll say it again - joanne freeman is what yale is all about. it's like listening to a fun podcast. her greatest strength is weaving incredibly fun anecdotes into larger themes and theses. contagious enthusiasm.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Professor Freeman is a phenomenal lecturer\r\n-The TFs are knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and warm\r\n-The readings are excellently curated and extremely interesting to read\r\n-The course is not too obsessed with dates and details, instead focusing on broader themes and concepts\r\n-The students taking the course are engaged and insightful, leading to enjoyable discussion sections (they truly were a highlight of my week)\r\n-The content has an excellent balance between the famous, consequential historical figures that we're familiar with (Washington, Jefferson, Jackson etc) and introducing influential people and movements that are less well known\r\n-The first paper-- an empathic essay where you write from the perspective of an individual of your choice in the time period-- was incredibly fun\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and I enjoyed it so much that I am now tempted to double-major in history. \r\nWeaknesses\r\n-My only suggestion is to do with the grading format. I would prefer a greater weightage and number of take-home essays, and less importance given to timed midterms and final exams. Since the exams also involve writing an essay, i feel I could have given a better account of myself without the time pressure.",

                "The lectures are very interesting and thorough and do a good job covering the material covered on exams and essays. The sections do a good job of filling in the gaps between the lectures and the readings. I think the course could be better if all of the readings were covered in section, or if unnecessary readings were cut or labeled optional. The class has a fair amount of reading to begin with and that might make the reading load more manageable.",

                "I enjoyed the primary source readings which were more than my previous History course and they related very well to the course. In my other course the readings were sometimes seemingly random. Not so in this course. I also really appreciated that my TF was responsive and gave me good feedback.",

                "This class was very engaging. Professor Freeman is fantastic and always kept things interesting, fun, and funny.",

                "Strengths was the lecturer who made class very interesting with many funny or interesting anecdotes to keep the class engaged. Weaknesses may have been that there was very little interaction between the students and the professor. Although the class was a lecture and taught via zoom, there was no time for questions or discussion; it was very much a one way street interns of dialogue.",
                "I really enjoyed how engaging the lectures were. However, without slides, it was sometimes hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman is a great and knowledgable lecturer, as is quite evident by all of the accolades she has accumulated, and she made the class quite interesting. Weakness: your experience of this course will be greatly influenced by the TF you have, so if yours is not good... best of luck to you.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were always interesting. Professor Freeman is very nice and makes class fun. Assignments never felt overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings were a bit long, but nothing too crazy. Sometimes I didnt see the connection between the lectures and the readings on a given week.",
                "This course is a refreshing and interesting take on Early America. Pam is absolutely amazing and such a captivating lecturer. She made online learning very fun and engaging, which is a tough thing to do. I also really enjoyed the discussions and assignments we had with our TF's. There is a lot of reading (we read about a book\/large portion of a book a week) but everything we read had a purpose.",
                "Professor Freeman is incredibly engaging (I've never loved history, but really enjoyed the course). She brings great anecdotes and interesting perspectives to the class. The course has a lot of reading, but it is all interesting and helps you learn to skim for the most important content.",
                "Professor Freeman's enthusiasm and engagement in lecture was a big strength, as well as her effectiveness in keeping lectures fun and filled with anecdotes while still keeping the message \/ main points of her lectures clear. My TF was also awesome. She led discussion sections well so that we had good, meaningful conversations and did not just reiterate stuff from lecture. My TF also occasionally liked to bring in some primary source documents for reading in section, which varied the structure a little bit and provided a different, helpful insight into some of the things we were talking about. Lastly, the feedback from my TF on papers \/ midterm were detailed and helpful. Generally, it's hard to find a weakness with this course...",
                "There are some fascinating readings in this course. I loved doing hundreds of pages of reading each week because the material was so interesting. The only real weakness was that some of the lectures were a little out of place. For example, we spent one of the last lectures talking about technology - which was interesting and important- but for a course that follows chronological order, talking about technologies over the span of the entire course was a little confusing and hard to follow.",
                "Strengths - Prof. Freeman is so great and understanding and laid the material out in a way that was easy to follow \r\nWeakness - The 2 Papers, They were very ~different~ and not your typical academic papers, especially the first paper.",
                "The strength of this course is Prof. Freeman and her vast knowledge of the subject. She covers not only the basic facts, but also mentions little anecdotes in each lecture containing figures from the course. One weakness I found, though, is that the anecdotes can be distracting from the lecture itself. I tended to zone out when the anecdotes were mentioned and sometimes it felt like we heard more anecdotes than actual material which would help us on papers and exams.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman!! She is so excited to talk about and teach the material and makes classes (even virtually) super engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the material\/readings can be dry or dense"

                "Professor Freeman does not use any visual aids or lecture slides during lecture, making the class very un-engaging.",

                "The fact that the lectures were recorded was very helpful. I only missed the live lecture once or twice, but having the ability to watch the lectures back as a review. Section was also handled as well as it could given the Zoom environment. Emily did a great job keeping the discussion flowing with questions for us.",
                "virtual asynchronous lectures worked; sections worked",
                "Perfect",

                "Yes",
                "The exams were surprisingly well-suited for virtual learning. It was fair because everyone would receive the prompt at the same time and be required to submit their response at the same time. The only issue would be that students in different time zones might have found it inconvenient.",
                "This class was fairly standard in terms of dealing with COVID. Sometimes it was hard to find the readings and we had a discussion section cancelled due to wifi issues but other than that nothing particularly bad or great in terms of gearing the class towards the pandemic.",
                "Virtual classes and discussion sections worked out, although having virtual tests was somewhat iffy. Everyone had to show up during class time and submit it by end of class. It may have been better to have a timed canvas test",
                "loved the optional asynchronous and live format",
                "Having lectures be recorded and watchable at any time was very useful.",

Prof. Freeman somehow found a way to keep me more engaged in her Zoom lectures than I have been in any other in-person lecture at Yale. That is quite the feat! My TF, Emily, also did a wonderful job of avoiding any technological hiccups, ensuring sections ran smoothly!",

                "Lectures were virtual but also recorded so we could go back and re-watch them. We were only required to attend one of two lectures \"live\" per week which gave us more flexibility with watching lectures and crafting our schedules which I appreciated. \r\nWhile Professor Freeman was very engaging in lecture, there was very little student input and interactions. Maybe the chat could've been used more? I understand though Professor Freeman was trying to fit a lot of information in so it might've been hard to also ask questions and stuff.  \r\nDiscussion section was run pretty well -- our TF was very supportive and encouraging so everyone seemed to participate which made conversations go smoother."

                "Professor Freeman alone is enough reason to take this course.",
                "Very solid history course! Interesting and accessible to non-majors, and I feel like it was exactly what I signed up for. As a history major, I didn't find the workload too challenging or extreme, and the course was better organized than some other history lectures I've taken.",
                "If you are interested in American history, then absolutely. Professor Freeman is incredible. However, you should be aware that much of your experience (and grade) depends on the quality of your TF.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they really love Professor Freeman or this time period.  Freeman was incredibly unorganized and the readings were long and boring.  The professor was flighty with due dates.  She even forgot to post the final exam!  Meanwhile, I could tell from her Twitter profile that she was online at the time of our scheduled exam.",
                "Yes! A 100x yes! Professor Freeman is a fantastic and lively lecture. She truly loves the material and it makes learning from her a great experience.",
                "Yes! The course material was super interesting, professor Freeman is an amazing lecturer, and the TFs are great people!",
                "Yes yes yes! This course is so well taught, and you can learn so much even if you have no background in the history of this time period. You learn so much about how and what it means to DO history. Although the readings could be a little daunting at first, they all fit well into the course and were thoroughly discussed in section. Professor Freeman is absolutely incredible, and I can't wait to take another class with her in the future!",
                "Prof. Freeman is great, I would recommend for students to at least take this course C\/D\/F, like I did, just to hear her lecture.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Professor Freeman is a gem. She is brilliant and interesting and so gosh-darn passionate, it's impossible not to get excited about this class. The work is chill, but fascinating. While I knew a lot of the facts about this time period, I don't think I truly understood them before this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to re-learn early history in a different angle. They will enjoy the mini anecdotes, tangents, and overall, lecture style.",
                "I definitely would! This is a must take history lecture, especially if you want to have a better understanding about the foundations of the U.S. governmental system.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It has had the best lectures of all of my classes at Yale and the most passionate professor.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any students interested in learning more about the beginnings of the nation or generally interested in American politics and government, as I found the origins of the American political system covered in class particularly interesting and relevant even today.",
                "Yes, Professor Freeman is super funny and engaging, and the material is very interesting as well. I would highly recommend this class to anybody interested in learning more about America and its history",
                "without a doubt, joanne freeman is one of, if not the, greatest professor at yale. it is a genuine pleasure to listen to her lectures, which feel more .like a fun podcast than class. she tells the coolest anecdotes as part of broader arguments, and her enthusiasm is contagious.",
                "Yes, yes, yes. I cannot recommend this course highly enough. Whether you have a background in history or not",
                "I would recommend to students interested in American history, or who want a classic Yale TM class. Prof. Freeman is a fun lecturer, and the workload is relatively manageable.\r\n\r\nSolid preindustrial credit for history majors!!",
                "Absolutely! The course covers a really interesting part of American history and Prof Freeman's lectures are always interesting and engaging.",
                "Absolutely- its an interesting course taught very well",

                "Yes. I would recommend any course with professor Freeman.",
                "Without a doubt. I absolutely love learning about this time period and although Id already taken APUSH in high school, APUSH does not even remotely compare to the beauty of this class. Prof. Freeman is an incredible lecturer and I believe she did a better job of keeping the class lively than any  other class Ive taken at Yale. Also, if you are obsessed with oddly fascinating historical anecdotes, then it doesnt get better than this.",
                "Yes if you are looking for an interesting \/ enjoyable class, but not if you are looking to up your skills in many ways.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot",
                "If you are very interested in the time period, want to gain a brief understanding of it, or it is a requirement, otherwise, you could find more engaging courses.",
                "Yes, especially if youre interested in American history. Opened my eyes on a lot of topics in American history.",
                "YES!! Take this class!",
                "Definitely! I think it's a great perspective to have for a variety of majors and just as an everyday person. Interesting material, exams are broad and manageable, and Freeman is very kind and entertaining.",
                "I would certainly recommend Early National America to other students, history majors or not. If you are a history major, it's a fun class and probably on the easier side compared to other history classes, but still valuable and very worth taking. If you are not a history major or have not taken a history class at Yale, this is a great first history class. It serves as a great introduction to how a college history class might be run and it requires little background knowledge, which makes it a great option for anybody. Professor Freeman is an awesome professor. She has supreme knowledge of the subject she's teaching, she brings energy and enthusiasm to every lecture, and she makes lectures fun and interesting (full of anecdotes) without losing her main points \/ focus. My TF was great also - she gave me detailed feedback on both papers and midterm. The workload from the class is probably average. There is a lot of reading, but it is not absolutely necessary to closely read every reading; you have to make sure you do a good amount of reading, but some reading can be done strategically \/ skimmed \/ etc. There are only two papers, a midterm and a final, so there are not too many big assignments to worry about either. Definitely give this class a try if you're interested in the subject or want to take a history class for the first time. Or for any other reason.",
                "YES- Take this if you at all care about US history",
                "Yes, but keep in mind what TA you pick for section. It seemed as if some sections had to do more prep work sections with their TA. It seemed as if some TA's were \"harder\" graders to, which could affect your overall experience in the class. Overall Joanne Freeman is great",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they had an interest in US History. This course is a great way to satisfy the Preindustrial requirement for the History major. The workload is not overwhelming and the material is interesting.",
                "Yes! If you need a History pre-industrial (PI) credit, then I would definitely recommend this course. Or if you are at all interested in this part or any part of US history, then I definitely suggest you take this course. Especially this year, Professor Freeman drew connections and parallels between our current moment and the politics and debates of early national America which made the history more real and impactful. This course provides a really strong foundation for all of US history and Professor Freeman absolutely loves teaching this course and is an expert in this field!"
