The Palestinian experience of exile and occupation are centered in this course, and we are able to dissect constructed political and racial narratives within Israeli literature.",

We also read de colonial theory and connected it to the subject matter and the literature. We talked not only about the content of the literature itself and also the politics of writing literature."

                "The course is incredibly interesting. I believe that it could be improved in a seminar context, where there is a little more discussion on the text.",
                "This course was held in a lecture hall instead of a space where seminar discussion is most effectively facilitated, so I would recommend, if possible, holding the class in a seminar room.",
                "Strengths: Hannan is clearly so knowledgeable about the topic and the best moments are when he can talk about his relationship with the authors themselves. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish topics discussed in the past were more contextualized, especially since the conflict is still ongoing.",
                "The only improvement I can think of is that the class might work better as a seminar rather than a lecture. Besides that, I loved it!",
                "The course could be improved by a more engaging structure. I thought the course was a seminar, but it was mostly Professor Hever talking. Still, he is a great lecturer and I learned a lot from him.",
                "The strengths are that the readings are (for the most part) very good and Prof. Hever is very kind. But this class was very poorly structured. Each class would basically just be Prof. Hever lecturing for two hours with some brief interruptions by whomever decided to raise their hand. It was basically a lecture without the structure of lectures. The result was consistently low engagement from the class. One time I looked around and noticed that literally every student was multitasking on their laptop, which is pretty sad for a literature course that meets once a week. On the last day we had class around a table and I thought it was unrecognizably better. People were more engaged and it felt like that was what this course was supposed to be. I think a few small structural changes, especially switching from a lecture room to a seminar room, could have made this course much more effective.",
                "I think the texts we read in this course were really powerful and illuminating on the subject. I really appreciated all of professor Hevers commentary on the texts and learned so much from him. I think the student presentations in class were helpful and I appreciated how professor Hever prioritized learning and discussion over always getting things right. I think the only weakness was that since we were in a lecture classroom it was sometimes hard to have a true discussion with peers more than just back and forth with professor Hever."

                "Yes, it is really a very interesting topic and Prof. Hever is thoroughly immersed in it.",
                "Yes, I would. Professor Hever is very knowledgeable and he is also willing to learn from his students. The conversations in class were incredibly eye-opening and Professor Hever handled the difficult topics of the course with care, while still allowing robust and lively discussion. You do have to be really diligent about doing your readings in order to get the most out of this class. Often the course did not follow the syllabus dates, so make sure you know exactly what readings are being discussed that day so you do not come to class having read the incorrect readings. Ultimately you get what you put in.",
                "Students will get as much as they put into this course. It operates more as a lecture than a seminar. I would recommend this course if you like literature and theory.",
                "Yes! I learned so much and read really interesting literature.",
                "I definitely would! The readings were extremely engaging and interesting even if class discussions didnt lend a ton of time to discuss them thoroughly. And if youre okay with a somewhat less engaging professor then definitely take it. Lectures are essentially meandering and rambling and just vibes but its endearing and genuine and entertaining at the very least. Its definitely not necessary to attend lectures and Im not sure how the course would be with a different TF but it was super chill and enjoyable.",
                "Yes. You will read so many great and important texts within Palestinian and Israeli literature. Professor Hever really helps you dissect texts and always keep in mind the historical context. He is very critical of Israel and Israeli settler colonial occupation of Palestine, which I loved.",
                "Only if they switch up the structure of the course. The quality of the discussions (which were more often unstructured lectures) does not even come close to the quality of the readings. I found this frustrating. However, you do get to read some really interesting stuff and Professor Hever says a few interesting things each class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding Israel-Palestine relations through a unique lens that is not purely historical.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is very interested in the subject matter and also who is willing to read a lot and listen to someone else talk about the readings. The class was pretty lecture heavy so if that is not your style it might not be the best class. Overall I feel like i still learned a lot and appreciated all of professor Hevers insights.",
