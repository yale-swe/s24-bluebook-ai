As someone who had taken a linear algebra class in high school but took this because I felt I might not have gotten all the content, I was surprised that this course didn't actually go much more in depth. That said, I think I became more proficient and confident at working with matrices, and especially at understanding many concepts visually -- though a lot of this development happened not because it was taught in the class, but because I looked up material online in order to understand what was being taught in the class.",

I don't think there needs to be so much rigorous proving of concepts we trust you in an applications course and it distracts from the content sometimes",
                "The class is not very organized. The was no notes posted and no solutions to set problems, and it was hard to get feedback or help",
                "This course is honestly a really great overview of linear algebra. I came out of it feeling as comfortable as I can feel I think in something like linear algebra. The strengths were certainly the professor (Mathias is great) and the psets (which I thought were quite well done and decent length). I would say this class could be improved with more discussion of real-world applications throughout the lectures. It also would've been great if Mathias posted the answers to the psets when they were done so we could study them.",
                "There should be more mathematical examples and applications of concepts shown in class rather than abstract proofs.",
                "I think the course could have a better textbook. I am not a big fan of the one we used.",
                "Strengths: Communication was very good -- especially helpful was the use of the Ed Discussion platform that allowed students to ask questions in an online forum and receive answers quickly from peers and teachers. Homework expectations were clear and there were ample review sessions. I think the overall mix of computation and theory was about right -- not just rote work, but not strict proofs either -- even if the teaching was not ideal in other respects. Weaknesses: It might just be inevitable, but engagement with the class was very poor. Often, not a single student would answer the professor's questions. Additionally, lectures could become hard to follow because examples, sub-cases, proofs, and new topics were not always clearly distinguished from each other (in speaking or on the blackboard). More references to the bigger picture and how everything fits together (e.g., \"this is just another way of expressing...\") would vastly improve the clarity of the teaching.",
                "Lectures were a little boring and hard to follow. The majority of the time I had to read the textbook to understand what was being taught. But this could be because the class was at 9 am idk.",
                "More visual depictions of the topics we learn about, better contextualization",
                "Strengths: Prof Schacht is a very understanding and reasonable professor, problem sets & exams were fair and representative of the concepts we learned. Weaknesses: It would have been helpful to see more example problems in class, I also personally did not learn well from the textbook we used",
                "Professor Schacht spent the time to derive many of the rules and concepts we used which gave us a great background for each topic, but also made pacing feel slow at times and caused us to not cover some of the topics we planned to review at the end of the semester. That being said I definitely do not think that a thorough understanding of the concepts should be compromised to add new topics, so I would say this course was great as is.",
                "This course was an abysmal introduction to linear algebra and should be redesigned entirely. Lectures were unclear and unhelpful, and little to no syllabus organized the topics covered. The textbook was closely followed, though it would have been great if another book was chosen (even Gilbert Strangs other textbook- I read all of both and prefer that one as a reference). This book has great intuitive explanations of the way many concepts in linear algebra overlap and interact, but has little structure and reads as a brick wall of prose without any theorems or key points highlighted. Unfortunately the intuitive (albeit dense) explanations of the textbook were not presented in lecture. To make matters worse, assignments and exams focused on computation, rather than understanding of the material. Its here where I start to wonder the reason for the existence of this course. We live in the 21st century. Computers were *literally* designed to deal with busywork matrix operations. If one isnt to take MATH 225 to explore the formal foundations of the field of linear algebra, the alternative should be a course that teaches the intuitions with real world applications. Yes, techniques such as gaussian elimination, factorization techniques, and inverse calculation should all be learned by hand initially. More important, however would be to actually explain when these techniques are necessary, and teach how one would use them in life. The concepts of linear algebra overlap and interact so beautifully, and it was a shame that this beauty was lost in a sea of pedantic busywork on every pset. Make me calculate a 4x4 inverse once on a pset and once on an exam, sure. Then teach me how to do it in matlab, and make me use matlab to solve an actual conceptually nontrivial problem. Meanwhile, for a course allegedly focused on applications there were no applications to be seen. I feel like the course not only failed to teach how linear algebra works, but also why anyone should care to learn it. I feel like I thought myself from the book and would have been better off learning entirely on my own.",

You have to watch out against getting lost in some of the lectures, but if you have a solid understanding of your metaphorical location in the domain of linear algebra at any given time, the class is pretty straightforward and not a pain to do by any means. I'm not sure if you'll necessarily come out of it knowing how to \"apply linear algebra\" to other subjects, but you'll at least know what people are talking about when they mention determinants or transformations.",

                "I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in higher level ecology or statistics. This is a great course taken alongside stats 238, since this course provides the reasoning for the statistical procedures that we did not have time to delve into over the course of 238. The more quantitative side of ecology uses what weve learned for analyses of succession and life tables, so this class was a great way to clarify the possibilities in these realms.",
                "No. If you have the time and interest, take MATH 225. This course is awfully taught and should be redesigned entirely to actually focus on applications with computer calculation (MATLAB), and provide intuitive explanation of the topics involved. Currently, it is mostly busywork calculations and fails to connect many of the key concepts that are so beautiful in linear algebra. Of course, it is a requirement, and many arent ready or simply dont want the rigorous and abstract presentation of MATH 225. In that case, youre screwed. Find yourself a good textbook and buckle up. Fortunately, the p-sets and exams are pretty easy if you learn the material from any competent source (not class).",
