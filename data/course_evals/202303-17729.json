                "The overall organization of the course could be slightly improved, as the syllabus and weekly assignments did not always line up. In addition, I wish there was a centralized home course on canvas, similar to what the MATH department does for its calculus courses, so that we can go there for all announcements.",
                "The course is super engaging and I had a blast learning. I love going to signing tables to sign with other students and teachers, I love signing with my friends who are also in ASL, and I love getting to challenge my brain in a different way than I typically do in engineering courses. One weakness is its pretty disorganized and expectations are unclear, but as long as you care and put in effort you'll be fine.",
                "strengths: We covered a lot in class and often played games and created stories. There was a good balance between learning ASL and learning about Deaf culture.\r\nweaknesses: expectations for homework and anything required out of class were not communicated or clear. The syllabus and homework often seemed slightly removed from or different than what we were learning in class. I didn't get any feedback on any of my assignments until very late into the semester, and I still haven't gotten feedback on a lot of my assignments. Weekly journal assignments often felt useless and had vague directions. Overall, I was really frustrated by feeling like I wasn't provided with enough information to really succeed in this class.",
                "This course was a great introduction to American Sign Language and the culture from which it stems. I feel like I already have a substantial knowledge of different signs and look forward to learning more. The one weakness is I feel like I didn't receive much feedback on whether or not I could sign the language.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Bellamie is an excellent professor! I was very engaged every day in class and looked forward to learning more every day. Bellamie is especially good at giving corrections in class without making you feel discouraged; she was always looking around the room to give feedback and it was really helpful to get corrections immediately when I messed up a handshape\r\n- The class community is incredible, and I am so grateful to have been a part of such a welcoming and supportive environment. I loved the outside-of-class components such as the movie nights and signing table; these events really improved my signing and I also met a lot of great people who really value this language and culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The \"Signing Naturally\" website we used to do our homework can be frustrating at times (technical issues)"

                "YES YES YES!! This is an incredible must-take course at Yale. The faculty is amazing, the people are amazing, the events and opportunities are amazing. However, if you are just looking for a low-workload course and aren't really interested in putting your all into this course, I wouldn't take it; the more you put into this class the more you get out, and I think we all owe it to the faculty to take the course seriously. Go to as many events outside of class as possible, especially signing table every week, and take advantage of online resources (Youtube videos and online ASL dictionaries).",
