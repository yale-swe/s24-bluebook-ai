                "I learned about Northern Ireland, which is a place that has been left off the syllabus for every other class I have ever taken. This class redefined how I view Europe, post-colonialism, and conflict",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of politics of modern conflict and peace processes. Also just a general sense of how some modern history and political science research is conducted through interactions with those living the history.",
                "I learned about the history of Northern Ireland and The Troubles, particularly with regard to the state of republicanism in Northern Ireland. I developed my ability to perform qualitative interviews with a wide variety of people.",
                "Learned a lot about Northern Ireland . Super interesting history and really rewarding to focus on a specific country I didnt know much about.",
                "Gained the ability to understand highly complex events and empathise with each side of the conflict.",
                "This was a fantastic class to learn about qualitative research, especially in the context of a conflict which has ended so recently and has so many ongoing ramifications",
                "I learned so much about Northern Ireland over the past century and its historical implications today.",
                "Interviews with post-conflict individuals, understanding social/political/economic factors that lead to political conflict (identity creation, divergent conceptions of the society); understanding the nature of post-conflict societies (intergenerational trauma), what factors go into peace-building (physical and social reintegration), what challenges still remain",
                "I developed a much deeper understanding of the dynamics of conflict in Northern Ireland, and had the unbelievable opportunity of speaking directly with people engaged in struggle and in peace work."

                "The strengths lie in the guest speakers, though I do wish Bonnie had lectured a bit more on the history of Northern Ireland, instead of just having students present on each topic. I liked the reflection-based assignments, but I would have liked more feedback.\r\nThe readings were also a high. I looked forward to completing them each week.",
                "The course is incredibly engaging. There is to a high workload, with just weekly readings and reflections, and each class session is amazing with some fascinating speakers. I would have appreciated more time for just class discussion and a little more continuity between sessions could come from some more discussion time, but I still feel like I learned a lot.",
                "The main strength is Professor Weir, who has created an excellent syllabus and is a great instructor. I learned so much in this class! A weakness of this course is that, between the guest speakers and the presentations, there isn't loads of time for class discussion, which is a shame. I also felt that the number of republicans featured as guest speakers significantly outweighed those from other backgrounds, so it would've been great to have more of a balance in who we were interviewing.",
                "The weekly guest speakers were such a treat, I really looked forward to each session. Would have loved a bit more opportunity to discuss the readings and perhaps more variety in the writing assignments.",
                "It would be nice to have an indication of your grade throughout the semester, but i thought the classes were very well run.",
                "Amazing class! Lots of very interesting speakers that gave an incredible insight into the troubles. Unlike any other class I have done at Yale so would definitely recommend it to everyone. \r\n\r\nI would perhaps suggest including a few more speakers from non-republican backgrounds as whilst the class was pretty unbiased it would be interesting to here some more different perspectives. For example, maybe another loyalist speaker or someone from the police or British army.",
                "The classes are certainly the strength of the class, and the readings are fascinating. I would love to be able to speak more with the speakers, and it might be nice to get a few of them to come in person. Also, please please please add a trip to Northern Ireland!!",
                "Strengths were the class discussion \r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Strengths: the guest speakers. Learned so many perspectives from them. Could be improved perhaps by more class discussion.",
                "Strengths: incredible format, interesting readings and guest speakers, amazing prof\r\nWeaknesses: i just wish we had more time every week!",
                "Regular assignments and constant engagement with professor were a huge strength! \r\n\r\nDrawback was occasional virtual classes.",
                "Unlike any other course I've taken, this course is structured around interacting with people with lived experience of the conflict and of peace work in Northern Ireland. That can be difficult and uncomfortable, especially when Yale students do not seem prepared to engage deeply with people who have dedicated their lives to what we're talking about. Professor Weir is very helpful about explaining historical context, personal histories, and her own engagement in ways that were very helpful. The weaknesses of this course are inherent to the political science discipline  students enter the room with biases in favor of specific conceptualizations of struggle and peace work, and are sometimes inflexible even when confronted with direct contradictory experience."

                "Yes absolutely  I felt like I was learning fascinating and brand new material, and I loved the course structure",
                "Yes. I had the opportunity to read documents and learn about Northern Ireland, a pretty interesting topic, in a very in depth way. This made the topic incredibly interesting, but even more exciting was the speakers who Professor Weir brings to class. They are incredibly interesting individuals to talk to and make every class session different and interesting. The workload was also not too high and I felt like I learned a lot.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class! Professor Weir is an incredible instructor and the content is really interesting. The ability to hear from speakers involved in the conflict and the peace process was also an amazing experience.",

                "Yes, so interesting. Sometimes overwhelming topics but not overwhelming work.",
                "This course is fascinating and weird. Take it if you want to talk to people who have engaged directly in a recent struggle against state oppression and have done amazing work towards reconciliation  and if you have a high tolerance for the political-scientification of these things."
