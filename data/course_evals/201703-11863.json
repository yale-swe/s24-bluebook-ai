    "Persian L3 will building upon your knowledge of grammar and vocabulary from levels 1 and 2, and by the end of the course you will be able to discuss travel, Iranian traditions and holidays, shopping and other topics in addition to the vocabulary learned in previous semesters.",
    "I improved my language skills significantly and expanded my knowledge of the Persian language.",
    "PERS 130 is an excellent continuation to the L1 and L2 courses. In this level, there seemed to be a distinct focus on developing writing and speaking skills, and I felt these were the skills most improved by this course. In addition, I gained knowledge and insight regarding the culture and history of Iran, both through course materials and supplemental cultural events, including Persian speakers, movies, and meals.",
    "This course dovetailed well with 120, continuing to expand vocabulary and develop understanding and usage of more complex sentence structures.",
    "In L3 we learned more verb tenses and vocabulary. We wrote more compositions than the previous two semesters and did longer presentations - all of which were manageable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the instructor, the textbook, and the level of engagement with my fellow classmates. Professor Shayesteh is a wonderful language instructor and the textbook used for the class is excellent in explaining grammar and vocabulary. Also, my classmates were very engaging and always enthusiastic about learning the language. The biggest weakness is the workbook: the exercises are repetitive and feel unnecessary if you do all of the textbook exercises.",
    "You will learn quite a bit in one semester of this course; however, at times it feels like the class moves a little fast. There were times where I struggled to keep up, but I was never too far behind. In the end, the class was definitely worth it seeing that I can read and speak the language much better than I could at the beginning of the semester.",
    "An important strength of this course is the professor, Dr. Shayesteh. She is obviously dedicated to her students, and her effort shows at each class meeting. The small class size is also a huge advantage in the course, as it allows for one on one attention given to each student, helping increase engagement and participation. In addition, the course's Friday discussion sections are a huge asset, and allow for practice of advanced vocabulary more relevant to modern conversation (including some casual and technology related words). One weakness of this course is not meeting everyday; I felt I would have very much benefited from having the opportunity to practice for a shorter period of time more consistently.",
    "All in all, this course is excellent.  The level of instruction is top-notch and there is ample opportunity to learn, so long as you apply yourself.",
    "The professor makes learning the language seem easy. The homework and readings are not too difficult but are effective in helping you remember the material. There are no weaknesses in this class. I was able to converse with people I met and they would compliment me on my speaking abilities. The class time itself is relaxed and enjoyable."

   "comments": [
    "This class is a great continuation of L1 and L2. After taking it you will feel much more prepared to have real conversations in Persian, and you will have a much more expansive vocabulary and knowledge of grammar.",
    "Yes. If a student is interested in the Persian culture and language, taking Persian might be the best course of action at Yale to cultivate this interest.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking for a challenging and rewarding course! At the beginning of L1, I knew practically no Persian, and now I am confident holding conversations, giving presentations in Persian, and writing five page essays. This is definitely not an easy course, but like any course at Yale, you'll definitely get out what you put in! If you are willing to dedicate a little extra time to the course every day, you'll see the benefit at the end of the semester. The small class size and Prof. Shayesteh are also huge assets to the course, and the fun atmosphere of class makes it a pleasure to attend! If you're even considering Persian, I would take it!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, and often do so.  The instruction received is some of the best that I have encountered at Yale.  It's rare that you get such a sense that the professor actually cares whether or not you understand the material and Professor Shayesteh certainly does.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Unlike other languages where certain students sandbag their abilities, everyone in Persian is on an even playing field. Plus, the professor judges everyone individually, not based on the best student. Take this class! The work is not overwhelming and you get to learn a really fantastic language."
