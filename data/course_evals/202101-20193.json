I was introduced to so many new artists who I am eager to continue learning from.",

Really amazing feedback from both Professor Rankine and Professor Skillings often with actionable advice.\r\nWeaknesses: I think Professor Rankine wanted to facilitate more natural discussion with mics unmuted, but somehow the act of muting is so normalized that I think the recommendation to unmute made discussions feel difficult.",

The course could be strengthened by a closer focus on the theme\/themes of the course, and perhaps a selection of less expansive themes."
