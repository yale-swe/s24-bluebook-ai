Really amazing feedback from both Professor Rankine and Professor Skillings often with actionable advice.\r\nWeaknesses: I think Professor Rankine wanted to facilitate more natural discussion with mics unmuted, but somehow the act of muting is so normalized that I think the recommendation to unmute made discussions feel difficult.",

The course could be strengthened by a closer focus on the theme/themes of the course, and perhaps a selection of less expansive themes."
