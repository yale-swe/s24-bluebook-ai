                "Greatly improved my Chinese abilities, particularly writing abilities, reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and vocabulary. We learned around 50 new words a week, which while difficult, has been extremely helpful. I feel like I'm getting to the point where I can read real news articles in Chinese, with limited vocabulary assistance",
                "I gained a tremendous amount from this course. I learned hundreds of new vocabulary words, how to use and apply new grammar structures in writing and conversation, and so much about Chinese history, culture, and society. I realized that I did not pay enough attention to my pronunciation in high school, so I worked hard on trying to improve my tones throughout CHNS 150.",
                "I developed Chinese skills! Largely vocabulary, also some new sentence structures and better reading comprehension. Learned how to write a bunch of new characters too, though I feel I may forget how to write those soon.",
                "During this course I greatly improved my mandarin abilities. I learned new vocabulary and grammar structures, and got lots of speaking practice.",
                "This course was excellent. I greatly improved my speaking, reading, and writing abilities. Specifically, I gained sufficient vocabulary and grammar knowledge to convey thoughts on basic political, economic, and cultural topics."

                "Strengths-Li Laoshi. Best Chinese teacher at Yale. She is super committed to her students and gives honest, sometimes tough, feedback. The course is also very well-organized. The Canvas site is easy to follow, assignments easy to access, and everything is in one place. Another strength is the small size of classes. We get so much speaking time three times a week and can ask practically any questions we ever have.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-Not enough writing feedback. We only write two essays a year, plus two presentations. We get feedback for an essay there, but it is hard to apply that and systematically improve one's writing skills. Instead, we should have shorter essays but more frequently.",
                "This course had many strengths. The class was very small in size, so we were able to participate in lots of discussion and debate and get plenty of individualized feedback. There were strong emphases on listening to, speaking, reading, and writing Chinese, which allowed me to further my Chinese skills in a plethora of ways. The texts we read dealt with so many interesting topics, from gender equality in 20th century China to the development of Chinese civil society to China's political history. The only weakness I can think of is that the class often ended 5-10 minutes late, which made me a little bit late to my next class.",
                "Strengths: Chinese was taught very well! I liked the focus on practical spoken Chinese that we might encounter in the real world. The professor was also very good at answering our questions specifically and satisfyingly. The classroom community was also nice.\r\nWeaknesses: not always the most organized. I will say, the home page of the canvas course (with the calendar) and the resources page on Canvas were very helpful and well-organized. However, other than those pages, oftentimes the Grades page would get very confusing, and also some of the assignments/instructions that were specific just to our section of Chinese 150 were not super clear.",
                "I think my classroom should have been stricter about only speaking Mandarin. Even though our class was mostly Mandarin-only, there were times when we spoke a bit of english and it wasn't necessary to.",
                "The course is overall well designed. There were certain weeks when work would pile up a bit, however. If possible, it would be good to better distribute larger assignments like essays, presentations and exams. That being said, the course was extremely well organized and if you wanted, it wouldn't be difficult to work in advance."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I have never been more excited about learning Chinese than while taking CHNS 150, and I feel like I made a tremendous amount of progress in just four months. It is quite challenging and work-heavy, but I felt that it all definitely paid off.",
                "I would! The community in the class was very nice, and it was a good challenge overall. It added some much-needed diversity to my otherwise stem-heavy schedule.",
                "Yes, this course does an excellent job improving one's mandarin ability.",
                "I definitely would. The work-to-learning ratio is as good as it gets for a foreign language, and if you are passionate about Chinese you will be very glad to have taken this course."
