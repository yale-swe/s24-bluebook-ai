                "I learned the principals of optics. I learned competency of a basic light microscope, and a survey level understanding or various other types of microscopy. We read scientific literature and discussed them as a group. I learned how to present scientific research in front of a group and defend my position. Dr. Wolenski was also great at delivering practical advice about how to excel at a career in science. Very good course!",
                "From this course, I have, at the very least, developed the necessary skills and confidence in operating a standard fluorescence microscope, which will surely be useful in the future. However, this was just a fraction of what this course offered. I had the unique opportunity to gain a breadth of knowledge to learn not only what all the components are of a microscope and how to adjust them for the best image but to actually understand the physics behind what light is doing and how the microscope actually produces the image that reaches our eyes. Understanding these concepts, I get the sense they will provide a lasting benefit as I interact with light microscopy in research for many years to come. That was more or less the first half of the course. The second half did a really good job of helping us understand the kinds of technologies related to light microscopy in modern research. What was really special, though, was that this was not just limited to slide decks but actually operating a spinning-disk confocal, a light-sheet microscope, etc. This added an extra dimension to the teaching and made the subjects more tangible. It was also nice to spend time on some of the technologies we use alongside light microscopy, like FRET and single-particle tracking. Overall, I have probably learned more from this class than from any other single course at Yale. Part of this might be a reflection of my limited knowledge of the subject prior to this semester, but the depth and rigor yet accommodation of this course were unparalleled.",

Ray tracing and theory of optical systems, including concepts of resolution, numerical aperture, Nyquist sampling, Fourier optics, focal planes...

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The course is tight knit and very personal. I loved the hands-on aspects of taking apart a microscope and putting it back together. The main instructor, Dr. Wolenski is very kind hearted and very easy to talk to. He is very wise on both microscopy and practical advice for a career in science. I felt like I learned a lot by the time is semester was over.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes I felt like the order in which we did things was a bit random, especially during the latter half of the semester. The other instructors would present their work, which both 1) didnt have much to do with microscopy and 2) did not make sense with the context of the last lecturer. The last part of the semester was very jumpy. The exams were fair, but often tested the mundane. Each professor had their own set of questions which made the style of the exam a mixed bag. \r\n\r\nAll things considered, this is a very strong course which is still in its honeymoon phase. All it needs is a few tweaks to be perfect.",
                "Because of the very small class size, we had a collaborative, intimate atmosphere between the students and instructors. A broad variety of different instructors contributed their perspectives and expertise. This class (in particular the second half) surveys a very broad range of topics with a bird's eye view, but we also learned in-depth how to operate and troubleshoot a microscope. The class demands a lot of in-person time per week, but makes up for this with a relatively light out-of-class workload. The most intense part is when you give your job talk, which requires extensive reading of a fairly tough paper."

                "Yes. It is a very intimate course. You will learn a lot. It is tedious and challenging at times, but that is really what makes it interesting. 10/10 would recommend.",
                "I would highly recommend this course if a student thinks they will use light microscopy as a research tool in the future. This is definitely a rigorous course, and I can imagine one not interested in such a subject would take less from this course and find it difficult at times. Of course, most will find it difficult at times, but it is worth those struggles. The course is well taught, and the many professors make it possible to ask deeper questions. The small number of students in the course makes it easier to interact with the professors in a way that simply is not possible in other STEM courses, even mid-sized labs. A student will find his/herself vastly more competent and knowledgeable by the course's end.",
                "Yes. If you're at all interested in doing anything that needs microscopy, this is a great way to really learn how the microscope works and feel confident using it. The class is so small and you really feel like the professors are on your side and want you to succeed."
