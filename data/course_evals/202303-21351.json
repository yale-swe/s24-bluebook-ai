                "The syllabus is amazing",
                "The syllabus for this class is excellent; Tim is extremely knowledgeable about the works he's assigned and their broader cultural context and legacy. He's a very involved and conscientious instructor. I really enjoyed our discussions in seminar. The course was a mix of class years which I was worried about at first but which I think wound up working out well. I loved the fact that half the course meetings were devoted to the study and discussion of relevant archival materials at the Beinecke. I also appreciated the flexibility of the syllabus (the extra weeks for the works of Peter Weiss & Frantz Fanon, for example), though the last couple weeks wound up feeling as though they were thrown a bit off balance as a result. I would say the class was slightly disorganized but not to the detriment of my learning."

It is a dream syllabus for many avid humanities students. However, this course needs to be much more organized and structured and redesigned for it to be successful.",
                "I would  anyone interested in the question of if and how art can be used to further social and cultural movements would be well-served by studying the texts on this syllabus, and Tim is excellent at facilitating engaging conversations about and with these texts."
