                "The syllabus is amazing",
                "The syllabus for this class is excellent; Tim is extremely knowledgeable about the works he's assigned and their broader cultural context and legacy. He's a very involved and conscientious instructor. I really enjoyed our discussions in seminar. The course was a mix of class years which I was worried about at first but which I think wound up working out well. I loved the fact that half the course meetings were devoted to the study and discussion of relevant archival materials at the Beinecke. I also appreciated the flexibility of the syllabus (the extra weeks for the works of Peter Weiss & Frantz Fanon, for example), though the last couple weeks wound up feeling as though they were thrown a bit off balance as a result. I would say the class was slightly disorganized but not to the detriment of my learning."

It is a dream syllabus for many avid humanities students. However, this course needs to be much more organized and structured and redesigned for it to be successful.",
