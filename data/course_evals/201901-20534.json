    "Refined graphic design skills through weekly critiques.",
    "intro to graphic design teaches you the foundations of design: how to portray things to best communicate meaning using aesthetic techniques",
    "I learned a lot through this course, definitely more than any other art class I've taken at Yale. I learned how to express ideas visually through both content and form, and how to think critically about design. I also learned how to use Photoshop InDesign and how to make my own book.",
    "I have taken a few art classes before at Yale as electives, so I thought I had a decent foundation into visual design. I was completely wrong. This class totally changed how I think about design. I learned a few practical skills, like how to use Adobe InDesign, as well as some nitty-gritty terms, definitions, and history, but mostly what I learned was that every single decision that goes into a final visual art project has some effect on the way it is perceived by an audience, and how to control those decisions effectively.",
    "how to effectively execute a graphic design project, from the idea phase to the final product",
    "I learned how preconceptions of design can hinder our progress in it. By breaking down thoughts into abstract visualizations, we were able to understand design better.",
    "I learned how to organize information (hierarchy of information), and how to use InDesign. This class also gave me the opportunity to interact with text in a different way, and showed me the role typography plays in design. This class also made me realize that even though graphic design is a form of art, in many cases it strays away from being representational. I learned that good designs should be able to convey ideas universally without having to use imagery (such as using soft curved lines and light colors, for example, to give the impression of sleep or bed instead of explicitly depicting the term with an image of a bed)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Covered design concepts from the ground up.",
    "decent amount of work from class to class, but the critiques (1:50 discussion+analysis of student work) were really great and very instructional",
    "The key strength of this course, as taught by Yeju Choi, at least, is that one completely feels as though one is learning a brand new skill and all its component background knowledge. No assignments or lectures feel extraneous. The entire experience is deliberate, and one leaves with a feeling of accomplishment. Its major weakness is the expense. In addition to a $150 materials fee, the instructor expects a minimum of $5 a week, on average, in printing costs, and many students spent upwards of $100 of their own money (outside the materials fee) in completing the final assignment. It is a gross oversight on the part of Yale's administration that this is allowed to happen, and it put a significant damper on my semester. Academically, though, the class is immaculately planned and executed.",
    "Very expensive. This should be made clear.",
    "Needs more detailed feedback.",
    "Strengths: the critiques were really helpful to figuring out ways to improve on our next projects \r\nWeaknesses: I found that I didn't have enough time to focus or think more in depth about the projects, and often found myself having to half-ass my work (even after spending hours working on it) because it was due by the next class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, because it makes you a better designer.",
    "highly highly recommend. take it if you can.",
    "I highly recommend this course! The work for this class consists of a series of exercises that build on one another to teach various design concepts. For example, one of the assignments was to redesign a poster as a way to practice information hierarchy. Class times are spent critiquing homework. These discussions are really valuable, and I learned a lot from both feedback I received, as well as feedback given to others. Professor Choi doesn't call on people to talk, so it is really on the individual to take the initiative and participate.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this class, providing you have the time in your schedule to dedicate to it. It is not an easy 5th credit, but the skills and insights it imparts are transferrable and interdisciplinary.",
    "this class won't teach you how to design pretty things but it will teach you conceptually how to be able to execute any idea you have for a project; if you're interested in that then yes",
    "Yes. I think it is important for everyone to have a basic understanding of aesthetics and how people perceive design and its value. This class will get you that, but not much more.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who really are interested and would want to learn more about the process of graphic design. That being said, however, be prepared to put in time and work for this class. It really pushes you to think outside the box and apply what you learned throughout the semester.",
    "Yes absolutely, especially if you want insight on how a graphic designer must think about their work."
