                "I think that the course made me more open-minded about how to approach writing. I learned that writing is really about discovery and the process might even prompt more questions than answers as you develop your thoughts and argument. I also learned that writing is kind of like a conversation maybe with yourself in some cases but with other sources as you develop your argument. From this course, I have a greater appreciation of writing and don't find it as daunting as before.",
                "I learned how to write in the format of papers more comfortably and also how to revise my drafts better with feedback from my instructor and peers. For example, I learned to write more freely (in contrast to the high school 5 paragraph essay) based on a question, thinking as I write. Also, I was able to improve my style of writing and become more aware of the problems of my writing to focus on as I improve in revising as well. For this writing seminar especially, I was also able to examine the topic of time from the different angles of memory, identity, metaphysics, and literature. I gained a deeper understanding of time and its interaction with humans."

Sometimes I felt like we were looking for a specific takeaway or summary and there would be no room for further discussion on the readings. I felt like the Japanese poetry discussion was pretty good and I felt like there was room to discuss and participate.",

                "If the topic of time interests you and you need to practice your writing more, I would recommend this course. However, if you are more interested in just improving your writing or you're more eager to discuss, there may be better writing seminars that will engage you more."
