I also learned so much about the context and application of healthcare in the US and how we got to where we are now which I'm very interested in.

                "The readings are really interesting, but it felt somewhat that we had the same conversation every week, so maybe more variety in the themes.",
                "This class had one of the most interesting selections of readings Ive had in a course. I always felt like I had something I could contribute in section. Sometimes I felt a little behind in the course if I had other work competing with it, which was hard. I wish the class could have been a little more flexible.",
                "This class was really good! I thought the readings overall were very interesting and our discussions felt very balanced. I also really liked that there were both primary and secondary sources for our readings so we got to see both. I did think some of the units felt a little repetitive but they built on each other so it was okay."
