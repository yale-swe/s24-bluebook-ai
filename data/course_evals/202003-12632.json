Now I feel like I have a better understanding of what can be considered a Black film, and the many generes that can be included in it.",

                "This class is genuinely great! I love being able to sit and talk with my peers about the readings and the films we watched, especially with everybody having such diverse backgrounds. I only wish the class was longer so our conversations could be deeper.",
                "I think the selection of films and readings for this course is very strong. However, one thing I think could be improved are our class discussions. I think that having a more concrete lesson for the day, rather than so much student discussion, could increase how much is taken away from the course.",
                "Really interesting films and discussions, just lacked a little bit of direction in our learning. I would've preferred slightly less reading so that we could go further into specific topics in class rather than having a more tenuous grasp on lots of different ideas. Additionally, the seminars could've had more structure so it was clearer what we were supposed to get out of each class. But overall I really enjoyed the things we talked about and viewed.",

                "Please take this class if you can! This is genuinely one of the best classes Ive ever taken at Yale! Beyond the desire to simply get a good grade, this is the one of the first classes where I actually felt like I learned something. It wasnt just doing the reading and writing papers to get an A, it was effort put into understanding every word and theory, every film. So much of what I learned in this course, especially the processes, have completely changed the way I approach readings and papers. Thats never going to leave and Im a better student for having taken this course!",
                "Yes, but only if you are committed to doing the work. It is geared more towards film majors than I expected an introductory course to be, so I would not recommend it if you are not particularly invested in the material.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in film or AfAm studies. You watch a lot excellent and interesting films that the core FMS courses don't screen and learn important things about race and art.",

                "Yes!! The films and readings in this course are great and Prof. Forster is fantastic. He cares so much about his students and is very open to helping increase student engagement and learning in any ways he can. I took this course during covid-19 and that made for a more difficult seminar-setting, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this material and grew as a Film Studies student through it."
