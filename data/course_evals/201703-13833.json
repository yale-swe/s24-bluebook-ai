    "This class really did provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon that is human trafficking. We looked at both supply (i.e.: poverty, corruption, etc.) and demand (i.e.: AIDS epidemic contributing to the desire for younger prostitutes) side causes and effects that contribute to trafficking. Additionally, we also gained a lot of experience cleaning and analyzing data in Stata.",
    "Research, group work, working with a client and reconciling approaches. In terms of skills this is the Yale class that has developed the most of my skills.",
    "This was an absolutely incredible course for personal growth. By working the Professor Cohen, I developed skills pertaining to professional protocol, teamwork, and innovation.",
    "Analyzing raw data using STATA; presentation skills; teamwork building"

   "comments": [
    "This course had a number of weaknesses. First of all, there was simply way too much work for all of our group to tackle effectively. At times, it seemed like I could do nothing but Capstone every day and still be behind. In the future, Jackson needs to do a better job of vetting the projects beforehand to ensure that they aren't overloading the students in the course. At a time when everybody is busy with job applications and all of the other commitments of senior year, it just isn't fair to throw kids into such a work-intensive project. To be fair, we all expected capstone to be intense, but nobody was expecting to be plugging away for 25+ hours a week. That is just unrealistic. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we were ill-equiped to tackle the problems that we faced. Professor Cohen is a rockstar with the human trafficking subject matter, but could offer us no assistance when it came to the data analysis. Our prior data analysis courses (i.e.: GLBL 121, GLBL 225) didn't feel like sufficient introductions to what we were ultimately required to do in capstone, which meant that this project was an absolute stress case for most of the class. In order to make this a more pleasurable experience in the future, Jackson should either bring on data analysis professionals to help students in these types of capstones, or beef up the pre-capstone data analysis requirements.",
    "I felt it was really disorganized and hectic, and there was conflicting information coming from the different mentors involved.but some of that was unavoidable and it got better by the end. I learned a lot",
    "This course had innumerable strengths all due to working with Professor Cohen, my only critique is that the students did not know what exactly we were getting ourselves into - especially regarding the extent of data analysis and cleaning that this project would entail. We had to do a year's worth of work in only a semester. Traveling to Haiti was an eye-opening experience and going to DC made this project truly feel worthwhile. Working as a team was at some moments challenging and at others very rewarding. Professor Cohen encourages us to be innovative with any and all challenges we faced - it was incredibly reassuring to know that she was our biggest supporter and enthusiastic about every step of our progress.",
    "Better division of work: I don't think it is necessary to have editors. Crash course on STATA \/ statistics in the beginning of the semester."

    "Can't avoid it if you're a global major. However, be careful when picking capstones, as some (like this) will turn out to be infinitely more work than the others.",
    "Yes! One of the best things about the major.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students; however, I would stress that they prepare themselves for a ginormous workload. Working with Professor Cohen and the IOM is the most rewarding experience and facilitates huge personal growth.",
    "Yes, the work we did was very meaningful, and my Yale experience would not be the same without this capstone project."
