You also learn how to work in a team and many valuable software engineering practices in the lectures.",
                "We worked on a semester-long software project. My team specifically built a mobile app using React Native/TypeScript for the frontend, Express/Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for our database. I had never built an app from scratch before, so this was a very practical and rewarding experience, and made me much more comfortable with building up a full-stack app from scratch.",

In addition, working as a team teaches you what the best practices are for software engineering, team management, testing, code quality, and decision-making for design choices. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis course provided a great exposure to software engineering best practices, team management and product management strategy, testing and code quality, and picking the best services for your applications.",
                "I got good experience working with a team and building an application from the ground up.",

I had used my teams Flutter + Firebase stack before, but I had never worked a software engineering internship or really developed code together on a large team, so that was where most of my learnings were. In particular, I became far more knowledgeable about git and version control, along with different development techniques (e.g. agile development) and testing protocols. Technically, I learned more about our chosen stack, with an emphasis on automated testing and deployment. More generally, I learned a lot of soft skills regarding group software projects that I think will be invaluable in future work environments."

            "comments": [
                "Faster turnaround for feedback on homeworks would have been immensely helpful (took like 2 months for Hw2 to be graded, and the feedback would have been super helpful to have sooner).",
                "Weaknesses: Lecture time was monotonous and there was little encouragement for the group projects by the teacher, all work had to be done independently outside of class. \r\n\r\nImprovements: Let part of class time (maybe even up to 50%) be dedicated and required in class work with your group project. There was little motivation to go to class and no workshops into specific technologies for certain group projects. Include as part of work time TAs readily available for help.",
                "Strengths: choosing our own project, picking what skills we want to learn, frequent presentations, practical problem sets, well-timed deadlines, Prof Antonopoulos is really nice\r\nWeaknesses: we get grades back really late and sometimes without any feedback (pset 3), so most of the time we have no way of knowing how we are doing in the course",
                "This was one of the most practical electives offered by Yale's CS department! We built an actual product, learned how to make MVPs, learned an entire tech stack, and worked on a team. I hope this course continues to evolve and grow in the future! Some weaknesses: The lectures were not always on the most relevant topics. Having workshops earlier-on and having classes to cover the tools we were using would be helpful. Having code reviews from the TFs/ULAs would also be nice.",
                "First, in the project selection phase, you guys need to make it clearer who is in charge of who joins which team.  Some of the people who came up with the project ideas were incredibly rude about selecting people for the project.\r\n\r\nSecond, this should be a once per week lecture class at most.  Realistically is should just be online lectures.  The content felt very dragged out.",
                "Strengths: I really liked that it was all dependent on this one large project since I really enjoyed the project. This also meant the work load was pretty low and you can dictate when you want to spend more time for the class. If you contribute to the project, you end up learning a lot of valuable skills from creating something by yourself + by working with a team of amazing engineers\r\nWeakness: Grades came back slowly",
                "Course could have been more structured to keep people on project deadlines.",
                "You get to do real-life, applicative CS work and get a personal project out of it, which is great. On the other hand, theres not much that I learnt from the class itself and attendance was usually low.",
                "I think Timos has done a great job of iterating on the course and don't see many weaknesses. It may help to give teams a better idea of when exactly they should actually concretely start their project, since my team was kind of confused about this point and started a bit late. Other than that, I really like the structure and content of the course!",
                "The strength is how this class is focused on creating a real project with a team. All of our assignments and time is devoted to this, which is awesome considering how Yale CS classes normally function. This class teaches you a lot of what it means to be a software engineer, even in a more limited setting. The weaknesses are how people can get away with doing less work (not much accountability), learning technologies is largely an independent task (which does have some benefits though!), and while lectures are interesting (especially guest lecturers), it's hard to engage with them sometimes.",
                "I think this class could definitely have more guidelines with how to schedule the timeline of your actual project. I additionally think that the concepts in Class could be applied in more practical examples. With these weaknesses, I personally think a reversed classroom would be better. The class itself could be more based on working with the team, establishing a good timeline and the homework could be watching the lectures/learning and having short quizzes on the software engineering concepts.",
                "The content presented in class was definitely new to me and interesting, but since there wasn't really anything holding accountable to showing up, a lot of students just stopped going to class, and near the end I was busy too and didn't go either. I suppose to each their own, but the content of the course was relevant.",
                "I enjoy the flexibility! I think it might help to have homework relate more closely to lecture materials; there was a lot of lecture material that I didn't process/understand, and I feel like getting more hands-on with the material could help.",
                "Think there were a couple lectures that werent as helpful than if the time was committed to work time with the team.",
                "Strengths: The biggest strength of this course is the amount of creative freedom you have to create whatever you want. The material taught in lectures is useful if you've never had a software engineering internship before, and Timos is an absolute gem. The ULAs were also great this semester. This is a project based class, so the PSETs are based off the project that you build throughout the entire semester, which is nice. You'll come out of it with something substantial to add to your resume and get exposed to other cool projects.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes people can get away with contributing very little to the project, so the workload falls on other group members. Because of the amount of creative freedom, there's not a lot of structure, and there's a lot of self-learning involved. The lectures are very detached from the actual project itself in some ways, so it disincentivizes people to come to lecture.",
                "lectures could be more interactive, but project format is great",
                "My suggestion for improvement would be to give comments on the first planning homework soon after the assignment is submitted, and then ask teams to start working on their projects. My team found all the different planning assignments (1, 2, project proposal presentation) redundant, and we didnt receive any useful feedback from the course staff about our project until we presented.",
                "I think the main strengths of the course were the dedicated focus on a single project, the straightforward yet useful homework assignments, and the generally relaxed and fun atmosphere of the course. I really liked being able to work on a single project in a group all semester, which allowed us to develop a work schedule and team chemistry while diving into our chosen application. Moreover, this is far more similar to a work environment than other Yale courses, which I really appreciated. The homework assignments complemented the core project well, as they forced us to look introspectively into our idea and to give constructive feedback regarding others ideas; moreover, they were a reasonable length so they did not really interrupt our project work. Furthermore, the due dates were always flexible if necessary, creating the aforementioned relaxed atmosphere for creating a cool final project. Overall, everything we learned was geared at becoming a better software developer, with ample opportunities for social learning along the way. Thus, it was a very collegial and productive environment for learning.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the main weaknesses of the course were a lack of accountability/assistance on our projects and somewhat disconnected lectures. While difficult with everyone choosing different stacks and technologies, it would have been nice to have a bit more technical direction on our projects; perhaps there could be a few stacks to choose from and a ULA/TA who is knowledgeable about each one. As an even smaller adjustment, there could be required brainstorming/planning/coding sessions with one of the instructors to get help and stay on track. While these structures would potentially lessen the freedom of the current structure a bit, they could be relaxed enough to be non-intrusive while still being helpful for less experienced teams. Perhaps they could take place instead of some of the lectures, which just felt a bit disconnected and auxiliary and were therefore poorly attended."

                "Great CS gut, especially if you have internship experience. You don't have to go to class",
                "Yes! But you should be motivated to figure things out on your own and with your team. The ULAs/TFs are helpful with starter code, but for a lot of this stuff (much like actual software engineering), you need to Google it and mess around with things until they work!",
                "Yes! If you like project-based classes then this is the one for you. It's a great way to motivate yourself to actually apply your skills and learn that framework you've been putting off for a long time.",
                "Yes, it is a good class to get realistic industry experience",
                "For sure, I think it's super valuable. It might help to take it with at least one other person that you know/can work with, but not totally necessary!",
                "If you're a CS major interested in a software engineering career, I definitely recommend this course. It's important to have experience working with a team and leveraging technologies to build a practical app. This class will reinforce what you may have already learned from internships as well as prepare you for future internships/jobs.",
                "Yes, great opportunity to learn how to work with others and get exposure to relevant tech stacks.",
                "If you have a few people you know before hand, and have a clear idea yourself on what youd want to do, then I think this class is a great excuse to work on it. Its hard to mobilize a group of random people, and the class itself is not that engaging on its own, so I think those prerequisites are important.",
                "Best class I have ever taken at Yale, and the best professor to take it with.",
                "Yes, if you want to go into SWE, this is a good class to learn about different techniques used in the real world, and since your semester is centered around creating a product you will come out of the class with a cool web or mobile app.",
                "yes, but I would recommend them to take it later once they've done an internship or two or already have some practical software dev experience so they can feel like they're contributing more",
                "Yes, it definitely teaches you software engineering principles that come in handy to work on a startup project. Also the example code and walkthroughs from the TAs was extremely helpful",
                "Yes, this is a great CS elective to take! Timos is amazing, and you get the chance to build something cool. There's a lot of self learning involved if you aren't already familiar with the tech stack that your group plans to use, but I feel like it's worth it. You also get a lot of experience with soft skills in terms of being on a team.",
                "yes it is interesting to work towards a project in a group",
                "I would recommend it to a CS major who is looking to learn about the SWE process and wants to take an easy class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys working in groups and on long term projects and wants to learn more about software development. If you are experienced, it will be a good place to practice and hone your skills, and you can help lead a team; if you are less experienced, this class is a great way to learn a popular framework alongside like-minded peers. However, you should be prepared for self-directed learning, as well as some hard work in planning and executing an idea. But given the lack of exams and relaxed assignment schedule, along with the practical skills you develop along the way, I would definitely say its worth it!"
