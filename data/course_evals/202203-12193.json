It was very difficult to navigate the service project, and as a result, I think most people feel they did not accomplish very much.",
                "Strengths - small class and great community. The ASL community at Yale is incredible; coming to class most days of the week made our section especially close. I often find myself signing with others outside of class for fun or teaching our friends in our free time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The online signing assignments were a good practice toolwhich did end up being useful throughout the course, but sometimes they were incredibly tedious and boring. They were also graded for credit and not completion, which was incredibly frustrating when you would spend 30 minutes doing an assignment just to miss the last question (which sometimes used vocabulary we did not learn in class) and you would have to redo the entire assignment. Certainly not a dealbreaker for this incredible course, just kind of annoying.",
                "This course is very strong in providing scaffolding for new learners of ASL. I also had a great time with joint classeswhere we got to have conversations with students from other sections at the same time as ourswhich I thought were very conducive to learning. The service component is important for an ASL class too, I think. My problems with this class were in organizationit seemed like there were a lot of attempts to standardize between classes and instructors that didnt work/werent appropriate to learning needs/overly complicated our lives. There were so many documents and rubrics and files within files that it was personally inaccessible for me. My instructor did a good job handling this, but it was frustrating.",
                "I think that a strength of the course is the immersion in asl and the involvement in the Deaf community. I think that a weakness of the course is that it is hard to go back and review the class material if you cannot remember a sign. I think this could be improved by recording pieces of class.",
                "Class is super engaging and reminds me of my love for learning; full immersion and the integration of Deaf culture/service projects are huge strengths; Not being able to write down vocab/notes/watch back the class makes it harder to remember all the vocab we've learned which is a definite weakness",
                "This class reaches far beyond the classroom in engaging students in service projects. This is a definite plus!\r\nSome assignments were a bit vague in directionality which was a little tough, but all instructors were easy to contact.",
                "I do not think there is anything that needs to improve in this course. It was very well taught and I really liked my teacher.",
                "The hardest part of this course is the lack of spoken language. I found it challenging at times to learn on my own and even with a tutor, learning was difficult. Not being able to talk to other students in class made it an impossibility to really get to know one's class mates and develop study groups. I think organizing a section or outside meetings is an absolute necessity for success in this coursetutors are not enough practice. The instructor of this course was excellent and she helped me out when I was struggling with learning the language. I met with her on a handful of occasions, exchanged emails, and in each of these interactions a learned a lot. It's my belief that Dr. Rubin is an excellent instructor."

Even though I found that the language wasn't for me, Dr. Rubin was an excellent instructor and took an interest in ensuring her students were engaged with the class and were performing well. The class is fun at the beginning, but later in the semester as vocabulary expands and more rules are taught, the language get much more difficult to learn as there are many signs to memorize and recognize throughout the course. All in all I enjoyed the course."
