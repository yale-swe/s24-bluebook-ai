    "This seminar was all strengths. Jason is an incredible professor and the class was highly engaged. There are no weaknesses, except that we only had 12 weeks together.",
    "The course was really well organized. I liked the novel\/2 movie per week structure and that we did theoretical readings before the two respective sections. I also really liked talking with the author Brian Slattery but wish we had done it earlier in the course so that we could return to what he said.",
    "Strengths: Great syllabus with a good variety of works of different mediums and on different topics. I appreciated that before we engaged with any material we first read some stuff about the intellectual theory of human-caused catastrophe novels. Having this theoretical framework made the discussions better and more interesting."

    "Amazing. Truly a wonderful and unique course. Engaging, fascinating, and really like no other course. If you have the chance, take it!! Also Professor Fitzgerald is awesome.",
    "100% recommend anything taught by Jason Fitzgerald, whether this topic or another. He's a wonderful teacher and he knows how to motivate a class",
    "Human-Caused Catastrophe was an amazing class. We had great discussions of contemporary problems regarding science, military, catastrophe responsibility, climate change, and so much more. Super engaging course.",
    "The course is pretty fascinating. I really enjoyed the books we read, it was a pretty low-stakes and laid back seminar, and Professor Fitzgerald is really nice. It is by no means an exceptional class, but if you are looking to take something out of your comfort zone without feeling too much pressure this is a good option."
