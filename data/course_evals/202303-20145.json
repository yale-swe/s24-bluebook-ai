After a semester, I learned a lot about the language and can hold very basic conversations in French\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the homework were not well-thought-out to facilitate learning (ex. the Defis); the tests were plenty and not well organized (part of the speaking and listening portion were messed up); heavy, heavy workload; textbook can be frustrating sometimes",
                "excellent course, no problems.",

                "The instructor is great ! He really acres about the students and about our learning. The museum activity was amazing. \r\nI consider that one of the weakness of the course are the evaluations in the computer using lingo, we get tested in a very different environment thatn the classroom, with french speakers with different accents, that speak faster, and with counted time to complete a writign and speaking and listening section that does not give time for revisions."
