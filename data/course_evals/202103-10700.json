                "I primarily learned how to look at social science research studies with a new lens. While they would be incomprehensible to me before taking this course, I learned how to weigh causal inference (essentially the process of \"proving\" something in social science) in each piece of research we read. I also learned how to conduct my own study, draw trends based on pre-existing datasets using R and writing detailed literature reviews answering difficult immigration-related questions. Overall, I would describe this class as a crash course in the basics of social science research.",
                "I learned all about causal inference through the lens of immigration and how to evaluate the validity of a study. We discussed the social, political, economic, historical, and psychological effects of immigration, as well as contemporary political issues. I also improved my R skills.",
                "I was able to carefully look at data. When reading many political science papers the research design elements were at times abstract. This course allowed me to better understand data and the differences between correlation and causality.",

Through this course, I gained skills such as how to read through political science studies more efficiently in order to understand research design better, as well as how to utilize R in order to review data sources for information on immigration and public opinion."

            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses: the readings were way too long, the final was completely unreasonable\/unnecessary, the coding expectation was also just way too much in each homework. \r\n\r\nStrengths: James was a great TA.",
                "Strengths: I think its the perfect blend of material to blend, a good amount of R and learning about quantitative methods useful in social sciences",
                "strengths: gained software use knowledge with R and learned how to apply theoretical concepts weaknesses: sometimes fast-paced, expected to complete assignments requiring coding (steeper learning curve for someone who's never coded before)",
                "Strength: Great intro to political experiments!\r\nWeakness: Was very challenging at first (with no experience in R)",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very engaging, the professor and TF spent a fair bit of time outside of the classroom in order to ensure we were grasping the concepts, the readings were interesting, all of the graded material was straightforward if you paid attention in class and grasped the readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were none!",
                "Strengths: Professor Mousa was a great lecturer and is very passionate about the subject matter. While she would sometimes get a bit overexcited and zoom through some lectures, I appreciated her genuine interest. The workload was pretty manageable and I enjoyed working on the problem sets because they combined coding and policy together. Readings were pretty interesting although copious. Weaknesses: In some discussion sections I wondered if we really needed to be there\/if we were actually learning anything. The final paper was a lot of work in a short period of time (one week to write 8-10 pages after reading 100+ pages which were not released until finals week).",
                "The strengths of this course are the ability to look at research design and data differently. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are a few. This course seems to be a direct copy paste from a Stanford course, that was said verbatim by the Professor a couple of times (with slides out of order or dated from previous semesters at a different university) -- the introduction to a brand new coding language (R) was not existing and led to students, or at least me feeling like we're already behind before we've even started. \r\n\r\nThe pace of the lecture was incredibly fast -- lectures recordings were updated not promptly and stored not on the canvas but rather a Stanford cloud. The problem sets were complex with little instruction on how to be successful, the time investment was the highest I've had during any of my undergraduate career. I was also surprised this course did not count as a QR credit considering the volume of the coding involved.",
                "Weaknesses - wish we spent more time learning R in class or section. The P-sets were often challenging to complete given no instruction on how to code in R. The course description said no prior knowledge of the computer language was necessary but think this was misleading given no attention given to coding during class and very little during section.",
                "Professor Mousa's lectures are interesting, and I enjoyed applying what I learned about causal inference to our readings. However, the course as a whole is pretty disorganized, with the content of lectures, sections, and assignments differing greatly from each other. I wish we had learned more R, since our psets mostly tested our skills in R, but we received pretty minimal instruction in it even though we were told we did not need any experience before we took the course. I think sections should be structured to teach students those skills and how to apply them, because our lectures did not cover that.",
                "The strengths of this course are the teaching team, many of the topic discussed, and the reading selections. Professor Mousa presented consistently engaging lectures - comprehensive in the material provided, while encouraging student participation. James, the Teaching Fellow, led excellent discussion sections were students could explore more specific topics or ask questions on the material and the assignments. The diversity of the topics covered in the course were also great - giving students a better understanding of the immigration experience around the world. The readings were also very insightful. There are only two points for improvement. The course focused on research design and methods more that had been suggested in the course description. While this was a great component of the course, perhaps it should have been noted early on. The second point would be on the reading selections. There were often more readings listed than were discussed in lecture or in section. Perhaps it would be better to move a few readings into a \"recommended\/suggested\" section, and focus on select readings for a given week."

                "No. This is one of the worst classes Ive taken at Yale. We spent 0 time in class talking about coding and yet the homeworks were all in R. Despite having some intro to general skills during section, this was not thorough enough to prepare any student for the requirements demanded by the homework. As a class that was advertised to be designed for students that dont know how to code in R or have stats experience, this was a huge disappointment. The midterm grading was harsh and had weird wording that dropped the mean for the class AND the final examination was ridiculous. To expect a 10-12pg research paper done in 5 days during finals period is so unnecessary. Even when this was moved down to 8-10 pages and extended for a couple of days, it just didnt seem necessary to put a time constraint on such a lengthy paper that will undoubtedly be graded harshly. Was just very disappointed with the format of this class even though prof Mousa and James were nice people.",
                "Yea! Its good to learn about actual causal evidence on things that drive immigration attitudes.",
                "Yes! Take it if you are looking to learn about running your own political experiments and analyzing data.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! Although I personally related to it more because I am a child of immigrants, I definitely think this class is important to take for anyone, since immigration is such a salient issue nowadays. In addition to briefly discussing the historical background of immigration policy, this course focuses mainly on modern debates in immigration as it relates to various topics (including the economy and refugees). The coding-based problem sets aren't too bad if you go to office hours and both the midterm and the final are relatively straightforward. If you enjoy thinking analytically about various research studies and talking about how those studies prove various things in the field of immigration, you will love this class!",
                "Yes. Professor Mousa did a great job of combining causal inference, immigration, and coding into one class. I learned so much about different aspects of immigration through fascinating readings about various experiments. I came away from this class with the tools to critically evaluate a study instead of just accepting their findings at face value. I will note that the class was geared to people with no coding experience. Having done work in R previously, I felt that the coding portion was pretty easy and could have been more engaging. But the TA gave lots of assistance to the majority of class who were beginners and I benefited from the review. Professor Mousa did a good job of not making the class overly political and one-sided, as she presented information in a generally unbiased way. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in immigration and causal inference.",
                "No I would not. This course was very difficult, especially if you have no foundation of coding. The class is advertised as a course where no background is required and I would highly advise not to take this course unless you have proficiency with R. The coding problem sets are weighed heavily and this is a course that can easily hurt your GPA. I also think since this course was being taught for the first time, it still needs some honing and polishing.",
                "Maybe yes if you want to learn about the debates in political science about immigration and integration, and you have some experience with R.",
                "I strongly recommend this section to any political science student interested in comprehensive research on immigration policy and public opinion. This course serves as a strong introduction to research design and methods, as well as how to utilize the program R."
