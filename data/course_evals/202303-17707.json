I know it's difficult sometimes to keep up with the pace of a daily class, but I think it works really well for language. I also loved that this class emphasized speaking with classmates! I'm usually really introverted, but I feel like I improved a lot by speaking with a comfortable group. Also loved the asynchronous Fridays :)\r\nWeaknesses: I would maybe recommend adding test corrections as a way to make up for missed points on exams. It helps the students learn more, and it helps our grades too! :)"
