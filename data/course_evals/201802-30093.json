   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength was definitely introducing each part of circuitry\/signals in a well-paced way, and the experiments being well structured to get the most out of each idea. Not many weaknesses within the structure of the course itself",
    "This course was great in that it accommodated the varying schedules of the students taking the course; A weakness is that from time to time, questions would be misunderstood and not sufficiently addressed. However, the positives of the teaching far outweighed the negatives."

    "Yes! If you own a car or a home, or plan to in the future, you should definitely take this course. There are many practical teachings on multimeters, current, resistors, diodes, etc that are quite useful in life."
