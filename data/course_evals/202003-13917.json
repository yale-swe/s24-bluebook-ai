                "A strength in this course was we were able to sometimes collaborate with our peers in order to understand the material. A weakness of this course was the fact that it was online, and so it was difficult to make connections with other students in order to help each other. Additionally, there was a lot of work involved with this class, and so I often found myself approaching the deadline to an assignment and still having a mountain of work to do.",
                "Strengths: great camaraderie among students, well-structured course, pre-class assignments were helpful in getting exposed to the material.\r\nWeaknesses: expectations were a bit confusing at the  beginning in terms of how the professor wanted the work to be done to earn full points.",
                "Sometimes the material was a little hard to grasp during the zoom sessions, or at least how to apply it to the problem sets, but the teacher always had office hours that were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: grading style, professor engagement\/accesibility\r\nWeaknesses: didn't thoroughly explain some topics, didn't stay on topic during lecture, quizzes often didn't match up w taught material",
                "One of the strengths of this course was that there was no \"graded\" tests and that it is a mastery based system, so it wasn't as stressful to get the grade that I wanted. On the other hand, it doesn't keep me as accountable about my grade, and I could feel myself slacking due the the fact that there was no strict grading system.",
                "The weakness of this course is that many people are taking it because they have to. That aside, the course itself was amazingProf. Barnes and the mastery system made it really shine.",
                "The strengths of this course were that grades were determined by mastery standards, so students didn't have to worry about immediately learning a topic. Personally, I preferred a mastery based system over regular grading because you aren't penalized for not fully grasping concepts early on, so you have more time to process the material. Also, office hours with peer tutors are extremely helpful (shoutout to Kexin!) The weaknesses of this course were that sometimes grading wasn't all that clear (I would recommend taking the class with James Barnes given that he determines the structure of all Math 112 classes) and that quizzes sometimes differed from what was taught in class.",
                "Strengths: Multiple attempts to achieve mastery alleviated stress on midterms or finals. P-sets were graded on participation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The mastery system was very confusing and not straightforward, which made knowing our current grade incredibly difficult.",
                "The course layout is very clear and there is lots of transparency regarding how to get the grades you want. I think that the course load was not too much and that homework, class, and preclass assignments were all very manageable but sometimes I just did not feel like I had learned what was being asked of me and when I did make mistakes there was never a clear explanation as to what went wrong.",
                "The strength is that the instructor made himself available to students at many different times and would work with the students to figure out a different time if needed. Something that could be improved is changing how students learn from their attempts at mastering standards. After receiving a score, students would have to directly ask the instructor for each assignment if they wanted to see the correct method of solving. It would have been nice to have had any type of answer key to look over and compare ourselves.",
                "The mastery-based system is a strength in my view! Unfortunately, I felt the class moved much too fast at times.",
                "Nothing this class was great Prof. Barnes is awesome and he really cares about his students.",
                "The mastery system was a definitive strength of the course: it contributed to my collection of calculus skills and wasn't overly stressful. I felt like I would have felt uneccesary pressure and retained less material if it were not a mastery system."

He was understanding of the fact that sometimes we could not make it to class and was open about mental health issues. I also liked how he was flexible about assignments and going to class during election week (something my other professors didn't mention) given that this presidential election was anxiety-inducing especially to students of underrepresented backgrounds.",
                "The professor did an amazing job of respecting the student's time and boundaries. He asked pronouns, gave mental health days, understood that I didn't always want a camera on my face, and that zoom fatigue is very much real. I would say that the student-organized zoom study groups were the most helpful for understanding more than the actual class.",
