                "I learned so much in this course. Aside from helping me work on my German, I learned about the relationship between visuals and audio, about fascist propaganda methods, about German feminism, about Black Germans, Jewish Germans, Turkish Germans, and immigrants, and especially about how social structures come through in works of art. This course totally changed my view of German literature and film in a great way.",
                "I learned to think critically about everything that I watch\/read. I initially didn't understand how details (shadows, perspective etc.) in a movie can be incredibly important to the message of the work itself. The discussions we had were also particularly insightful and frequent. We changed partners every class so I got to hear from everyone in the class.",
                "I became more adept at writing analytically in German and at viewing films and texts of 21st century German canon through different interpretative lenses. I also gained more insight into subversive historical and social narratives of the past century in the German psyche.",
                "I learned how to analytically watch a German movie, and honestly a movie in general as this was new to me."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength to me was the content of the class. Assignment directions and rubrics could be slightly improved",
                "This class was amazing! Hands down one of the best Yale classes I have taken. Every single text we studied was interesting, and Professor Gindner did a great job challenging our thinking without the course being overwhelming. The syllabus was clearly very carefully designed. Professor Gindner also put a lot of time and effort into providing us each with clear feedback and regularly met with us for 30-45 min to discuss our projects\/papers. I also liked how often we spoke in smaller groups and our assignments were always very reasonable, fun, interesting, and valuable. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that I would change would be to have a clearer, consistent syllabus and schedule, because I was often confused about assignments\/expectations.",
                "Frau Dr. Gindner is the chief strength of this course. She would have us do physical exercises before class so we could focus, something I think other classes would do well to do. She also assigned a manageable workload throughout the semester. Her scholarship and guidance really opened up a new world for me. She gave me a new perspective on German and world literature and film through her carefully selected works and projects. She taught me how to be critical (but not cynical) about social structures and what we take for granted. She brings such expertise to the classroom, and it was really valuable learning from her. My one suggestion for improvement would be to have the course materials posted a little earlier after each class so it is easy to access them to do homework at any time.",
                "Strengths: Small class with many opportunities to contribute. Engaging material and a variety of ages. Many different movies\/texts - you can choose a specific one for a project if another one doesn't speak to you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much work on vocab and grammar.",
                "The weekly discussion posts were an excellent way to prepare and engage with the material before class. However, I wish there was more opportunity for discussion outside of class, e.g more group viewings or projects."

                "Yes, absolutely! I consider myself 1000% more familiar with German\/transnational literature and film",
                "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE !!! I cannot recommend enough. It is super interesting if you have any interest in film \/ media studies or German history, and Professor Gindner is incredible. Would definitely recommend if you're taking a heavier workload, as the workload is pretty evenly spaced and not too bad (probably 3-5ish hours per week depending on the homework, and 3 main projects that were evenly spaced).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. We always get one form of German history, and it so often overlooks so many perspectives, including those of Black, queer, and Turkish-Germans. If you want to watch great movies and read great poems and really deepen your understanding of social structures (in Germany and even in the USA), you should definitely take this course. It is lots of fun, and I learned so much.",
                "Yes. Much of this class was based around discussions with peers. The workload isn't incredibly high, but the topics covered are interesting and you'll definitely find more than a few works you really enjoy."
