                "I can't really think of any weaknesses. I really, really enjoyed the course. Sam was super receptive to feedback and the kindest professor during this pandemic semester. Genuinely one of the best teachers I've ever had. I think the course itself could be improved only at the level of the WGSS department  since FQ Theory is required for the major, those WGSS professors with the power to shape the major should seriously rethink their exclusive commitment to North American and European feminist thought. This is an issue that just adding a class or two per semester on non-'Western' feminist theory wouldn't resolve. The classes like Feminist and Queer Theory that are foundational to the major should set the precedent.",
                "The only weakness of the course was the ratio of readings to class time, as we often ran out of time to discuss all of our readings. All other aspects of the course were strong.",
                "The course's biggest weakness is the breadth of information that must be covered. This can also be a strength  Professor Huber successfully chose texts that could be read in conversation with one another, regardless of their publishing date. I liked that the course, in this way, could reject a completely chronological history. Because of this, it would be unfortunate to split the course into different time periods. However, it might be good to offer follow-up iterations of  the course which focus on more specific themes or time periods.",
                "very engaging for a zoom class! i think the format went pretty well and I generally enjoyed the readings quite a lot. however, there were certain readings i had a lot of difficulty with, especially since i had never taken a feminist or queer theory class before, so maybe if we spent a little more time summarizing more difficult readings before leaping into discussion that would have been helpful",
                "The readings are incredible. The organization of the papers work really well, too: the midterm paper focuses on a few readings in conversation, while the  final paper allows us to apply the readings to a real-world case study. Although the course explicitly focuses on American, British, and some French theory, I would have appreciated some context on thinkers from other parts of the world."

                "I enjoyed how, at the start of class, we all went around and shared how we were doing and one thing we wanted to discuss about the readings. Professors should always check in on their students, especially during this time. A sense of community and care is more essential than ever for virtual engagement.",
                "I don't know if this was used specifically for the pandemic, but the student presentations and outlines were very helpful, both from the perspective of the presenter and the audience. Some classes that I have been in have overused breakout rooms, but this class used them appropriately in order to facilitate discussion.",
                "I thought the virtual seminar format worked really well for this class. The short presentations were a great way to keep us engaged with the readings. Breakout rooms were generally effective, and helped us feel like a community even if we weren't together in person."

                "Well, it is required for the WGSS major, but I would recommend to non-majors because other academic programs\/departments here don't exactly engage closely enough with feminist and queer theory. Also, Sam is incredible and brilliant (!!!!!!!!!!!) and you will feel respected and cared for.",

                "Yes, I recommend this course wholeheartedly to anyone interested in expanding their understanding of the historical development of feminist and queer theory. I only wish I had taken this class earlier! As someone totally new to feminist\/queer academics, this class reconfigured my analytical worldview on a weekly basis (a fancy way of saying that the readings blew my mind) and has totally changed the way I approach academic and critical thinking in the humanities generally. While I know this class is taught by a different professor each time it's given, I have to give special thanks to Professor Huber, who was absolutely wonderful and committed to helping his students engage with the material. He curated the class so as to be accessible to those new to feminist\/queer theory, for which I am quite grateful, and his readings list, contextualizations of those readings, and especially his insights if you went to him for help writing papers were all marvelously constructive.",
                "yes, sam is great and the content was super interesting",
                "YES! The readings are varied and fascinating. I found myself reflecting on my Feminist & Queer Theory readings while in other classes or reading the news. This course will change your worldview!",
                "I definitely recommend this course! Its quite intellectually engaging and the readings and discussions invite you to ask important questions about society especially with regard to gender and sexuality. Be warned though, youll be left with many questions at the end than you had when you came in  that is a good thing!"
