    "The strengths of the course were that it had particular relevance to today's climate in Germany and in the U.S., and it was very interesting to explore these aspects in a German course setting. I think that the class could be improved through a little more clarity about what is expected for different assignments and, since I really enjoyed reading the book, maybe more reading of books could be an improvement on the class.",
