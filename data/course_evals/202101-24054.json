To teach us more than just the foreign language, Professor Lopez engaged each of the students by using interesting methods and mediums (e.g., podcasts, movies, art, cultural research projects, etc. and not just the daily textbook spelling and grammar. She also honed our abilities to listen, speak, and write in Spanish."

Talking to everyone in the class made it much more interesting and Im glad to have improved my Spanish through a lot of practice situations and talking exercises. A weakness would be the lack of help before tests and not really getting a full idea of what tests will be like.",
                "I think bi-weekly spanish lunch tables within the class could be a great option to help us develop our spanish speaking skills. One thing that lacked this semester was that inperson talking aspect and a lunch every other week that is encouraged by allowing that as a skip for doing homework that day could be a great option to practice our speaking.",

Each week, she chose fascinating resource materials and mediums to teach Spanish language as well as bits of culture of different Spanish-speaking cultures. Using parts of podcasts, music, artwork, short stories, and history (in class discussions and homework assignments) provided important and interesting context for daily homework and learning of the language. Professor Lopez's caring manner and style also made it easier to talk and engage in class!\r\n...Also, a super minor thing: it could be a tiny bit more clear which document is meant to be completed if multiple documents have similar file names in the Canvas page for this SPAN 140 section. :)\r\n\r\n...One weakness (not related to Professor Lopez's section!) would be the length/difficulty of the \"Semana __ Tarea __\" homework assignments which are assigned by the SPAN 140 Umbrella/overall course page on Canvas."

                "The small group discussions facilitated through the breakout room feature on Zoom were really helpful in maximizing our Spanish-speaking skills in class. Additionally, the group writing sessions each day were also helpful in improving writing skills. I think, in this case, the virtual format actually benefitted us greatly because we received edits and suggestions on our writing in real-time, and within the first month of the course, I was writing more dramatically correct and efficiently than I ever have in Spanish. The course was very well adapted to the online format, more so than most of my other courses.",
