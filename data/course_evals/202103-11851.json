Going into a math class this semester was daunting at first considering that I had not taken a math class for over a year, however, I felt that I was really able to take this class with ease. I believe that it will set the foundation for the different-level math courses in the future.",

I also would have liked to have had more practice in class and done more worksheets myself so that i could see whether I understood.",

However, for several weeks it felt more like a lecture, where the professor would just talk and the students would just listen. But getting to the end of the semester, the professor started giving ungraded in class try problems that made me feel more engaged in the class.",
                "I believe that there could have been more ways that the class could have been engaging. Many times the chalk and chalkboard lecture was very unhelpful when trying to learn difficult math concepts. Moreover, I wish there was a way in which students had access to the information\/material being taught before lecture.",
