However, for several weeks it felt more like a lecture, where the professor would just talk and the students would just listen. But getting to the end of the semester, the professor started giving ungraded in class try problems that made me feel more engaged in the class.",

Many times the chalk and chalkboard lecture was very unhelpful when trying to learn difficult math concepts.
