   "comments": [
    "This class goes extremely fast and the professors take a while to get used to with their accents and how fast they speak.  Although I came in understanding a fair amount of spanish, it was definitely a large leap forward with how fast I had to catch on.",
    "Overall good class can't really complain. Maybe we could have done a little more presentations because those were definitely the most challenging.",
    "I think a particular strength is that the entire course was talk in Spanish at all times. I thought that the curriculum was particularly fast in the middle of the semester and wonder if there is a way to even that out a bit.",
    "This course was very successful in its intent of being an immersion environment for students. As a result, it really helped with listening comprehension. Additionally, the course was very successful with going over the grammar learned in previous years of study without spending too much time on the information so that students could feel confident in their base. I found the course to be well organized and cannot think of any major improvements that are needed.",
    "The strengths of this course were the incorporation of short films and daily homework that serves as constant practice of the language. However, I feel as though there should have been more time dedicated to speaking among me and my peers so I could strengthen my casual conversation skills even more.",
    "I think this course does a great job progressing ones Spanish skills.",
    "Strengths: Building fluency\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Definitely can cut down on the workload. A lot of \"busy work.\"",
    "Strength: complete Spanish immersion. \r\nWeakness: lack of diversity and creativity in the curriculum",
    "Improved proficiency in speaking and writing",
    "This is a great course talk really well. It is challenging but also really interesting. Everyone was really engaged in class. This class was so good that I don't have any real ideas on how to make it better except to maybe grade a little more leniently."

    "I would recommend this course. It's so important to learn languages these days, and Spanish in particular is so important in the United States! I thought this class was taught well.",
    "I would recommend this course. It improved my reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension abilities in Spanish.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, it helps your fluency and skill level in Spanish and it isn't too fast to keep up with",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student (especially if they want to improve their listening skills!) However, one must always dedicate some time to the assignments for the course because while they are not super intellectually challenging, they do require some time on the part of the student.",
    "Yes if they wish to improve their Spanish skills.",
    "Yes, if you would like to become fluent.",
    "Yes, really helped improve my Spanish.",
    "Yes, especially if you take it with a great professor like Daz."
