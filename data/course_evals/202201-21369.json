                "Strengths: Rasheed was absolutely amazing!! He made a very open, safe environment for us to discuss and gave us many things to think about (very very insightful). Weaknesses: Sometimes we would go on very long, kind of unrelated tangents that would take up all of class and we didn't get to the plan for the day and kept getting pushed back. Would've loved some more structure and boundaries within the class to ensure we got done what we needed to. Aldo would've appreciated more focus on writing skills (How to write a strong intro and conclusion, how to incorporate quotes tastefully, how to build a strong argument, etc) rather than just focusing on the readings - though that was really good as well.",
                "strengths: welcoming and accepting class environment, great understanding professor\r\nweaknesses: structure of discussions",
                "Strengths: Exposure to intersectional and interdisciplinary work that can inform thought and practice of students from other fields, flexibility in pursuing material with a twist of what interests each student, class direction adapts to interest of students",
                "This course was structured in a very organized manner that facilitated class discussion. I always felt like an active participant in class and learned equally as much from my fellow classmates as I did from the professor. The syllabus covered a broad scope of influential texts whilst also simultaneously not overwhelming me with work. Rasheed was a super kind and understanding professor who was always there for us and greatly enhanced my class experience. The overall workload in terms of assignment was also very manageable and I legitimately enjoyed writing every single essay. I particularly loved the last two papers (the creative project and research paper) as they allowed me to creatively explore subjects that had always fascinated me but still in a constructive manner."

He truly loves the material and cares for his students and their learning experience. Our class would often stay after class for hours at end not wanting to end our discussion of that day's reading material."
