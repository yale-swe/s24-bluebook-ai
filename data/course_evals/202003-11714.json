                "The strength of the course is the p-sets, I would say that are at a difficulty that is both challenging and fun to do. It is also a good way to prepare for exams and to help understand concepts better. Also, there being constant peer tutor hours is really amazing to have, especially when struggling with the content or the p-sets. Something to improve would be the way that students would collaborate this semester. When put into student groups, there were some instances, where it seemed like the other students didn't want to talk and were a bit shy to interact with each other. Along with this, the use of Jamboard was nice to have, but it was disadvantageous for me because I didn't have accessibility to a touch screen device other than my phone.",
                "You learn most of the material through PSETs. The actual lecture quality is completely based on instructor. You get a lot of practice with difficult problems, but there is not a lot of conceptual explanation. This makes the true and false section on exams very difficult. If you are struggling; however, there are a lot of supplementary resources and helpful office hours.",
                "I liked how it was smaller sections rather than a big lecture so we got to work closely with the professor. We did breakout rooms to explore problems together and the teaching fellows were really helpful.",
                "Strengths: my class was very well taught by the legendary Prof. John Hall. The course organization with the pre-class videos and quizzes was very conducive to learning and engaging with the lesson and practice examples during the lecture. The problem sets helped to consolidate the material taught in lecture, and the exams were all very reasonable. The true\/false was often the trickiest part for me. Overall, the workload was very manageable. The grading was fair, and we received quick feedback on our problem sets and exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because the last part of the class was not tested, I felt that I did not retain the information as well. Some more applications throughout the course (and not just with the final projects at the end) would have made the course material more interesting.",
                "I thought that the course was organized well and set up for students to succeed. Lectures were clear, tests were fair, there was ample extra help. No complaints. While pre-class quizzes irked me in the moment they were helpful for giving context to each lecture. I'm not sure a final project really makes sense for a calculus class but I understand that it was created because of COVID and I think it was a good way to even the playing field when our test taking environments were disrupted post-thanksgiving break.",
                "I found the lectures to be quite clear and helpful--the main thing that made that made engagement difficult was the online aspect of the class.",
                "Perhaps the greatest strength of this course was that it was very well organized. Problem sets were posted at the beginning of each week, and the content of each of the week's lectures (as well as the textbook chapters in which they could be found) were posted ahead of time. This organization made it much easier for me to learn and study the course material efficiently. The class was also structured in a discussion format, and this provided students with ample time to pose questions. Professor Hall was also an excellent instructor. \r\n\r\nI think the course would be improved if students were sent out to break-out rooms to discuss math problems more frequently. Several times over the course of the semester, Professor Hall placed practice exercises on a Google Jamboards document, and sent students to break-out rooms to discuss the problems collaboratively. These exercises were very constructive for me, and I wish we had done this more often.",
                "Strengths are that you learn the material pretty comprehensively and there are a lot of example problems. Weaknesses are that it is pretty low engagement and the videos and class time felt a little bit redundant at times, although it was nice to get lots of example problems",
                "The weekly readings and Psets could have been slightly shorter. Make the weekly reading quiz longer but not count for a grade and have an explanation for when we get them wrong.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Breadth of topics: Even if one area chapter isn't your forte, there is a wide enough range of topics to compensate your interest (and grade!). \r\n-Video lessons: I appreciated Professor Hall's commitment to consistently uploading videos which previewed the topics covered in class. Thus, class could be used to discuss questions and review example problems. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Inconsistent quality of instruction: Between sections, there was a great discrepancy between quality of teaching. Some sections (like those who had the course director as professor) were provided ample examples of good quality. Other sections were left, basically, to figure out much of the material on their own. Admittedly, this is an introductory-level course, but nevertheless deserves a higher overall quality of instruction. \r\n-Material covered throughout the class felt rather scattered across a jumble of topics. I felt limited continuity between the subjects, and the professor made very minimal attempt to outline the \"bigger picture,\" so to speak. I come away from this class knowing isolated pockets of information, but to a limited extent the \"bigger picture\" of multivariable calculus. \r\n-Limited intuition of 3D objects: The class jumps abruptly into material, and did not allow me to build an intuition of 3D space (with sketches, really deeply understanding how computations applied). I hope future courses allot more time for such intuition-building. \r\n-Confusing and late feedback: Problem sets were oftentimes returned weeks after the due date, and sometimes not until after the relevant test. Although answer keys for those assignments were provided, I would have liked to know what I personally got wrong and what I needed to improve BEFORE the test. Feedback most often did not explain what was wrong clearly and was a source of much confusion for me and other peers who I discussed the material with.",

                "What succeeded in this course would be countless resources offered by this class. If a student puts in the effort, they will succeed. An improvement could be the collaboration of students and the life of the zoom lecture. Whenever I went to a lecture, most of the students had their camera off which made it seem like only a couple of students including me and the professor. A possible solution to this would be to do some activities at the beginning of the course to help the students up to become more comfortable and interested in the course.",
                "I think what succeeded were the videos we had to watch before class, in a way, because it was nice to be able to rewatch videos on topics we were not sure about as an additional resource to the textbook. \r\n\r\nI think the Jamboard was a hit or miss, since sometimes group members were not active.",

                "Successes: pre-class videos and quizzes were super helpful, and they allowed me to really pay attention and understand what was going on in class. The quizzes definitely prevented me from falling behind. The peer tutoring was also very helpful. The tutoring sessions were surprisingly well-organized and not chaotic over Zoom. The 3 exam format (and no final) was nice.\r\n\r\nFailures: it was a little more difficult to stay engaged in class on Zoom.",
                "We took three tests proctored via zoom. We had to show the proctor our desks and each sheet of paper we planned to use and then we downloaded the test as a pdf, took it, and uploaded it to gradescope when we were done. The first test was comically mis-run by my zoom group's proctor. He was late to the zoom room, misinterpreted the directions so that we could have easily cheated on the exam and could barely see the pdf of the test because of the angle he made us put our computers, and then couldn't instruct us on where the test actually was online so we started the exam 10+ minutes late. I had a different proctor for the next two tests who was great and everything went smoothly. Clearly there was a learning curve which totally makes sense. If the tests were to continue I recommend that new proctors administrate a practice exam to other 120 instructors to avoid stressful zoom room environments for students. \r\nThe final project was also a new addition so that students didn't have to take a final exam after everyone was sent home post-thanksgiving. I thought this was a good alternative and was designed well. We were all given plenty of support and had the opportunity to get prof feedback at many different points. The only downfall is that math 120 is still a pretty low level math course so the final projects had to have a pretty limited scope.",
                "I thought the asynchronous lectures and quizzes worked well, but it wasn't great in-class when I can't really see or interact with the other people in my class.",
                "Students were expected to watch pre-recorded lectures about math concepts before those concepts were presented in class. Though this practice was time consuming, I believe it was very helpful in making the actual live lectures more productive. \r\n\r\nAlso helpful was the fact that there were many office hours sessions available. \r\n\r\nI do wish, though, that more opportunities for collaborative problem-solving among students were provided (via Jamboards and break-out rooms in Zoom).",
                "Videos were good, peer tutoring hours were also very helpful. Lectures could have either been more interactive or otherwise just recorded.",
                "The video lessons provided by Professor Hall were usually helpful in digesting the week's material. I also appreciated his consistency in uploading the videos on the weekend, so I could get ahead and take more time (if necessary, for, say a harder section). Gradescope, couple with the Canvas site, worked well for submitting assignments with an intuitive interface. Tests over Zoom and submitting via Gradescope, for the same reasons, also provided minimal hassle. However, I think more breakout rooms (depending on the instructor, of course) to compute examples would be a beneficial improvement to make.",

That being said, I would recommend it because knowing calculus is important and multi really isn't a big leap from lower level calc, so you might as well. If you are going to take it, I highly recommend giving preference to the section taught by the course leader (this year John Hall) because they are more likely to cover exactly the material you will be tested on as I think they have a heavy hand in writing the tests.
