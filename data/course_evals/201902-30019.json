    "It is suitable for us.",
    "Something I like about the course is that it combined physics with social science and that it's friendly to non-science major students. Also, the textbook is impressive and well writen. The course could be better if there is a course outline letting us know what we are going to learn in the whole semester.",
    "the course is very interesting.",
    "Everything is fine, especially the field trip, which really strengthens our understanding of the forefront of environmental science.",
    "This course contains a lot of information and knowledge specific to environmental physics, which is informative and useful. The content of this course is not so hard, so the pace of the course is slow in some degree."

    "Yes! This course integrate a multidisciplinary way to access different energy type. Through field trips, we are able to broaden our knowledge in the field of Applied Physics.",
    "Yes, many of the knowledge taught can be regarded as common sense that people would usually neglect, which is good to know",
    "I would because it is a good course to start a science journey and couldn't be boring.",
    "Yes, this is interesting for people who wants to learn the basic things about science.",
    "Yes, because Professor can explain the concept with real-life events, he is also good at answering the questions.",
    "Yes. Humans really have a big impact on the environment. Arousing the awareness of the environmental problem can prompt people to make the world a better place."
