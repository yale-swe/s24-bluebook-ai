                "Overall, everything was good but my only note of improvement is for the section assignments. Most of them were very time-consuming which took away time from actually discussing the material with one another and talking through questions we might have had.",
                "Strengths - engaged professor, good class size, material/assignments are very interesting, everything is approached with a high level of depth, grading is very fair Weaknesses - workload can be a bit overwhelming at times, some of the longer section assignments get a little tedious",
                "I generally enjoyed the course and learned most through sections. I wish wed stuck more to slides and had a systematic form of learning rather than sort of a discussion and asking questions session each class. I also wish there had been less assignments or reading, as they got overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Thompson and her teaching for sure -- she was highly approachable and very accessible with regard to her office hours; the class is set up for students to succeed and was very user-friendly especially for people without a strong background in the field coming into the class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload at times could be a little high with what felt like busy work",
                "Strengths: prof knows a lot, lectures in class with some discussion, good science credit for non-stem, good social science credit for stem \r\nWeaknesses: assignments were confusing, no good format, allowed resubmissions to assignments most people resubmitted because the assignment instructions were unclear.",
                "Strengths:\r\nCertainly the highlight was the section where we made stone tools. The debates were also useful in how they really forced critical thinking about the conclusions in these scientific articles, especially because different sides of the debate would often use papers by the same person.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome of the assignments, especially the take homes, could be unclear. The section assignments were often too long. I think it would be more efficient if the sections worked in smaller groups instead of the entire class being divided into two groups for the sorting activities."

                "Yes, if you're looking for a good science credit",
                "I would, if you have a genuine interest in the subject or in how to approach scientific arguments. I found some of the exercises we did in critiquing evidence, evaluating different causal claims, etc. to be very interesting, and broadly applicable skills outside of the specific anthropology context. The debates were a fun element as well. Engaging with new science and its implications was also interesting, and when class discussion was engaged (it wasn't always) it was very interesting. That being said, do not take this course if you are just interested in the science credit. The workload can be intense at times (think three presentations, debates, weekly section assignments, readings, several long-form essays, etc.) None of it is particularly difficult, but it is a lot, so be prepared. That said, the subject is interesting and Professor Thompson is clearly very passionate about what she does.",
                "Yes, its a great science credit for a non science major. Just be prepared for a lot of work.",
                "Absolutely, the no-exam aspect of the course makes it super doable for a non-stem non-anthro major. Though the workload is high, I felt as though the lack of exams made it worth it, as I felt I was learning for myself, not for the sake of doing well on an exam. Beyond this, Dr. Thompson is super passionate about the field, which made the class super enjoyable even for someone with not the highest interest level in the subject.",
                "Yes if you are nonstem looking for science cred, no if you want a gut course",
                "A more accurate if less catchy title for the class would be something like \"Intro to methods in paleoanthropology.\" There's much more uncertainty about human evolution than I realized before the class, which can make the class a bit frustrating but also interesting in its own way. New discoveries overturn previously held consensus, and the same debates have been ongoing for decades. If you have a background in history it might seem like the amount of justification offered by any theory is really low compared to times when we have written sources, and we're just groping in the dark when it comes to people so ancient. Professor Thompson really puts a lot of emphasis on recent scholarship which can help alleviate the sense of aporia. Nevertheless, it's there, lurking in the background.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly courses that would give you a science credit with less work, especially writing, if that's what you're looking for. But at the very least you'll actually learn things in this class, and you'll get practice in reading scientific papers efficiently."
