                "Strengths - professor, interactive classroom, useful TA\r\nWeaknesses - My section was a bit too big which made speaking difficult.",
                "The Chinese professors give great feedback on individualized strengths and weaknesses so that we can improve. This semester, we were not able to talk a lot in class so it was harder to be engaged and practice our speaking skills."

The student participation could have been improved by using more breakout rooms, but the students were actually engaged much better than in some of my other classes because they were called on regularly.",
