                "I learned a tremendous amount about not only Yiddish as a language, but the culture, history, and politics of the language from its very conception to how it exists as a live language today.",
                "Thanks to Prof. Price and this amazing course, I have developed a deep understanding of the Yiddish language, Ashkenazi culture, and the cultural richness of the Jewish diaspora. Looking back on what has been a wonderful semester, I am amazed at how much Yiddish I have learned. I can now read complex, modernist poetry in the original Yiddish! I can read whole newspaper articles and children's books. All after only one semester! This course has given me a much deeper understanding of the cultures, politics, and geographies which shaped my family and the modern Jewish world. But most of all, this course is so much fun!!! Prof. Price's dedication seeps into everything we do in the classroom. In this class, I have made friends and memories which will last for a lifetime!",
                "I learned a lot about Yiddish literature, Yiddish history, Yiddish humor, the area of Williamsburg, life, and how to speak conversational Yiddish.",
                "I can speak, read, and write Yiddish at a basic level, and I am familiar with a variety of texts from Yiddish press, literature, and song."

                "The class is genuinely so enjoyable to be a part of. Professor Price is engaging with the class and makes it very rewarding to learn such a great language.",
                "Strengths - Verbal and written practice, regular feedback, communication\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - clarity on what we ought to learn vs what is good to know but doesn't need to be actively studied, vocabulary",
                "This course is strong in every way. One develops Yiddish proficiency at an astonishing pace, but without having to sift through a huge textbook. Prof. Price uses a wide range of material from socialist campaign posters to Hasidic children's literature to introduce his students to this fascinating language. The small class size creates a tight knit community dedicated to Yiddish learning and Yiddish fun. Prof. Price goes out of his way to facilitate this community, sponsoring Yiddish-themed parties and events. No notes!",
                "The biggest strength of the course is BY FAR Josh Price. He cares so much about teaching Yiddish and every class felt like a fun adventure. The class does an amazing job of fostering community between students, too, which made practicing a lot more fun. Class never felt dull or boring, and I never felt put on the spot. The only \"weakness\" of the class is the amount of homework. It is a lot of work and I found myself wishing we could have some nights off, but the professor was receptive to hearing that and was always accommodating. The homework was a strength itself, though, as the assignments are very creative and often collaborative. Unlike some other classes where things feel like busywork, he spent a lot of time giving constructive feedback on every piece of homework submitted which also made it feel worth it."

                "I cannot recommend this course more. I am not exaggerating when I say that signing up for this course was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have learned so much more in the span of a semester than I thought was possible and made so many close friends. This course single handedly encouraged me to pursue a Jewish Studies major, but it is open and accessible for all. In fact, the average major in my year was Astrophysics! I cannot emphasis enough how special the Yiddish community at Yale is. We are the only L1 language course at Yale that I know of which regularly hosts its own social events to sing and dance to Yiddish music, teach others about the Yiddish language, and speak the language in our free time!",
                "I would absolutely, 100%, undoubtedly, for sure recommend taking Yiddish here. When else are you gonna have the chance?? It is truly an incredible opportunity we have to take it for credit, and with such a wonderful instructor and community. The class is challenging and there is a lot of work but it is not stressful, and that makes a huge difference. After bad experiences in previous language courses, this felt like a breath of fresh air where language learning actually became fun. I can't recommend it highly enough!!"
