                "I wish there would have been more student discussion, especially from the readings.",
                "Strengths: The course reviews so many important revolutionary moments worth knowing the background about. I loved that we didnt talk just about the reasons why a revolution occurred, but specifically looked at its relationship to space and the city where it unfolded, and also often discussed how art was used in each. Weaknesses: The only drawback I think would be that there wasnt as much seminar discussion time as I would have hoped, but Prof. Plattus has so much fascinating knowledge to share that you barely notice.",
                "Because each seminar was a case study of a different city (sometimes a few), movement, or historical moment, it sometimes felt like a new class every week. Lack of continuity could be seen as a weakness, but also allowed us to go in depth and explore different movements based on direction of class discussion. Combination of history and theory (mostly spatial analysis and some architectural theory) was a definite strength."
