The material wasn't very cohesive, we kept jumping back and forth chronologically and switching between different topics. Each week felt very self-contained and the material didn't really build on itself over the course of the semester. I think I could have gotten a lot more out of the class if the course syllabus had been organized chronologically or if the material had been more clearly grouped thematically.",

                "The course was a good balance of discussions, readings, and papers. I like how at least 30% of our grade is based on participation and discussion posts. There could have been a little more guidance of what the professor was looking for in a presentation or paper, especially because that was such a big part of our grade."

                "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in Russian history and has a strong background in the field. Some of the readings are really interesting but some are on fairly niche topics. Also, the syllabus bounces around between a lot of different topics and time periods over the course of the semester, which made it difficult to build on previous readings\/discussions in each week's class. Overall, though, the class discussions were pretty interesting and engaging.",
                "Yes. The course is definitely rigorous, but if you have an interest in Russian history, I highly recommend the class.",
