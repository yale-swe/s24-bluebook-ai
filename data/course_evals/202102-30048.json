In addition to the core material covered in this course, Dr. Parr was keen to include relevant historical\/practical applications of the content, especially in Biochemistry.",

                "I didn't love the way the material was presented with slides I liked how Dimeglio did it first session much more.",
                "Parr is an excellent instructor; however he did veer off topic a little. I would also try to arrange the course material in a way that was grouped together by topics (e.g. not jumping from reversible to non reversible reactions) and such. Also he often went over time which was a bit annoying considering we had section three times a week right after class.",
                "The discussion sections are extremely helpful and the teachings staff is very involved",
                "Went really fast but it was over the summer. I wish that we could have focused more on the actual content we needed to know sometimes.",
                "The course is extremely fast paced, but it is organized well to promote adequate learning and engagement.",
                "The course was well-organized and well-taught. The fast pace is somewhat nauseating at times (especially at the end of the semester) -- it's really different than any other undergraduate academics you've had -- but the flexibility of recorded lectures made this more manageable. You did have to attend lectures on MWF to be able to participate in the following discussion section, but this shouldn't be a problem for most people. Professor Parr is nothing short of a fantastic lecturer. He is knowledgeable, kind, and very open to student questions. He would often stay late in office hours to work with students who were struggling to understand certain concepts before an upcoming exam. His exams were very fair, in my opinion, and the averages reflected this. If you put the time in going to lectures\/section, doing the daily practice problems, and utilizing the textbook, you were certainly going to do well. The only weakness I can really think of was the lack, at times, of additional homework\/practice problems. I know it may sound masochistic, but success in organic chemistry is heavily dependent on practice practice practice. The daily problems were excellent for this, I just wish there were more of them. The book problems he assigned were good, but not always relevant, as the exam questions often took different forms than emphasized in the book.",
                "I thought the technology use was lacking in this course.",
                "Strengths: I found the lectures to be quite engaging and also enjoyed the participation-based daily questions, which made the course less stressful on a day-to-day basis. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not find the discussion sections to be helpful\/engaging, particularly in the virtual format.",
                "This course was organized, despite moving extremely fast. It was interesting and the information was split up in a coherent, organized manner. The problem-solving sessions provided opportunities to work through challenging problems with other students which was very helpful. It could be improved by offering additional practice problems that were not from the book after each chapter that were more similar to exam style questions. These were only given in the context of practice exams and I think having them after each chapter would make studying easier.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are on the pre-med track and NEED it.  Professor Parr is great, but the course is extremely difficult and time consuming.  I did like the summer session set up and would recommend it to someone if they do not want to sit a full semester of organic chem during the school year.",
                "Yes, I took organic chemistry on the off-cycle to avoid the traditional and often discredited lecturers for this sequence. I was very happy with this decision. Both semesters were well-taught, interesting, and fair courses. Parr went above and beyond my expectations, and I sincerely hope I have an opportunity to take another class with him. I would recommend this class to any student who needs the Orgo II prereq and wants to avoid the misery possible with other professors.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would suggest taking this course during the regular school year as opposed to the summer; the course material does not lend itself well to being condensed into 5 weeks and needs more time to process\/integrate. The 5-week course was quite intense, and I wish I had more time to spread out the burden.",
                "I would recommend taking this course over the summer because you can concentrate solely on it, without having to worry about other subjects. However, it is significantly harder than Orgo 1 and difficult to balance with the lab course on top of it. Be prepared to work really hard as the pace of the course is insane.",
                "Yes, the teaching was very clear, the class was well organized, and the teaching staff genuinely wanted the students to succeed."
