This class has expanded my knowledge about issues in Latin America, especially in socio-political spheres. I loved the projects in the class which allowed me to study more about my own culture as I learned about issues from other Latin American countries."

There is a lot of small work for this class, but this helps you not lose the knowledge. Helpful feedback is also returned very quickly.",

                "Very good course",
                "Strengths: The class is structured into little groups where 2-4 students help each other complete various activities, from translation exercises or recounting the previous night's reading or video. This allows for all students to uplift each other and creates a strong sense of comradery between students.\r\nWeaknesses: Although I enjoyed watching videos and movies for homework, the class could incorporate more media in the class itself. We could watch clips as a whole to introduce a new topic and write about different interpretations or opinions on the topic."
