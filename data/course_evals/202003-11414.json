While I agree with this sentiment somewhat, I don't think my writing changed in the way I thought it would. I don't believe this class improved my grammar\/writing structure, but it did alter the way I support my arguments. I think Professor Robinson was very skilled in getting students to break free from the so-called \"template\" writing that was learned in high school. He really helped me focus on a single argument and support it fully without veering from the topic at hand, which was extremely helpful.",
                "How to analyze different pieces of literature related to censorship, how to structure different types of academic essays",
                "I learned a lot about what is important in writing. We focused less on the small things like font\/margins and more on the core of the essay like the thesis and the support. There was a huge emphasis on having a corrective and contestable claim. We wrote papers that discussed ideas from readings. Some papers were structured more as research papers."

                "The strength of this course is that Professor Robinson gives you timely and helpful feedback to your paper, which means that you are able to improve your first draft. He also pays lots of attention to individual students, via commenting and meeting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Robinson provides extremely clear feedback on each essay you submit for this class. I think the practice of submitting a draft before getting a final grade helped to strengthen my writing and the final quality of the paper because it allowed us to make corrections without receiving any penalty. I also liked the size of the class, as it really forced people to chat about the topics in an environment that wasn't too intimidating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though minor, I felt that sometimes Prof. Robinson talked a little too much, and it was a little difficult to add your insight into the conversation without feeling like you were interrupting him. I think we actually had some classes where each student only spoke for about 10 seconds. While this was a little comforting\/sheltering if you had nothing important to say\/skipped a reading or two, it would have been more beneficial to be forced to talk and critique each other. I think the only improvement I would make to this course is the addition of some time for students to converse with each other instead of conversations with just Prof. That said, I'm not sure what this class would be like in person, but this is what I felt over Zoom.",
                "The main strength of this course is definitely Professor Robinson. While all of the 114 sections teach similar writing techniques, Professor Robinson makes the class environment laid back and welcoming for all, which I really enjoyed. He is also always willing to meet outside of class to discuss essay topics and feedback on drafts, which I also found especially useful. Overall, definitely recommend this section--no real weaknesses I can think of!",
                "I appreciated how this was a small course that allowed me to be engaged with the professor and my classmates. \r\n\r\nThere was a little more reading than I anticipated but it was not horrible."

                "Yes. As a pre-med student, it's often necessary to take ENGL 114, and honestly, compared to what my friends mentioned about their sections, Prof. Robinson's class was far more laid back, and Prof. Robinson was more understanding and compassionate towards his students. I think this is a low stress class focused on discussion of weekly readings and a couple essays   not much more than that. The structure of this class was a nice pairing with some heavier courses that may be less focused on individual students.",
                "Yes, if they can take it with Professor Robinson! I think 114 in general really depends on the professor teaching the section, but taking it with Professor Robinson was definitely enjoyable. It's a relatively low-stress way of learning about important writing techniques and getting a WR credit. The main topic (censorship) is also especially relevant in today's political climate, which to me was an added bonus.",
