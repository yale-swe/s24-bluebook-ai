The lab reports were formatted poorly and graded terrible. The format of the lab reports make it difficult to even begin writing the lab reports. The grading was so sporadic because they are is not a single system used to grade the lab reports. There is of course a \"rubric\" but there is no guidance on why there are points taken off. Fix this.",

The labs introduced new laboratory techniques which were interesting, but the majority of my time in this course was spent writing lab reports. The lab reports were tedious and often superfluous, and points would be subjectively deducted for irrelevant errors like inconsistent formatting or including too much information. Grading standards were inconsistent between different TFs. Expect to spend four to six hours outside of lab each week doing prep for lab and writing lab reports. While you will learn things during lab, you will not learn much writing the lab reports.",

                "The experiments chosen by the teaching team were good. They covered a wide range of topics in chemistry. Additionally, the lab reports (especially the questions) were insightful and improved my understanding of the course. The course was well organized. However, there are some weaknesses. There seems to be an inconsistency in the ways TFs grade. I had emailed one TA (not my specific one) about a grade, and the dispute was never resolved. As I compare with other classmates, there seems to be a variety of ways in which TF's differ in awarding and deducting points. Consistency should be better.",
                "This course should be worth a full credit because of the amount of time spent and the workload is equal to any full credit course.",
                "There are no strengths to lab. Weakness were mention previously",
                "Strengths: hands on , only one day a week, reasonable length lab reports, great TAs, lots of office hours\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lots of work to prepare for class (1 hr+ lecture and pre lab quiz) in addition to lab reports due on same day, harsh grading of reports",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Lab itself was pretty interesting, if over-structured at times\r\n- TA (Steve) was great\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Labs were pre-designed and required little to no engagement\r\n- Reports were similar; busy work which were tedious and often frustrating, but not particularly insightful.",
                "The class should be made more interesting and the lab reports should be less frequent and less tedious, they make chemistry not fun.",
                "Strengths: good TAs. \r\nWeaknesses: horrible professor, mundane tasks, not exciting content. Quizzes and lab reports were often arbitrarily graded, and when a systematic issue was pointed out to the professor, he just corrected one students grade, while not notifying anyone else in the class",
                "The lab reports feel like busywork intended to make students lose points. Aside from learning how to write an abstract, I learned very little in the dozens of hours I spent writing lab reports this semester. The points I lost on lab reports (which make up most of the grade) were generally from formatting errors or technicalities unrelated to my understanding of big concepts. It seems useless to have such an emphasis on perfection in an introductory course taken primarily by non-chem majors. Why does a cohort of mostly premeds (and other life science people) need to write a perfect lab report for the standards of a chemistry journal? I think the format of CHEM 222L with more flexible post-lab assignments would be more conducive to learning. (Also, why is it only half a credit?)",
                "The strengths are the experiments, they are enjoyable and interesting. The weaknesses are the lectures we have before the experiment, they don't always explain well how the experiment is linked to the concept we are learning. Also the amount of work and time put into the course is the same as my other courses. THIS SHOULD BE A FULL CREDIT, NOT HALF.",
                "This course is very helpful in teaching you how to structure a lab report by using basic experiments. However, the Prelabs for this class were not good and often received low grades if you made a mathematical error. TFs for this course are a key resource.",
                "strengths: lab reports good length, prelab videos good\r\nweaknesses: more freedom in procedure\/developing procedure\r\nimproved: more connections to everyday applications",
                "It was very clear what we had to do. I think that there should be a seminar on how to write up lab reports, at the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths are the lab TAs, and the weaknesses are the long and tedious lab reports. The rubrics needs to be adjusted for more room for error.",
                "The course was set up well where it was clear what was going to be done in lab, however some labs took longer than they needed to. One weakness of this course was that new graders graded the lab reports every week. This meant that each grader was looking for different formats and details so it was difficult to make improvements and see if you did so correctly because a new grader wouldn't have the same thoughts.",
                "Weakness- hard grading with little explanation",
                "This course could be more clear on how the lab reports should be in the forefront with examples of abstracts and conclusions. They did that later on in this course, but I think a session on proper lab reports would be helpful for a student not to be surprised with their lab report grades.",
                "The grading is very subjective and unpredictable. A different TA graded my lab report each time, so the number of points taken off varied greatly.",
                "Very interactive, but pre-lab videos are too long. I think the pre-lab videos can be more interactive.",

                "This class managed to be difficult and boring at the same time. I feel that requiring this specific course even for those in Advanced Gen Chem with lab experience is a mistake.",
                "Strengths: the course is well organized with clear expectations. It gives a valuable hands-on component to complement the material taught in general chemistry lecture. The grading seems harsh during the semester, but you can get many points deducted and still end up with 100% in the class. Weaknesses: lack of clarity around grading expectations throughout the semester. Lab reports were very prescribed and scripted. Grading consists only of online pre-lab quizzes and semi-weekly lab reports. The grading of lab reports does not contribute to learning, as you are not rewarded for demonstrating knowledge of core concepts given significant points are taken off for minuscule errors like sig figs and typos. Dr. Parr can be condescending and hard to approach, though your TA is a great resource.",
                "Lab didnt take up all four hours that are allotted for chem 134L which was amazing. I am very glad the labs covered werent too complicated and didnt take too much time. \r\nThe lab reports were very tedious and sucked a lot of time out of my week. They were effective at teaching me how to summarize what was done in the experiment in a scientific paper tone, but taking the calculations I already did and typing them into a computer was pretty monotonous.",
                "The strengths of this course are the exciting material and genuine hands on learning. The course could be improved by having shorter meeting times.",
                "The course is a great introduction on how to do lab work and some of the experiments we conducted were actually quite fun. I do think that this course only being 0.5 credits is misleading because the lab time is 4 hours, the prelab lectures and quiz can take up to an hour and a half, and a report is due almost every week. If I had known this class would be this intensive, I might have reconsidered doing 5 credits during my first semester. In my opinion, this class should be at least 1 credit.",
                "This class was really helpful in the way that it illustrated a lot of the concepts we were learning in gen chem lecture. It was also great to get to be in a lab for the first time. I think the biggest weakness is just that the lab reports are a lot of busy work because you can lose points for very small details.",
                "Strengths: The experiments are pretty cool to carry out\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The inconsistent grading because there was not a standard that the TAs were following, so one's grade on the lab reports are very dependent on which TA is grading them.",
                "The strength of this course was that I felt well-prepared to come to lab and perform the experiment due to the pre-lab being posted. However, the work that this class required is equivalent to greater than 0.5 credit hours.",
                "Grading clarity could be improved in this course. The rubrics were not always explicit nor were they detailed enough to gain the necessary knowledge to receive a high mark. However, this course did allow for students to gain a hands on laboratory experience.",
                "It was a great class overall.",
                "I thought that this course was a good intro chem course",
                "The strengths of this class was that the pre-recorded lectures were good starters to stepping into the lab with already learned techniques and knowledge. The lectures were helpful in the fact that they introduced the math and concepts behind what we would be performing once we arrived at the lab as well. The course also made all of the lab and lab reports independent which made it a great environment to learn from mistakes.",
                "The strengths of this course were the clear instructions given for the pre-lab lecture, the lab manual, and lab reports. Prior to each lab, the professor provided a lab manual and a pre-lab lecture that provided a thorough, straightforward explanation of the lab that we would be doing. This made it very easy to prepare for lab and know exactly what was expected of us to do ahead of time. Some weaknesses of the course were little to no engagement with the actual professor during the class. We solely interacted with our TF and almost never saw the main professor assigned to the class. I wish that the professor would have been more involved in the experiments aside from simply walking around and supervising the TFs. Another weakness was the weekly lab quiz. While the quiz was relatively easy and tested material from the lab manual and pre-lab lecture, sometimes it included random, unrelated questions. The two attempts were super helpful; however, I would suggest shifting the material to a more directly related lab procedure, such as safety precautions and specific steps. Finally, a major weakness was the subtraction of points from each weeks lab report for no apparent reason. TFs would take off numerous points for significant figures and I had to fight tooth and nail to get points back that were taken off for arbitrary reasons. Most students were discouraged and never sought feedback on why the points were taken off. In the end, there was such a huge curve that the few points lost hardly mattered; however, I found it quite frustrating.",
                "Strengths: Very supportive TFs, a lot of office hours and chances to ask questions, prelab lectures were usually clear (and explained the chemistry concepts behind the lab), never felt rushed in the lab.\r\nWeaknesses: Different TFs give different explanations at the start of lab, which means that students in different sections are prepared differently for the labs, Dr. Parr would sometimes assume knowledge we didn't have (Ex: in the second experiment's prelab, he named a bunch of types of reactions I hadn't heard of).",
                "Dr. Parr was amazing at always being supportive and helping us to advance our knowledge--his office hours were invaluable for me, and he always responded to emails in a quick and timely manner. The experiments themselves were intriguing, and the chemistry behind them was well-explained. However, there were many instances when the experiments did not line up with the material described in CHEM 161, which was a little confusing. Being able to line the curricula of these two courses might help facilitate learning for others in the future!",
                "It helped me to understand basic chemistry concepts and how they can be done in the lab\r\nWeakness- it is tiring!",
                "Strength: Helps those of all science backgrounds get acquainted with basic lab skills (in the lab procedure and class grading)\r\nWeakness: Subjectivity of grading",
                "Strengths: Grading was fair, overall. Professor ensured that students were adequately prepared for each experiment by providing prelab lecture and quiz. \r\nWeaknesses: Prelab lectures didn't always prepare students for the prelab quizzes and were quite lengthy.",
                "This course not only gave me the opportunity to explore certain scientific questions, but it showed me the reasons why. Understanding the reasons behind each experiment made my time in the lab more meaningful. My teaching assistant was also very willing to help during my time in the lab.",
                "Many of the labs seem quite pointless, more advanced labs are desired.",
                "I think that this course is organized really well. I appreciated being divided into smaller sections and having a TA who was able to devote a lot of her attention to me!",
                "The experiments were well constructed and assisted in my understanding of the content from the general chemistry lectures.",
                "The strengths of this class were that it prepared you for future lab classes and was pretty basic and understandable for those with little experience in chemistry labs. The weaknesses were that the degree of accuracy to which the lab reports were held seemed to vary between graders, with some TFs possibly taking off more points for smaller mistakes than others. Additionally, some of the questions on the lab reports were not phrased very clearly, causing me to have to ask friends and TFs for help often, which is not a problem in itself, but made the lab reports take a very long time to complete. Since I was trying not to get points taken off for mistakes, I was spending more time on work for lab than I was for some of my 1 credit classes. I think that this could be improved by having more in-person office hours or group lab report work sessions with the TFs there to help answer questions, because it would be easier to ask questions as they come up.",
                "The course is very good at allowing us to interact with scientific knowledge and experimental skills through hands-on activities.",
                "One strength was the level of hands-on experience that was gained. However, I think it should count for a whole credit, not just .5. The time spent in the lab and the time required every week to write up lab reports make it worth a full credit.",
                "The TFs are amazing people and teachers. They really draw out little details we should consider while doing the experiment. They do not babysit but they never shy from a guided hand or push in the right direction. A weakness is how quizzes are evaluated. you lose too many points for missing like one question",
                "The strengths of this course are that it was able to help me produce a better understanding on how to apply lesson concepts learned in General Chemistry 161 to hands-on lab assignments. Some weaknesses are that the workload was quite demanding.",
                "Well organized and engaging. Have the writing up before we get there so we can start faster.",
                "The course was really effective in teaching us many lab skills and lab etiquette. The only weakness is that the labs dont really match what we learn in chemistry class.",
                "The course aligned well with Chem 161 to help me reinforce the concepts I was learning.",
                "Strengths: Prelab lectures are clear and prelab quizzes are helpful\/manageable, TAs are always available to help out during experiments, lab reports are not overwhelming, TAs have plenty of drop-in Zoom office hours for any questions regarding lab reports or experiments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports involve a decent amount of work with excel, which, for students like me who are pretty unfamiliar with the platform, can get quite frustrating\/time-consuming.",
                "strength: engaging and really enhanced learned\r\nweakness: discrepancies between grading styles\/difficulties of TAs",
                "The strengths of this course is that the workload is very manageable, and the professor and TFs are very helpful in the lab when performing the experiments. The experiments we did were pretty standard chemistry experiments done in an introductory gen chem class, and so while they weren't always the most exciting, they served their purpose of reinforcing the concepts we were learning simultaneously in Chem 161.",
                "It was straightforward and easy to follow during lab, but the lab reports were time consuming.",
                "I learned a lot of techniques and chemistry concepts. The write ups were at times tedious.",
                "I liked performing different experiments, as well as how they relate to different topics in chemistry, but the experiments did not really align with what I was learning in CHEM163.",
                "A strength of the course is that it was more practical, since it was more hands on and engaging. A weakness is that I feel its designation as only half credit didn't match up with the workload, and the lab report grading was sometimes unclear, as the rubric on Canvas would indicate that I lost points, but based on each point value's description, I should have earned points since I completed that task.",
                "The lab is fun and labs are well constructed. I think some of the labs were a bit short and too trivial (i.e. measuring boiling point of substance).",
                "I think the grading of the lab reports were unfair at times since each lab TA were subjective in terms of their grading. I think that they could have a specific rubric in terms of grading so that the grading process is more equal.",
                "It was a pretty good class, the lab reports were always a bit hectic and I felt like the syllabus was kind of up to interpretation of the TAs so they gave different instructions in terms of the report.",
                "This course is a very good introduction to basic chemistry laboratory experience that allows students to experience a lab environment. It also allowed me to supplement my chemistry knowledge by introducing the concepts in a hands-on experience."

                "Yes, if you need it for your major. If not, then do not take it because it is a lot of work for only half of a credit.",
                "No, unless you're premed or doubting that the experiments in Chem161 can be replicated (which is fair; I truly appreciated the experimental confirmation of the concepts from lecture).",
                "No I would only recommend it to someone that needs to take it to move on in chemistry labs. It is helpful in some ways in learning basic chemistry skills however most people have done these experiments in high school (I did and went to a public school) and the lab reports are overly tedious and busy work.",
                "NO BAD CLASS. It sucks that an intro class can be so boring and frustrating. It does not give you the necessary skills to do lab work, and is composed of a set of very long and pointless experiments.",
                "You need to take this as a prereq for a lot of stuff, but there's no reason to take it if it's not required. If you have the option of placing out of this course, you should. The course is only half a credit, but it has the workload of a full-credit course.",
                "Yes, if it would help them with their major than I would recommend it.",
                "I recommend this course as an introductory lab, especially if you have yet to have previous experience. There is a lot of support for undergraduates and leniency in the first lab reports to allow students to learn how to effectively write within a lab environment and conduct experiments.",
                "Yeah, I enjoyed lab and the specificity of the class. Although, if you don't like the topics I can't imagine this class is enjoyable.",

                "This course was a good intro course to lab work and a prereq for many majors but there were times when it required a lot of time and when the content was confusing.",
                "I mean if you are a pre-med, you have to take it. If you aren't pre-med or in a major that requires a gen chem lab credit, don't take this course. Please go back and re-read that because you need to hear it. Don't take this course unless you need it. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, my advice is to take this class sooner rather than later. It's geared toward first-years who don't know what they're doing. So, if you have no lab experience but want to get into research and all that, take it first-year fall. You will at least became more familiar with the lab and what research looks like.",
                "If it is a prerequisite, I guess you have to take it anyways",
                "Yes, it is a good foundation and necessary for some majors.",
                "Only to fulfill a prerequisite or requirement.",
                "yes",
                "If you have an interest in learning what a lab environment is like, then take this course. If you dont have any interest in STEM definitely DONT take this course. Its a tedious time commitment that takes commitment. It is, however, not too hard to do very well in.\r\nI believe I have a much better sense of what doing research in a lab is like after taking this course. I think the course was fairly interesting and supplemented what we were learning in Gen Chem 161.",
                "Yes! This course is a fun way to get an introduction to chemistry lab.",
                "If you don't have to do lab for your major or premed I would not do it because it is a bit time consiminf.",
                "If you have to take it, it's not terrible. If you don't, you can learn a lot of the same skills on other courses.",
                "Its required for most people taking it, but Id still say yes. Its a good introduction to chemistry concepts in a lab setting.",
                "Only if it is a pre-requisite. Otherwise, please do not place your mental health in jeopardy because it is not worth it.",
                "No, it is too large of a time commitment for little credits.",

                "I absolutely would; Dr. Parr and the TFs created an enjoyable learning environment.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a great way to be introduced to a lab and skills that go with many of the concepts and ideas taught in general chemistry. In addition, it is a way to see how reactions and other things learned in chemistry are conducted in hands on experiments.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are taking general chemistry as a prerequisite for their major. I would highly recommend taking the lab alongside the lecture course as it serves as a great way to see the applications of chemistry concepts and, in my opinion, is more fun than the lecture. The lab does entail at least six hours of work outside of the lab period to prepare the pre-lab and write up the lab report. However, if you allocate time to do the work, it does not have to be stressful. The pre-lab quizzes are doable and the professor was always available to help students. I greatly enjoyed the lab component for general chemistry. However, be aware that the two courses are not really connected so do not expect the lab to clarify concepts learned in the lecture course.",
                "I would not recommend students take this course for fun because it includes a lot of tedious work and isn't particularly engaging (it's a very introductory class, after all). But as a required course, this isn't bad. It's relatively low stress and there's a lot of support from kind TFs.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Not only is it a prerequisite for many other STEM classes, but it is a nice transition to lab courses at Yale. It also provides a good introduction on how to begin structuring lab reports, which aids in future lab classes.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it's a requirement for many STEM majors and for the pre-med track. I wouldn't take this class if you're looking to learn something really engaging\/exciting about chemistry.",
                "Yes, necessary for many major requirements and it couples well with General Chemistry lecture.",
                "I think this course would be useful for those deciding whether they'd love to pursue a STEM-related career and is a nice introduction to the laboratory environment.",

                "I would recommend this class as a good foundation for anyone taking general chemistry, as it prepares you for the future and also solidifies your knowledge of material that was learned in lecture that week.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who has no prior experience in the lab and desires to gain more experience.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially one that is pursuing the pre-med track and is taking chemistry at the same time and wants hands-on, real-life experience.",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is such a great way to learn how to properly conduct lab procedures, which is essential for anyone who wants a career in STEM.",
                "Yes, engaging and very interesting experiments.",
                "Definitely a useful course when paired with CHEM161. You also receive a lot of support from the TFs.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it introduces you to lab equipment and techniques that may be essential for you.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is required for other students, as it does require a decently large time commitment for a half-credit course. That said, this course is nothing to fear for students on the chemistry track! Prelab lectures and quizzes are not too difficult and genuinely helpful, instructions are always clear, and . Weekly lab reports can take a lot of time (and they do require patience), but each TA has plenty of office hours to help out if students are ever confused.",
                "yes, very much a necessity for pre-med students. it really helped me to know how to work in a lab",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good way to be introduced to working in a lab setting at Yale and also helped with improving understanding of the topics that we were learning in Chem 161.",
                "Yes, only if it is a requirement and you would like more lab skills.",
                "Yes, if it is necessary, it is not a bad course to take.",
                "The course was not bad and I think is really helpful when starting out with laboratory science at Yale.",
                "I am neutral about recommending it, since people only take it to complete requirements (like premed or for EVST BS), and the course content wasn't particularly interesting, since it was the same topics as general chemistry, but performing labs was pretty fun.",
                "Yes, the course is not that difficult and fun. However, I don't see much point of taking it if the student does not need the class for major prereqs.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is a fantastic introduction to chemistry lab which is very important if studying further chemistry later. It introduces the basic knowledge needed in a lab and allows the student to be able to practice with specific lab equipment."
