                "Strengths -- professor clearly cares during class, asks all the student questions, wants to hear about our lives etc. And you learn a fair amount of Swahili through the course of the semester. Definitely know a LOT more now than when I began. \r\n\r\nWeakness - sometimes class was boring. Was a lot of just reading new words on the zoom screen. I know teaching a language virtually was probably very difficult, but i think prof should have livened it up a little if possible.",
                "The structure of the class jumps from topic to topic a little bit, but by and large, I felt like I learned at an extremely accelerated rate, and learned a lot. The class would very clearly be even more fun in person, as the professor has incredible energy, that is surely amplified in real life.",
                "This course was fairly easy to keep up with and I would say it's the biggest strength is Mwalimu. He really makes sure you are keeping up with the class and is very responsive. You get a ton of practice speaking and listening as everyday Mwalimu sets aside time to converse with each student in Swahili. I would say it's the biggest Weakness is it was unorganized. We didn't use the book which made it so if you had a misunderstanding you almost had to email the prof. Also I wasn't totally clear about what work was being graded and what wasn't being graded.",
                "Loved this class. The small size made it really easy to engage in and receive constant feedback. The professor also makes it easy to learn a lot in a short amount of time. No weaknesses.",
                "Beginning Kiswahili I has many strengths. Mwalimu Kiarie is entertaining and effective, he is extremely welcoming and accommodating, and he adapts his course throughout the semester based on how students are doing. He makes sure all of his students develop the most important skills of grammar with hints of what is to come later, he devotes a lot of class time for each student to speak with him one on one in Kiswahili, and he engages everyone in interesting discussions of language and culture. He doesn't assign too much homework and at the same time covers a broad range of elementary Kiswahili grammar and vocabulary, focusing on developing the skills of speaking, writing, and reading.\r\n\r\nThe course had a lot of flexibility built in, but sometimes I wished that there were more structure. We read from a textbook that Mwalimu is developing from time to time, but it was difficult to tell what topic we would learn next. Our vocabulary lists were impressively extensive, but I would appreciate learning more of the most functional words; for example, we could say \"avocado\" (parachichi) but we had to ask him how to say \"to be able to, can\" (kuweza) (and if you didn't write it down then, you would have to ask again) -- although I suppose in the end I did learn both. I also would have appreciated more frequent, shorter assessments, because studying for quizzes and tests really helped me solidify what we had covered. The tests could run a bit long, especially if we hadn't had one in a while, and what was expected of us on tests was not always clear (for example, you could lose points for not writing enough on a free response question, but there was no minimum number of words specified)."
