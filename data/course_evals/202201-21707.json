                "There are no strengths to this course. The professors are unreachable, unapproachable, and provide no information when questions are asked. They provide no guidance with courses, and the materials have minimal structure. They grade so strictly and provide minimal, if not contradictory feedback.",
                "Strengths - having weekly homeworks very helpful to keeping up on coursework, lectures are very interesting and having the handouts helps keep track of the material\r\nWeaknesses - I think maybe some examples of blog posts or the final paper might be helpful, just because the assignment instructions were very open ended",
                "i liked the homework assignments - working together with other students and engaging with the material was fun. also really liked that the notes were all written out and we could refer back to those. \r\nweakness - maybe could be a bit more clear on expectations for the blog post / assignments",
                "Honestly wouldn't change a thing!",
                "The strength of the course is that the topics can be genuinely interesting. The weakness is that the instruction and assignments really ruin the class. Professor Burns and Sanker were excessively punitive, even when students would simply ask a question in class. Comments on homework assignments felt very nit-picky and not even in a way that would enhance learning.",
                "Overall this was a very good class and each lecture was well structured",
                "I think that the professors could be a little more clear with the assignments and grade a little less harshly/pedantically considering the course is a 100s level course. Likewise, I wish the professors were just a bit more understanding of students issues and offer more accommodation.",
                "Strengths: It's really quite good at getting a door into linguistics, if that's what you're interested in; or it's also good as just an intro to a different subject that you've never learned about before! I also think it was quite well-integrated with a number of different sources and current-day examples (i.e. the McGurk effect, and how that relates to the yanny-laurel debate from a few years ago). The class was comprehensive and we didn't need to do the readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was graded as if it were for more advanced linguistics students, and not people who barely know anything about the subject. For instance, we had pretty much weekly p-sets to turn in, which covered the content from previous classes. However, some of those questions were genuinely unanswerable for me (as someone with no experience in linguistics, as they asked about things that we barely touched on in class, and there were no answers online or in the textbook.",
                "This course grades way too harshly for an introductory linguistics class. The compulsory class participation did not appear to be helpful, as we didn't really have fruitful class discussions.",
                "Strengths: when Professors would lecture and ask lots of questions to the students and invite the students to reflect on their own experiences, I felt like I learned the best. Linguistics and the study of language is universal enough that everyone can become interested in it by engaging in the aspects of it that they have experienced before, so having a seminar-style class was beneficial to that regard.\r\n\r\nWeakness: when the professors lectured by just reading off the notes in class without giving extra anecdotes or inviting class discussion, I felt the material didn't stick with me very well.",
                "This course is meant to be an approachable method of exploring linguistics, but the time, professors, and assignments make it confusing and harder to engage with then it could be."

                "No. This is the absolutely worse class I have ever taken and I have taken multiple STEM courses. The timing is horrible and the professors are rude if you are slightly late to class even though attendance is not required. The teaching was done so poorly that I only came out of this class with more anxiety and stress.",

                "I would absolutely 100% recommend this class!! I think linguistics is incredibly fascinating and relevant. It's also a very low-stakes classnot too much homework, no exams, just a short final paper with lots of freedom.",
                "No. Unless you absolutely need this as a linguistics major, DO NOT take this course. Even though it is listed as a 106 course, it is not friendly to people who do not already know a bit about linguistics. I wish I had listened to the reviews that said not to take this course.",
                "This is, without a doubt, the worst class I have ever taken at Yale, and I've taken a lot of classes at Yale. What makes this class the worst you ask? I'll tell you. To begin with, this class suffers from the usual case of an irrelevant academic field trying to make a class needlessly complicated and obscure in order to mask its utter unimportance. That's my general understanding of what made the class so bad, but I'll be more specific. The readings are somehow both frivolous and entirely beyond the scope of human comprehension. It's not that they were hard to understand, it's just that it was nothing in them worth understanding at all. The home work assignments were actually decent from time to time, but even so there would often be stuff on them that we hadn't discussed at all in class or in the readings. Finally, the professors refused to offer any sort of transparency in regards to the grading scheme. They'd give us grades each week, but they refused to tell us what our grades meant. Was I failing? Was I thriving? I have no idea. In short, if you value the quality of your life at all, do not take this class. Kachow.",
                "Definitely yes. it is a very enjoyable course to learn about linguistics",
                "Probably not. I didnt feel that engaged, and the harshness of grading makes the class not a class you can take just because youre interested.",
                "Yes? But also no?\r\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the class, but I also didn't at the same time. I like learning about the material, but I thought we were being questioned a little bit too thoroughly about it. Furthermore (and I'm pretty sure this isn't either of the professors' faults, but...) the timeslot was absolutely atrociousit ran from 6pm to 7:15pm, which basically meant that I never had a chance to eat dinner, as I wasn't really ever that hungry prior to 6. But Professor Burns is well worth taking a class withshe's an absolute icon.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I did not enjoy taking LING 106. There are interesting course concepts, but the weekly assignments  are harshly graded and require lots of time. It was discouraging to try my best on each assignment to no avail. I wasn't alone in my thoughts either.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Burns continues teaching it. I learned a lot as someone with no background in linguistics and was very interested in the problem sets and the final paper we had to write.",
                "No, there are a lot more interesting classes at Yale with better pedagogical styles."
