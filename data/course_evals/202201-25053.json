I felt like sometimes we lacked basic historical and cultural understandings of the places we were to talking about to then be able to jump to some of the high level analyses we were being asked to make. I also received no grades or feedback throughout the entire semester which made it difficult to gage where I stood in the class and how I could improve.",
