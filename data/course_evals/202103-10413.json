                "I learned how to dig deeper when developing a story and writing a screenplay. Camille forces you to think critically about how stories unfold, what characters want, and how they act on that. Although I came in with a solid toolkit for screenwriting and storytelling from previous classes, this course helped me refine those.",
                "This course is AMAZING. You learn how to write a screenplay and what makes other movies great. You also do a bunch of weird exercises that you don't understand in the moment and then are slowly revealed to be extremely useful. Such a fun and excellent course for anyone curious to know more about storytelling through film.",

                "This is one of my favorite courses at Yale. Classtime is a perfect balance of engaging presentations of film analysis/structure/character/etc. and delightfully unexpected in-class exercises. The class is designed so that you get out of it what you put into it, and Professor Thomasson makes you want to put everything you have into it.",
                "I loved the feedback we received on our writing and the in-class activities like the improv day and our Iphigenia at Aulis performance. Class was a joy and rarely felt too long despite it being two hours. I would have loved to learn more about Camille's experience in the industry and how she's learned what she has / believes what she does. It's more interesting when lessons are grounded in story!",
                "Strengths- passionate professor, well-structured classes, small class size builds a little community.\r\nWeakness- (this isn't a weakness of the course but maybe my experience in particular) Because you'll be working on one project for the entire semester, you need to be ready from day one. I didn't come with my idea fully fleshed out, which made the next couple weeks difficult.",
                "No weaknesses! The strengths are pretty much every aspect: the syllabus, the professor, the in-class activities, the cohort you form with your classmates. I guess if I had to change one thing it would to actively assign us more screenplays to read. We only had a few assignments where we actually had to read screenplays--I would have appreciated a couple more!",

                "If you are at all interested in screenwriting or storytelling, take this course. It is simply so much fun while also being engaging and giving you a great understanding of how a great film works. All of the other screenwriting courses I've taken at Yale seem to have no interest in your story past the first 10-15 pages, but this course helps you think further, setting you up to continue writing after the semester ends. It also will give you a good set of tools to apply to other screenplays and stories in general.",
                "Yes, it's a no brainer. Take this course. Camille is an excellent professor and it's a well-structured class. Well-paced and interesting.",
                "Absolutely. So long as Camille is teaching this class, it is a must-take for any student interesting in screenwriting, storytelling, or film.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in screenwriting, apply. The application looks really intimidating but the course itself is not. It's challenging, but not scary. You will not regret it!",
