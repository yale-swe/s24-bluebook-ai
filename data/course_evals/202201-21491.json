                "I learned so much from this course about ways of critically looking at our assumptions about distant historical periods and languages. I learned about the joys of translation, as well as the artistry of it, and the ways it helps one better understand and appreciate a foreign language. I learned so much about Chaucer himself, and the context of his work  history that was fascinating, held many keys to understanding our own global and country politics, and helped me better understand Anglophone literature so much better as a whole."

                "This course is great. Pretty much a standard English class: you do weekly readings, discuss in section, and write papers. My favorite moment in the semester was our last class at Professor Butterfield's loft. She had us all over and we ate medieval themed snacks and talked about the Cantebury Tales. It was so much fun!",
                "The course has only strengths. Though it is a rather obscure field, I quickly became excited about the content of the class.",
                "The expectations were very clear for assignments, which I loved. I also loved the options of reading for more, how we could pursue our interests each week. This is a really great class, I highly recommend.",
                "Great course. No notes.",
                "This course had so many strengths - each unit, discussion topic set, and set of readings was so well thought out. Our discussions were always fascinating, and the readings too. Several of us in class had a bit of difficulty figuring out what the readings were for a given week (high stakes, as we only met once a week)  especially towards the beginning. The cause for this was that it was the modules tab in Canvas where this info was being communicated, but we'd been mistakenly looking at the syllabus (a mistake I think many people might have easily made). A bit more emphasis on the importance of the Modules tab early on in the course (and its objectively superior importance than the syllabus) would have helped.\r\n\r\nI also think it would have really improved my learning if we'd had the chance to do re-writes of essays (that is, first and second drafts) for one or both papers  I could have delved deeper into a thread with the help of the professor in a way that office hours alone would not have enabled me to."

                "Yes, it is an excellent introduction to Chaucer.",
                "Yes absolutely. The course was a lot of work because all the readings were dense and in Middle English. But it was so worth it.",
                "Yes. Great course to fulfill your Medieval requirement as an English major, even if you're not a huge Chaucer fan. Professor Butterfield is great, and the readings are cool if you let yourself get into them.",
                "YES! But only to specific students  nerds of history that enjoy language and fairly obscure, deep rather than broad history. To me the beauty of this class was the depth (and relative lack of breadth) of it. \r\nI would, however, emphasize that professor Butterfield's impressive expertise in the area, and Chaucer's delightful writings  as well as their applicability to today's world and literature  are reasons for anyone to take the course. \r\n\r\nThe course provoked such profound thought and insights for me, and made me realize the joys of becoming expert in a topic  something I don't naturally do (as a fox rather than a hedgehog... usually, but perhaps not so much after this course!). It actually made me consider entering medieval studies, something I never for the life of me thought I would be good at or interested in."
