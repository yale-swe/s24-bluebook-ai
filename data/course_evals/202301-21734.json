                "Strengths - weekly coaching, Sophiko is great, I think Callisto quartet is very knowledgeable and I would love them to give a class in the beginning on how to rehearse chamber music \r\nWeaknesses - repertoire could be expanded, would love to develop more chamber-music specific skills with Callisto beyond repertoire interpretation",
                "The emphasis on having lots of coaching helps tremendously with developing the piece, however I feel that the classes on Tuesdays could be a little more efficiently run? Perhaps telling the students to pay attention to certain things in the performance that the performers would like to work on.",
                "I appreciate the opportunity for students to give and receive feedback from each other during classes, as I think this is an important skill to have in the musical world that I haven't had as much opportunity to practice previously. I don't have any suggestions for major improvement in this course.",
                "Strengths: Lots of attention from great TA's (the coaches), chance to perform in class once a month.",
                "Coaches are very knowledgable",
                "This course struggles with the question of who it is for: it is effectively a course for white and East Asian string players and pianists. Of course we all know that the classical music community has a problem with race and class, but this course does not do anything to counteract those stereotypes. All eight of the coaches for this course are white. There would be more interesting perspectives in the class if there were more wind players and coaches, and if wind groups were allowed to play more significant repertoire. Unfortunately the class time conflicts with Concert Band rehearsals and therefore this is not an option for many high-level musicians. Admissions for the course are quite political and arbitrary, left entirely to the personal whims of the few YSM-affiliated faculty members who teach undergraduates. But overall this is a pretty good course that students learn a lot from, even if most of that learning comes from working with fellow students rather than from the instructors.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot about musical collaboration and ensemble work. Low-stress workshop classes and great people. \r\nWeaknesses: Wish it was worth a full credit.",
                "Time is wasted at the beginning of every semester by presenting about our pieces  everyone would rather spend the time rehearsing and having extra coachings.",
                "I liked the studio class format which allowed us to critically evaluate our classmate's performances. Coachings were also always quite helpful for developing our interpretation of the music we were learning. I would appreciate more focus on teaching chamber music skills, such as how to rehearse, tuning chords, and cuing.",
                "This is a great classI think it is very strong for people who want to have a structured chamber music environment at Yale. I think more wind players as coaches would be amazing :') and I wish groups could choose their own repertoire! Or at least have a little more input.. but otherwise I had a great experience.",
                "I think that the assignment of giving presentations at the beginning of the semester worked well during COVID, but has now outlived its usefulness. Many of the presentations were effectively blow-by-blow musical summaries of the pieces with little attention to interpretive questions. More importantly, spending so much time on presentations at the beginning of the semester"

                "Great way to make friends and become better at my instrument",
                "Yes, this can be a good course that you can learn a lot from. But you should try to talk to people who have taken the course before first to figure out if it's the right fit for you. Also, the admissions process is not entirely fair nor merit-based, and so you shouldn't feel bad if you aren't accepted. There are many opportunities to play great chamber music at Yale, and this is just one of them.",
                "It is a lot of work for just half a credit, but the people and learning opportunities make it well worth your time. It requires a lot of communication and being on top of your part, but I found this easy since the repertoire and people were inspiring and encouraging. I had a great time getting to know my groupmates and rehearsals\/coachings were always great. Wendy, Sophiko and the Callisto Quartet are incredibly skilled musicians and wonderful people in general. I highly encourage auditioning for all musicians.",
                "This is a great course if you want to play chamber music at a high level as an undergrad. It is also a great way to get to know other serious musicians",
                "I would! To any student who wants to play chamber music in an organized way, and to listen to others play.",
