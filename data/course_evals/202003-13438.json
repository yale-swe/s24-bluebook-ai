I feel that I have the knowledge and insights to participate productively in discussions about China and the U.S., which will most certainly dominate the foreign policy sphere for the foreseeable future.",

Through the course, I can now identify much more precisely the exact areas in which China is struggling, the roots of its trade dispute with America, and can counter misinformation about those trade dispute roots. By writing op-eds, making presentations, and finally writing a research paper, I practiced useful research strategies and synthesized the information I had learned into focused reports.

                "Strengths - Professor Roach clearly cares about the students' experience. The assignments are conducive to learning, the readings are interesting and manageable, and class time is a good combination of lecture and discussion",
                "Strengths: I'm not sure if Professor Roach will continue to offer ECON 338 as a seminar post-COVID or whether he will turn the course back into a large lecture, but I think the seminar-style was a huge plus in my experience. Professor Roach is the foremost scholar on China's impact on the broader global economy. Having the opportunity to listen to his experiences and engage with him directly on these issues is hugely rewarding. Another strength is the breadth and depth of content covered -- Prof Roach does a great job of covering diverse aspects of China's growth (from the country's lack of a social safety net to corporate deleveraging) so that every student will find at least one of the classes extremely interesting (if not all!). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's a LOT of reading. Some weeks there might be two 100-page reports assigned along with more book chapters and shorter articles. But alas, that's a Yale seminar for you.",
                "Strengths - good course\r\nWeakness - sometimes the assignment descriptionsa re vague. feedback is fantastic on assignments but i wish there was a little more clarity esp w\/ final paper on how to craft what is expected",
                "Strengths: Class expectations were very reasonable and at some times, assignments were quite flexible. Course readings were predominantly very relevant to each week and also I enjoyed the class-generated questions for seminar discussion. Appreciated the guidance and clear instructions given before class presentations and writing assignments. Grades are very fair. Intellectually challenging, and I learned how to critically think about questions that address op-eds. Weaknesses: None.",
                "This course was phenomenal in that it went through a variety of topics in depth. I particularly enjoyed the beginning of each course with a short lecture by professor Roach. I found the readings to be highly relevant and helpful for essay writing.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Wide range of material, offering multiple perspectives, with high density of useful and insightful information. Research papers, book chapters, government reports and op-eds all included (we also had Sinocism subscriptions).\r\n- Excellent, well-informed, enthusiastic instructor\r\n- Assignments give students high engagement with and involvement with the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Amount of reading overwhelming at times",
                "I think that a strength was definitely the TA's -- they were really nice and really smart. A weakness was probably the course format.  I often felt that there wasn't enough opportunity for students to speak."

Discussions were well-run and students were able to participate an equal amount, and the combination of instructor lecturing and student lecturing broke up the Zoom time well.",

                "Yes! Professor Roach is a great teacher. The workload is very manageable  (especially for Econ majors looking to avoid exams) and both experts and novices in the course material will be able to learn from him.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Everybody should take this class! Understanding China's growth trajectory and the U.S.-China relationship will be significant over the next few years as the conflict between existing and rising superpower escalates. Professor Roach does an excellent job of laying out this foundation, and he is another highlight of this course. It's clear he loves teaching and prepares extensively for each class, reading through every student's reading responses carefully and engages with each student's thoughts at least once during each class period. The class is a bit of work (in-class presentation, three reading response questions each week, two four-page papers, and a 15-20 page final paper), and you really have to do all (or at least the majority) of readings each week because Professor Roach will call on each student to share thoughts. However, I thought for the intellectual engagement and access to such a leading scholar on China-- the workload was completely worth it.",
                "yes",
                "I came into this class with a very conservative, hawkish viewpoint on China mostly formed by media and the bias narrative promulgated by the Trump administration. This was probably exacerbated by an election year and anti-China rhetoric during COVID-19. Though significant amounts of reading, extremely informative presentations and Professor Roach's non-partisan analysis of China's economic identity, I learned to challenge these misconceptions. That being said, I was also left with more questions about China's global leadership and its weird similarities with U.S aspirations. Comprehension of U.S-Sino relations is one of the most essential criteria for a future military officer, diplomat, economist, government official and I suggest all those interested in these fields to take this very diverse, balanced seminar. You will not be disappointed.",
                "I would recommend this course to any students interested in studying China's economic rise. It offers profound insights that go beyond what you see in regular media and political science literature.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, conditional on their not taking other highly reading-intensive courses. \"Inside the Next China\" is a fantastic deep dive into what makes China tick right now, so to speak, economically. It possesses highly useful information and a good break from mainstream Americentric narratives. At the same time, you won't get much from the class if you don't put in a lot of effort into reading and digesting the weekly course material, so if you don't have the time to devote to this class, it's best to save it for later.",
