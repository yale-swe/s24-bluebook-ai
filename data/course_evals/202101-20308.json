My time reading complex material, discussing historical events and theoretical concepts, and more all resulted in the development of my critical analysis skills.",
                "This should be a required course for every history major. Before coming into this course, I hadn't really thought about the difference between history and memory. This class digs into that difference and discusses how each impacts the other. The readings are admittedly very complex. But Professor Allen teaches you how to read them, how not to spend too much time on them, and what to look for. After this class, I won't be able to write a history paper without considering the impact of memory. I don;'t think any other Yale course has impact my outlook so broadly.",
                "I learned how to write a primary source-driven history research paper, I learned how to think about history and memory from a socio-cultural perspective, and gained the skills to apply those frameworks to understanding specific case studies. This class really teaches you how to interrogate memory politics in the world around you.",
                "This course is really wonderful in gaining an understanding of memory and history -- how we remember things, why we remember the things we do, and a discussion on why those things are written down. You learn how to evaluate memory and testimony, uncovering the tensions and synergies between memory and history.",
                "Professor Allen gives the best feedbackbetter than any professor I've had. That feedback will make you a better writer for sure. The readings were great and the assignments were a perfect mix of really academic and then also some more creative and fun assignments too. This class will really get you thinking and pondering new ideas, especially about the role of memory and history on our lives (which is a topic that touches EVERYTHING in the world).",
                "I learned about the relationship between memory and historyhow the two concepts often seep into one another, and yet describe such different analytical phenomena. This class was an incredible introduction into the world of memory politics, covering everything from museums to monuments to counter-monuments. We also rooted our studies in some difficult but fascinating historical theory, which helped me build my close reading skills. Professor Allen provided an enormous amount of feedback on my writing, and I think there have been few other courses at  Yale where my writing has improved so much."

                "This course is meticulously structured. Each reading is assigned for very specific purposes and it was gratifying to see how all of the readings weaved together and interacted with one another by the end of the semester. The assignments are carefully thought out with a good mix of formal and creative assignments. Seminar discussions were engaging and energizing. \r\n\r\nAt times I felt as though the course was overloaded with assignments such that it took away from the readings/seminar discussions/content of the course. It was rare that I could just read the readings and enjoy them and think critically about them without having to turn that reading into a writing assignment. During the first six weeks students had to choose two weeks in which to write a short paper on that week's readings. I usually wasn't able to finish the readings before Saturday or Sunday (our seminar met on Tuesdays) which gave me not much time to digest the readings, decide whether or not I wanted to write a paper on them, and then actually write the paper. Thus, each week it felt as if I was preparing to write a paper, even if I didn't end up writing one. This added an additional layer of stress to the reading and took away some of the enjoyment from the reading process. I wonder if the instructor might consider adjusting this format and specifically assigning deadlines for the two papers (maybe week 3 and 6). Alternatively, the instructor might combine the two short papers into a larger assignment and have one medium-length paper due on week 6.  \r\n\r\nI also think the instructor might consider changing some of the assignment deadlines. Our final research paper was due on April 25th, a few weeks before the end of the semester and before reading period. It is difficult to write such an intellectually demanding paper while also doing other reading and attending class, which is why I enjoy writing/finishing these assignments during reading period when I don't have to attend class. I appreciate that the instructor wanted us to finish the assignment early so we wouldn't have to juggle it with other similar assignments during reading period, but I still would have appreciated finishing it up in a slower-paced environment so I could really slow down and invest more energy into it. I think one reason that the instructor decided to have the paper due so early was so that we wouldn't procrastinate and leave it for reading period. If this is the case, maybe a detailed rough draft could be due on April 25th (or at the equivalent time during the fall semester) and then the final wouldn't be due until after reading period.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of the research paper, I wonder if the writing/researching process could be started even earlier in the semester. I find it very difficult to think of a good topic, find sources, and then write a good paper in a short amount of time during the middle/end of the term. I wonder if it would be better if students were told to choose their topics even in the first four weeks. This way they could have a lot more time to research and think. I understand the difficulties of this, though, because students perhaps might not know what they want to write about (or have the proper tools to consider it) so early in the semester.",
                "This course is phenomenal. Although it is challenging (and I mean challenging), it is rewarding and interesting at all points. The readings themselves are fascinating and engaging, and although there are a lot of pages assigned each week, they are enjoyable ones. Secondly, the essays are structured to be thought provoking and challenging but not long. In this class, you don't write for the sake of writing an essay, but to prove a specific argument and use the allotted space to support your thesis. The methods of writing are challenging, but improvement is necessary. Also, I appreciated how engaging our discussions were. Professor Allen allows the class to flow but interjects ideas here and there to keep us on track.",
                "Strengths: Professor Allen is incredible. She cares very deeply for her students and will devote tons of one-on-one time to help them develop ideas or talk through problem spots. Importantly for a seminar, she frames each discussion very well. You're never listening to her lecture for too long, and she also never fishes for an answer. The readings in the course are great. The load is never too overwhelming, and you're encouraged to skim. \r\nI don't have any real weaknesses. Maybe the moment proposal should be weighted a little less - it felt weird to spend a ton of time on the research paper and have that be worth the same. But Professor Allen is very fair with grading, and the huge participation portion balances it all out.",
                "Incredibly engaging course, brilliant and inspiring professor, incredibly thorough feedback on writing, amazing texts and conversations in a tight-knit group. This class is a lot of work, but I think most people know that going in.",
                "This course was incredibly strong. The first half of the course is theory and the second half is application. However, there's still a lot of theory in the application readings. I wished that we had done more application work before doing the big research paper.",
                "This class had amazing readings and Professor Allen is perhaps the best moderator and mediator of a seminar-style discussion I've had at Yale. She lets students speak but also adds so much insight and depth to what we say through her own comments during the discussion. We packed so much into each seminar session, it was really astounding!",
                "This course is among the best I have taken at Yale. Professor Allen is one of the most hard-working and passionate professors I have ever met, and any student would be lucky to have her as their professor. The course is strongest in its balance between theory and real-world application: we studied not only the concept of memory and its philosophical underpinnings, but also how it relates to the history of Europe."

I think the use of Zoom was really good, and I hope that this will be the last time anyone has to teach online under these circumstances.",

The conversations themselves flowed really well with Prof Allen moderating (so it wasn't just a free-for-all). If this kind of all-virtual seminar format occurs again in the future, I would suggest helping students put together a class group-chat (by deputizing a certain student) so that students can meet each other outside of class to build community and facilitate discussions.",

That said, Professor Allen is a brilliant and engaging instructor who really cares about her students' improvement. The seminar discussions were fascinating and engaging and I learned a lot from them. I also really appreciated Professor Allen's incredibly detailed line comments on all of my written assignments. \r\n\r\nI will say that this class was incredibly stressful (possibly exacerbated by COVID). It was so fast-paced and I felt like I was always preparing for an assignment that I never felt quite confident in. The class is incredibly taxing emotionally and intellectually, but you learn and improve a lot.",
                "I will and have recommended this course to every single one of my friends. Without a doubt, it was the best class I have taken at Yale, and I wholeheartedly think everyone should take a class with Professor Allen. I showed up to this class during shopping period and asked to join, knowing that I was out of my element. I am neither a history major nor super knowledgeable about European history. If you have the basics, you can do well in this class. The readings are engaging and thought-provoking throughout the semester  the material builds on itself and layers the information. The essays, though difficult, are great ways to compile work throughout the class and display your understanding of the material. Professor Allen provides feedback unlike any other professor at Yale, and you'll become a better writer and thinker. Even if you're scared by the workload of this class, it shouldn't be a reason to not take the class. If you start early in the week, you'll get it done on time. To put it simply, this was the only class I was excited about attending each and every day this semester. If you have the chance and are lucky enough to get a spot, you must take the class.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!! Every history major should consider taking this course. You can't have history without memory, or memory without history. Professor Allen is incredible. Professor Allen has won awards for her dedication to undergraduate teaching, and she'll continue to do so! This class will make you more curious. It'll challenge you academically without overwhelming you with work.",
                "Yes, definitely!! If you are interested in studying the cool, niche relationship between history and memory, you will love this class! If you want to think about how collective memory/memory politics functions in society, this class will blow your mind! Honestly, ever day is super fun and the discussions almost always leave me feeling excited. With that being said, the reading load is pretty heavy and Prof Allen will hit you with a massive stack of comments on your papers. But I feel like she has genuinely made me a better thinker (and writer), and that is one of the really special things that I will bring with me when I leave Yale.",
                "Definitely. It is a really really hard course, but I think if one goes in with that expectation there's just so much to get out of it. It gave me a brand new framework in which to think about history. But if you can't handle reading dense theory texts for the first 7 weeks, it will be a challenge.",
                "I 100000000% recommend this course to any student. Even if you are not a History major, you will leave this class with so many profound and new thoughts about the role of memory and history, and why this matters so much! And it does! This class will make anyone a better thinker in the long term.",
                "YES! This is an amazing course. It is very difficult and challenging, but I don't think I have grown as much as a history student in any other class at Yale. Intellectually rigorous and very well-organized, this class will have a huge impact on you conceptualize the past."
