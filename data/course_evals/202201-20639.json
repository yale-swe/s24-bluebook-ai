I also learned a good deal about R, especially working with packages included in tidyverse and DeclareDesign (a random experiment-focused packaged co-written by prof coppock!), and some good practices in making my code neater. I learned about different issues that you may run into during a randomized experiment (e.g. compliance issues), and how you may overcome them or work around them to still get meaningful results from your data."

                "This course facilitated student learning and participation, and Professor Coppock and Shikhar were an amazing instructor/TA duo who made sure that students were understanding and engaging with the course material.",
                "Really great course, good pace of learning, right amount of work assigned. However, I think office hours with the TA could be greatly improved. 10 minute slots are just not enough, and I don't get as much out of office hours when it's one on one. I think people appreciate one-on-one office hours with professors, but certainly not with the TA. Office hours with a TA should be collaborative and open to all. We should not need to make an appointment and only get a 10-minute time slot. Office hours are also supposed to be a chance for students to hear each other's questions and learn from those questions.",

                "I don't think there were any weaknesses to this course. I truly learned a lot from the lectures, and I liked how one class of the week was typically dedicated to learning the topic while the other class was dedicated to discussing a relevant social science article that used experimentation techniques.",
                "Great course, very helpful professor and TA!",
                "Strengths: Coppock is so, so good. Hes enthusiastic about the material and knows his stuff. I also appreciated the in-class discussion of published papers! The homework and exams were very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I could have used more guidance on the expectations for the final project.",
                "This class was amazing! I really learned a lot. Alex is great at teaching and presenting material in a clear and concise manner. His way of teaching really facilitates learning. The TF was amazing too and all the sections were very helpful. Our textbook was great and all the parts were manageable. I liked the final project and how we got to use what we learned on the project.",

                "Everything about this course is perfect!!! I love the weekly discussion of papers! I also become more interested in political science because of this course!",
                "The greatest strength of this course is Shikhar the TF and the flexibility of the final project. I was able to conduct a practice experiment on a hobby I love and post to social media as part of the experiment. The greatest weakness of the course is the timeliness in which assignments and feedback were received, though this was due to only having one TF.",
                "This was a great course! Very well-suited for and focused on student learning. The only drawback I noted was that at times, I felt like some of the statistics concepts weren't well explained.",
                "Strengths: Professor Coppock is truly excited about what he teaches, so if you look over the syllabus and are interested in the content you will have a great time in this course. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the lecture content was recorded so that I could rewatch the content or listen at my own pace.",
                "Strengths: Prof Coppock was so well versed in what he taught (he is even writing a textbook related to the course!), so I always felt energized by his lectures and that everything we covered was actually useful and applicable. Also, our TF was awesome!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets can be a bit technically challenging, especially if you haven't coded or worked with R before. Luckily, Shikhar had great sections that would help guide us through useful coding frameworks. Also, the classes were sometimes rushed."

He is also very understanding and will help you if you are a bit behind on understanding R or any of the concepts. Really strengthened my comfort with working with R, my statistics knowledge, and understanding of econ research and how research is conducted. Really great class for those interested in writing thesis or doing graduate research in the future.",

Its not too high workload, but you come away really getting the concepts and being able to understand and critically evaluate papers on field experiments. Its also really cool to see what questions you can answer with experiments!",
