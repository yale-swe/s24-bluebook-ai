The homework workloadthe essays in particularfelt more effective and less-redundant than in the first two levels. One aspect of Chinese-learning that I missed from last year was the character-writing. Although I feel like I learned more characters in general, my ability to hand-write them has decreased because of online learning."

If you are looking to just learn any language, though, beware that the workload for Chinesealthough not unmanageableis constant and modestly large."
