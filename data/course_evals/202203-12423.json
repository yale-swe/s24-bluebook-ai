Sometimes I felt the problem sets were at a level that was above where we were in class, so I stood no shot without going to ULA office hours.",

                "I really enjoyed the coding parts of this class. It felt very fun, and we made a lot of progress. All the stuff relating to Markov chains were really eye opening. I enjoyed the examples in classes and psets, for the most part. \r\n\r\nThe parts of this course relating to high level math were unclear. The math in the lectures didnt prepare students properly for the math in the psets, which both didnt fully help prepare students for the exams. Being good at math is very much needed, dont take the math prerequisite as lightly as the syllabus seemed to. \r\n\r\nI think this course was disorganized due to the nature of it trying to cover many areas in probability and statistics, but thats natural in a course like this.",
                "it's perfect",
                "Strengths: Awesome professor, well-taught course content, PSets were reasonable and related to the course content, it's possible to do well if you follow along. Towards the end, all the PSets/exams include questions about Martians, which is fun. Weaknesses: I can't think of many, but I was already familiar with R because of 230, so others might feel differently.",
                "Long and sometimes off track lectures. Lack of support for accommodations.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the availability of resources. There are six different times for office hours as there is a huge student staff of four ULAs, a TF, and our professor. The course slides are easily accessible, as well as slides for specific lectures in case someone missed or wanted to review a particular lecture. There is also code from each lecture readily available as well as a file of class notes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of this course is the amount of time we spend learning each concept. I would appreciate going through more examples of each concept we learn as well as there being more examples on the course slides to model off of. While I appreciate the challenge of having to teach myself certain things on the problem sets, I feel like there were certain concepts where I wish we were given stronger guidance, such as learning JAGS syntax. There are many concepts where we delved into sufficient examples to understand concepts, but I also feel that, in some ways, the professor assumes our prior knowledge is greater than it really is.",
                "I learned a lot in this course. Many topics were covered to a fair degree of depth. I liked that every concept/method we learned was justified, I.e. we learned not just what works but how and why it works. Biggest weakness was the speed with which the class moved. I especially disliked the use of slides in lecture because it made for less satisfying lectures that move too fast.  I think the lectures just moved way too fast. It was the kind of class where you arent going to understand the lecture as its happening, so I just stopped going and started watching the recordings.",
                "This was a well-organized course offering a solid introduction to Bayesian probability and statistics. The material and problem sets were interesting.",
                "Material can move rather quickly at times and sometimes the psets are rather difficult because problems are not gone over in class. The canvas site can be a little difficult to manage because files are not organized in the files section of canvas, but the canvas is very well planned out even though not the most intuitive. Midterm was unreasonably hard though,",
                "Strengths: the course is very well-organized \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In the past, people have praised Joe Chang; quite frankly, I found him rather rude and standoffish at times (esp when students asked questions). The course presents itself as the 'swiss knife' of intro stats courses. I felt as though the class attempted to cover far too much at once. I envy my friends who took S&DS 241 as they emerged with a thorough understanding of probability theory (enough to apply to quant firms, for example). I feel as though I received a very superficial education of prob and stat theory. I guess that's what the course presented itself as. I wish the class focused more on its strength: Markov Chains. I feel as though the brush on prob theory for the first half of the semester didn't add to the course. Further, near the end, the lectures became useless as no one had any idea what was going on and topics seemed just thrown into the syllabus (I'd say anything after the linear regression lectures was a waste of my time). \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this course was interesting. However, I feel as though the course was quite difficult with a heavy workload and yet very little help. \r\nSome pset questions essentially require you to go to office hours (because there's simply no way to solve them by relying on lectures, textbook, etc.), yet were pretty unavailable. The TA was awful and Chang's office hours made students feel bad for asking for questions. There was one ULA, Andrew Yoon, who was a blessing and the only reason a significant portion of the course had any idea what was going on.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material; combines theory and applications in R; OH was great\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were too simple compared to the problem sets which, as the semester went on, became increasingly difficult; the notes were very helpful though. Exams were also challenging. \r\nOverall a very interesting but time consuming class.",
                "Joe Chang was a great instructor. Psets were usually difficult for me, this was probably the class I spent the most time on this semester. But I really enjoyed what I was learning. I cant complain about the difficulty of the psets, because I really feel like i was learning a ton of useful content. I am walking away from this course feeling like it was a great use of my time.",
                "I think at times some of the R code could be moved to a discussion/hour-long workshop lead by the TAs to get more individualized help and practice with it.",
                "Homework were good in a way that they were complimentary to course lectures, but also were sort of challenging because not all of the materials in homework were covered in class",
                "Sometimes I struggled to understand how the homework connected to the course material--I figured it out eventually, but for the first part of the semester, the homework felt like deciphering a mysterious language using a blurry magnifying glass.",
                "Prof Chang is the best lecturer Ive had in this term, everything is very structured and well explained. the problem sets are challenging at times but interesting. this is complemented by a lot of help given by all the teaching fellows",
                "I sometimes found homework questions to be difficult to understand at first and there were times when the class moved very quickly. However, having office hours spread out over the whole week was very helpful. I liked going through the R course in class with all of the explanations.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, the lectures were recorded, all the ressources were posted online (very comprehensive Canvas page, which made it easier to study for exams and solve psets). Weaknesses: I wish the lectures were shorter, to keep the class more engaging. I also wish we didn't spend this much time on R, but maybe I should have taken 241 if I wanted a more theoretical, non computational class. The psets were rather long and a little repetitive, I wish we didn't have a take-home exam in the last week of classes.",
                "The class was recorded and the notes were very in-depth. Much of the material was delivered in a way that was very confusing and didn't feel like it flowed together.",
                "Strength: Covers a good spread of topics, not too programming heavy\r\n\r\nWeakness: the computational exam seems to have too much weight in grade calculations. Only two questions for 25%",
                "I am sad that I felt like I had to live at office hours. maybe this is because I was slower than the other students and/or didn't have any stats/probability background whatsoever. this class ate away at a lot of my time :(",
                "This course was very interesting! I especially thought the problem sets were well constructed - they felt like a good way to practice the material learned in class while still being engaging and asking interesting questions (rather than being just standard example problems). Exams felt like a good assessment of the course material as well. Lectures were easy to follow and concepts were explained well - I thought the pace could be a little slow for me at times, but I understand that this course serves students from all different backgrounds so it was good to make sure everyone could follow.",
                "I think the strength and the weakness of the course was the amount of material we covered. It was interesting to learn about many different aspects of statistics and probability but I felt that we moved very quickly and were expected to have a lot deeper of an understanding of the material after only spending a short amount of time on it. If we had done more practice/example problems rather than revisiting the same problems, I think that would have allowed for deeper understanding of concepts",
                "Honestly, this is the perfect course I have taken so far."

                "yes.",
                "This was my first S&DS course and it was extremely difficult for me. I learned a lot and the course is extremely well organized (the most well-organized course I've ever been in at Yale), but the weekly problem sets got away from me and I couldn't always finish them. Would not recommend taking this if it is your first S&DS course and if your major does not require it.",
                "Maybe. The first thing I'll say is that I do NOT feel that the prereqs for this are enough, especially if you want to get by without drowning in work. I came in with a very strong coding and pure math background and felt that that carried me enough to learn the stats concepts. However, if I hadn't had those (ESPECIALLY some experience in R because essentially the entire second half of the course is in R) I think I would've really struggled. Overall I would say if you have little to no experience spread across those three - coding, stats, and pure math - I would take a class or two (intro stats, S&DS 230?) beforehand if you want this to be survivable. If you do have that background, I would say from what I've heard this seems like a better alternative to 241 (especially if you're going on to take 242, or future R classes like 363, since there's some overlap in topics).\r\n\r\nJoe is a nice guy but I found his lectures to be unengaging - fortunately, his course notes are fantastic and a great way to review topics, and the TAs were amazing and super helpful on the problem sets. One thing I will say is he was INCREDIBLY obstinate with my accommodations to the point of almost ableism. He seemed to not understand that it was his responsibility to arrange testing accommodations for students with extra time (going so far as to sending us an email asking 'what we planned on doing for the final,' as if we could proctor the exam ourselves??) and I found myself having to frequently, frequently, frequently follow up with him and confirm or arrange testing formats for the midterm and final. Going into the final, I'm still not sure if my exam is going to be proctored correctly despite numerous attempts to communicate with Joe and the course staff, both over email and in person.  I was definitely not the only person with this problem and I sincerely hope Joe will do better for his students in the future because I was left confused and stressed as a result of his poor planning lack of communication. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: go in with more than just the prereqs, or beware. Skip lectures, read the course notes instead.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I think the content is really interesting, and I learned a lot of valueable math and coding. That being said, its the hardest class Ive taken in my time at Yale, and the lectures are deceptively easy ( especially for the first 8 lectures), relative to the difficult psets.\r\n\r\nDont take this class if youre not prepared for tough math.",
                "it's perfect",
                "Yes! I am taking it for the certificate and so glad I did. The workload is manageable, the course content is interesting, and the grading was actually very kind. They look for conceptual understanding more than perfect execution. This course seems more rigorous than 240 but less intimidating than 241.",
                "DO NOT take this class if you are a student with accommodations, Every student who needed accessibility help for class or for tests in this course was declined assistance or ghosted. It made it extremely difficult to receive the help I needed in the course or communicate with the Professor. The only person that would help was a TA who had enough on their plate and did not need to take this on.",
                "I would recommend this course for students with interest in probability and statistics and, more importantly, students with prior experience with probability and statistics, such as AP Statistics. In fact, even if a student has taken AP Statistics, I would not recommend this course unless they found AP Stats easy and thoroughly excelled in the course. This is because this course quickly glosses by a large variety of concepts in very little time, so not having sufficient knowledge foundations will make it incredibly difficult to keep up with the pace of the course. The difference in conceptual difficulty ramps up following the midterm, so even if a student seems to hang on at the beginning, it is not indicative of performance throughout an entire semester.\r\n\r\nLong story short, this should not be someone's first statistics/probability course.",
                "Yes, if youre or think you might be interested in S&DS. This course is like a microcosm of the major. It really helped me understand that S&DS is not for me, but if S&DS is for you it will affirm that it is the right choice. Even as somehow who ultimately used the course to rule out the major, I feel like it was a very useful course that was a) interesting b) challenging and c) gave me applicable knowledge and skills. Would recommend, but just know it can be a grind to get through so much material. Psets are tough and you must go to office hours, but thats definitely intentional.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course if you are considering/majoring in S&DS and want an interesting probability course that also involves some computation.",
                "Yes",
                "You have to do a lot of your own work to keep up in this class because lectures are simply not enough. If you are more math inclined, take s&ds 241. This course is explained without math whenever possible, which I found rather frustrating.",
                "Yes, if you are committed to learning higher level Bayesian statistics and want to learn how to use R to do this.",
                "For s&ds majors, I'd recommend the revamped S&DS 241 over this course. If you decide on this course, you should prob know R before taking this class; I had a pretty strong computing and math background, so I didn't struggle as much as other students. This class was valuable because it taught us Markov Chains (pretty cool) and Bayesian statistics (which isn't typical for most stats courses). However, the class attempts to teach too much, to the point that most students felt extremely lost by the end (but maybe you prefer breadth over depth). Given the choice to do it all again, I would've preferred to do the 241/242 sequence rather than this course which superficially covers the material in both courses. I don't feel like I learned Prob Theory at all (at least not more than what I covered in high school pre-calc), whereas my friends in 241 have learned enough to fare pretty well in quant interviews. Moreover, the workload, esp in comparison to 241, felt much higher. \r\n\r\nI've read various reviews recommending this class because of its practicality; that is, you do learn very powerful computational techniques that aren't covered in 241 (as 241 is completely theory-based with no computation). However, I feel as though, for any s&ds majors, you should have a thorough understanding of the theory before diving into the computation. I feel as though for Markov Chains, Chang really explained everything well, but this course shouldn't be presented as \"on par\" with 241. You learn starkly different content; the content presented is very useful, of course, but I just don't like that students \"choose\" between 241 and 238 when they really don't teach similar concepts.\r\n\r\nNow, the midterm and final exams (yes there are 2 finals for some reason) were pretty fair. I think the final exams should be merged into 1 take-home examespecially considering the fact that the in-person final covered content about the computational components of the class.",
                "Probably yes if the student finds the material interesting enough and is ready to spend a lot of time on the course. The course is not easy at all, especially towards the end.",
                "Sure, just be prepared to do the work that comes with it. I dont think you need a light semester to take this class, but I wouldnt recommend taking it with a heavy workload in other classes. Psets were hard but fun, I learned a ton of useful info.",
                "I think this is fundamental to anyone who wants a stats degree from Yale.",
                "Not if you do not have any experience with R.",
                "Overall I would recommend this course because it was a great introductory course for probability and Bayesian theory",
                "Yes! The depth and breadth of basic probability and statistics concepts is invaluable.",
                "yes. I learn a lot and everything moves on comfortably in this course",
                "yes",
                "Yes! It was quite a difficult course for me, but I felt like I learned a lot and I would recommend to anyone trying to improve their skills in statistical analysis.",
                "Yes",
                "Kind of depends on your motivation to learn statistics on a rather deep level. If you just want some background, I would take a lower-level class, and if you're more interested in the mathematical stuff, take 241. This class is required for a lot of math-adjacent majors / certificates, so if that includes yours I guess you have to take it. It's not bad, I promise, especially if it is taught by Joe Chang.",
                "If you don't have to take it, DO NOT. It starts off being all fun and games until it isn't. It's very fast-paced and the instructors don't really help you understand the already hard-to-explain material. Avoid at all costs--unless you're fine with spending every single Friday night toiling at psets. I started to dream in probabilities because of this course. In short, the expected value of a person who takes this class is misery.",
                "only if they want to major in s&ds or get the certificate",
                "Yes, if you are looking to get a comprehensive introduction to the field it is good, but tough. Psets take a while. DONT procrastinate!",
                "yes because I walked away with a decent understanding, but you should recognize that this is a difficult class (at least it was for me). i thought it would be a gut, but it was not.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! I found the material very engaging and gained a good understanding of the concepts introduced as well as insight on how this is used in the real world. Very good course",
                "Yes if they are willing to put in the outside of classroom effort and if they have taken other intro level stats classes. I did not take any other intro classes so I found the class to be a little difficult",
                "Yes and definitely. Good division between the theory part and the coding part."
