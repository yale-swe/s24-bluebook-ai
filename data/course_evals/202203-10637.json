I also enjoyed Professor Boorman's lectures, although they might not suit everyone since there is not much room for class discussion. In terms of improvements, maybe providing a discussion board for the topics we discuss would help with engagement. I would also suggest formatting the emails as a newsletter and / or having a simple website to centralize all the information."

It is low workload, and I think Professor Boorman teaches the material well, but if you aren't willing to engage with the material outside of or during class you probably will not get much out of the course."
