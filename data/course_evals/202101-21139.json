                "News-writing in Chinese, particularly the language used in official news articles and how they are different from spoken language.

                "I really learned a lot more about the current affairs on a global scale and national scale, all in my native language.",
                "I learned how to use Chinese to talk about nearly every kind of current event in the news. I learned a lot of vocabulary for discussing environmental protection issues, elderly care issues, and public health.",
                "This class is pretty straightforward, and Zhou is upfront with it from the get-go. Through a very self-directed style, this class teaches how to tailor your Chinese for journalistic style. Honestly, the class should be renamed to \"reading newspapers and writing news articles\" because that's all we really do, and \"Chinese for Current Affairs\" somewhat distorts the expectations vs. reality of the class. I did learn how to write in a journalistic style, but it's not entirely what I expected going into it, and a lot of the time it was unclear to what degree of formality my writing should be. I did learn to be think outside the box and be more creative with my Chinese, though.",
                "I greatly improved my ability to read, watch, and understand news reports in Chinese through the constant exposure to authentic materials that took place in this course.  I also noticeably strengthened my ability to write in formal Chinese, including the use of idioms, abbreviated forms, and writing styles specific to news reporting."

                "The workload is pretty significant and regular, but such regular assignments kept me on my toes. A good thing is that the individual can decide how much you want to get out of the course: the amount of new vocab words you learn each week can vary depending on what you want to get out of the course -- and I like this flexibility. Unfortunately, the workload is high, and I do spend a decent amount of time on the assignments.",
                "Perhaps due to the pandemic, it sometimes felt a little impersonal, but I'm sure that once we're back in person in a seminar room, the feeling of a classroom will be re-instituted.",
                "This class provided lots of practice in reading Chinese quickly. We read a ton! It also provided lots of opportunities to practice writing, with many homework assignments and projects. There were innumerable media resources for practicing listening as well, and we had three oral reports throughout the semester that helped with practicing prepared speeches in Chinese. However, the course often didn't provide enough space during class discussions to practice extemporaneous Chinese speaking, which is the most difficult skill to acquire. It could be improved by leaving much more open space in class discussions for students to try to express their ideas in Chinese.",
                "Strengths: Zhou is the best Chinese professor at this school, and I will not be taking other comments. He very clearly puts in a ton of work into his classes, cares about all his students, and carefully crafts his assignments. This class is supremely well organized and he certainly knows what he's doing. That being said, considering that he's been teaching this for years, there are quite a few spots for improvement. Weaknesses: discussion gets dry so incredibly quickly, it felt like why do the homework just to come to class and \"offer your opinions on the articles\" like, what is the point of explaining my kan4fa3 if literally none of the articles we are reading are opinion based? Every. Single. One. is rooted in facts: from climate change to elderly care facilities to public health, who am I to say \"I disagree with x\" in an article about an endangered species? And then the level divide in the class is so obvious from the start that it got exhausting to listen to people who couldn't say anything and then the native speakers who said too much. Then there was the inconsistency in our writing assignments: why on earth would I be writing about a mass shooting, a hate crime, a court adjudication, a rover landing, and sexual harassment if our reading assignments have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with any of that????? The level of cognitive dissonance between on the one hand flexing my Chinese skills to write a convincing fake news article about a fake military coup and then reading 2-6 articles on the AIDS crisis in China (which we never talked about in class, mind you) made no sense whatsoever. Plus, some of the articles had so much content that you could never remember all the details, and sometimes he would ask pointed questions in class and other times we'd derail the conversation. It frankly didn't cohere that for a class focused on more speaking practice, for over half of class, it is only Zhou speaking, going over the model articles for our homework writing assignments word for word, line by line, having us watch news reel clips (that also seemed out of place b/c we never did anything with them) and then maybe having ten minutes left to speak - but those ten minutes were \"what's your opinion.\" Sorry to break it to you, but maybe the  articles were just confirmation bias that the US wasn't doing great with COVID, but how many more times can I say \"I was certainly unsurprised by this article\"? Not many! And then honestly, what was up with assigning the final exam (which isn't really an exam don't worry), a final news recording (which required fancy editing as prescribed in the rubric, I spent 12 hours on it), AND a real news article all due within a week of each other? Candidly, that was the most absurd amount of work I've ever had to do for a Chinese class, especially considering we had just piggybacked off of a long presentation too. I also did not like the lack of guidance on the presentations, the incredibly minimal comments on our homework news assignments (no actual commentary, just \"nice use of shumian yu\" like thanks.. but you've said that 10 times now, like can you comment on the actual content?), and the Quizlets. Zhou gets the same comments year after year about the Quizlet requirement and never changes it. Fine. Keep it. But don't make me redo all of the sets before the exams are due, especially if nobody actually does redo them since that takes way too much time. TL;DR great professor but a bit of a wack class with very, very little guidance that should be there. Zhou says he's \"not your fumu\" but at the same time, for a language class, it's an awful lot like a lecture with a share your thoughts section. I would certainly appreciate more guidance and maybe a handout on conventional Chinese news style because that's what I lost points on if I ever did. Because he grades way too leniently: why is the average on most assignments a 99??",
                "A clear strength of this course is its exclusive use of authentic news materials  both written and audiovisual  to learn and practice using real, high-level Chinese in context.  This course also benefits from its inclusion of wide variety of topics, which ensures each unit is fresh and engaging for students.  Professor Zhou also added a great deal to this course through his lively and caring style of instruction, as well as his commitment to ensuring each student received tailored feedback and help no matter what their proficiency level."

                "Yes. If you are interested in significantly boosting your written and spoken Chinese (for more formal situations) and move beyond just being able to hold down a conversation with someone else, I would definitely recommend this. Zhou laoshi is very accommodating and open to having chats with students, and I appreciate how he allows each student the flexibility to decide how much they want to get out of the course. Be prepared for weekly assignments and significant amounts of reading that will push you beyond your comfort zone (news articles, op-eds, other publications etc). Sometimes the vocab you learn might be oddly specific to a very small topic, but on balance you do learn a lot about a pretty wide variety of topics (that are very relevant and recent!)",

                "Totally!! Especially if you have an interest in learning about the news in Chinese (as the title of the course suggests) you'll be able to learn a lot from the professor and he's a super sweet man.",
                "This is a fantastic class. It is probably the most useful Chinese class I ever took (in 13 years of studying Chinese). This is exactly what you need to be able to engage that Chinese person sitting next to you on the plane who wants to know your opinion on American gun policy, what you think of China's environmental pollution, if you heard about the blizzard that hit the Northeast US, and all the other common things you end up talking about when you interact with strangers in China. You learn a lot about the world and current events as well through this class, often through an international lens.",
                "Eh, good question. I took it to learn about news writing style and to make sure I kept my Chinese up, and while my Chinese has \"improved\" I can't say it was from this class. Sure, I know how to write a newspaper article in Chinese now, but my use of formal language is literally no better than it was before. Any improvements in my shumianyu usage have come from my own, independent work, or from the reading assignments we very seldom went over. Why assign them all if we're NEVER gonna talk about them all? Pick one or two and ask some guiding questions, for crying out loud. So all in all, super easy not so time consuming keep up your language level class, then YES. Actually really learn something and genuinely have a passion for writing news, interesting questions, more so in the middle. Primary Chinese language learning class post-L5, NO,",
                "Absolutely.  Professor Zhou did an excellent job making this an interesting, far-reaching, and  most importantly  extremely practical course.  For anyone interested in learning and practicing how to use Chinese in both daily life and professional settings, this course is perhaps the most useful you can take at Yale or beyond."
