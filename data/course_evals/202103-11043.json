I also think my speaking skills improved significantly due to how discussion-driven this course was and the fact that most of our projects were presentations. The essays also really developed my formal writing skills and ability to conduct research in French.",
                "I learned so much about various aspects of medicine throughout the world, all the while practicing my French in a thoughtful, engaging way.",
                "I learned about medical ethics, healthcare access disparities, cultural differences in healthcare, and some of the major issues in big pharmaceutical companies' modus operandi. I also learned to participate in discussions in French and prepare presentations about technical topics in an easy-to-understand way.",
                "Vocabulary and conversation strengthened.",
                "I developed a vast amount of knowledge of the medical system in France and several Francophone countries. I also developed a large pool of French medical/health vocabulary, and became well versed in a lot of health topics, diseases, medical organisations/NGOs, etc.",
                "I increased my vocabulary significantly, mostly about medical subjects. I also learned a lot about various health issues from a French perspective, and I became more comfortable speaking.",
                "This class introduces a wide range of topics all discussing ethical dilemmas within the medical world. You don't need any prior medical-specific knowledge and honestly don't learn any in the class, rather you spend time delving into topics that raise moral and ethical questions in global health and medical related issues. You are required to speak and participate frequently in class all in French and the essays and oral presentations require a lot of engagement with the material."

                "The strengths of the class were a good structure, and planned syllabus. You always knew what we were going to discuss and the sources were always excellent. However, if you do not have a strong level of proficiency in French, it may be difficult to keep up with the in-class discussion.",
                "Strengths include the breadth of material covered and the cultural diversity in sources.",
                "I love this class and Business French. Monsieur Tertrain is a wonderful teacher, and I really like how he has organized the class (2 crit, 3 exposs, and 3 quizzes are perfect).",
                "Strength: Monsieur Tertrain was an excellent professor and is truly one of the best French professors at Yale. Not only is he a good teacher, he is also very kind and understanding. The course is very structured with clear expectations, and you get to learn a lot about the topics that are on the syllabus, including through French literature/novels.\r\nNo weakness",
                "The course is not much homework, though there are a good number of larger assignments that are all graded very fairly. It was nice to have very little homework, but I also felt my engagement overall was a bit lower since so much time would pass between class meetings. This class is very well suited for someone who is already quite comfortable with French, since there is not too much time to improve speaking or writing. I would perhaps have liked to have finished the books we started as a class. We only read select excerpts in each, so I felt it was a little less enjoyable.",
                "Weakness some of the movies like la Sociale are very hard to comprehend.\r\nThe second half content was more stimulating than the first half.",
                "A strength of the class is it's very interesting and explores a diverse range of topics without dwelling too long on anything giving anyone time to get bored. You also have a lot of freedom in the content of the larger assignments in terms of what you want to write or present about. A weakness of this class is that a few main people end of dominating the class discussion who are either native or near-native French speakers because the class discussion moves quite fast. It would be more ideal if the class was structured in a way that encouraged more breadth of participation. Also there was way too much paper printed throughout the course."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in medicine and studying French here. The conversations are always very thought-provoking, and I also could visibly see my own improvement in terms of speaking/writing throughout the semester. The topics we covered were genuinely interesting, and you didn't necessarily need a strong background in science to participate.",
                "This is the best class I have taken at Yale!! If you are interested in medicine and looking for an upper-level French course, this is the one to take.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to students who are interested in bioethics, medical dilemmas, or are pre-med.",
                "YESSSSSSS! Monsieur Tertrain is an amazing teacher. I don't even like medicine, but I do love French culture and taking this course has aided my understanding of French culture in general.",
                "Yes, of course! Even if youre not a pre-med you get to improve your vocabulary, speaking skills, French presentation skills and writing skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are primarily interested in the medical aspect. The course is not structured to give extensive feedback on grammar or language use, so it is ideal for people who are already quite comfortable or who are not overly invested in improving their French in itself.",
                "It is a great class to understand healthcare in other regions of the world.",
                "This course demands a lot of engagement for each and every assignment. Every class, there is a required short response, along with regular essays and oral presentations so just be aware of that as a commitment. It ended up taking up most of my time doing homework in between midterms and finals. Otherwise, I would recommend this class because the professor puts in a lot of time for creating interesting discussions, picking engaging material, and giving super specific feedback to your writing and speaking."
