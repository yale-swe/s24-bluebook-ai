Nor had I thought about energy distribution among conformations (states) of systems and probability in the way we encountered the concepts in the course. I constantly had the feeling that I was learning to justify conclusions encountered in chemistry courses from an entirely new perspective. It was like climbing a mountain one had climbed many times before-but from the other side.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this class became clearest towards the end of the semester, while studying for the final. Though in any individual lecture a given equation or fact might appear on the screen, be absorbed into working memory, and then be built upon by the next equation or fact, often any sense of general cohesion to a given days' content was lacking. Only in surveying the course as a whole does this cohesion become apparent; concepts are introduced at the earliest possible moment, then reintroduced later with further scaffolding from related ideas, then reintroduced yet again as the scaffolding for some new concept, then required to be used on a problem set without being named, and so on until, over the course of the entire semester, the conception and use of individual ideas becomes second nature, even if those ideas are exceedingly difficult to comprehend individually. However, this broad picture fails to capture a good deal of the blank-minded gaping and head-shaking which typically accompanied the first introduction of various ideas of the course outside the strict progression of lectures, despite the best efforts of all involved. Additionally, a major strength of this class, all too easy to forget but not to be understated, is the extent to which prior experience with multivariable calculus is not a prerequisite; after never having found a partial derivative before, I never felt I lacked the quantitative skills for the class.",
                "Although the material was difficult, I felt that classes were well-organized in that they didn't try to cram too many topics in one day, and Prof. Ganim always built in lots of time for questions. I would have appreciated more of a chance to do practice problems in class, but since the class focuses more on derivations and concepts rather than directly applying those concepts to calculations, I understand why it might be hard to built that in to class time. I really liked the class powerpoints, as they were very visually well-made and outlined derivation steps very clearly; however, I would have liked to see more details on the slides, as I often felt that if I hadn't paid attention to the slide in class, or had to miss the class, then I wouldn't really understand what was going on from the slides themselves. I guess that would make the slides quite cluttered and difficult to read though, so I think it would be really awesome if the class was recordedespecially with this kind of material, that's really hard to grasp the first time around (at least for me)!",
                "I thought it was super fun, really interesting, and super informative. My only critique is that all classes should be recorded to accommodate for disabled students and students with mental health issues.",
                "As far as strengths go, the lecture slides are very well-crafted. Also, solutions to homework and exams are available promptly, which gives students plenty of time to review them. The professor and teaching assistant offered ample office hours and responded to emails in a timely fashion-which was very good to address student inquiries. \r\n\r\nThe hour long mid-term exams felt a bit short of adequate time to think through and respond to the questions. \r\n\r\nThe hour long duration felt a bit short, in general.",
                "The strengths of this course included its very clear organization and the small size of the class, which made it easier to ask questions and stay engaged. While the material was difficult, I found the proofs and derivations quite interesting. Professor Ganim is also a clear lecturer, and he helped break down complex concepts into relatively easier ways to understand. I thought the workload was reasonable, and we received very fast feedback on the problem sets. The first two midterms were also very fair, and I really appreciated that the exams were all open-note. The biggest strength of the class was probably Ethan, our TF, who was super helpful, and I really appreciated having discussion sections to clarify lecture material, despite our class size already being so small. \r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the course was how long it took to get feedback on the exams, so by the time we were given our exams back, some of the material on there was already weeks old and felt harder to recall. I also often found myself getting confused by some of the lecture slides when I tried to review them since certain details wouldn't make sense without Professor Ganim's verbal explanation. Additionally, I think all of the students in the class were very caught off guard by the third midterm since almost none of the material on it felt similar to any of the practice problems from the textbook or from problem sets, so I believe there was some miscommunication there.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA were both very open to questions and comments\r\n\r\nWeakness: No peer tutors, sometimes the lecture notes were hard to understand when re-reading them",
                "Classes were not recorded. Lecture slides did not contain all the information taught in class. So, if a class was missed for any reason, it would be very difficult to catch up. Homework content was harder than what we learned in class. The third midterm's content was completely dissimilar to anything we covered in class or homework. Sometimes, homework feedback would not be given in time for exams."

                "I came into this course with a lifelong love of the non-quantitative, hand-wavey version of thermodynamics I had been taught in general chemistry classes throughout my scientific career, as well as a longstanding, albeit inexplicable, interest in phase transitions. Though this would suggest that I was primed to enjoy every second of the class, I found that my enthusiasm for the material under discussion was only kindled occassionally. Instead, most of my enjoyment came from engaging with Professor Ganim, who is a very compelling speaker who never hesitates to increase engagement with a funny video or pop cultural reference. Thus, it is likely that anyone thinking of taking this course for the sake of the material, rather than a requirement, would be dissapointed. For those taking it as a requirement, it covers the material in a brisk and effective manner, and is likely to prove an effective foundation for any future forays into the biophysical realm.",
                "If you're thinking about taking this course, you're probably an MB&B major who has to take this course to fulfill the biophysics requirement. Although there are pros\/cons to both this course and CHEM 332 (the other P Chem), I would recommend this course if you're interested in being in a more intimate learning environment with fewer students (and thus more access to the professor\/TA), as well as if you are interested in learning about biological application of physical chemistry (e.g. protein folding).",
                "I really like the prof, so yeah. Its a great class! However, until they start recording it, you have to attend in person. If you skip, youll fail.",
                "Yes. If a student enjoys chemistry or is obligated to take physical chemistry and is also interested in human biology, I would recommend this course. It really complements the knowledge base built in general, organic, and biochemistry.",
                "Overall, I still would recommend this course to another student who needs to take physical chemistry and is choosing between this course or CHEM 332. I think the biggest advantage of this course lies in its small class size, since being able to have better access to peers, the professor, and the TF is crucial when learning something as difficult as physical chemistry. Also, having the exams be open-note was also a big plus, since this way I could focus more on conceptual learning rather than rote memorization. Either way, physical chemistry is just a hard subject to learn regardless of which course you take, but I found this course to have some clear merits.",
                "I did not take CHEM 332, but I believe this course is a better choice for those who want a smaller class size. I felt very comfortable participating in this class because of the smaller class size. This course seemed to build a stronger professor-student connection. Professor Ganim and Ethan knew all of our names, and they both cared about each individual's progress.",
