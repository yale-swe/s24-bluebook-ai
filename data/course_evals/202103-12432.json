Was pretty cool to learn some of the ways you can value various projects, and to see the economic arguments for better environmental practices. Sometimes the course felt too economics-sided as we didn't really look at more qualitative issues (but instead focused almost solely quantitatively). A great introduction to this area, but it felt like there is a lot more to be explored and that the course could be better organized to show us these starting points, recognize them as starting points, and point to where else you go.",

                "Weaknesses: Your grade suffers from even an excused absence from section. Section isn't even that useful, especially since almost nobody participated.\r\nStrengths: This class was very interesting, and Prof. Mendelsohn is an expert. It also isn't too much of a workload, and it covers a lot of topics that you have probably never thought about but will enjoy learning.",
                "Strengths: it's not very hard. Learning about the economic rationale behind environmental management decisions such as timber use and fisheries was actually pretty interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The professor has some HOT takes, such as \"we should raise the price of national parks and then hold a lottery for poor people who can't afford it.\" and \"it is economically efficient to use all the water in a river\". It was kind of funny honestly.",
                "The pset questions and test questions are incredibly vague and the TAs had to provide extensive clarifications throughout the semester. The psets were often very simple, but the math required to do them was explained so poorly or little in lecture that they became very time intensive and I went to office hours nearly every week for guidance. The TAs were excellent, but the course content itself did not focus on what was tested nearly enough.",
                "Review of mathematical processes in class would be helpful.  TA office hours were the place where I learned the math, however on the final exam I was at a loss for how to apply concepts.  This might also have been a personal failing, but I was frustrated throughout the course at my inability to conceptualize the mathematical explanations without direct assistance from either classmates or a TA (I found the theory fairly basic and easy to reason through, if questionable in terms of ethic).\r\n\r\nI was happy to visit Professor Mendelsohn in office hours almost weekly, we shared thought provoking conversation and he was very helpful for thinking about concepts beyond the class.\r\n\r\nI would advocate for a class prerequisite in the EVST/ER&M major be required before a student enroll in this course.  There must be other exposure to environmental/cultural ethic for this class to be received in an informed, responsible, contextualized manner.  I would also hope to see this course become a core rather than elective in the Econ major.  As the problems of the environment progress, we will be forced to confront our collective responsibility and I am terrified at the prospect of those involved heavily with the market as being unexposed to these basic ideas presented to them in a context with which they are familiar.  It is the responsibility of this institution to equip these young thinkers and innovators, and to neglect to include the environment in that education is not prudent and frankly is immoral.",
                "This class should not be labeled an environmental studies class. It is an econ class that very clearly values money over the earth. I wasted space on my schedule taking this class. The workload is incredibly disproportional. Unclear whether to label this class as a gut or just a pain in my ass. Final exam took the last light out of me.",
                "Weakness is wording on exams is unclear",
                "There aren't many strengths with the course unfortunately. The workload is quite low, but I thought the class was poorly organized. The problem sets had barely anything to do with what we learned with class. It was not clear what the grade distribution was going to be, and overall, it just seemed like the course engagement was low. It wasn't a great class.",
                "Weakness: almost every class seems exactly like the last in terms of what you learn. The only difference is the topic upon which the concepts are applied.",
                "Tests were extremely difficult. Psets were very easy but riddled with typos and missing assumptions. Lectures were informative but provided no time for questions.\r\n\r\nTo improve I would try to make more interactive and spend more time improving psets. Readings we're assigned but never brought up even in syllabus slides so uncertain if they were necessary",
                "Psets dont align with what we learn in class",
                "The lectures were very interesting, and Professor Mendelsohn is an extremely engaging lecturer. The content of the course and the lectures in which it was delivered were definitely one of its strengths. However, the content did not always align well with the problem sets, and we were rarely taught the mathematical techniques necessary for completing these homework assignments. The TAs would have to spend most of the discussion section explaining to us how to even start the problem sets. These homeworks had so little instruction and assumed a lot of background knowledge and intuition that was not taught in class. This was a shame, given how interesting the actual course content was.",
                "Topics were interesting. Sometimes was frustrating that the class kept emphasizing that we need to find the optimal amount of pollution for society...just felt kind of weird from an environmental perspective.",
                "It was extremely disorganized.",
                "Could be organized better to have lectures and psets match up better and have a more qualitative side to the course, or at least open-ended questions that get you to explore and think on the things learned in class. Felt much more like a regurgitation class at some points with little critical thinking involved. I also think lectures could be more succinct and perhaps the slides revamped to have a better formating.",
                "I appreciated Prof Mendelsons lectures and the use of current events in section",
                "Strengths: The course teaches you to think differently than what you might learn from listening to news cycles, environmentalists, mass media, etc. Weaknesses: Complete disorganization, not very useful, unclear expectations, evaluation is not based on what you learn in class.",
                "Lectures were not paced well, if they go through the important information first it would be more worthwhile",

                "Lectures content was very interesting, but I think it could be more engaging with different elements like poll surveys or other tools. A big weakness is the disconnect between the lecture content and the psets. We talk about calculation methods very abstractly in lectures, which makes it very difficult to apply them when doing the psets. It would have been very helpful if either the lecture or sections helped more (before submission) with the pset material and connecting it to lecture content.",

                "Strengths: I found the material interesting, the pure economics solutions to these issues were often not the usual solutions you hear about and probably would not learn about them otherwise, the professor clearly knows his stuff and I thought his lectures were pretty interesting and easy enough to follow along. The TF sections were extremely helpful especially for psets, and though the weekly psets were sometimes annoying, they forced you to keep up with the material and not fall behind.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the psets were kind of all over the place. Sometimes they felt very relevant from lecture and like we had the tools to do them, and other times they felt kind of out of the blue like we had no idea the methods to solve them except maybe a few equations on a slide that way barely mentioned. They also varied greatly from being extremely easy to extremely difficult. \r\n\r\nThe professor definitely has some controversial ideas that the environmentalists in the class disagree with (ex: fracking is good). I think this is both a strength and a weakness because we are learning from a different perspective than is usually depicted, but it is also somewhat of a one sided depiction as we don't get any counterarguments.",
                "- Strengths- \r\n- Weakness- lectures did not help with Psets",

                "The material was interesting and the professor was very knowledgeable about the field. TA Winston was awesome and very helpful \r\n\r\nOnly weakness is that the course material (although very interesting) isnt challenging enough for their to be a strict curve",
                "Strengths - low workload and course poses interesting questions and perspectives around environmental protections. \r\nWeaknesses - problem set questions and midterm and final feel like curve balls and material isnt covered in depth in lecture.",
                "There seems to be a disconnect between what was taught in the lectures and problem sets.",
                "This course had really great lectures and the material was interesting. The problem sets were generally fairly easy and more difficult problem sets likely would have helped with learning the material thoroughly. The questions on both problem sets and exams had a tendency to be vague and therefore confusing, which could be improved for next time with longer, more specific phrasing.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\n1. Questions on the psets and midterm were ambiguous and difficult to understand  to clarify, it's not that the questions themselves were difficult, but they were worded so poorly that often it was hard to get what they were asking.\r\n2. Grading for the short-answer questions on the midterm also felt arbitrary  we would receive rather vague, open-ended questions, and even if you essentially fully answer the question, you would receive points off here and there for not using a specific phrase / idea.\r\n3. The mathematical concepts were easy to understand in class, but it was unnecessarily hard to review after class because the notation and formatting of equations and graphs in the lecture slides were done hastily / in a confusing manner.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n1. The TFs were helpful in clarifying questions.\r\n2. Learning about managing timber was cool.",
                "Professor talks about nothing for 90% of the time and says crazy things. Literally no logic or regard for human life or the world. I get that its economics but its really wack.",
                "Were the material in this course not highly relevant today, it would have no redeeming qualities. This course does offer a basic understanding of benefits and shortcomings of programs like cap and trade, carbon offset markets, and renewable subsidies; however, the weaknesses of this course far outweigh these strengths.\r\n\r\nThe course material is increasingly outdated and represents views that are not consistent with the current consensus in climate science. Many of the readings were published in the 1990s and early 2000s. Professor Mendelsohn suggested 4C of global warming from current temperatures might be the optimal level because much of the mitigation costs would fall on generations after 2070. Likewise, he suggested that the benefits of climate change in northern areas, like increased crop fertilization, may outweigh the costs in equatorial regions.\r\n\r\nThe PSETs are often busy work, repetitive exercises in setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost to find the optimal solution, and do not expand a students understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nThe lecture slides had mathematical inconsistencies, sloppy short-hand notation, and hand-wavy explanations on how one step flows to the other. Consistently, there were typos and poor wording in the lecture slides, the PSETs, and midterm that made the material difficult to follow or understandusing profit and revenue interchangeably, asking students to calculate the area of a circle instead of the area of an annulus (the area between two concentric circles), using regulations as a synonym for quantity standards and to describe all possible government policies, quantity standards and taxes included. The PSETs were so confusing the TFs began to preemptively send clarifying emails to all the students, anticipating a flurry of questions. Another TF said they felt sorry for the students because they felt the wording on the midterm was unfair and caused many students to lose points when they in fact understood the material.\r\n\r\nThis class needs a total overhaulin readings, lecture slides, exams, and assignmentsand an injection of fresh life to better organize it for learning and bring it up to date.",

                "As described above, some of the science was incorrect. Additionally, it's no surprise that the high discount rate was taken almost as fact during lecture due to the influence of Nordhaus. The class does do well to attempt to remain neutral in what is often a very politically charged topic. It would be great if the class expanded more on global policy more often rather than only in the last unit of the class.",
                "Strengths were p sets to prepare for exams, weaknesses were not enough learning in lecture about the p sets.",
                "Problems sets were poorly written, TAs were good though",
                "A BIG weakness is the fact that the lectures and the problem sets seem like theyre entirely different classes. The stuff covered in lecture are more conceptual, but the problem sets are very quantitative. And they wouldnt be terrible, if it werent for the fact that were not taught how to do the things asked in them. The questions in the problem sets are also confusing and sometimes miss important information that is pertinent to actually getting the right answer.",
                "I think incorporating more conceptual questions in the problems sets would be helpful. Or maybe go over examples of the numeric questions in class.",
                "Weaknesses: the course material is nonsensical at times. The psets are solved through arbitrary methods that often do not portray broader economic frameworks or reasoning.",
                "Strengths: lectures were clear and logically organised. The TF sessions were particularly interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: the wording of the problem sets and exams was often ambiguous. The confusion could likely have been reduced if the terminology was used and explained in lecture, but unfortunately this was generally not the case. It was frustrating that because of this confusion it was near impossible to successfully complete the problem sets by oneself (you had to attend office hours to understand what the questions were asking for). \r\nThe course was also almost entirely based on rote learning of theories and methods, and did not encourage critical thinking. For instance, we learnt many times over the course of the semester how to calculate an \"efficient\" outcome using assumed values, but rarely if ever were we asked to consider what the true value of the \"efficient\" outcome is (is efficiency always the most equitable solution?), or how the assumptions made from the outset may have biased the conclusion. This was particularly problematic in a course that deals with profound moral questions, such as how to equitably distribute resources and engage with the environment. Although these questions were implicit in the nature of the course's content, it almost felt as if it was intentionally avoiding the complexities of those questions. The result was that the learning was reductive and often reached conclusions that, if they were to be enacted in the real world, would result in undesirable consequences. Some examples how the first lecture suggested that the lack of action to mitigate climate change was a result of victim's inaction rather than that of firms (which, although I understand the economic argument, fails to engage the justice principles that should morally determine responsibility); and the failure to question why discounting the rights of future generations to a healthy environment is just (again, while I understand the financial argument that future generations will be \"richer,\" this fails to consider exactly who will be richer, and what the uneven impacts of climate change are and will be).",
                "No comment",
                "The content of this course is interesting and approachable. My one qualm was that the problem sets were more quantitative than the lectures, and therefore the math was hard to learn because it was not always grounded in theory.",
                "The content was very interesting but sometimes seemed to be outdated and the lectures could be more engaging."

                "Yes! This is a pretty easy course that teaches you important things about the environment and economics. For econ majors, this is a great elective which will teach you how to use your knowledge to help the planet. For non-econ majors, this is a cursory overview of economic thinking while still covering a broad range of environmental topics.",
                "I would recommend as an easier ECON elective or as a class with some environmental implications. I think the Professor's views on climate change shouldn't be taken as 100% truth- climate experts want to limit warming to below 2 degrees C but according to this professor, that's not even close to necessary, and warming (up to a certain extent) is actually beneficial?? But there are a lot of useful topics taught in this class and it is a nice 4th or 5th class to take.",
                "While this class was incredibly confusing at times, in regards to the difference between psets and course content, and Professor Mendelsohn had very controversial takes on climate change in a few of the lectures, it was also incredibly interesting. I'm glad that I took the course, but I believe that the course either needs a new professor or major restructuring so that the content is more cohesive and learning and understanding is emphasized more than memorizing the economic problem in the environment and its solution. It's a low workload class, but some weeks the psets are so vague and barely related to the lecture slides that I had to devote many hours to understanding very simple concepts.",
                "Nice econ gut. Super easy psets. only thing is that it's still on the econ curve so half the class is still getting Bs even though I'm pretty sure we all did well on the final...",
                "Yes, but please remember the place of economics.  It is one, new way of thinking, and the global economic system is a direct cause of climate change.  It's ridiculous to believe that this course will equip one with the full breadth of understanding of the value of natural resources or the environment.  Overall, the lessons I learned in this course did not make me hopeful.  Even the \"success\" stories of fisheries or forest management rang hollow.  If anything, the course caused me to resent the system and human conditions which have enabled the exploitation of our COLLECTIVE (living organism - human and non human) right to a safe environment.  I do not believe the market can regulate that which it is designed to \"utilize efficiently and completely\", not when the corruptive and exploitative tendencies of human nature are encouraged in the name of short term profit, and governing/regulatory bodies are paralyzed by the inability of a poorly educated society to recognize and prioritize basic needs.",

                "I think this course had issues but is very important for all people to be informed about environmental issues and the ways to combat them\r\n\r\nAt many times, the course was frustrating because economic analysis of environmental issues totally ignored the justice aspects of global warming and climate policy. Learning that subsidizing renewable electricity actually increases the use of fossil fuels and that recycling causes less trees to be planted is very hard to hear\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are not challenging and not much work is required outside of class which is nice but because everything is relatively easy, missing a few points can really hurt you in the curve",

                "If you want the economic perspective on environmental studies, then yes. It's pretty easy, but BE WARNED that Prof. Mendelsohn's test questions can be really confusing.",
                "If you're interested in any of the relevant fields yes. I think it is the best introduction to this intersection of environmental and economic-related areas available to us at Yale, and while the course could certainly be improved it does give you a basic understanding of each topic and show you some cool methods of looking at them. It is frustrating and points, and you do not do much critical thinking in terms of extending off of what the course teaches you, but I wouldn't understand as much as I do about various types of pollution and environmental resource management without this course.",
                "Yes. This introduces an extremely useful way to view environmental issues and search for solutions. Environmental crises will not be solved without serious economic considerations of the costs and benefits of different forms of mitigation.",
                "If I had to go back, I'd probably still take the class. Lectures weren't really necessary, and the problem sets take about 30 minutes once you know what you're doing. That being said, it is very rare that you know what you're doing. Oftentimes the problem sets would have literally nothing to do with what we learned in lectures, which was very frustrating at times. Overall assessment of this course is that it is a solid gut; very light load, not very challenging, is somewhat interesting, but the lack of direction can be very frustrating.",

                "I think this is an interesting course that introduces students to a different perspective to the environmental problems we face. There is a lot of material that is extremely pertinent to current discussions and that we are surprisingly not familiar with. I don't think it is the most organized or helpful in terms of reinforcing the material, but if you're looking for an introduction to the material, it is a very interesting course that I would recommend.",

Definitely need a bit of a background in econ (supply & demand curves) and to be able to take simple derivatives to do the psets, but if not OH and the TFs are very helpful. The weekly psets are sometimes a bit annoying, but they are not too much work (if you're familiar with the simple math/econ usually an hourish or less, every once in a while more like 2 hours). I found this course interesting and sometimes a bit challenging to the ideas I feel are often projected in media. If you are more of an environmentalist though, you may not agree with some of the professor's opinions, but he is very passionate and knowledgable and definitely believes we need to take action to care for our environment (just maybe not in as radical a way).",
                "Yes to someone who is interested in environmental economics.",

The material from the pollution and nonrenewable resources segment is pretty useful and pertinent -- the renewable not so much.

                "Yes if you are taking this major as an econ or other major. Even as a senior econ major this course was difficult at times to see the connection between what was taught in the lecture and what was asked to do in the problem sets.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course! I approached it from an academic background with little economics experience, and yet I still found the course valuable and very interesting. This course has shifted my perspective on a lot of environmental issues and I think anyone who wants to go into an environmentally-focused field after college should take it.",
                "If you want a super low workload econ class, then yes. But if you dont want to suffer and lose braincells then no",
                "NO! I am considering climate finance as a career and am very interested in environmental policy. I would not recommend this class to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe course material is outdated and out of touch with current climate discussions. We learned that 4C of global warming from current temperatures was ideal, that there are large benefits to climate change in northern regions, that fisheries have no value (because their total revenue=total cost), so it does not matter if they are destroyed from climate change. \r\n\r\nThe PSETs are busy work, confusing, and a waste of time. The lecture slides have typos, and the graphs are all in blue and poorly labeled, making them difficult to understand. \r\n\r\nOn the midterm, poor wording caused many students to receive half credit on a simple question. Professor Mendelsohn apologized in class yet said he wouldnt do anything about it because the curve would sort everything out anyway. One of the TFs later apologized, saying he thought the wording was unfair to students.\r\n\r\nAt Yale, there are so many interesting courses offered each semester, but you only get to take a few. Do not take this one or you will regret it.",
                "yes! learned a lot",

                "No.",
                "Definitely not. By far the worst class Ive taken at Yale. The workload is pretty low, but even if youre looking for a gut or easy Econ elective there are much better options. The first weeks of the class are fine, the content is interesting and it makes sense. Over time, especially after the midterm, the course is based on complete nonsense.",
                "I would not recommend this course if there are other options available. I felt I learnt very little that meaningfully helped to answer questions about how to engage with the environment, and was frustrated by the lack of critical thinking.",
                "No comment",
                "Yesif the topic interests you, take it. The course is engaging and approachable. The content matches the course description and Professor Mendelsohn has much to offer from his own career and perspectives.",
