   "comments": [
    "The material of the course is interesting, but the readings for some weeks felt a little scattershot, and the syllabus in general may be too ambitious. The course might benefit from greater focus (rather than Digital Anthropology, perhaps Selected Topics in Digital Anthropology would be better). I was also disappointed by the structure of the seminar discussions, which relied very heavily on student presenters and didn't involve much input from Professor Zucker. If she took a more active role in facilitating class discussion (and sharing some of her own thoughts), I think the course would benefit from it.",
    "I wish I could have learned more from the professor! She is incredibly insightful, but most of the lecturing was left to the students.",
    "Incredibly interesting topics supported by very dated readings. Discussions were very weird.",
    "The weekly presentations were a good way to introduce questions to the group, but because of how long they always went sometimes I felt that it detratced from class discussion, because the presenter couldn't get through their whole presentation or because the class wasn't able to share their own thoughts."

    "Although this course shows potential, its current organization makes it difficult to recommend. The syllabus stretches a bit too far, lacking the sustained focus required to maintain through-lines from class to class, and the seminar discussion relies heavily on student presenters, with little input or guidance from Professor Zucker. With a more focused syllabus and a more active and engaged instructor, this course could really shineespecially given the relevance of its topicbut in its present form it does not.",
    "Absolutely. Necessary topics to think about.",
    "Absolutely! This is incredibly necessary for anyone wanting to study anthropology or the social sciences.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you are interested in the increasing amount of digital technology in our society and how it has become inseparable from everyday life. I also loved reading so many ethnographies. It is pretty heavy on reading but they actually are all interesting. Any kind of interest you may have related to the digital can be explored in this course."
