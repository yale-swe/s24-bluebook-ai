            "comments": [
                "Every Thursday, we discussed a medical paper. Hearing other people's views about a paper helped to understand the paper from different perspectives.",
                "Course material was always accessible through clear explanations in lecture and well-designed slides, such that even if I had to miss a lecture, I was able to review the concepts and catch up afterwards. It would have been even more helpful if additional pre-recorded video lectures were provided as well.",
                "weaknesses: Lectures were not engaging, slides were uninformative, concepts weren't explained well and I only grasped the content after doing Google searches",
                "Strengths: Professor Meyers is such a nice guy, very positive, and has a good sense of humor even if a little corny. He seems to actually care about the topic he is teaching as well.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The final was not very well structured to the quizzes and p-sets and the practice we did on those.",
                "A strength is that a lot of review was incorporated so it helped the concepts stick. A weakness is that it didn't feel like a very helpful class, we mostly just memorized a lot of definitions of medical statistics which doesn't really help you understand statistics better. There were a few topics that were useful, though. We also had to read medical study papers every week which felt more like busywork than something that is actually helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course was the half semester introduction. I was able to learn a lot through having both in-person lectures and lecture recordings. The lecture recording were extremely helpful since that I was able to watch them and strengthen my understanding of concepts that I didnt quite understand in the in-person lecture. \r\n\r\nThis strength is what made the latter concentration a weakness for me. There were no lecture recordings so I had a difficult time reviewing concepts on my own. However, office hours helped with this weakness and was a strength of the concentration (105).",
                "A strength was the online quizzes making sure you knew the proper content at the right times. Weakness was not lots of participation in lectures.",
                "Ethan's instructing was poor",
                "I thought this class was well designed. There were multiple ways to learn the material, its just up to the student to not fall behind.",
                "I thought the courses model was fairly well designedI liked the fact that a lot of the work was collaborative and could be done on our own pace.",
                "First half of the course was very engaging, and I appreciated being able to attend class live or watch the prerecorded lectures. The problem sets were very helpful.",
                "I enjoyed all the resources and office hours of this course. It could be improved my making it more engaging.",
                "For the 105 portion of the course, I felt that the homework assignments and the weekly readings were both engaging and taught me a lot about how to use what we were talking about in class. I would have appreciated more guidance on some of the questions on the homework--the more open-ended ones took me forever because I wasn't sure how much I was expected to write. I also wish we spent more time discussing the readings, because that was really fun. I had a lot of trouble staying focused during the lecture portion of class because there were so many slides and it becomes hard to tell the emphasis Prof. Moss is placing on the material-- it's difficult to pinpoint the most important themes or formulas or rules because of the sheer magnitude we're given each class. Maybe condensing material and spending more time on pseudo data like we did on the homework would be more engaging? For example, spending 45 min on new content and then working through data in small groups and coming up with our own interpretations and then sharing with the whole class for the last 30 min."

If you just want to take a statistics class and dont have a preference on the topic, a different concentration might be better depending on what youre looking for. The statistics concentrations are not all equal as some of them had more forgiving testing policies than the others and had recorded lectures while others did not. For example, some statistics concentrations had a online, open-book final while 105s final was closed-book and in-person.",
