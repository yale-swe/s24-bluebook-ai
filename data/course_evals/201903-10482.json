    "I really gained an appreciation for biomedical image processing and analysis. It's so interesting to look at an image and recognize that it's really just a matrix of numbers. These numbers can then be modified in order to enhance, blur, or otherwise alter the image you see. I liked the material and enjoyed the professors. Duncan has an engaging lecturing style and you can tell that he genuinely cares about the material. Staib is clearly knowledgable and explains the material in a very clear and concise way."

   "comments": [
    "If the class has a weakness, then (from an undergrad perspective) there's a bit of a disconnect from the concepts and the coding. It's difficult to get a feel for the theory (which can often be complicated if you don't have a statistics background) and then translate the theory into MatLab code. I often felt like I was wandering blindly through MatLab portions of the homework even though I knew the problems were intended to increase my understanding. I'm not entirely sure how to marry these two aspects of the course together. Perhaps some days could be dedicated to MatLab demonstrations? \r\n\r\nI liked the material that we covered and the overall structure of the class otherwise. I definitely appreciated the primary literature that Duncan and Staib uploaded. Overall, the homework was the perfect balance of challenging but fair."

   "comments": [
    "If the student has a decent background in computer science and statistics, I would recommend the course. That said, I had a weak background in both and still enjoyed it. The class title gives full disclosure about the material covered, so there are no surprises. Duncan and Staib are both great professors so, if you're interested in biomedical image processing, then I'd recommend the class."
