Professor Kane truly knows how to foster a fun and meaningful classroom environment that helps everyone no matter their major or experience."

But what made it even more intriguing of a class was the people there. The professor does a great job of providing space for students to discuss the readings for the week, and I never feel bored by the endless jokes, projects, insightful messages, and other things we got to share with each other. I can't really think of any weaknesses, but I do wish we could have incorporated more multimedia content (Youtube songs, performances, images) along with the readings or even the lectures.",

I would have appreciated some more detailed feedback on assignments throughout the course, but discussions were always engaging and fun to be a part of.",
                "This course was so well designed it should be available to everyone as a model for what a well done class looks like. The reading was always interesting, the perspectives were always varied, and the experience as a whole was very clearly crafted around helping the students grow intellectually. When comparing this class to some of the other classes at Yale, I almost feel robbed of a more meaningful college experience. If you want Yale to continue to be a transformative experience, please take this mans advice!!"
